A slow control system for the Garfield apparatus

The major part of the GARFIELD apparatus electronics are monitored and set up through a slow control system, which has been developed at LNL. A software package based on Lab View has been dedicated to the setting and control of 16 channels integrated Amplifiers and Constant Fraction Discriminators. GPIB controllers and GPIB-ENET interfaces have been used for the communication between the Personal Computer and the front-end of the electronics.
