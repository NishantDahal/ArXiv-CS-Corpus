New approach for network monitoring and intrusion detection

The approach for a network behavior description in terms of numerical time-dependant functions of the protocol parameters is suggested. This provides a basis for application of methods of mathematical and theoretical physics for information flow analysis on network and for extraction of patterns of typical network behavior. The information traffic can be described as a trajectory in multi-dimensional parameter-time space with dimension about 10-12. Based on this study some algorithms for the proposed intrusion detection system are discussed.
