Improved Quantum Communication Complexity Bounds for Disjointness and Equality

We prove new bounds on the quantum communication complexity of the disjointness and equality problems. For the case of exact and non-deterministic protocols we show that these complexities are all equal to n+1, the previous best lower bound being n/2. We show this by improving a general bound for non-deterministic protocols of de Wolf. We also give an O(sqrt{n}c^{log^* n})-qubit bounded-error protocol for disjointness, modifying and improving the earlier O(sqrt{n}log n) protocol of Buhrman, Cleve, and Wigderson, and prove an Omega(sqrt{n}) lower bound for a large class of protocols that includes the BCW-protocol as well as our new protocol.
