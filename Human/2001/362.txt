The Building of BODHI, a Bio-diversity Database System

We have recently built a database system called BODHI, intended to store plant bio-diversity information. It is based on an object-oriented modeling approach and is developed completely around public-domain software. The unique feature of BODHI is that it seamlessly integrates diverse types of data, including taxonomic characteristics, spatial distributions, and genetic sequences, thereby spanning the entire range from molecular to organism-level information. A variety of sophisticated indexing strategies are incorporated to efficiently access the various types of data, and a rule-based query processor is employed for optimizing query execution. In this paper, we report on our experiences in building BODHI and on its performance characteristics for a representative set of queries.
