L.T.Kuzin: Research Program

Lev T. Kuzin (1928--1997) is one of the founders of modern cybernetics and information science in Russia. He was awarded and honored the USSR State Prize for inspiring vision into the future of technical cybernetics and his invention and innovation of key technologies.
  The last years he interested in the computational models of geometrical and algebraic nature and their applications in various branches of computer science and information technologies. In the recent years the interest in computation models based on object notion has grown tremendously stimulating an interest to Kuzin's ideas. This year of 50th Anniversary of Cybernetics and on the occasion of his 70th birthday on September 12, 1998 seems especially appropriate for discussing Kuzin's Research Program.
