An object evaluator to generate flexible applications

This paper contains a brief discussion of an object evaluator which is based on principles of evaluations in a category. The main tool system referred as the Application Development Environment (ADE) is used to build database applications involving the graphical user interface (GUI). The separation of a database access and the user interface is reached by distinguishing the potential and actual objects. The variety of applications may be generated that communicate with different and distinct desktop databases. The commutative diagrams' technique allows to involve retrieval and call of the delayed procedures.
