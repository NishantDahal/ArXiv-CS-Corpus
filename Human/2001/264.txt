A Multi-Threaded Fast Convolver for Dynamically Parallel Image Filtering

2D convolution is a staple of digital image processing. The advent of large format imagers makes it possible to literally ``pave'' with silicon the focal plane of an optical sensor, which results in very large images that can require a significant amount computation to process. Filtering of large images via 2D convolutions is often complicated by a variety of effects (e.g., non-uniformities found in wide field of view instruments). This paper describes a fast (FFT based) method for convolving images, which is also well suited to very large images. A parallel version of the method is implemented using a multi-threaded approach, which allows more efficient load balancing and a simpler software architecture. The method has been implemented within in a high level interpreted language (IDL), while also exploiting open standards vector libraries (VSIPL) and open standards parallel directives (OpenMP). The parallel approach and software architecture are generally applicable to a variety of algorithms and has the advantage of enabling users to obtain the convenience of an easy operating environment while also delivering high performance using a fully portable code.
