Parallel Computing on a PC Cluster

The tremendous advance in computer technology in the past decade has made it possible to achieve the performance of a supercomputer on a very small budget. We have built a multi-CPU cluster of Pentium PC capable of parallel computations using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We will discuss the configuration, performance, and application of the cluster to our work in physics.
