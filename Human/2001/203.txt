Event Driven Objects

A formal consideration in this paper is given for the essential notations to characterize the object that is distinguished in a problem domain. The distinct object is represented by another idealized object, which is a schematic element. When the existence of an element is significant, then a class of these partial elements is dropped down into actual, potential and virtual objects. The potential objects are gathered into the variable domains which are the extended ranges for unbound variables. The families of actual objects are shown to be parameterized with the types and events. The transitions between events are shown to be driven by the scripts. A computational framework arises which is described by the commutative diagrams.
