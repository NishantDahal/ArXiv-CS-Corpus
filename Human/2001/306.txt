Universal Simulation of Hamiltonians Using a Finite Set of Control Operations

Any quantum system with a non-trivial Hamiltonian is able to simulate any other Hamiltonian evolution provided that a sufficiently large group of unitary control operations is available. We show that there exist finite groups with this property and present a sufficient condition in terms of group characters. We give examples of such groups in dimension 2 and 3. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to simulate an arbitrary bipartite interaction by a given one using such groups acting locally on the subsystems.
