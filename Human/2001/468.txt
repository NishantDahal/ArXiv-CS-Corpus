Civic Engagement among Early Internet Adopters: Trend or Phase?

This paper brings evidence to bear on the question of the long-term effects of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws on findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall 2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that early adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities and to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters. Further, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their community involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic minded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh, 2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other studies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995, among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily to the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend. As later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic engagement in geographic communities.
