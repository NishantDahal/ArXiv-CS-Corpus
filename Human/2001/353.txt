A Framework for Assessing Universal Service Obligations: A Developing Country Perspective

A critical element of most national telecom policy objectives is advancing universal service. In a multi-operator context, this is usually operationalized through Universal Service Obligations (USO), by which various operators are mandated to provide a part of their services to rural areas or to high cost to serve customers at "affordable" prices.
  This paper highlights the various issues in USO from a developing country perspective. The first part of this paper gives an overview of USO practices and issues. The second part reviews the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's recommendations on USO cost estimation. In the third part, the paper analyzes characteristics of rural exchanges with a view to evolve a framework for assessing USO. This framework is applicable to developing countries as the study carried out in this paper is in the context of a developing country characterized by low telecom penetration and non-availability of data with regulators.
