Spiders and Crawlers and Bots, Oh My: The Economic Efficiency and Public Policy of Contracts that Restrict Data Collection

Recent trends reveal the search by companies for a legal hook to prevent the undesired and unauthorized copying of information posted on websites. In the center of this controversy are metasites, websites that display prices for a variety of vendors. Metasites function by implementing shopbots, which extract pricing data from other vendors' websites. Technological mechanisms have proved unsuccessful in blocking shopbots, and in response, websites have asserted a variety of legal claims. Two recent cases, which rely on the troublesome trespass to chattels doctrine, suggest that contract law may provide a less demanding legal method of preventing the search of websites by data robots. If blocking collection of pricing data is as simple as posting an online contract, the question arises whether this end result is desirable and legally viable.
