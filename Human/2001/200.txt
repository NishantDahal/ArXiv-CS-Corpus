Logic, Individuals and Concepts

This extended abstract gives a brief outline of the connections between the descriptions and variable concepts. Thus, the notion of a concept is extended to include both the syntax and semantics features. The evaluation map in use is parameterized by a kind of computational environment, the index, giving rise to indexed concepts. The concepts are inhabited into language by the descriptions from the higher order logic. In general the idea of object-as-functor should assist the designer to outline a programming tool in conceptual shell style.
