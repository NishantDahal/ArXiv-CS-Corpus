The definition of a random sequence of qubits: from Noncommutative Algorithmic Probability Theory to Quantum Algorithmic Information Theory and back

The issue of defining a random sequence of qubits is studied in the framework of Algorithmic Free Probability Theory.Its connection with Quantum Algorithmic Information Theory is shown
