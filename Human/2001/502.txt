The Eleventh Workshop on Logic Programming Environments (WLPE'01) was one in a series of international workshops in the topic area. It was held on December 1, 2001 in Paphos, Cyprus as a post-conference workshop at ICLP 2001. Eight refereed papers were presented at the conference. A majority of the papers involved, in some way, constraint logic programming and tools for software development. Other topics areas addressed include execution visualization, instructional aids (for learning users), software maintenance (including debugging), and provisions for new paradigms.
