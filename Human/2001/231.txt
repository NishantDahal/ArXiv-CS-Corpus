Hot-pressing process modeling for medium density fiberboard (MDF)

In this paper we present a numerical solution for the mathematical modeling of the hot-pressing process applied to medium density fiberboard. The model is based in the work of Humphrey[82], Humphrey and Bolton[89] and Carvalho and Costa[98], with some modifications and extensions in order to take into account mainly the convective effects on the phase change term and also a conservative numerical treatment of the resulting system of partial differential equations.
