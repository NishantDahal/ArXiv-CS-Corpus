Profiling Internet Users' Participation in Social Change Agendas: An application of Q methodology

New computer-mediated channels of communication are action oriented and have the ability to deliver information and dialogue - moderated and unmoderated - which can facilitate the bringing together of a series of society's stakeholders, opinion leaders and change agents, who have the ability to influence social action. However, existing online studies have been limited in explaining Internet users' willingness to participate in social change agendas online. They have relied predominately on basic demographic descriptors such as age, education, income and access to technology and have ignored, social, psychological and attitudinal variables that may explain online participation and social change. The authors propose a Q methodology research approach better evaluate Internet users participation in online social change agendas.
