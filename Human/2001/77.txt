In search of an evolutionary coding style

In the near future, all the human genes will be identified. But understanding the functions coded in the genes is a much harder problem. For example, by using block entropy, one has that the DNA code is closer to a random code then written text, which in turn is less ordered then an ordinary computer code; see \cite{schmitt}.
  Instead of saying that the DNA is badly written, using our programming standards, we might say that it is written in a different style -- an evolutionary style.
  We will suggest a way to search for such a style in a quantified manner by using an artificial life program, and by giving a definition of general codes and a definition of style for such codes.
