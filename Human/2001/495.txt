An Environment for the Exploration of Non Monotonic Logic Programs

Stable Model Semantics and Well Founded Semantics have been shown to be very useful in several applications of non-monotonic reasoning. However, Stable Models presents a high computational complexity, whereas Well Founded Semantics is easy to compute and provides an approximation of Stable Models. Efficient engines exist for both semantics of logic programs. This work presents a computational integration of two of such systems, namely XSB and SMODELS. The resulting system is called XNMR, and provides an interactive system for the exploration of both semantics. Aspects such as modularity can be exploited in order to ease debugging of large knowledge bases with the usual Prolog debugging techniques and an interactive environment. Besides, the use of a full Prolog system as a front-end to a Stable Models engine augments the language usually accepted by such systems.
