The Set of Equations to Evaluate Objects

The notion of an equational shell is studied to involve the objects and their environment. Appropriate methods are studied as valid embeddings of refined objects. The refinement process determines the linkages between the variety of possible representations giving rise to variants of computations. The case study is equipped with the adjusted equational systems that validate the initial applicative framework.
