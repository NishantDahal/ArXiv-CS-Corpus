Inference of termination conditions for numerical loops

We present a new approach to termination analysis of numerical computations in logic programs. Traditional approaches fail to analyse them due to non well-foundedness of the integers. We present a technique that allows to overcome these difficulties. Our approach is based on transforming a program in way that allows integrating and extending techniques originally developed for analysis of numerical computations in the framework of query-mapping pairs with the well-known framework of acceptability. Such an integration not only contributes to the understanding of termination behaviour of numerical computations, but also allows to perform a correct analysis of such computations automatically, thus, extending previous work on a constraints-based approach to termination. In the last section of the paper we discuss possible extensions of the technique, including incorporating general term orderings.
