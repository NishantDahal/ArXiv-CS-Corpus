Semantic Web Content Accessibility Guidelines for Current Research Information Systems (CRIS)

The most exciting challenge for CRIS is to create a service for research information which should be wide-spread, distributed and actual like Google, but at the same time structured, trusted, with a complex search and navigation similar to today CRIS application. The core technology for such a "new" CRIS is the semantic web technology to integrate database contents with HTML and XML web pages for being provided to the research interested public. One (at the moment the best) possible way is to use RDF (Resource Description Framework) which is also recommended by the W3 consortium.
