Data Access - Experiences Implementing an Object Oriented Library on Various Platforms

Data Access will be the next generation data abstraction layer for EPICS. Its implementation in C++ brought up a number of issues that are related to object oriented technology's impact on CPU and memory usage.
  What is gained by the new abstract interface? What is the price that has to be paid for these gains? What compromises seem applicable and affordable?
  This paper discusses tests that have been made about performance and memory usage as well as the different measures that have been taken to optimize the situation.
