On the Design of a Tool for Supporting the Construction of Logic Programs

Environments for systematic construction of logic programs are needed in the academy as well as in the industry. Such environments should support well defined construction methods and should be able to be extended and interact with other programming tools like debuggers and compilers. We present a variant of the Deville methodology for logic program development, and the design of a tool for supporting the methodology. Our aim is to facilitate the learning of logic programming and to set the basis of more sophisticated tools for program development.
