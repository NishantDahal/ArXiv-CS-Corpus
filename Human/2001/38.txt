Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Automated Debugging (AADEBUG 2000)

Over the past decades automated debugging has seen major achievements. However, as debugging is by necessity attached to particular programming paradigms, the results are scattered. The aims of the workshop are to gather common themes and solutions across programming communities, and to cross-fertilize ideas. AADEBUG 2000 in Munich follows AADEBUG'93 in Linkoeping, Sweden; AADEBUG'95 in Saint Malo, France; AADEBUG'97 in Linkoeping, Sweden.
