Checking Properties within Fairness and Behavior Abstractions

This paper is motivated by the fact that verifying liveness properties under a fairness condition is often problematic, especially when abstraction is used. It shows that using a more abstract notion than truth under fairness, specifically the concept of a property being satisfied within fairness can lead to interesting possibilities. Technically, it is first established that deciding satisfaction within fairness is a PSPACE-complete problem and it is shown that properties satisfied within fairness can always be satisfied by some fair implementation. Thereafter, the interaction between behavior abstraction and satisfaction within fairness is studied and it is proved that satisfaction of properties within fairness can be verified on behavior abstractions, if the abstraction homomorphism is weakly continuation-closed.
