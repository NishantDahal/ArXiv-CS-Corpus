Objects and their computational framework

Most of the object notions are embedded into a logical domain, especially when dealing with a database theory. Thus, their properties within a computational domain are not yet studied properly. The main topic of this paper is to analyze different concepts of the distinct computational primitive frames to extract the useful object properties and their possible advantages. Some important metaoperators are used to unify the approaches and to establish their possible correspondences.
