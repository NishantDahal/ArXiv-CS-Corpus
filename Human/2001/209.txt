Object-oriented solutions

In this paper are briefly outlined the motivations, mathematical ideas in use, pre-formalization and assumptions, object-as-functor construction, `soft' types and concept constructions, case study for concepts based on variable domains, extracting a computational background, and examples of evaluations.
