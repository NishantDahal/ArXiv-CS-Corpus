Decomposing Finite Abelian Groups

This paper describes a quantum algorithm for efficiently decomposing finite Abelian groups. Such a decomposition is needed in order to apply the Abelian hidden subgroup algorithm. Such a decomposition (assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis) also leads to an efficient algorithm for computing class numbers (known to be at least as difficult as factoring).
