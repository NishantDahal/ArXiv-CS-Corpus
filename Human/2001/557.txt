Universal Model for Paraphrasing -- Using Transformation Based on a Defined Criteria --

This paper describes a universal model for paraphrasing that transforms according to defined criteria. We showed that by using different criteria we could construct different kinds of paraphrasing systems including one for answering questions, one for compressing sentences, one for polishing up, and one for transforming written language to spoken language.
