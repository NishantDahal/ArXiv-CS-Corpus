Building Views with Description Logics in ADE: Application Development Environment

Any of views is formally defined within description logics that were established as a family of logics for modeling complex hereditary structures and have a suitable expressive power. This paper considers the Application Development Environment (ADE) over generalized variable concepts that are used to build database applications involving the supporting views. The front-end user interacts the database via separate ADE access mechanism intermediated by view support. The variety of applications may be generated that communicate with different and distinct desktop databases in a data warehouse. The advanced techniques allows to involve remote or stored procedures retrieval and call.
