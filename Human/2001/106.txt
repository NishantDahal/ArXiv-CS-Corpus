Generic Automatic Proof Tools

This book chapter establishes connections between the interactive proof tool Isabelle and classical tableau and resolution technology.  Isabelle's classical reasoner is described and demonstrated by an extended case study: the Church-Rosser theorem for combinators.  Compared with other interactive theorem provers, Isabelle's classical reasoner achieves a high degree of automation.
