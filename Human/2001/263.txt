Intentional Walks on Scale Free Small Worlds

We present a novel algorithm that generates scale free small world graphs such as those found in the World Wide Web,social and metabolic networks. We use the generated graphs to study the dynamics of a realistic search strategy on the graphs, and find that they can be navigated in a very short number of steps.
