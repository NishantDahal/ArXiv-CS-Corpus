Mathematical Model of Word Length on the Basis of the Cebanov-Fucks Distribution with Uniform Parameter Distribution

The data on 13 typologically different languages have been processed using a two-parameter word length model, based on 1-displaced uniform Poisson distribution. Statistical dependencies of the 2nd parameter on the 1st one are revealed for the German texts and genre of letters.
