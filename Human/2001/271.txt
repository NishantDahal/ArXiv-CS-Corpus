P-model Alternative to the T-model

Standard linguistic analysis of syntax uses the T-model. This model requires the ordering: D-structure $>$ S-structure $>$ LF. Between each of these representations there is movement which alters the order of the constituent words; movement is achieved using the principles and parameters of syntactic theory. Psychological serial models do not accommodate the T-model immediately so that here a new model called the P-model is introduced. Here it is argued that the LF representation should be replaced by a variant of Frege's three qualities. In the F-representation the order of elements is not necessarily the same as that in LF and it is suggested that the correct ordering is: F-representation $>$ D-structure $>$ S-structure. Within this framework movement originates as the outcome of emphasis applied to the sentence.
