Logic Programming, Functional Programming, and Inductive Definitions

An attempt at unifying logic and functional programming is reported.  As a starting point, we take the view that "logic programs" are not about logic but constitute inductive definitions of sets and relations.  A skeletal language design based on these considerations is sketched and a prototype implementation discussed.
