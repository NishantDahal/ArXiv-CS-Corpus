The Guidebook, the Friend, and the Room: Visitor Experience in a Historic House

In this paper, we describe an electronic guidebook prototype and report on a study of its use in a historic house. Supported by mechanisms in the guidebook, visitors constructed experiences that had a high degree of interaction with three entities: the guidebook, their companions, and the house and its contents. For example, we found that most visitors played audio descriptions played through speakers (rather than using headphones or reading textual descriptions) to facilitate communication with their companions.
