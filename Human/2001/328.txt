Lead, Follow, or Go Your Own Way: Empirical Evidence Against Leader-Follower Behavior in Electronic Markets

Low search costs in Internet markets can be used by consumers to find low prices, but can also be used by retailers to monitor competitors' prices. This price monitoring can lead to price matching, resulting in dampened price competition and higher prices in some cases. This paper analyzes price data for 316 bestselling, computer, and random book titles gathered from 32 retailers between August 1999 and January 2000. In contrast to previous studies we find no evidence of leader-follow behavior for the vast majority of retailers we study. Further, the few cases of leader-follow behavior we observe seem to be associated with managerial convenience as opposed to anti-competitive behavior. We offer a methodology that can be used by future academic researchers or government regulators to check for anti-competitive price matching behavior in future time periods or in additional product categories.
