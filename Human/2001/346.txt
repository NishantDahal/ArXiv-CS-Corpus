Branching: the Essence of Constraint Solving

This paper focuses on the branching process for solving any constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). A parametrised schema is proposed that (with suitable instantiations of the parameters) can solve CSP's on both finite and infinite domains. The paper presents a formal specification of the schema and a statement of a number of interesting properties that, subject to certain conditions, are satisfied by any instances of the schema.
  It is also shown that the operational procedures of many constraint systems including cooperative systems) satisfy these conditions.
  Moreover, the schema is also used to solve the same CSP in different ways by means of different instantiations of its parameters.
