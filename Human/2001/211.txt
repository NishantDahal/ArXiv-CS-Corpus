Building the access pointers to a computation environment

A common object technique equipped with the categorical and computational styles is briefly outlined. An object is evaluated by embedding in a host computational environment which is the domain-ranged structure. An embedded object is accessed by the pointers generated within the host system. To assist with an easy extract the result of the evaluation a pre-embedded object is generated. It is observed as the decomposition into substitutional part and access function part which are generated during the object evaluation.
