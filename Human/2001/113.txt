Decoding method for generalized algebraic geometry codes

We propose a decoding method for the generalized algebraic geometry codes proposed by Xing et al. To show its practical usefulness, we give an example of generalized algebraic geometry codes of length 567 over F_8 whose numbers of correctable errors by the proposed method are larger than the shortened codes of the primitive BCH codes of length 4095 in the most range of dimension.
