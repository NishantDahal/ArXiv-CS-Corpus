Meaning Sort - Three examples: dictionary construction, tagged corpus construction, and information presentation system

It is often useful to sort words into an order that reflects relations among their meanings as obtained by using a thesaurus. In this paper, we introduce a method of arranging words semantically by using several types of `{\sf is-a}' thesauri and a multi-dimensional thesaurus. We also describe three major applications where a meaning sort is useful and show the effectiveness of a meaning sort. Since there is no doubt that a word list in meaning-order is easier to use than a word list in some random order, a meaning sort, which can easily produce a word list in meaning-order, must be useful and effective.
