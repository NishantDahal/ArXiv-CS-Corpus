Lectures on Reduce and Maple at UAM I - Mexico

These lectures give a brief introduction to the Computer Algebra systems Reduce and Maple. The aim is to provide a systematic survey of most important commands and concepts. In particular, this includes a discussion of simplification schemes and the handling of simplification and substitution rules (e.g., a Lie Algebra is implemented in Reduce by means of simplification rules).
  Another emphasis is on the different implementations of tensor calculi and the exterior calculus by Reduce and Maple and their application in Gravitation theory and Differential Geometry.
  I held the lectures at the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa, Departamento de Fisica, Mexico, in November 1999.
