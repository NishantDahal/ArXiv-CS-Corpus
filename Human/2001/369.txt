The Internet, 1995-2000: Access, Civic Involvement, and Social Interaction

Our research, which began fielding surveys in 1995, and which have been repeated with variation in 1996, 1997 and 2000, was apparently the first to use national random telephone survey methods to track social and community aspects of Internet use, and to compare users and non-users. It also seems to be among the first that used these methods to compare users with non-users in regards to communication, social and community issues. The work has been largely supported by grants from the Markle Foundation of New York City as well as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
