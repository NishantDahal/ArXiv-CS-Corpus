Explicit modular towers

We give a general recipe for explicitly constructing asymptotically optimal towers of modular curves such as {X_0(l^n): n=1,2,3,...}. We illustrate the method by giving equations for eight towers with various geometric features. We conclude by observing that such towers are all of a specific recursive form, and speculate that perhaps every tower of this form that attains the Drinfeld-Vladut bound is modular.
