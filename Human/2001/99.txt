Rapid Application Evolution and Integration Through Document Metamorphosis

The Harland document management system implements a data model in which document (object) structure can be altered by mixin-style multiple inheritance at any time. This kind of structural fluidity has long been supported by knowledge-base management systems, but its use has primarily been in support of reasoning and inference. In this paper, we report our experiences building and supporting several non-trivial applications on top of this data model. Based on these experiences, we argue that structural fluidity is convenient for data-intensive applications other than knowledge-base management. Specifically, we suggest that this flexible data model is a natural fit for the decoupled programming methodology that arises naturally when using enterprise component frameworks.
