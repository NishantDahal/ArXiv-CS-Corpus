Bounding the radii of balls meeting every connected component of semi-algebraic sets

We prove explicit bounds on the radius of a ball centered at the origin which is guaranteed to contain all bounded connected components of a semi-algebraic set $S \subset \mathbbm{R}^k$ defined by a quantifier-free formula involving $s$ polynomials in $\mathbbm{Z}[X_1, ..., X_k]$ having degrees at most $d$, and whose coefficients have bitsizes at most $τ$. Our bound is an explicit function of $s, d, k$ and $τ$, and does not contain any undetermined constants. We also prove a similar bound on the radius of a ball guaranteed to intersect every connected component of $S$ (including the unbounded components). While asymptotic bounds of the form $2^{τd^{O (k)}}$ on these quantities were known before, some applications require bounds which are explicit and which hold for all values of $s, d, k$ and $τ$. The bounds proved in this paper are of this nature.
