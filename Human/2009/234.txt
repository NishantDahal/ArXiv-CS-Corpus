The Road Coloring for Mapping on k States(withdrawn)

Let $Γ$ be directed strongly connected finite graph of uniform outdegree (constant outdegree of any vertex) and let some coloring of edges of $Γ$ turn the graph into deterministic complete automaton. Let the word $s$ be a word in the alphabet of colors (considered also as letters) on the edges of $Γ$ and let $Γs$ be a mapping of vertices $Γ$.
