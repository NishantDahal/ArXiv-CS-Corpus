Optimal detection of homogeneous segment of observations in stochastic sequence

A Markov process is registered. At random moment $Î¸$ the distribution of observed sequence changes. Using probability maximizing approach the optimal stopping rule for detecting the change is identified. Some explicit solution is obtained.
