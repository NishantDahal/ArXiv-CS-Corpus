Maximizing Maximal Angles for Plane Straight-Line Graphs

Let $G=(S, E)$ be a plane straight-line graph on a finite point set $S\subset\R^2$ in general position. The incident angles of a vertex $p \in S$ of $G$ are the angles between any two edges of $G$ that appear consecutively in the circular order of the edges incident to $p$.
  A plane straight-line graph is called $φ$-open if each vertex has an incident angle of size at least $φ$. In this paper we study the following type of question: What is the maximum angle $φ$ such that for any finite set $S\subset\R^2$ of points in general position we can find a graph from a certain class of graphs on $S$ that is $φ$-open? In particular, we consider the classes of triangulations, spanning trees, and paths on $S$ and give tight bounds in most cases.
