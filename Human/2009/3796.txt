The capacity region of a product of two unmatched Gaussian broadcast channels with three particular messages and a common message

This paper considers a Gaussian broadcast channel with two unmatched degraded components, three particular messages, and a common message that is intended for all three receivers. It is shown that for this channel superposition coding and Gaussian signalling is sufficient to achieve every point in the capacity region.
