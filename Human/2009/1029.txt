Joint Range of Rényi Entropies

The exact range of the joined values of several Rényi entropies is determined. The method is based on topology with special emphasis on the orientation of the objects studied. Like in the case when only two orders of Rényi entropies are studied one can parametrize upper and lower bounds but an explicit formula for a tight upper or lower bound cannot be given.
