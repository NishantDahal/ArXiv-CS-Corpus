Weight Distribution of A p-ary Cyclic Code

For an odd prime $p$ and two positive integers $n\geq 3$ and $k$ with $\frac{n}{{\rm gcd}(n,k)}$ being odd, the paper determines the weight distribution of a $p$-ary cyclic code $\mathcal{C}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ with nonzeros $α^{-1}$, $α^{-(p^k+1)}$ and $α^{-(p^{3k}+1)}$, where $α$ is a primitive element of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$
