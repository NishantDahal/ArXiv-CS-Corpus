About a new splitting for the algorithmic study of the tilings $\{p,q\}$ of the hyperbolic plane when $q$ is odd

In this paper, we remind previous results about the tilings $\{p,q\}$ of the hyperbolic plane. We introduce two new ways to split the hyperbolic plane in order to algorithmically construct the tilings $\{p,q\}$ when $q$ is odd.
