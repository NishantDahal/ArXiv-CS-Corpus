Discrepancy-Sensitive Dynamic Fractional Cascading, Dominated Maxima Searching, and 2-d Nearest Neighbors in Any Minkowski Metric

This paper studies a discrepancy-sensitive approach to dynamic fractional cascading. We provide an efficient data structure for dominated maxima searching in a dynamic set of points in the plane, which in turn leads to an efficient dynamic data structure that can answer queries for nearest neighbors using any Minkowski metric.
