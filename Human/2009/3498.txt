Theory of sexes by Geodakian as it is advanced by Iskrin

In 1960s V.Geodakian proposed a theory that explains sexes as a mechanism for evolutionary adaptation of the species to changing environmental conditions. In 2001 V.Iskrin refined and augmented the concepts of Geodakian and gave a new and interesting explanation to several phenomena which involve sex, and sex ratio, including the war-years phenomena. He also introduced a new concept of the "catastrophic sex ratio." This note is an attempt to digest technical aspects of the new ideas by Iskrin.
