Advances in the Design and Implementation of a Multi-Tier Architecture in the GIPSY Environment

We present advances in the software engineering design and implementation of the multi-tier run-time system for the General Intensional Programming System (GIPSY) by further unifying the distributed technologies used to implement the Demand Migration Framework (DMF) in order to streamline distributed execution of hybrid intensional-imperative programs using Java.
