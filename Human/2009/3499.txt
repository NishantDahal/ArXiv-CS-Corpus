On $Z_{2^k}$-Dual Binary Codes

A new generalization of the Gray map is introduced. The new generalization $Φ: Z_{2^k}^n \to Z_{2}^{2^{k-1}n}$ is connected with the known generalized Gray map $φ$ in the following way: if we take two dual linear $Z_{2^k}$-codes and construct binary codes from them using the generalizations $φ$ and $Φ$ of the Gray map, then the weight enumerators of the binary codes obtained will satisfy the MacWilliams identity. The classes of $Z_{2^k}$-linear Hadamard codes and co-$Z_{2^k}$-linear extended 1-perfect codes are described, where co-$Z_{2^k}$-linearity means that the code can be obtained from a linear $Z_{2^k}$-code with the help of the new generalized Gray map. Keywords: Gray map, Hadamard codes, MacWilliams identity, perfect codes, $Z_{2^k}$-linearity
