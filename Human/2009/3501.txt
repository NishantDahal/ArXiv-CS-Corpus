Algorithm for generating orthogonal matrices with rational elements

Special orthogonal matrices with rational elements form the group SO(n,Q), where Q is the field of rational numbers. A theorem describing the structure of an arbitrary matrix from this group is proved. This theorem yields an algorithm for generating such matrices by means of random number routines.
