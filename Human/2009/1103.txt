A Program to Determine the Exact Competitive Ratio of List s-Batching with Unit Jobs

We consider the online list s-batch problem, where all the jobs have processing time 1 and we seek to minimize the sum of the completion times of the jobs. We give a Java program which is used to verify that the competitiveness of this problem is 619/583.
