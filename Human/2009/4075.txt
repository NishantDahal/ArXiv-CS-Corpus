The Gaussian Surface Area and Noise Sensitivity of Degree-$d$ Polynomials

We provide asymptotically sharp bounds for the Gaussian surface area and the Gaussian noise sensitivity of polynomial threshold functions. In particular we show that if $f$ is a degree-$d$ polynomial threshold function, then its Gaussian sensitivity at noise rate $ε$ is less than some quantity asymptotic to $\frac{d\sqrt{2ε}}π$ and the Gaussian surface area is at most $\frac{d}{\sqrt{2π}}$. Furthermore these bounds are asymptotically tight as $ε\to 0$ and $f$ the threshold function of a product of $d$ distinct homogeneous linear functions.
