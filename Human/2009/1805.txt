Syntax is from Mars while Semantics from Venus! Insights from Spectral Analysis of Distributional Similarity Networks

We study the global topology of the syntactic and semantic distributional similarity networks for English through the technique of spectral analysis. We observe that while the syntactic network has a hierarchical structure with strong communities and their mixtures, the semantic network has several tightly knit communities along with a large core without any such well-defined community structure.
