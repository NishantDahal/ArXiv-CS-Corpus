Propelinear structure of Z_{2k}-linear codes

Let C be an additive subgroup of $\Z_{2k}^n$ for any $k\geq 1$. We define a Gray map $Φ:\Z_{2k}^n \longrightarrow \Z_2^{kn}$ such that $Φ(\codi)$ is a binary propelinear code and, hence, a Hamming-compatible group code. Moreover, $Φ$ is the unique Gray map such that $Φ(C)$ is Hamming-compatible group code. Using this Gray map we discuss about the nonexistence of 1-perfect binary mixed group code.
