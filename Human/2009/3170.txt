Piercing translates and homothets of a convex body

According to a classical result of Grünbaum, the transversal number $τ(\F)$ of any family $\F$ of pairwise-intersecting translates or homothets of a convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$ is bounded by a function of $d$. Denote by $α(C)$ (resp. $β(C)$) the supremum of the ratio of the transversal number $τ(\F)$ to the packing number $ν(\F)$ over all families $\F$ of translates (resp. homothets) of a convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$. Kim et al. recently showed that $α(C)$ is bounded by a function of $d$ for any convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$, and gave the first bounds on $α(C)$ for convex bodies $C$ in $\RR^d$ and on $β(C)$ for convex bodies $C$ in the plane.
  Here we show that $β(C)$ is also bounded by a function of $d$ for any convex body $C$ in $\RR^d$, and present new or improved bounds on both $α(C)$ and $β(C)$ for various convex bodies $C$ in $\RR^d$ for all dimensions $d$. Our techniques explore interesting inequalities linking the covering and packing densities of a convex body. Our methods for obtaining upper bounds are constructive and lead to efficient constant-factor approximation algorithms for finding a minimum-cardinality point set that pierces a set of translates or homothets of a convex body.
