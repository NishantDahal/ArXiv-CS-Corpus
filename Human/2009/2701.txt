On diameter perfect constant-weight ternary codes

From cosets of binary Hamming codes we construct diameter perfect constant-weight ternary codes with weight $n-1$ (where $n$ is the code length) and distances 3 and 5. The class of distance 5 codes has parameters unknown before. Keywords: constant-weight codes, ternary codes, perfect codes, diameter perfect codes, perfect matchings, Preparata codes
