Kovalenko's Full-Rank Limit and Overhead as Lower Bounds for Error-Performances of LDPC and LT Codes over Binary Erasure Channels

We present Kovalenko's full-rank limit as a tight lower bound for decoding error probability of LDPC codes and LT codes over BEC. From the limit, we derive a full-rank overhead as a lower bound for stable overheads for successful maximum-likelihood decoding of the codes.
