On P vs. NP, Geometric Complexity Theory, Explicit Proofs and the Complexity Barrier

Geometric complexity theory (GCT) is an approach to the P vs. NP and related problems. This article gives its complexity theoretic overview without assuming any background in algebraic geometry or representation theory.
