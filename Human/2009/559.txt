Doppler Spectrum Estimation by Ramanujan Fourier Transforms

The Doppler spectrum estimation of a weather radar signal in a classic way can be made by two methods, temporal one based in the autocorrelation of the successful signals, whereas the other one uses the estimation of the power spectral density PSD by using Fourier transforms. We introduces a new tool of signal processing based on Ramanujan sums cq(n), adapted to the analysis of arithmetical sequences with several resonances p/q. These sums are almost periodic according to time n of resonances and aperiodic according to the order q of resonances. New results will be supplied by the use of Ramanujan Fourier Transform (RFT) for the estimation of the Doppler spectrum for the weather radar signal.
