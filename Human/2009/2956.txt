An Efficient and Publicly Verifiable Id-Based Multi-Signcryption Scheme

Multi-signcryption is used when different senders wants to authenticate a single message without revealing it. This paper proposes a multi signcryption scheme in which no pairing is computed on the signcryption stage and the signatures can be verified publicly.
