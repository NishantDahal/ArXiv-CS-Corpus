Generalized Statistics Framework for Rate Distortion Theory

Variational principles for the rate distortion (RD) theory in lossy compression are formulated within the ambit of the generalized nonextensive statistics of Tsallis, for values of the nonextensivity parameter satisfying $ 0 < q < 1 $ and $ q > 1 $. Alternating minimization numerical schemes to evaluate the nonextensive RD function, are derived. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of generalized statistics RD models.
