A Note on the DQ Analysis of Anisotropic Plates

Recently, Bert, Wang and Striz [1, 2] applied the differential quadrature (DQ) and harmonic differential quadrature (HDQ) methods to analyze static and dynamic behaviors of anisotropic plates. Their studies showed that the methods were conceptually simple and computationally efficient in comparison to other numerical techniques. Based on some recent work by the present author [3, 4], the purpose of this note is to further simplify the formulation effort and improve computing efficiency in applying the DQ and HDQ methods for these cases.
