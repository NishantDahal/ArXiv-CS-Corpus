Sampling from a couple of positively correlated binomial variables

We know that the marginals in a multinomial distribution are binomial variates exhibiting a negative correlation. But we can construct two linear combinations of such marginals in such a way to obtain a positive correlation. We discuss the restrictions that are to be imposed on the parameters of the given marginals to accomplish such a result. Next we discuss the regression function, showing that it is a linear function but not homoscedastic.
