Does P = NP?

This paper considers the question of P = NP in context of the polynomial time SAT algorithm. It posits proposition dependent on existence of conjectured problem that even where the algorithm is shown to solve SAT in polynomial time it remains theoretically possible for there to yet exist a non-deterministically polynomial (NP) problem for which the algorithm does not provide a polynomial (P) time solution. The paper leaves open as subject of continuing research the question of existence of instance of conjectured problem.
