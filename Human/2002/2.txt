A lower bound on the quantum query complexity of read-once functions

We establish a lower bound of $Ω{(\sqrt{n})}$ on the bounded-error quantum query complexity of read-once Boolean functions, providing evidence for the conjecture that $Ω(\sqrt{D(f)})$ is a lower bound for all Boolean functions. Our technique extends a result of Ambainis, based on the idea that successful computation of a function requires ``decoherence'' of initially coherently superposed inputs in the query register, having different values of the function. The number of queries is bounded by comparing the required total amount of decoherence of a judiciously selected set of input-output pairs to an upper bound on the amount achievable in a single query step. We use an extension of this result to general weights on input pairs, and general superpositions of inputs.
