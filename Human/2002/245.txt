Additive models in high dimensions

We discuss some aspects of approximating functions on high-dimensional data sets with additive functions or ANOVA decompositions, that is, sums of functions depending on fewer variables each. It is seen that under appropriate smoothness conditions, the errors of the ANOVA decompositions are of order $O(n^{m/2})$ for approximations using sums of functions of up to $m$ variables under some mild restrictions on the (possibly dependent) predictor variables. Several simulated examples illustrate this behaviour.
