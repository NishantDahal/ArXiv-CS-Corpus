A Compact Graph Model of Handwritten Images: Integration into Authentification and Recognition

A novel algorithm for creating a mathematical model of curved shapes is introduced. The core of the algorithm is based on building a graph representation of the contoured image, which occupies less storage space than produced by raster compression techniques. Different advanced applications of the mathematical model are discussed: recognition of handwritten characters and verification of handwritten text and signatures for authentification purposes. Reducing the storage requirements due to the efficient mathematical model results in faster retrieval and processing times. The experimental outcomes in compression of contoured images and recognition of handwritten numerals are given.
