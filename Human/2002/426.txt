A note on fractional derivative modeling of broadband frequency-dependent absorption: Model III

By far, the fractional derivative model is mainly related to the modelling of complicated solid viscoelastic material. In this study, we try to build the fractional derivative PDE model for broadband ultrasound propagation through human tissues.
