Evolution and Gravitation: a Computer Simulation of a Non-Walrasian Equilibrium Model

The paper contains a computer simulation concerning a basic non-Walrasian equilibrium system, following the Edmond Malinvaud "short side" approach, as far as the price adjustment is concerned, and the sequential Hicksian "weeks" structure with regard of the temporal characterization.
