Interface agents: A review of the field

This paper reviews the origins of interface agents, discusses challenges that exist within the interface agent field and presents a survey of current attempts to find solutions to these challenges. A history of agent systems from their birth in the 1960's to the current day is described, along with the issues they try to address. A taxonomy of interface agent systems is presented, and today's agent systems categorized accordingly. Lastly, an analysis of the machine learning and user modelling techniques used by today's agents is presented.
