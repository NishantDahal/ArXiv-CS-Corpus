On the Cell-based Complexity of Recognition of Bounded Configurations by Finite Dynamic Cellular Automata

This paper studies complexity of recognition of classes of bounded configurations by a generalization of conventional cellular automata (CA) -- finite dynamic cellular automata (FDCA). Inspired by the CA-based models of biological and computer vision, this study attempts to derive the properties of a complexity measure and of the classes of input configurations that make it beneficial to realize the recognition via a two-layered automaton as compared to a one-layered automaton. A formalized model of an image pattern recognition task is utilized to demonstrate that the derived conditions can be satisfied for a non-empty set of practical problems.
