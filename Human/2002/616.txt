Real numbers having ultimately periodic representations in abstract numeration systems

Using a genealogically ordered infinite regular language, we know how to represent an interval of R. Numbers having an ultimately periodic representation play a special role in classical numeration systems. The aim of this paper is to characterize the numbers having an ultimately periodic representation in generalized systems built on a regular language. The syntactical properties of these words are also investigated. Finally, we show the equivalence of the classical "theta"-expansions with our generalized representations in some special case related to a Pisot number "theta".
