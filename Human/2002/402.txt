Gales Suffice for Constructive Dimension

Supergales, generalizations of supermartingales, have been used by Lutz (2002) to define the constructive dimensions of individual binary sequences. Here it is shown that gales, the corresponding generalizations of martingales, can be equivalently used to define constructive dimension.
