Technology For Information Engineering (TIE): A New Way of Storing, Retrieving and Analyzing Information

The theoretical foundations of a new model and paradigm (called TIE) for data storage and access are introduced. Associations between data elements are stored in a single Matrix table, which is usually kept entirely in RAM for quick access. The model ties together a very intuitive "guided" GUI to the Matrix structure, allowing extremely easy complex searches through the data. Although it is an "Associative Model" in that it stores the data associations separately from the data itself, in contrast to other implementations of that model TIE guides the user to only the available information ensuring that every search is always fruitful. Very many diverse applications of the technology are reviewed.
