Information Measures in Detecting and Recognizing Symmetries

This paper presents a method to detect and recognize symmetries in Boolean functions. The idea is to use information theoretic measures of Boolean functions to detect sub-space of possible symmetric variables. Coupled with the new techniques of efficient estimations of information measures on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) we obtain promised results in symmetries detection for large-scale functions.
