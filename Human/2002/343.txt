Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Logic Programming Environments

The twelfth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments, WLPE 2002, is one in a series of international workshops held in the topic area. The workshops facilitate the exchange ideas and results among researchers and system developers on all aspects of environments for logic programming. Relevant topics for these workshops include user interfaces, human engineering, execution visualization, development tools, providing for new paradigms, and interfacing to language system tools and external systems. This twelfth workshop held in Copenhaguen. It follows the successful eleventh Workshop on Logic Programming Environments held in Cyprus in December, 2001.
  WLPE 2002 features ten presentations. The presentations involve, in some way, constraint logic programming, object-oriented programming and abstract interpretation. Topics areas addressed include tools for software development, execution visualization, software maintenance, instructional aids.
  This workshop was a post-conference workshop at ICLP 2002.
