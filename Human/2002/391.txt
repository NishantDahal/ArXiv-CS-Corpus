National Infrastructure Contingencies: Survey of Wireless Technology Support

In modern society, the flow of information has become the lifeblood of commerce and social interaction. This movement of data supports most aspects of the United States economy in particular, as well as, serving as the vehicle upon which governmental agencies react to social conditions. In addition, it is understood that the continuance of efficient and reliable data communications during times of national or regional disaster remains a priority in the United States. The coordination of emergency response and area revitalization / rehabilitation efforts between local, state, and federal emergency response is increasingly necessary as agencies strive to work more seamlessly between the affected organizations. Additionally, international support is often made available to react to such adverse conditions as wildfire suppression scenarios and therefore require the efficient management of workforce and associated logistics support.
  It is through the examination of the issues related to un-tethered data transmission during infrastructure contingencies that responders may best tailor a unified approach to the rapid recovery after disasters occur.
