Weaves: A Novel Direct Code Execution Interface for Parallel High Performance Scientific Codes

Scientific codes are increasingly being used in compositional settings, especially problem solving environments (PSEs). Typical compositional modeling frameworks require significant buy-in, in the form of commitment to a particular style of programming (e.g., distributed object components). While this solution is feasible for newer generations of component-based scientific codes, large legacy code bases present a veritable software engineering nightmare. We introduce Weaves a novel framework that enables modeling, composition, direct code execution, performance characterization, adaptation, and control of unmodified high performance scientific codes. Weaves is an efficient generalized framework for parallel compositional modeling that is a proper superset of the threads and processes models of programming. In this paper, our focus is on the transparent code execution interface enabled by Weaves. We identify design constraints, their impact on implementation alternatives, configuration scenarios, and present results from a prototype implementation on Intel x86 architectures.
