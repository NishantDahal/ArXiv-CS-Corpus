High-order fundamental and general solutions of convection-diffusion equation and their applications with boundary particle method

In this study, we presented the high-order fundamental solutions and general solutions of convection-diffusion equation. To demonstrate their efficacy, we applied the high-order general solutions to the boundary particle method (BPM) for the solution of some inhomogeneous convection-diffusion problems, where the BPM is a new truly boundary-only meshfree collocation method based on multiple reciprocity principle. For the sake of completeness, the BPM is also briefly described here.
