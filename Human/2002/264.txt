Relational Association Rules: getting WARMeR

In recent years, the problem of association rule mining in transactional data has been well studied. We propose to extend the discovery of classical association rules to the discovery of association rules of conjunctive queries in arbitrary relational data, inspired by the WARMR algorithm, developed by Dehaspe and Toivonen, that discovers association rules over a limited set of conjunctive queries. Conjunctive query evaluation in relational databases is well understood, but still poses some great challenges when approached from a discovery viewpoint in which patterns are generated and evaluated with respect to some well defined search space and pruning operators.
