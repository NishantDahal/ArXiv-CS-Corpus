Evolutionary Circuit Design: Information Theory Perspective on Signal Propagation

This paper presents case-study results on the application of information theoretic approach to gate-level evolutionary circuit design. We introduce information measures to provide better estimates of synthesis criteria of digital circuits. For example, the analysis of signal propagation during evolving gate-level synthesis can be improved by using information theoretic measures that will make it possible to find the most effective geometry and therefore predict the cost of the final design solution. The problem is considered from the information engine point of view. That is, the process of evolutionary gate-level circuit design is presented via such measures as entropy, logical work and information vitality. Some examples of geometry driven synthesis are provided to prove the above idea.
