Monadic Style Control Constructs for Inference Systems

Recent advances in programming languages study and design have established a standard way of grounding computational systems representation in category theory. These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control and side-effects in functional and imperative languages. Another benefit is a better way of modelling computational effects in logical frameworks. With this analogy in mind, we embark on an investigation of inference systems based on considering inference behaviour as a form of computation. We delineate a categorical formalisation of control constructs in inference systems. This representation emphasises the parallel between the modular articulation of the categorical building blocks (triples) used to account for the inference architecture and the modular composition of cognitive processes.
