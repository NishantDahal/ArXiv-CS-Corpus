Graph equivalence and characterization via a continuous evolution of a physical analog

A general novel approach mapping discrete, combinatorial, graph-theoretic problems onto ``physical'' models - namely $n$ simplexes in $n-1$ dimensions - is applied to the graph equivalence problem. It is shown to solve this long standing problem in polynomial, short, time.
