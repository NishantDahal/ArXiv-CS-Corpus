Decision Lists for English and Basque

In this paper we describe the systems we developed for the English (lexical and all-words) and Basque tasks. They were all supervised systems based on Yarowsky's Decision Lists. We used Semcor for training in the English all-words task. We defined different feature sets for each language. For Basque, in order to extract all the information from the text, we defined features that have not been used before in the literature, using a morphological analyzer. We also implemented systems that selected automatically good features and were able to obtain a prefixed precision (85%) at the cost of coverage. The systems that used all the features were identified as BCU-ehu-dlist-all and the systems that selected some features as BCU-ehu-dlist-best.
