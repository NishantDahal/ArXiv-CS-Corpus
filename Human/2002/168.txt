On the Average Similarity Degree between Solutions of Random k-SAT and Random CSPs

To study the structure of solutions for random k-SAT and random CSPs, this paper introduces the concept of average similarity degree to characterize how solutions are similar to each other. It is proved that under certain conditions, as r (i.e. the ratio of constraints to variables) increases, the limit of average similarity degree when the number of variables approaches infinity exhibits phase transitions at a threshold point, shifting from a smaller value to a larger value abruptly. For random k-SAT this phenomenon will occur when k>4 . It is further shown that this threshold point is also a singular point with respect to r in the asymptotic estimate of the second moment of the number of solutions. Finally, we discuss how this work is helpful to understand the hardness of solving random instances and a possible application of it to the design of search algorithms.
