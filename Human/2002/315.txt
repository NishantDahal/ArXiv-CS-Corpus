Paraconsistent Reasoning via Quantified Boolean Formulas,I: Axiomatising Signed Systems

Signed systems were introduced as a general, syntax-independent framework for paraconsistent reasoning, that is, non-trivialised reasoning from inconsistent information. In this paper, we show how the family of corresponding paraconsistent consequence relations can be axiomatised by means of quantified Boolean formulas. This approach has several benefits. First, it furnishes an axiomatic specification of paraconsistent reasoning within the framework of signed systems. Second, this axiomatisation allows us to identify upper bounds for the complexity of the different signed consequence relations. We strengthen these upper bounds by providing strict complexity results for the considered reasoning tasks. Finally, we obtain an implementation of different forms of paraconsistent reasoning by appeal to the existing system QUIP.
