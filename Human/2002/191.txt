Aging, double helix and small world property in genetic algorithms

Over a quarter of century after the invention of genetic algorithms and miriads of their modifications, as well as successful implementations, we are still lacking many essential details of thorough analysis of it's inner working. One of such fundamental questions is: how many generations do we need to solve the optimization problem? This paper tries to answer this question, albeit in a fuzzy way, making use of the double helix concept. As a byproduct we gain better understanding of the ways, in which the genetic algorithm may be fine tuned.
