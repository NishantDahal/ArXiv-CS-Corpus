The efficient generation of unstructured control volumes in 2D and 3D

Many problems in engineering, chemistry and physics require the representation of solutions in complex geometries. In the paper we deal with a problem of unstructured mesh generation for the control volume method. We propose an algorithm which bases on the spheres generation in central points of the control volumes.
