Applying a Hybrid Query Translation Method to Japanese/English Cross-Language Patent Retrieval

This paper applies an existing query translation method to cross-language patent retrieval. In our method, multiple dictionaries are used to derive all possible translations for an input query, and collocational statistics are used to resolve translation ambiguity. We used Japanese/English parallel patent abstracts to perform comparative experiments, where our method outperformed a simple dictionary-based query translation method, and achieved 76% of monolingual retrieval in terms of average precision.
