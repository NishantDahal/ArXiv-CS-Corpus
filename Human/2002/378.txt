On the Information Engine of Circuit Design

This paper addresses a new approach to find a spectrum of information measures for the process of digital circuit synthesis. We consider the problem from the information engine point of view. The circuit synthesis as a whole and different steps of the design process (an example of decision diagram is given) are presented via such measurements as entropy, logical work and information vitality. We also introduce new information measures to provide better estimates of synthesis criteria. We show that the basic properties of information engine, such as the conservation law of information flow and the equilibrium law of information can be formulated.
