The performance of the batch learner algorithm

We analyze completely the convergence speed of the \emph{batch learning algorithm}, and compare its speed to that of the memoryless learning algorithm and of learning with memory. We show that the batch learning algorithm is never worse than the memoryless learning algorithm (at least asymptotically). Its performance \emph{vis-a-vis} learning with full memory is less clearcut, and depends on certain probabilistic assumptions.
