A Model-Theoretic Semantics for Defeasible Logic

Defeasible logic is an efficient logic for defeasible reasoning. It is defined through a proof theory and, until now, has had no model theory. In this paper a model-theoretic semantics is given for defeasible logic. The logic is sound and complete with respect to the semantics. We also briefly outline how this approach extends to a wide range of defeasible logics.
