Coloring random graphs

We study the graph coloring problem over random graphs of finite average connectivity $c$. Given a number $q$ of available colors, we find that graphs with low connectivity admit almost always a proper coloring whereas graphs with high connectivity are uncolorable. Depending on $q$, we find the precise value of the critical average connectivity $c_q$. Moreover, we show that below $c_q$ there exist a clustering phase $c\in [c_d,c_q]$ in which ground states spontaneously divide into an exponential number of clusters and where the proliferation of metastable states is responsible for the onset of complexity in local search algorithms.
