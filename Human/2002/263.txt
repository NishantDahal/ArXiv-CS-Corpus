Sierpinski Gaskets for Logic Functions Representation

This paper introduces a new approach to represent logic functions in the form of Sierpinski Gaskets. The structure of the gasket allows to manipulate with the corresponding logic expression using recursive essence of fractals. Thus, the Sierpinski gasket's pattern has myriad useful properties which can enhance practical features of other graphic representations like decision diagrams. We have covered possible applications of Sierpinski gaskets in logic design and justified our assumptions in logic function minimization (both Boolean and multiple-valued cases). The experimental results on benchmarks with advances in the novel structure are considered as well.
