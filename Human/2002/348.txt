Tracing and Explaining Execution of CLP(FD) Programs

Previous work in the area of tracing CLP(FD) programs mainly focuses on providing information about control of execution and domain modification. In this paper, we present a trace structure that provides information about additional important aspects. We incorporate explanations in the trace structure, i.e. reasons for why certain solver actions occur. Furthermore, we come up with a format for describing the execution of the filtering algorithms of global constraints. Some new ideas about the design of the trace are also presented. For example, we have modeled our trace as a nested block structure in order to achieve a hierarchical view. Also, new ways about how to represent and identify different entities such as constraints and domain variables are presented.
