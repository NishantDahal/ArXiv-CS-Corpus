Computational Phonology

Phonology, as it is practiced, is deeply computational. Phonological analysis is data-intensive and the resulting models are nothing other than specialized data structures and algorithms. In the past, phonological computation - managing data and developing analyses - was done manually with pencil and paper. Increasingly, with the proliferation of affordable computers, IPA fonts and drawing software, phonologists are seeking to move their computation work online. Computational Phonology provides the theoretical and technological framework for this migration, building on methodologies and tools from computational linguistics. This piece consists of an apology for computational phonology, a history, and an overview of current research.
