On linear programming bounds for spherical codes and designs

We investigate universal bounds on spherical codes and spherical designs that could be obtained using Delsarte's linear programming methods. We give a lower estimate for the LP upper bound on codes, and an upper estimate for the LP lower bound on designs. Specifically, when the distance of the code is fixed and the dimension goes to infinity, the LP upper bound on codes is at least as large as the average of the best known upper and lower bounds. When the dimension n of the design is fixed, and the strength k goes to infinity, the LP bound on designs turns out, in conjunction with known lower bounds, to be proportional to k^{n-1}.
