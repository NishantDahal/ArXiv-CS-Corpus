Logic Programming with Ordered Disjunction

Logic programs with ordered disjunction (LPODs) combine ideas underlying Qualitative Choice Logic (Brewka et al. KR 2002) and answer set programming. Logic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective called ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent alternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A \times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at least B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a preference relation on answer sets. LPODs are useful for applications in design and configuration and can serve as a basis for qualitative decision making.
