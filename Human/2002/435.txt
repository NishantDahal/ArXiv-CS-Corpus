On the graph coloring check-digit scheme with applications to verifiable secret sharing

In the paper we apply graph vertex coloring for verification of secret shares. We start from showing how to convert any graph into the number and vice versa. Next, theoretical result concerning properties of n-colorable graphs is stated and proven. From this result we derive graph coloring check-digit scheme. Feasibility of proposed scheme increases with the size of the number, which digits are checked and overall probability of errors. The check-digit scheme is used to build shares verification method that does not require cooperation of the third party. It allows implementing verification structure different from the access structure. It does not depend on particular secret sharing method. It can be used as long as the secret shares can be represented by numbers or graphs.
