Orthonormal RBF wavelet and ridgelet-like series and transforms for high-dimensional problems

This paper developed a systematic strategy establishing RBF on the wavelet analysis, which includes continuous and discrete RBF orthonormal wavelet transforms respectively in terms of singular fundamental solutions and nonsingular general solutions of differential operators. In particular, the harmonic Bessel RBF transforms were presented for high-dimensional data processing. It was also found that the kernel functions of convection-diffusion operator are feasible to construct some stable ridgelet-like RBF transforms. We presented time-space RBF transforms based on non-singular solution and fundamental solution of time-dependent differential operators. The present methodology was further extended to analysis of some known RBFs such as the MQ, Gaussian and pre-wavelet kernel RBFs.
