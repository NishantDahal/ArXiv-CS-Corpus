On ASGS framework: general requirements and an example of implementation

In the paper we propose general framework for Automatic Secret Generation and Sharing (ASGS) that should be independent of underlying secret sharing scheme. ASGS allows to prevent the dealer from knowing the secret or even to eliminate him at all. Two situations are discussed. First concerns simultaneous generation and sharing of the random, prior nonexistent secret. Such a secret remains unknown until it is reconstructed. Next, we propose the framework for automatic sharing of a known secret. In this case the dealer does not know the secret and the secret owner does not know the shares. We present opportunities for joining ASGS with other extended capabilities, with special emphasize on PVSS and proactive secret sharing. Finally, we illustrate framework with practical implementation.
