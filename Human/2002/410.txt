Evaluation of Coreference Rules on Complex Narrative Texts

This article studies the problem of assessing relevance to each of the rules of a reference resolution system. The reference solver described here stems from a formal model of reference and is integrated in a reference processing workbench. Evaluation of the reference resolution is essential, as it enables differential evaluation of individual rules. Numerical values of these measures are given, and discussed, for simple selection rules and other processing rules; such measures are then studied for numerical parameters.
