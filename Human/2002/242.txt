Exact Solution of a Drop-push Model for Percolation

Motivated by a computer science algorithm known as `linear probing with hashing' we study a new type of percolation model whose basic features include a sequential `dropping' of particles on a substrate followed by their transport via a `pushing' mechanism. Our exact solution in one dimension shows that, unlike the ordinary random percolation model, the drop-push model has nontrivial spatial correlations generated by the dynamics itself. The critical exponents in the drop-push model are also different from that of the ordinary percolation. The relevance of our results to computer science is pointed out.
