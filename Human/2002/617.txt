Classes of Spatiotemporal Objects and Their Closure Properties

We present a data model for spatio-temporal databases. In this model spatio-temporal data is represented as a finite union of objects described by means of a spatial reference object, a temporal object and a geometric transformation function that determines the change or movement of the reference object in time.
  We define a number of practically relevant classes of spatio-temporal objects, and give complete results concerning closure under Boolean set operators for these classes. Since only few classes are closed under all set operators, we suggest an extension of the model, which leads to better closure properties, and therefore increased practical applicability. We also discuss a normal form for this extended data model.
