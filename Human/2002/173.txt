The Lattice of N-Run Orthogonal Arrays

If the number of runs in a (mixed-level) orthogonal array of strength 2 is specified, what numbers of levels and factors are possible? The collection of possible sets of parameters for orthogonal arrays with N runs has a natural lattice structure, induced by the ``expansive replacement'' construction method. In particular the dual atoms in this lattice are the most important parameter sets, since any other parameter set for an N-run orthogonal array can be constructed from them. To get a sense for the number of dual atoms, and to begin to understand the lattice as a function of N, we investigate the height and the size of the lattice. It is shown that the height is at most [c(N-1)], where c= 1.4039... and that there is an infinite sequence of values of N for which this bound is attained. On the other hand, the number of nodes in the lattice is bounded above by a superpolynomial function of N (and superpolynomial growth does occur for certain sequences of values of N). Using a new construction based on ``mixed spreads'', all parameter sets with 64 runs are determined. Four of these 64-run orthogonal arrays appear to be new.
