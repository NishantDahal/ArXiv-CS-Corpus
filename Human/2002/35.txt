Covariance Plasticity and Regulated Criticality

We propose that a regulation mechanism based on Hebbian covariance plasticity may cause the brain to operate near criticality. We analyze the effect of such a regulation on the dynamics of a network with excitatory and inhibitory neurons and uniform connectivity within and across the two populations. We show that, under broad conditions, the system converges to a critical state lying at the common boundary of three regions in parameter space; these correspond to three modes of behavior: high activity, low activity, oscillation.
