Mathematical basis for polySAT implication operator

The mathematical basis motivating the "implication operator" of the polySAT algorithm and its function is examined. Such is not undertaken with onerous rigor of symbolic mathematics; a more intuitive visual appeal being employed to present some of the mathematical premises underlying function of the implication operator.
