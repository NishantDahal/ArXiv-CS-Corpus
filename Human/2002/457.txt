A universal alphabet and rewrite system

We present two ways in which an infinite universal alphabet may be generated using a novel rewrite system that conserves zero (a special character of the alphabet and the symbol for that character) at every step. The recursive method delivers the entire alphabet in one step when invoked with the zero character as the initial subset alphabet. The iterative method with the same start delivers characters that act as ciphers for properties that the developing subset alphabet contains. These properties emerge in an arbitrary sequence and there are an infinite number of ways they may be selected. The subset alphabets in addition to having mathematical interpretation as algebra can also be constrained to emerge in a minimal way which then has application as a foundational physical system. Each subset alphabet may itself be the basis of a rewrite system where rules that operate on symbols (representing characters) or collections of symbols manipulate the specific properties in a dynamic way.
