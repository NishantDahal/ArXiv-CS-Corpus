Lecture Notes on Evasiveness of Graph Properties

This report presents notes from the first eight lectures of the class Many Models of Complexity taught by Laszlo Lovasz at Princeton University in the fall of 1990. The topic is evasiveness of graph properties: given a graph property, how many edges of the graph an algorithm must check in the worst case before it knows whether the property holds.
