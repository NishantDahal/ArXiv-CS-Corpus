Computer-Generated Photorealistic Hair

This paper presents an efficient method for generating and rendering photorealistic hair in two dimensional pictures. The method consists of three major steps. Simulating an artist drawing is used to design the rough hair shape. A convolution based filter is then used to generate photorealistic hair patches. A refine procedure is finally used to blend the boundaries of the patches with surrounding areas. This method can be used to create all types of photorealistic human hair (head hair, facial hair and body hair). It is also suitable for fur and grass generation. Applications of this method include: hairstyle designing/editing, damaged hair image restoration, human hair animation, virtual makeover of a human, and landscape creation.
