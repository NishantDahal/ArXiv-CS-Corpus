Simulating Dense Small Cell Networks

Through massive deployment of additional small cell infrastructure, Dense Small cell Networks (DSNs) are expected to help meet the foreseen increase in traffic demand on cellular networks. Performance assessment of architectural and protocol solutions tailored to DSNs will require system and network level simulators that can appropriately model the complex interference environment found in those networks. This paper identifies the main features of DSN simulators, and guides the reader in the selection of an appropriate simulator for their desired investigations. We extend our discussion with a comparison of representative DSN simulators.
