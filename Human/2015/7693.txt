Kernel Manifold Alignment

We introduce a kernel method for manifold alignment (KEMA) and domain adaptation that can match an arbitrary number of data sources without needing corresponding pairs, just few labeled examples in all domains. KEMA has interesting properties: 1) it generalizes other manifold alignment methods, 2) it can align manifolds of very different complexities, performing a sort of manifold unfolding plus alignment, 3) it can define a domain-specific metric to cope with multimodal specificities, 4) it can align data spaces of different dimensionality, 5) it is robust to strong nonlinear feature deformations, and 6) it is closed-form invertible which allows transfer across-domains and data synthesis. We also present a reduced-rank version for computational efficiency and discuss the generalization performance of KEMA under Rademacher principles of stability. KEMA exhibits very good performance over competing methods in synthetic examples, visual object recognition and recognition of facial expressions tasks.
