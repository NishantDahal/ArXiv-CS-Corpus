Sequential Score Adaptation with Extreme Value Theory for Robust Railway Track Inspection

Periodic inspections are necessary to keep railroad tracks in state of good repair and prevent train accidents. Automatic track inspection using machine vision technology has become a very effective inspection tool. Because of its non-contact nature, this technology can be deployed on virtually any railway vehicle to continuously survey the tracks and send exception reports to track maintenance personnel. However, as appearance and imaging conditions vary, false alarm rates can dramatically change, making it difficult to select a good operating point. In this paper, we use extreme value theory (EVT) within a Bayesian framework to optimally adjust the sensitivity of anomaly detectors. We show that by approximating the lower tail of the probability density function (PDF) of the scores with an Exponential distribution (a special case of the Generalized Pareto distribution), and using the Gamma conjugate prior learned from the training data, it is possible to reduce the variability in false alarm rate and improve the overall performance. This method has shown an increase in the defect detection rate of rail fasteners in the presence of clutter (at PFA 0.1%) from 95.40% to 99.26% on the 85-mile Northeast Corridor (NEC) 2012-2013 concrete tie dataset.
