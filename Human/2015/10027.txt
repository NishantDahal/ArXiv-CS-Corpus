Simulating Brain Reaction to Methamphetamine Regarding Consumer Personality

Addiction, as a nervous disease, can be analysed using mathematical modelling and computer simulations. In this paper, we use an existing mathematical model to predict and simulate human brain response to the consumption of a single dose of methamphetamine. The model is implemented and coded in Matlab. Three types of personalities including introverts, ambiverts and extroverts are studied. The parameters of the mathematical model are calibrated and optimized, according to psychological theories, using a real coded genetic algorithm. The simulations show significant correlation between people response to methamphetamine abuse and their personality. They also show that one of the causes of tendency to stimulants roots in consumers personality traits. The results can be used as a tool for reducing attitude towards addiction.
