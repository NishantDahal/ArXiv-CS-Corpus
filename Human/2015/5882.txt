Unbounded-Thread Reachability via Symbolic Execution and Loop Acceleration (Technical Report)

We present an approach to parameterized reachability for communicating finite-state threads that formulates the analysis as a satisfiability problem. In addition to the unbounded number of threads, the main challenge for SAT/SMT-based reachability methods is the existence of unbounded loops in the program executed by a thread. We show in this paper how simple loops can be accelerated without approximation into Presburger arithmetic constraints. The constraints are obtained via symbolic execution and are satisfiable exactly if the given program state is reachable. We summarize loops nested inside other loops using recurrence relations derived from the inner loop's acceleration. This summary abstracts the loop iteration parameter and may thus overapproximate. An advantage of our symbolic approach is that the process of building the Presburger formulas may instantly reveal their unsatisfiability, before any arithmetic has been performed. We demonstrate the power of this technique for proving and refuting safety properties of unbounded-thread programs and other infinite-state transition systems.
