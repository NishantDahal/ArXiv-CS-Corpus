Graph Isomorphism for Bounded Genus Graphs In Linear Time

For every integer $g$, isomorphism of graphs of Euler genus at most $g$ can be decided in linear time.
  This improves previously known algorithms whose time complexity is $n^{O(g)}$ (shown in early 1980's), and in fact, this is the first fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem for bounded genus graphs in terms of the Euler genus $g$. Our result also generalizes the seminal result of Hopcroft and Wong in 1974, which says that the graph isomorphism problem can be decided in linear time for planar graphs.
  Our proof is quite lengthly and complicated, but if we are satisfied with an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for the same problem, the proof is shorter and easier.
