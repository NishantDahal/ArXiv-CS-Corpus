Reliable Initialization of GPU-enabled Parallel Stochastic Simulations Using Mersenne Twister for Graphics Processors

Parallel stochastic simulations tend to exploit more and more computing power and they are now also developed for General Purpose Graphics Process Units (GP-GPUs). Conse-quently, they need reliable random sources to feed their applications. We propose a survey of the current Pseudo Random Numbers Generators (PRNG) available on GPU. We give a particular focus to the recent Mersenne Twister for Graphics Processors (MTGP) that has just been released. Our work provides empirically checked statuses designed to initialize a particular configuration of this generator, in order to prevent any potential bias introduced by the parallelization of the PRNG.
