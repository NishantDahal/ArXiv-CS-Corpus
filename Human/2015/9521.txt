Proposal of ROS-compliant FPGA Component for Low-Power Robotic Systems

In recent years, robots are required to be autonomous and their robotic software are sophisticated. Robots have a problem of insufficient performance, since it cannot equip with a high-performance microprocessor due to battery-power operation. On the other hand, FPGA devices can accelerate specific functions in a robot system without increasing power consumption by implementing customized circuits. But it is difficult to introduce FPGA devices into a robot due to large development cost of an FPGA circuit compared to software. Therefore, in this study, we propose an FPGA component technology for an easy integration of an FPGA into robots, which is compliant with ROS (Robot Operating System). As a case study, we designed ROS-compliant FPGA component of image labeling using Xilinx Zynq platform. The developed ROS-component FPGA component performs 1.7 times faster compared to the ordinary ROS software component.
