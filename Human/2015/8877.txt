Prediction of Radiation Fog by DNA Computing

In this paper we propose a wet lab algorithm for prediction of radiation fog by DNA computing. The concept of DNA computing is essentially exploited for generating the classifier algorithm in the wet lab. The classifier is based on a new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning suitable for wet lab implementation. This new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning is different from conventional approach to fuzzy reasoning based on similarity measure and also replaces the logical aspect of classical fuzzy reasoning by DNA chemistry. Thus, we add a new dimension to existing forms of fuzzy reasoning by bringing it down to nanoscale. We exploit the concept of massive parallelism of DNA computing by designing this new classifier in the wet lab. This newly designed classifier is very much generalized in nature and apart from prediction of radiation fog this methodology can be applied to other types of data also. To achieve our goal we first fuzzify the given observed parameters in a form of synthetic DNA sequence which is called fuzzy DNA and which handles the vague concept of human reasoning.
