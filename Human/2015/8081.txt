About embedded quarters and points at infinity in the hyperbolic plane

In this paper, we prove two results. First, there is a family of sequences of embedded quarters of the hyperbolic plane such that any sequence converges to a limit which is an end of the hyperbolic plane. Second, there is no algorithm which would allow us to check whether two given ends are equal or not.
