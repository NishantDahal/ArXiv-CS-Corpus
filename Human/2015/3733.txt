Exact and Stable Covariance Estimation from Quadratic Sampling via Convex Programming

Statistical inference and information processing of high-dimensional data often require efficient and accurate estimation of their second-order statistics. With rapidly changing data, limited processing power and storage at the acquisition devices, it is desirable to extract the covariance structure from a single pass over the data and a small number of stored measurements. In this paper, we explore a quadratic (or rank-one) measurement model which imposes minimal memory requirements and low computational complexity during the sampling process, and is shown to be optimal in preserving various low-dimensional covariance structures. Specifically, four popular structural assumptions of covariance matrices, namely low rank, Toeplitz low rank, sparsity, jointly rank-one and sparse structure, are investigated, while recovery is achieved via convex relaxation paradigms for the respective structure.
  The proposed quadratic sampling framework has a variety of potential applications including streaming data processing, high-frequency wireless communication, phase space tomography and phase retrieval in optics, and non-coherent subspace detection. Our method admits universally accurate covariance estimation in the absence of noise, as soon as the number of measurements exceeds the information theoretic limits. We also demonstrate the robustness of this approach against noise and imperfect structural assumptions. Our analysis is established upon a novel notion called the mixed-norm restricted isometry property (RIP-$\ell_{2}/\ell_{1}$), as well as the conventional RIP-$\ell_{2}/\ell_{2}$ for near-isotropic and bounded measurements. In addition, our results improve upon the best-known phase retrieval (including both dense and sparse signals) guarantees using PhaseLift with a significantly simpler approach.
