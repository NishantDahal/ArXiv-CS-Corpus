ptp++: A Precision Time Protocol Simulation Model for OMNeT++ / INET

Precise time synchronization is expected to play a key role in emerging distributed and real-time applications such as the smart grid and Internet of Things (IoT) based applications. The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is currently viewed as one of the main synchronization solutions over a packet-switched network, which supports microsecond synchronization accuracy. In this paper, we present a PTP simulation model for OMNeT++ INET, which allows to investigate the synchronization accuracy under different network configurations and conditions. To show some illustrative simulation results using the developed module, we investigate on the network load fluctuations and their impacts on the PTP performance by considering a network with class-based quality-of-service (QoS) support. The simulation results show that the network load significantly affects the network delay symmetry, and investigate a new technique called class probing to improve the PTP accuracy and mitigate the load fluctuation effects.
