Optimizing coverage of 3D Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks by means of deploying redundant sensors

Coverage is one of the fundamental issues in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). It reflects the ability of WMSNs to detect the fields. Motivated by the existing-enhancing algorithm of traditional 2D WMSNs, a new 3D WMSNs sensing model is established and a new coverage-enhancing algorithm based on this model is proposed. This algorithm defines the sensing model as trapezoidal pyramid, calculates the key parameters (tilt angle) then improves coverage ratio by optimizing it. However, there still exists redundant sensors in this optimized networks. Aiming at efficiently utilizing these redundant sensors and enhancing coverage ratio, the authors selects the redundant sensors by introducing the set cover model algorithm, further deploys them to the uncovered area following the greedy policy, so that the whole path coverage performance of WMSNs is enhanced.
