Knowledge Acquisition from Social Platforms Based on Network Distributions Fitting

The uniqueness of online social networks makes it possible to implement new methods that increase the quality and effectiveness of research processes. While surveys are one of the most important tools for research, the representativeness of selected online samples is often a challenge and the results are hardly generalizable. An approach based on surveys with representativeness targeted at network measure distributions is proposed and analysed in this paper. Its main goal is to focus not only on sample representativeness in terms of demographic attributes, but also to follow the measures distributions within main network. The approach presented has many application areas related to online research, sampling a network for the evaluation of collaborative learning processes, and candidate selection for training purposes with the ability to distribute information within a social network.
