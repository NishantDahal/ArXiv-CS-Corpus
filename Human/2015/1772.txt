A DCT And SVD based Watermarking Technique To Identify Tag

With the rapid development of the multimedia,the secure of the multimedia is get more concerned. as far as we know , Digital watermarking is an effective way to protect copyright. The watermark must be generally hidden does not affect the quality of the original image. In this paper,a novel way based on discrete cosine transform(DCT) and singular value decomposition(SVD) .In the proposed way,we decomposition the image into 8*8 blocks, next we use the DCT to get the transformed block,then we choose the diagonal to embed the information, after we do this, we recover the image and then we decomposition the image to 8*8 blocks,we use the SVD way to get the diagonal matrix and embed the information in the matrix. next we extract the information use both inverse of DCT and SVD, as we all know,after we embed the information seconded time , the information we first information we embed must be changed, we choose a measure way called Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) to estimate the similarity of the two image, and set a threshold to ensure whether the information is same or not.
