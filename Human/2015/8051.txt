WearWrite: Orchestrating the Crowd to Complete Complex Tasks from Wearables (We Wrote This Paper on a Watch)

In this paper we introduce a paradigm for completing complex tasks from wearable devices by leveraging crowdsourcing, and demonstrate its validity for academic writing. We explore this paradigm using a collaborative authoring system, called WearWrite, which is designed to enable authors and crowd workers to work together using an Android smartwatch and Google Docs to produce academic papers, including this one. WearWrite allows expert authors who do not have access to large devices to contribute bits of expertise and big picture direction from their watch, while freeing them of the obligation of integrating their contributions into the overall document. Crowd workers on desktop computers actually write the document. We used this approach to write several simple papers, and found it was effective at producing reasonable drafts. However, the workers often needed more structure and the authors more context. WearWrite addresses these issues by focusing workers on specific tasks and providing select context to authors on the watch. We demonstrate the system's feasibility by writing this paper using it.
