A Proposal for a Nationwide Student Gradebook Information Network

Todays students are encouraged to study and develop expertise in more than one national academic environment. As a matter of fact, their educational activities inevitably occur in a variety of academic settings and even span several years. Consequently students academic results and progress are expected to be easily monitored and accessed nationally. The authors of the present paper have devised a student gradebook information network to be nationally employed by all public and private universities and colleges. The papers deals with the architectural principles underlying the system and discusses aspects related to data collection, data analysis and data storage across multiple machines while providing a seamless view of entire infrastructure and service delivery system from a single Web access point. The utility of the architectural system is discussed in relationship with its major advantages: user-friendliness, security access, flexibility, transparency, distributional power, and scalability. The major beneficiary of the system is the Romanian higher education system.
