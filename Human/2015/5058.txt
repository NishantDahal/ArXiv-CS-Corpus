Multidimensional Digital Smoothing Filters for Target Detection

Recursive, causal and non-causal, multidimensional digital filters, with infinite impulse responses and maximally flat magnitude and delay responses in the low-frequency region, are designed to negate correlated clutter and interference in the background and to accumulate power due to dim targets in the foreground of a surveillance sensor. Expressions relating mean impulse-response duration, frequency selectivity and group delay, to low-order linear-difference-equation coefficients are derived using discrete Laguerre polynomials and discounted least-squares regression, then verified through simulation.
