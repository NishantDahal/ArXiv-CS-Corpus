Multi-valued Color Representation Based on Frank t-norm Properties

In this paper two knowledge representation models are proposed, FP4 and FP6. Both combine ideas from fuzzy sets and four-valued and hexa-valued logics. Both represent imprecise properties whose accomplished degree is unknown or contradictory for some objects. A possible application in the color analysis and color image processing is discussed.
