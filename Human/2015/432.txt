Communication and games in the online foreign language educational system. User behavior study

The paper describes creation and development of the educational online communication platform for teaching and learning foreign languages. The system is based on the time bank principle, allowing users to teach others their native tongue along with taking foreign language lessons. The system is based on the WebRTC technology, allowing users to access synchronized teaching materials along with seeing and hearing each other. The platform is free for the users with implemented gamification mechanics to motivate them. It is based on the freemium model, where the main functions are provided free of charged with some premium features. The paper describes studies associated with user involvement in the learning/teaching process. The hypothesis whether two previously unfamiliar individuals could communicate with each other using a foreign language, based on the developed system algorithms, was tested. System virality, where new users are attracted by the existing users was also studied, along with user motivation for viral behavior. Relationships between monetization, virality and user involvement were also considered.
