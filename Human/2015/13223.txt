Error-Resilient Multicasting for Multi-View 3D Videos in Wireless Networks

With the emergence of naked-eye 3D mobile devices, mobile 3D video services are becoming increasingly important for video service providers, such as Youtube and Netflix, while multi-view 3D videos have the potential to inspire a variety of innovative applications. However, enabling multi-view 3D video services may overwhelm WiFi networks when every view of a video are multicasted. In this paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), which allows each mobile client to synthesize the desired view from nearby left and right views, in order to effectively reduce the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, when each client suffers from packet losses, retransmissions incur additional bandwidth consumption and excess delay, which in turn undermines the quality of experience in video applications. To address the above issue, we first discover the merit of view protection via DIBR for multi-view video multicast using a mathematical analysis and then design a new protocol, named Multi-View Group Management Protocol (MVGMP), to support the dynamic join and leave of users and the change of desired views. The simulation results demonstrate that our protocol effectively reduces bandwidth consumption and increases the probability for each client to successfully playback the desired views in a multi-view 3D video.
