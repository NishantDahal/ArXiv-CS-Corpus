Some notes on a method for proving inequalities by computer

In this article we consider mathematical fundamentals of one method for proving inequalities by computer, based on the Remez algorithm. Using the well-known results of undecidability of the existence of zeros of real elementary functions, we demonstrate that the considered method generally in practice becomes one heuristic for the verification of inequalities. We give some improvements of the inequalities considered in the theorems for which the existing proofs have been based on the numerical verifications of Remez algorithm.
