10 Observations on Google Cluster Trace + 2 Measures for Cluster Utilization Enhancement

Utilization enhancement is a key concern to cluster owners. Google's cluster manager named Borg manages its clusters at an overall utilization higher than many others' clusters. Recently, Google has disclosed the details of its powerful cluster manager Borg. Quite a few lessons are summarized from the Borg experiences. Nevertheless, we find that more can be learned if the Borg design is correlated with the trace analysis of a Google cluster managed by Borg. There is one such trace released four years ago. In this paper, we analyze the Google cluster trace and make 10 observations not found in previous analyses. We also correlates the results of our analysis and previous analyses to the Borg design, such that we find two measures that can possibly further improve cluster utilization over Borg.
