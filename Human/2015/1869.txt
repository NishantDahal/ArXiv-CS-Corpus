Power Efficient Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex Radio Distributed Antenna Networks

In this paper, we study the resource allocation algorithm design for distributed antenna multiuser networks with full-duplex (FD) radio base stations (BSs) which enable simultaneous uplink and downlink communications. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as an optimization problem taking into account the antenna circuit power consumption of the BSs and the quality of service (QoS) requirements of both uplink and downlink users. We minimize the total network power consumption by jointly optimizing the downlink beamformer, the uplink transmit power, and the antenna selection. To overcome the intractability of the resulting problem, we reformulate it as an optimization problem with decoupled binary selection variables and non-convex constraints. The reformulated problem facilitates the design of an iterative resource allocation algorithm which obtains an optimal solution based on the generalized Bender's decomposition (GBD) and serves as a benchmark scheme. Furthermore, to strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance, a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial time complexity is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD based iterative algorithm converges to the global optimal solution and the suboptimal algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance. Our results also demonstrate the trade-off between power efficiency and the number of active transmit antennas when the circuit power consumption is taken into account. In particular, activating an exceedingly large number of antennas may not be a power efficient solution for reducing the total system power consumption. In addition, our results reveal that FD systems facilitate significant power savings compared to traditional half-duplex systems, despite the non-negligible self-interference.
