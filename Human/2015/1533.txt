Evaluation of Security Solutions for Android Systems

With the increasing usage of smartphones a plethora of security solutions are being designed and developed. Many of the security solutions fail to cope with advanced attacks and are not aways properly designed for smartphone platforms. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology to evaluate their effectiveness. Since the Android operating system has the highest market share today, we decided to focus on it in this study in which we review some of the state-of-the-art security solutions for Android-based smartphones. In addition, we present a set of evaluation criteria aiming at evaluating security mechanisms that are specifically designed for Android-based smartphones. We believe that the proposed framework will help security solution designers develop more effective solutions and assist security experts evaluate the effectiveness of security solutions for Android-based smartphones.
