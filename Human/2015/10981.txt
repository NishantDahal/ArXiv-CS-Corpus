A New Storage Optimized Honeyword Generation Approach for Enhancing Security and Usability

Inverting the hash values by performing brute force computation is one of the latest security threats on password based authentication technique. New technologies are being developed for brute force computation and these increase the success rate of inversion attack. Honeyword base authentication protocol can successfully mitigate this threat by making password cracking detectable. However, the existing schemes have several limitations like Multiple System Vulnerability, Weak DoS Resistivity, Storage Overhead, etc. In this paper we have proposed a new honeyword generation approach, identified as Paired Distance Protocol (PDP) which overcomes almost all the drawbacks of previously proposed honeyword generation approaches. The comprehensive analysis shows that PDP not only attains a high detection rate of 97.23% but also reduces the storage cost to a great extent.
