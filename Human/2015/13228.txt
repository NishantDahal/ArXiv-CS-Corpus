Mining MOOC Clickstreams: On the Relationship Between Learner Behavior and Performance

We study student behavior and performance in two Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In doing so, we present two frameworks by which video-watching clickstreams can be represented: one based on the sequence of events created, and another on the sequence of positions visited. With the event-based framework, we extract recurring subsequences of student behavior, which contain fundamental characteris- tics such as reflecting (i.e., repeatedly playing and pausing) and revising (i.e., plays and skip backs). We find that some of these behaviors are significantly associated with whether a user will be Correct on First Attempt (CFA) or not in answering quiz questions. With the position-based framework, we then devise models for performance. In evaluating these through CFA prediction, we find that three of them can substantially improve prediction quality in terms of accuracy and F1, which underlines the ability to relate behavior to performance. Since our prediction considers videos individually, these benefits also suggest that our models are useful in situations where there is limited training data, e.g., for early detection or in short courses.
