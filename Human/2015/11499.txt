The Economic Dispatch for Integrated Wind Power Systems Using Particle Swarm Optimization

The economic dispatch of wind power units is quite different from that in conventional thermal units, since the adopted model should take into consideration the intermittency nature of wind speed as well. Therefore, this paper uses a model that takes into account the aforementioned consideration in addition to whether the utility owns wind turbines or not. The economic dispatch is solved by using one of the modern optimization algorithms: the particle swarm optimization algorithm. A 6-bus system is used and it includes wind-powered generators besides to thermal generators. The thorough analysis of the results is also provided.
