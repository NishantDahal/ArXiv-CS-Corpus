Approximation and Dependence via Multiteam Semantics

We define a variant of team semantics called multiteam semantics based on multisets and study the properties of various logics in this framework. In particular, we define natural probabilistic versions of inclusion and independence atoms and certain approximation operators motivated by approximate dependence atoms of Väänänen.
