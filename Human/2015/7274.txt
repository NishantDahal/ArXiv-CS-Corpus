Words with the Maximum Number of Abelian Squares

An abelian square is the concatenation of two words that are anagrams of one another. A word of length $n$ can contain $Î˜(n^2)$ distinct factors that are abelian squares. We study infinite words such that the number of abelian square factors of length $n$ grows quadratically with $n$.
