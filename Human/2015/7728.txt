Novel Super-Resolution Method Based on High Order Nonlocal-Means

Super-resolution without explicit sub-pixel motion estimation is a very active subject of image reconstruction containing general motion. The Non-Local Means (NLM) method is a simple image reconstruction method without explicit motion estimation. In this paper we generalize NLM method to higher orders using kernel regression can apply to super-resolution reconstruction. The performance of the generalized method is compared with other methods.
