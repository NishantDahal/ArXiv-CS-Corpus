A variational formula for risk-sensitive reward

We derive a variational formula for the optimal growth rate of reward in the infinite horizon risk-sensitive control problem for discrete time Markov decision processes with compact metric state and action spaces, extending a formula of Donsker and Varadhan for the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of a positive operator. This leads to a concave maximization formulation of the problem of determining this optimal growth rate.
