On Dress Codes with Flowers

Fractional Repetition (FR) codes are well known class of Distributed Replication-based Simple Storage (Dress) codes for the Distributed Storage Systems (DSSs). In such systems, the replicas of data packets encoded by Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code, are stored on distributed nodes. Most of the available constructions for the FR codes are based on combinatorial designs and Graph theory. In this work, we propose an elegant sequence based approach for the construction of the FR code. In particular, we propose a beautiful class of codes known as Flower codes and study its basic properties.
