Towards a Model Theory for Distributed Representations

Distributed representations (such as those based on embeddings) and discrete representations (such as those based on logic) have complementary strengths. We explore one possible approach to combining these two kinds of representations. We present a model theory/semantics for first order logic based on vectors of reals. We describe the model theory, discuss some interesting properties of such a system and present a simple approach to query answering.
