Sharp Finite-Time Iterated-Logarithm Martingale Concentration

We give concentration bounds for martingales that are uniform over finite times and extend classical Hoeffding and Bernstein inequalities. We also demonstrate our concentration bounds to be optimal with a matching anti-concentration inequality, proved using the same method. Together these constitute a finite-time version of the law of the iterated logarithm, and shed light on the relationship between it and the central limit theorem.
