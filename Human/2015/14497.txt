Solving a Mathematical Problem in Square War: a Go-like Board Game

In this paper, we present a board game: Square War. The game definition of Square War is similar to the classic Chinese board game Go. Then we propose a mathematical problem of the game Square War. Finally, we show that the problem can be solved by using a method of mixed mathematics and computer science.
