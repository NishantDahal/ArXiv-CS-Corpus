Proceedings 6th Workshop on Formal Methods and Analysis in SPL Engineering

The workshop aims at reviewing the state of the art and the state of the practice in which formal methods and analysis approaches are currently applied in SPLE. This leads to a discussion of a research agenda for the extension of existing formal approaches and the development of new formal techniques for dealing with the particular needs of SPLE. To achieve the above objectives, the workshop is intended as a highly interactive event fostering discussion and initiating collaborations between the participants from both communities.
