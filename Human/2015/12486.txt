The Physical Web in Smart Cities

In this paper, we discuss the physical web projects based on network proximity for Smart Cities. In general, the Physical Web is an approach for connecting any physical object to the web. With this approach, we can navigate and control physical objects in the world surrounding mobile devices. Alternatively, we can execute services on mobile devices, depending on the surrounding physical objects. Technically, there are different ways to enumerate physical objects. In this paper, we will target the models based on the wireless proximity.
