Sharing Channel In IEEE 802.16 Using The Cooperative Model Of Slotted ALOHA

One of the main problems in WIMAX is to share the medium by multiple users who compete for access. Various random access mechanisms, such as ALOHA and its corresponding variations have been widely studied as efficient methods to coordinate the medium access among competing users. In this paper the slotted ALOHA protocol is implemented as a two-state system. Using Markov Models, we evaluate the channel utilization and we analyze the throughput under different fairness conditions. The cooperative team problem is considered.
