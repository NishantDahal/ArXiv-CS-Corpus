Quantum Information splitting using a pair of GHZ states

We describe a protocol for quantum information splitting (QIS) of a restricted class of three-qubit states among three parties Alice, Bob and Charlie, using a pair of GHZ states as the quantum channel. There are two different forms of this three-qubit state that is used for QIS depending on the distribution of the particles among the three parties. There is also a special type of four-qubit state that can be used for QIS using the above channel. We explicitly construct the quantum channel, Alice's measurement basis and the analytic form of the unitary operations required by the receiver for such a purpose.
