Towards Distributed Convoy Pattern Mining

Mining movement data to reveal interesting behavioral patterns has gained attention in recent years. One such pattern is the convoy pattern which consists of at least m objects moving together for at least k consecutive time instants where m and k are user-defined parameters. Existing algorithms for detecting convoy patterns, however do not scale to real-life dataset sizes. Therefore a distributed algorithm for convoy mining is inevitable. In this paper, we discuss the problem of convoy mining and analyze different data partitioning strategies to pave the way for a generic distributed convoy pattern mining algorithm.
