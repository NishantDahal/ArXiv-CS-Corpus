A Unified Approach to 3 Basic Challenges in Shared Autonomy

We discuss some of the challenges facing shared autonomy. In particular, we explore 1) shared autonomy over unreliable networks, 2) how we can model individual human operators (in contrast to the average of a human operator), and 3) how our approach naturally models and integrates sliding autonomy into the joint human-machine system. We include a Background Section for completeness.
