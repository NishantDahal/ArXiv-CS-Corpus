Quadrant Based DIR in CWin Adaptation Mechanism for Multihop Wireless Network

In Multihop Wireless Networks, traffic forwarding capability of each node varies according to its level of contention. Each node can yield its channel access opportunity to its neighbouring nodes, so that all the nodes can evenly share the channel and have similar forwarding capability. In this manner the wireless channel is utilize d effectively, which is achieved using Contention Window Adaptation Mechanism (CWAM). This mechanism achieves a higher end to - end throughout but consumes the network power to a higher level. So, a newly proposed algorithm Quadrant Based Directional Routing Protocol (Q-DIR) is implemented as a cross - layer with CWAM, to reduce the total network power consumption through limited flooding and also reduce the routing overheads, which eventually increases overall network throughput. This algorithm limits the broadcast region to a quadrant where the source node and the destination nodes are located. Implementation of the algorithm is done in Linux based NS-2 simulator.
