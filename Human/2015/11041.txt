Relay Selection in Wireless Powered Cooperative Networks with Energy Storage

This paper deals with the problem of relay selection in wireless powered cooperative networks, where spatially random relays are equipped with energy storage devices e.g., batteries. In contrast to conventional techniques and in order to reduce complexity, the relay nodes can either harvest energy from the source signal (in case of uncharged battery) or attempt to decode and forward it (in case of charged battery). Several relay selection schemes that correspond to different state information requirements and implementation complexities are proposed. The charging/discharging behavior of the battery is modeled as a two-state Markov chain and analytical expressions for the steady-state distribution and the outage probability performance are derived for each relay selection scheme. We prove that energy storage significantly affects the performance of the system and results in a zeroth diversity gain at high signal-to-noise ratios; the convergence floors depend on the steady-state distribution of the battery and are derived in closed-form by using appropriate approximations. The proposed relay selection schemes are generalized to a large-scale network with multiple access points (APs), where relays assist the closest AP and suffer from multi-user interference.
