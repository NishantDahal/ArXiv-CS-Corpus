On the Equivalence of CoCoA+ and DisDCA

In this document, we show that the algorithm CoCoA+ (Ma et al., ICML, 2015) under the setting used in their experiments, which is also the best setting suggested by the authors that proposed this algorithm, is equivalent to the practical variant of DisDCA (Yang, NIPS, 2013).
