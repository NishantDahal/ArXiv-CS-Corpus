Orthogonal Multilevel Spreading Sequence Design

Finite field transforms are offered as a new tool of spreading sequence design. This approach exploits orthogonality properties of synchronous non-binary sequences defined over a complex finite field. It is promising for channels supporting a high signal-to-noise ratio. New digital multiplex schemes based on such sequences have also been introduced, which are multilevel Code Division Multiplex. These schemes termed Galois-field Division Multiplex (GDM) are based on transforms for which there exists fast algorithms. They are also convenient from the hardware viewpoint since they can be implemented by a Digital Signal Processor. A new Efficient-bandwidth code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) is introduced, which is based on multilevel spread spectrum sequences over a Galois field. The primary advantage of such schemes regarding classical multiple access digital schemes is their better spectral efficiency. Galois-Fourier transforms contain some redundancy and only cyclotomic coefficients are needed to be transmitted yielding compact spectrum requirements.
