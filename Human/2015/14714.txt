An Approach to 2D Signals Recovering in Compressive Sensing Context

In this paper we study the compressive sensing effects on 2D signals exhibiting sparsity in 2D DFT domain. A simple algorithm for reconstruction of randomly under-sampled data is proposed. It is based on the analytically determined threshold that precisely separates signal and non-signal components in the 2D DFT domain. The algorithm operates fast in a single iteration providing the accurate signal reconstruction. In the situations that are not comprised by the analytic derivation and constrains, the algorithm is still efficient and need just a couple of iterations. The proposed solution shows promising results in ISAR imaging (simulated data are used), where the reconstruction is achieved even in the case when less than 10% of data is available.
