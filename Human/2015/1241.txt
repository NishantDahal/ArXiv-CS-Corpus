The conjugated null space method of blind PSF estimation and deconvolution optimization

We have shown that the vector of the point spread function (PSF) lexicographical presentation belongs to the left side conjugated null space (NS) of the autoregression (AR) matrix operator on condition the AR parameters are common for original and blurred images. The method of the PSF and inverse PSF (IPSF) evaluation in the basis of the NS eigenfunctions is offered. The optimization of the PSF and IPSF shape with the aim of fluctuation elimination is considered in NS spectral domain and image space domain. The function of surface area was used as the regularization functional. Two methods of original image estimate optimization were designed basing on maximum entropy generalization of sought and blurred images conditional probability density and regularization. The first method uses balanced variations of convolutions with the PSF and IPSF to obtaining iterative schema of image optimization. The variations balance is providing by dynamic regularization basing on condition of the iteration process convergence. The regularization has dynamic character because depends on current and previous image estimate variations. The second method implements the regularization of the deconvolution optimization in curved space with metric defined on image estimate surface. The given iterative schemas have fast convergence and therefore can be used for reconstruction of high resolution images series in real time. The NS can be used for design of denoising bilateral linear filter which does not introduce image smoothing.
