The development of a mapping tool for the evaluation of building systems for future climate scenarios on European scale

The paper presents a tool for the mapping of the performance of building systems on European scale for different (future) time periods. The tool is to use for users and be applicable for different building systems. Users should also be able to use a broad range of climate parameters to assess the influence of climate change on these climatic parameters. Also should the calculation time be reasonable short. The mapping tool is developed in MATLAB, which can be used by other users for their own studies.
