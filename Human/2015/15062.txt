HDR - A Hysteresis-Driven Routing Algorithm for Energy Harvesting Tag Networks

The work contains a first attempt to treat the problem of routing in networks with energy harvesting units. We propose HDR - a Hysteresis Based Routing Algorithm and analyse it in a simple diamond network. We also consider a network with three forwarding nodes. The results are used to give insight into its application in general topology networks and to general harvesting patterns.
