Influence of Personality Types in Software Tasks Choices

According to psychology, not everybody can excel at all kinds of tasks. Thus, chances of a successful outcome of software development increase if people with particular personality types are assigned to their preferred tasks in the project. Likewise, software development depends significantly on how software practitioners perform their tasks. This empirical study surveys 100 Cuban software developers, who also teach or study at the University of Informatics Sciences in Havana, Cuba. This work aims to find possible patterns that link personality types to role preferences in a software life cycle. Among the various roles, system analyst, software designer, and programmer are found to be the most preferred among the participants. In contrast, software tester and software maintainer happen to be the least popular roles among software engineers.
