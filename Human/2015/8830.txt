Shedding Light on the Asymmetric Learning Capability of AdaBoost

In this paper, we propose a different insight to analyze AdaBoost. This analysis reveals that, beyond some preconceptions, AdaBoost can be directly used as an asymmetric learning algorithm, preserving all its theoretical properties. A novel class-conditional description of AdaBoost, which models the actual asymmetric behavior of the algorithm, is presented.
