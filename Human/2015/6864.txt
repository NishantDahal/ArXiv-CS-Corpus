A Feature-Based Analysis on the Impact of Set of Constraints for e-Constrained Differential Evolution

Different types of evolutionary algorithms have been developed for constrained continuous optimization. We carry out a feature-based analysis of evolved constrained continuous optimization instances to understand the characteristics of constraints that make problems hard for evolutionary algorithm. In our study, we examine how various sets of constraints can influence the behaviour of e-Constrained Differential Evolution. Investigating the evolved instances, we obtain knowledge of what type of constraints and their features make a problem difficult for the examined algorithm.
