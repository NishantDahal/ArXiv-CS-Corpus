Function spaces for second-order polynomial time

In the context of second-order polynomial-time computability, we prove that there is no general function space construction. We proceed to identify restrictions on the domain or the codomain that do provide a function space with polynomial-time function evaluation containing all polynomial-time computable functions of that type.
  As side results we show that a polynomial-time counterpart to admissibility of a representation is not a suitable criterion for natural representations, and that the Weihrauch degrees embed into the polynomial-time Weihrauch degrees.
