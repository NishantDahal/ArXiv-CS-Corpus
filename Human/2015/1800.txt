The Modeling and Quantification of Rhythmic to Non-rhythmic Phenomenon in Electrocardiography during Anesthesia

Variations of instantaneous heart rate appears regularly oscillatory in deeper levels of anesthesia and less regular in lighter levels of anesthesia. It is impossible to observe this "rhythmic-to-non-rhythmic" phenomenon from raw electrocardiography waveform in current standard anesthesia monitors. To explore the possible clinical value, I proposed the adaptive harmonic model, which fits the descriptive property in physiology, and provides adequate mathematical conditions for the quantification. Based on the adaptive harmonic model, multitaper Synchrosqueezing transform was used to provide time-varying power spectrum, which facilitates to compute the quantitative index: "Non-rhythmic-to-Rhythmic Ratio" index (NRR index). I then used a clinical database to analyze the behavior of NRR index and compare it with other standard indices of anesthetic depth. The positive statistical results suggest that NRR index provides addition clinical information regarding motor reaction, which aligns with current standard tools. Furthermore, the ability to indicates the noxious stimulation is an additional finding. Lastly, I have proposed an real-time interpolation scheme to contribute my study further as a clinical application.
