Spacetimes with Semantics (II), Scaling of agency, semantics, and tenancy

Using Promise Theory as a calculus, I review how to define agency in a scalable way, for the purpose of understanding semantic spacetimes. By following simple scaling rules, replacing individual agents with `super-agents' (sub-spaces), it is shown how agency can be scaled both dynamically and semantically.
  The notion of occupancy and tenancy, or how space is used and filled in different ways, is also defined, showing how spacetime can be shared between independent parties, both by remote association and local encapsulation. I describe how to build up dynamic and semantic continuity, by joining discrete individual atoms and molecules of space into quasi-continuous lattices.
