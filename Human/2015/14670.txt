Asymmetric quantum convolutional codes

In this paper, we construct the first families of asymmetric quantum convolutional codes (AQCC)'s. These new AQCC's are constructed by means of the CSS-type construction applied to suitable families of classical convolutional codes, which are also constructed here. The new codes have noncatastrophic generator matrices and they present great asymmetry. Since our constructions are performed algebraically, it is possible to derive several families of such codes and not only codes with specific parameters. Additionally, several different types of such codes are obtained.
