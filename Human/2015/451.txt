A One-Dimensional Physically Universal Cellular Automaton

Physical universality of a cellular automaton was defined by Janzing in 2010 as the ability to implement an arbitrary transformation of spatial patterns. In 2014, Schaeffer gave a construction of a two-dimensional physically universal cellular automaton. We construct a one-dimensional version of the automaton.
