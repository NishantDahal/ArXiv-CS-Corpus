ElSe: Ellipse Selection for Robust Pupil Detection in Real-World Environments

Fast and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite for video-based eye-tracking in real-world settings. Several algorithms for image-based pupil detection have been proposed, their applicability is mostly limited to laboratory conditions. In realworld scenarios, automated pupil detection has to face various challenges, such as illumination changes, reflections (on glasses), make-up, non-centered eye recording, and physiological eye characteristics. We propose ElSe, a novel algorithm based on ellipse evaluation of a filtered edge image. We aim at a robust, resource-saving approach that can be integrated in embedded architectures e.g. driving. The proposed algorithm was evaluated against four state-of-the-art methods on over 93,000 hand-labeled images from which 55,000 are new images contributed by this work. On average, the proposed method achieved a 14.53% improvement on the detection rate relative to the best state-of-the-art performer. download:ftp://emmapupildata@messor.informatik.unituebingen. de (password:eyedata).
