On Contact Graphs with Cubes and Proportional Boxes

We study two variants of the problem of contact representation of planar graphs with axis-aligned boxes. In a cube-contact representation we realize each vertex with a cube, while in a proportional box-contact representation each vertex is an axis-aligned box with a prespecified volume. We present algorithms for constructing cube-contact representation and proportional box-contact representation for several classes of planar graphs.
