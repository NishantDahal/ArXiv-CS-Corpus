Generation and Analysis of Constrained Random Sampling Patterns

Random sampling is a technique for signal acquisition which is gaining popularity in practical signal processing systems. Nowadays, event-driven analog-to-digital converters make random sampling feasible in practical applications. A process of random sampling is defined by a sampling pattern, which indicates signal sampling points in time. Practical random sampling patterns are constrained by ADC characteristics and application requirements. In this paper authors introduce statistical methods which evaluate random sampling pattern generators with emphasis on practical applications. Furthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes with strict practical limitations imposed on patterns, with possibly minimal loss in randomness of sampling. The proposed generator is compared with existing sampling pattern generators using the introduced statistical methods. It is shown that the proposed algorithm generates random sampling patterns dedicated for event-driven-ADCs better than existed sampling pattern generators. Finally, implementation issues of random sampling patterns are discussed.
