New DNA Cyclic Codes over Rings

This paper is dealing with DNA cyclic codes which play an important role in DNA computing and have attracted a particular attention in the literature. Firstly, we introduce a new family of DNA cyclic codes over the ring $R=\mathbb{F}_2[u]/(u^6)$. Such codes have theoretical advantages as well as several applications in DNA computing. A direct link between the elements of such a ring and the $64$ codons used in the amino acids of the living organisms is established. Such a correspondence allows us to extend the notion of the edit distance to the ring $R$ which is useful for the correction of the insertion, deletion and substitution errors. Next, we define the Lee weight, the Gray map over the ring $R$ as well as the binary image of the cyclic DNA codes allowing the transfer of studying DNA codes into studying binary codes. Secondly, we introduce another new family of DNA skew cyclic codes constructed over the ring $\tilde {R}=\mathbb{F}_2+v\mathbb{F}_2=\{0,1,v,v+1\}$ where $v^2=v$ and study their property of being reverse-complement. We show that the obtained code is derived from the cyclic reverse-complement code over the ring $\tilde {R}$. We shall provide the binary images and present some explicit examples of such codes.
