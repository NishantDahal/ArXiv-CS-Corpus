Compressed sensing with combinatorial designs: theory and simulations

In 'An asymptotic result on compressed sensing matrices', a new construction for compressed sensing matrices using combinatorial design theory was introduced. In this paper, we use deterministic and probabilistic methods to analyse the performance of matrices obtained from this construction. We provide new theoretical results and detailed simulations. These simulations indicate that the construction is competitive with Gaussian random matrices, and that recovery is tolerant to noise. A new recovery algorithm tailored to the construction is also given.
