A linear-time algorithm for the geodesic center of a simple polygon

Given two points in a simple polygon $P$ of $n$ vertices, its geodesic distance is the length of the shortest path that connects them among all paths that stay within $P$. The geodesic center of $P$ is the unique point in $P$ that minimizes the largest geodesic distance to all other points of $P$. In 1989, Pollack, Sharir and Rote [Disc. \& Comput. Geom. 89] showed an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm that computes the geodesic center of $P$. Since then, a longstanding question has been whether this running time can be improved (explicitly posed by Mitchell [Handbook of Computational Geometry, 2000]). In this paper we affirmatively answer this question and present a linear time algorithm to solve this problem.
