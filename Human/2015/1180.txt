New HSL Distance Based Colour Clustering Algorithm

In this paper, we define a distance for the HSL colour system. Next, the proposed distance is used for a fuzzy colour clustering algorithm construction. The presented algorithm is related to the well-known fuzzy c-means algorithm. Finally, the clustering algorithm is used as colour reduction method. The obtained experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
