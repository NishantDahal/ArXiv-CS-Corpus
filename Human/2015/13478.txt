Multi-Cloud Resource Provisioning with Aneka: A Unified and Integrated Utilisation of Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2 Instances

Many vendors are offering computing services on subscription basis via Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model. Users can acquire resources from different providers and get the best of each of them to run their applications. However, deploying applications in multi-cloud environments is a complex task. Therefore, application platforms are needed to help developers to succeed. Aneka is one such platform that supports developers to program and deploy distributed applications in multi-cloud environments. It can be used to provision resources from different cloud providers and can be configured to request resources dynamically according to the needs of specific applications. This paper presents extensions incorporated in Aneka to support the deployment of applications in multi-cloud environments. The first extension shows the flexibility of Aneka architecture to add cloud providers. Specifically, we describe the addition of Microsoft Azure IaaS cloud provider. We also discuss the inclusion of public IPs to communicate resources located in different networks and the functionality of using PowerShell to automatize installation of Aneka on remote resources. We demonstrate how an application composed of independent tasks improves its total execution time when it is deployed in the multi-cloud environment created by Aneka using resources provisioned from Azure and EC2.
