Dominance and Deficiency for Petri Nets and Chemical Reaction Networks

Inspired by Anderson et al. [J. R. Soc. Interface, 2014] we study the long-term behavior of discrete chemical reaction networks (CRNs). In particular, using techniques from both Petri net theory and CRN theory, we provide a powerful sufficient condition for a structurally-bounded CRN to have the property that none of the non-terminal reactions can fire for all its recurrent configurations. We compare this result and its proof with a related result of Anderson et al. and show its consequences for the case of CRNs with deficiency one.
