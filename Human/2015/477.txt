Blind identification of an unknown interleaved convolutional code

We give here an efficient method to reconstruct the block interleaver and recover the convolutional code when several noisy interleaved codewords are given. We reconstruct the block interleaver without assumption on its structure. By running some experimental tests we show the efficiency of this method even with moderate noise.
