ELDA: Towards Efficient and Lightweight Detection of Cache Pollution Attacks in NDN

As a promising architectural design for future Internet, named data networking (NDN) relies on in-network caching to efficiently deliver name-based content. However, the in-network caching is vulnerable to cache pollution attacks (CPA), which can reduce cache hits by violating cache locality and significantly degrade the overall performance of NDN. To defend against CPA attacks, the most effective way is to first detect the attacks and then throttle them. Since the CPA attack itself has already imposed a huge burden on victims, to avoid exhausting the remaining resources on the victims for detection purpose, we expect a lightweight detection solution. We thus propose ELDA, an Efficient and Lightweight Detection scheme against cache pollution Attacks, in which we design a Lightweight Flajolet-Martin (LFM) sketch to monitor the interest traffic. Our analysis and simulations demonstrate that, by consuming a few computation and memory resources, ELDA can effectively and efficiently detect CPA attacks.
