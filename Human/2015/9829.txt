Image tag completion by local learning

The problem of tag completion is to learn the missing tags of an image. In this paper, we propose to learn a tag scoring vector for each image by local linear learning. A local linear function is used in the neighborhood of each image to predict the tag scoring vectors of its neighboring images. We construct a unified objective function for the learning of both tag scoring vectors and local linear function parame- ters. In the objective, we impose the learned tag scoring vectors to be consistent with the known associations to the tags of each image, and also minimize the prediction error of each local linear function, while reducing the complexity of each local function. The objective function is optimized by an alternate optimization strategy and gradient descent methods in an iterative algorithm. We compare the proposed algorithm against different state-of-the-art tag completion methods, and the results show its advantages.
