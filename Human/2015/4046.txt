From End-User's Requirements to Web Services Retrieval: A Semantic and Intention-Driven Approach

In this paper, we present SATIS, a framework to derive Web Service specifications from end-user's requirements in order to opera-tionalise business processes in the context of a specific application domain. The aim of SATIS is to provide to neuroscientists, which are not familiar with computer science, a complete solution to easily find a set of Web Services to implement an image processing pipeline. More precisely, our framework offers the capability to capture high-level end-user's requirements in an iterative and incremental way and to turn them into queries to retrieve Web Services description. The whole framework relies on reusable and combinable elements which can be shared out by a community of users sharing some interest or problems for a given topic. In our approach, we adopt Web semantic languages and models as a unified framework to deal with end-user's requirements and Web Service descriptions in order to take advantage of their reasoning and traceability capabilities.
