Statistical Channel Model with Multi-Frequency and Arbitrary Antenna Beamwidth for Millimeter-Wave Outdoor Communications

This paper presents a 3-dimensional millimeter-wave statistical channel impulse response model from 28 GHz and 73 GHz ultrawideband propagation measurements. An accurate 3GPP-like channel model that supports arbitrary carrier frequency, RF bandwidth, and antenna beamwidth (for both omnidirectional and arbitrary directional antennas), is provided. Time cluster and spatial lobe model parameters are extracted from empirical distributions from field measurements. A step-by-step modeling procedure for generating channel coefficients is shown to agree with statistics from the field measurements, thus confirming that the statistical channel model faithfully recreates spatial and temporal channel impulse responses for use in millimeter-wave 5G air interface designs.
