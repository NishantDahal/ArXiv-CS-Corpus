Exploring Green Interference Power for Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in the MISO Downlink

In this paper we propose a power-efficient transfer of information and energy, where we exploit the constructive part of wireless interference as a source of green useful signal power. Rather than suppressing interference as in conventional schemes, we take advantage of constructive interference among users, inherent in the downlink, as a source of both useful information and wireless energy. Specifically, we propose a new precoding design that minimizes the transmit power while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) and energy harvesting constraints for generic phase shift keying modulated signals. The QoS constraints are modified to accommodate constructive interference. We derive a sub-optimal solution and a local optimum solution to the precoding optimization problem. The proposed precoding reduces the transmit power compared to conventional schemes, by adapting the constraints to accommodate constructive interference as a source of useful signal power. Our simulation results show significant power savings with the proposed data-aided precoding compared to the conventional precoding.
