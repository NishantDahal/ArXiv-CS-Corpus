Proceedings Tenth International Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science

This volume contains the proceedings of the Tenth International Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science (FICS 2015) which took place on September 11th and 12th, 2015 in Berlin, Germany, as a satellite event of the conference Computer Science Logic (CSL 2015).
  Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science. They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and associated reasoning techniques. The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation of programming languages, logics, verification, databases. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their results to those members of the computer science and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed points.
  Each of the 11 contributed papers of this volume were evaluated by three or four reviewers. Some of the papers were re-reviewed after revision.
  Additionally, this volume contains the abstracts of the FICS 2015 invited talks given by Bartek Klin and James Worrell.
