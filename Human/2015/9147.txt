Preprint Virtual Reality GIS and Cloud Service Based Traffic Analysis Platform

This is the preprint version of our paper on The 23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics (Geoinformatics2015). City traffic data has several characteristics, such as large scale, diverse predictable and real-time, which falls in the range of definition of Big Data. This paper proposed a cloud service platform which targets for wise transportation is to carry out unified management and mining analysis of the huge number of the multivariate and heterogeneous dynamic transportation information, provides real-time transportation information, increase the utilization efficiency of transportation, promote transportation management and service level of travel information and provide decision support of transportation management by virtual reality as visual.
