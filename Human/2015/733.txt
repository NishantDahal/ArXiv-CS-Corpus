Secure Transmission in Wireless Sensor Networks Data Using Linear Kolmogorov Watermarking Technique

In Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), All communications between different nodes are sent out in a broadcast fashion. These networks are used in a variety of applications including military, environmental, and smart spaces. Sensors are susceptible to various types of attack, such as data modification, data insertion and deletion, or even physical capture and sensor replacement. Hence security becomes important issue in WSNs. However given the fact that sensors are resources constrained, hence the traditional intensive security algorithms are not well suited for WSNs. This makes traditional security techniques, based on data encryption, not very suitable for WSNs. This paper proposes Linear Kolmogorov watermarking technique for secure data communication in WSNs. We provide a security analysis to show the robustness of the proposed techniques against various types of attacks. This technique is robust against data deletion, packet replication and Sybil attacks
