Proceedings 4th Workshop on Hybrid Autonomous Systems

The interest in autonomous systems is increasing both in industry and academia. Such systems must operate with limited human intervention in a changing environment and must be able to compensate for significant system failures without external intervention. The most appropriate models of autonomous systems can be found in the class of hybrid systems that interact with their environment. This workshop brings together researchers interested in all aspects of autonomy and resilience of hybrid systems.
