DGD Gallery: Storage, sharing, and publication of digital research data

We describe a project, called the "Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics Gallery", or DGD Gallery for short, whose goal is to store geometric data and to make it publicly available. The DGD Gallery offers an online web service for the storage, sharing, and publication of digital research data.
