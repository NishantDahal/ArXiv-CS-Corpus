An Approach to Complex Bayesian-optimal Approximate Message Passing

In this work we aim to solve the compressed sensing problem for the case of a complex unknown vector by utilizing the Bayesian-optimal structured signal approximate message passing (BOSSAMP) algorithm on the jointly sparse real and imaginary parts of the unknown. By introducing a latent activity variable, BOSSAMP separates the tasks of activity detection and value estimation to overcome the problem of detecting different supports in the real and imaginary parts. We complement the recovery algorithm by two novel support detection schemes that utilize the updated auxiliary variables of BOSSAMP. Simulations show the superiority of our proposed method against approximate message passing (AMP) and its Bayesian-optimal sibling (BAMP), both in mean squared error and support detection performance.
