Retrospective Interference Alignment for the MIMO Interference Broadcast Channel

The degrees of freedom (DoF) of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Interference Broadcast Channel (IBC) with 2 cells and 2 users per cell are investigated when only delayed channel state information is available at the transmitter side (delayed CSIT). Retrospective Interference Alignment has shown the benefits in terms of DoF of exploiting delayed CSIT for interference, broadcast and also for the IBC. However, previous works studying the IBC with delayed CSIT do not exploit the fact that the users of each cell are served by a common transmitter. This work presents a four-phase precoding strategy taking this into consideration. Assuming that transmitters and receivers are equipped with $M,N$ antennas, respectively, new DoF inner bounds are proposed, outperforming the existing ones for $ρ= \frac{M}{N} > 2.6413$.
