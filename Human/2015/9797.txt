Personalized QoS Prediction of Cloud Services via Learning Neighborhood-based Model

The explosion of cloud services on the Internet brings new challenges in service discovery and selection. Particularly, the demand for efficient quality-of-service (QoS) evaluation is becoming urgently strong. To address this issue, this paper proposes neighborhood-based approach for QoS prediction of cloud services by taking advantages of collaborative intelligence. Different from heuristic collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, we define a formal neighborhood-based prediction framework which allows an efficient global optimization scheme, and then exploit different baseline estimate component to improve predictive performance. To validate the proposed methods, a large-scale QoS-specific dataset which consists of invocation records from 339 service users on 5,825 web services on a world-scale distributed network is used. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned neighborhood-based models can overcome existing difficulties of heuristic collaborative filtering methods and achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art prediction methods.
