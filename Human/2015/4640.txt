MacWilliams Extension Theorem for MDS additive codes

The MacWilliams Extension Theorem states that each linear isometry of a linear code extends to a monomial map. Unlike the linear codes, in general, additive codes do not have the extension property. In this paper, an analogue of the extension theorem for additive codes in the case of additive MDS codes is proved. More precisely, it is shown that for almost all additive MDS codes their additive isometries extend to isometries of the ambient space.
