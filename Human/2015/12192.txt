Bit Error Rate Analysis of Cooperative Beamforming for Transmitting Individual Data Streams

Cooperative beamforming (CB) has been proposed as a special case of coordinated multi-point techniques in wireless communications. In wireless sensor networks, CB can enable low power communication by allowing a collection of sensor nodes to transmit data simultaneously to a distant fusion center in one hop. Besides the traditional CB approach where all nodes need to share and transmit the same data, a more recent technique allows each node to transmit its own data while still achieving the benefits of cooperation. However, the intricacies of varying beamforming gains in the direct sequence spread spectrum with binary frequency shift keying multiple access scheme used in this context need to be taken into account when evaluating the performance of this beamforming technique. In this paper, we take the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of this individual-data CB technique by proposing a best suited decoding scheme and analyzing its bit error rate (BER) performance over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Through analytical expressions and simulation results BER curves are drawn and the achieved performance improvement offered by the CB gain is quantified.
