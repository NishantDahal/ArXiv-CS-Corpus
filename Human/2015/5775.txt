A Database of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Codes

There has been much research on codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$, sometimes called quaternary codes, for over a decade. Yet, no database is available for best known quaternary codes. This work introduces a new database for quaternary codes. It also presents a new search algorithm called genetic code search (GCS), as well as new quaternary codes obtained by existing and new search methods.
