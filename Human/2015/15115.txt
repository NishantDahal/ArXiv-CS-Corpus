Serifos: Workload Consolidation and Load Balancing for SSD Based Cloud Storage Systems

Achieving high performance in virtualized data centers requires both deploying high throughput storage clusters, i.e. based on Solid State Disks (SSDs), as well as optimally consolidating the workloads across storage nodes. Nowadays, the only practical solution for cloud storage providers to offer guaranteed performance is to grossly over-provision the storage nodes. The current workload scheduling mechanisms used in production do not have the intelligence to optimally allocate block storage volumes based on the performance of SSDs. In this paper, we introduce Serifos, an autonomous performance modeling and load balancing system designed for SSD-based cloud storage. Serifos takes into account the characteristics of the SSD storage units and constructs hardware dependent workload consolidation models. Thus Serifos is able to predict the latency caused by workload interference and the average latency of concurrent workloads. Furthermore, Serifos leverages an I/O load balancing algorithm to dynamically balance the volumes across the cluster. Experimental results indicate that Serifos consolidation model is able to maintain the mean prediction error of around 10% for heterogeneous hardware. As a result of Serifos load balancing, we found that the variance and the maximum average latency are reduced by 82% and 52%, respectively. The supported Service Level Objectives (SLOs) on the testbed improve 43% on average latency, 32% on the maximum read and 63% on the maximum write latency.
