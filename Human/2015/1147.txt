Characterizing co-NL by a group action

In a recent paper, Girard proposes to use his recent construction of a geometry of interaction in the hyperfinite factor in an innovative way to characterize complexity classes. We begin by giving a detailed explanation of both the choices and the motivations of Girard's definitions. We then provide a complete proof that the complexity class co-NL can be characterized using this new approach. We introduce as a technical tool the non-deterministic pointer machine, a concrete model to computes algorithms.
