Dynamic texture and scene classification by transferring deep image features

Dynamic texture and scene classification are two fundamental problems in understanding natural video content. Extracting robust and effective features is a crucial step towards solving these problems. However the existing approaches suffer from the sensitivity to either varying illumination, or viewpoint changing, or even camera motion, and/or the lack of spatial information. Inspired by the success of deep structures in image classification, we attempt to leverage a deep structure to extract feature for dynamic texture and scene classification. To tackle with the challenges in training a deep structure, we propose to transfer some prior knowledge from image domain to video domain. To be specific, we propose to apply a well-trained Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) as a mid-level feature extractor to extract features from each frame, and then form a representation of a video by concatenating the first and the second order statistics over the mid-level features. We term this two-level feature extraction scheme as a Transferred ConvNet Feature (TCoF). Moreover we explore two different implementations of the TCoF scheme, i.e., the \textit{spatial} TCoF and the \textit{temporal} TCoF, in which the mean-removed frames and the difference between two adjacent frames are used as the inputs of the ConvNet, respectively. We evaluate systematically the proposed spatial TCoF and the temporal TCoF schemes on three benchmark data sets, including DynTex, YUPENN, and Maryland, and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields superior performance.
