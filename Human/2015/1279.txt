Open Source Remote Monitoring for Rural Solar Electrification Projects

Renewable energy systems are an increasingly popular way to generate electricity around the world. As wind and solar technologies gradually begin to supplant the use of fossil fuels as preferred means of energy production, new challenges are emerging which are unique to the experience of decentralized power generation. One such challenge is the development of effective monitoring technologies to relay diagnostic information from remote energy systems to data analysis centers. The ability to easily obtain, synthesize, and evaluate data pertaining to the behavior of a potentially vast number of individual power sources is of critical importance to the maintainability of the next generation of intelligent grid infrastructure. However, the application space of remote monitoring extends well beyond this. This paper details the development and implementation of an open-source monitoring framework for remote solar energy systems. The necessity for such a framework to be open is much better understood when considered through the lens of the theoretical potential for remote monitoring technologies in developing countries. The United States and other industrialized nations in the so-called 'first world' are likely to be slow to seriously adopt renewable energy on account of the massive investment and infrastructural changes required for its integration into the existing electrical grid. In countries where grid infrastructure is generally inadequate or nonexistent, this barrier is far less of a concern, and renewable energy technologies are viewed more as an enabling tool for progress than as a disruptive and expensive technological tangent. In this context as well, remote monitoring has a role to play.
