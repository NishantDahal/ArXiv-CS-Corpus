Proactive Push with Energy Harvesting Based Small Cells in Heterogeneous Networks

Motivated by the recent development of energy harvesting communications, and the trend of multimedia contents caching and push at the access edge and user terminals, this paper considers how to design an effective push mechanism of energy harvesting powered small-cell base stations (SBSs) in heterogeneous networks. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process by optimizing the push policy based on the battery energy, user request and content popularity state to maximize the service capability of SBSs. We extensively analyze the problem and propose an effective policy iteration algorithm to find the optimal policy. According to the numerical results, we find that the optimal policy reveals a state dependent threshold based structure. Besides, more than 50% performance gain is achieved by the optimal push policy compared with the non-push policy.
