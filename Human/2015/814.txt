Optimized Implementation of Memristor-Based Full Adder by Material Implication Logic

Recently memristor-based applications and circuits are receiving an increased attention. Furthermore, memristors are also applied in logic circuit design. Material implication logic is one of the main areas with memristors. In this paper an optimized memristor-based full adder design by material implication logic is presented. This design needs 27 memristors and less area in comparison with typical CMOS-based 8-bit full adders. Also the presented full adder needs only 184 computational steps which enhance former full adder design speed by 20 percent.
