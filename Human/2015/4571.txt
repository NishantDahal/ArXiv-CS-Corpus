Proceedings Tenth International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models

This volume contains the papers presented at the Tenth International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models (DCM) held in Vienna, Austria on 13th July 2014, as part of the Vienna Summer of Logic.
  Several new models of computation have emerged in the last years, and many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of programming languages, and new paradigms of software development.
  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their applications to the development of programming languages and systems.
