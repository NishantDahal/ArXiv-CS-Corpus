Approximate Message Passing-based Compressed Sensing Reconstruction with Generalized Elastic Net Prior

In this paper, we study the compressed sensing reconstruction problem with generalized elastic net prior (GENP), where a sparse signal is sampled via a noisy underdetermined linear observation system, and an additional initial estimation of the signal (the GENP) is available during the reconstruction. We first incorporate the GENP into the LASSO and the approximate message passing (AMP) frameworks, denoted by GENP-LASSO and GENP-AMP respectively. We then investigate the parameter selection, state evolution, and noise-sensitivity analysis of GENP-AMP. We show that, thanks to the GENP, there is no phase transition boundary in the proposed frameworks, i.e., the reconstruction error is bounded in the entire plane. The error is also smaller than those of the standard AMP and scalar denoising. A practical parameterless version of the GENP-AMP is also developed, which does not need to know the sparsity of the unknown signal and the variance of the GENP. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the proposed schemes.
