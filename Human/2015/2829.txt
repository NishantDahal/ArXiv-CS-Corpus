Design and Implementation of a GUI based Offline GIFT Tool to exchange data between different systems

Multiple Choice Questions or MCQs are very important for e-learning. Many MCQ Tools allow us to generate MCQs very easily. However, in most of the cases they are not portable. That means MCQs generated for one system cannot be used for other unless a common format is used. So, collaboration and/or up gradation becomes a time consuming tedious task. In this paper, we will examine how tool could be designed which can produce portable MCQs and that too generating in the laptop and/or desktop without any need for going online.
