Joint Tx/Rx Energy-Efficient Scheduling in Multi-Radio Networks: A Divide-and-Conque Approach

Most of the existing works on energy-efficient wireless communication systems only consider the transmitter (Tx) or the receiver (Rx) side power consumption but not both. Moreover, they often assume the static circuit power consumption. To be more practical, this paper considers the joint Tx and Rx power consumption in multiple-access radio networks, where the power model takes both the transmission power and the dynamic circuit power into account. We formulate the joint Tx and Rx energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem which is a combinatorial-type one due to the indicator function for scheduling users and activating radio links. The link EE and the user EE are then introduced which have the similar structure as the system EE. Their hierarchical relationships are exploited to tackle the problem using a divide-and-conquer approach, which is only of linear complexity. We further reveal that the static receiving power plays a critical role in the user scheduling. Finally, comprehensive numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for improving the system EE.
