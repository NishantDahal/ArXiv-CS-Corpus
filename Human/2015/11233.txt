Stochastic Geometry-Based Performance Bounds for Non-Fading and Rayleigh Fading Ad Hoc Networks

In this paper, we study the performance of non-fading and Rayleigh fading ad hoc networks. We first characterize the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) through the Laplace transform of the inverted SINR for non-fading channels. Since most communication systems are interference-limited, we also consider the case of negligible noise power, and derive the upper and lower bounds for the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution under both non-fading and fading cases. These bounds are of closed forms and thus more convenient for theoretical analysis. Based on these derivations, we obtain closed-form bounds for both the average Shannon and outage rates. We also leverage the above results to study partial fading ad-hoc systems. These results are useful for investigating and comparing fifth-generation communication systems, for example massive multi-antenna and small-cell networks as in our illustrative example.
