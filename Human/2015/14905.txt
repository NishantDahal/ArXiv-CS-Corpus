Improper Graceful and Odd-graceful Labellings of Graph Theory

In this paper we define some new labellings for trees, called the in-improper and out-improper odd-graceful labellings such that some trees labelled with the new labellings can induce graceful graphs having at least a cycle. We, next, apply the new labellings to construct large scale of graphs having improper graceful/odd-graceful labellings or having graceful/odd-graceful labellings.
