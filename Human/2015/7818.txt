Big Data Privacy in the Internet of Things Era

Over the last few years, we have seen a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, products and services, making their way into the industry's market-place. All such solution will capture a large amount of data pertaining to the environment, as well as their users. The objective of the IoT is to learn more and to serve better the system users. Some of these solutions may store the data locally on the devices ('things'), and others may store in the Cloud. The real value of collecting data comes through data processing and aggregation in large-scale where new knowledge can be extracted. However, such procedures can also lead to user privacy issues. This article discusses some of the main challenges of privacy in IoT, and opportunities for research and innovation. We also introduce some of the ongoing research efforts that address IoT privacy issues.
