Challenges and Considerations for Utilizing Burst Buffers in High-Performance Computing

As high-performance computing (HPC) moves into the exascale era, computer scientists and engineers must find innovative ways of transferring and processing unprecedented amounts of data. As the scale and complexity of the applications running on these machines increases, the cost of their interactions and data exchanges (in terms of latency, energy, runtime, etc.) can increase exponentially. In order to address I/O coordination and communication issues, computing vendors are developing an intermediate layer between compute nodes and the parallel file system composed of different types of memory (NVRAM, DRAM, SSD). These large scale memory appliances are being called 'burst buffers.' In this paper, we envision advanced memory at various levels of HPC hardware and derive potential use cases for how to take advantage of it. We then present the challenges and issues that arise when utilizing burst buffers in next-generation supercomputers and map the challenges to the use cases. Lastly, we discuss the emerging state-of-the-art burst buffer solutions that are expected to become available by the end of the year in new HPC systems and which use cases these implementations may satisfy.
