Fault Analysis Using Gegenbauer Multiresolution Analysis

This paper exploits the multiresolution analysis in the fault analysis on transmission lines. Faults were simulated using the ATP (Alternative Transient Program), considering signals at 128/cycle. A nonorthogonal multiresolution analysis was provided by Gegenbauer scaling and wavelet filters. In the cases where the signal reconstruction is not required, orthogonality may be immaterial. Gegenbauer filter banks are thereby offered in this paper as a tool for analyzing fault signals on transmission lines. Results are compared to those ones derived from a 4-coefficient Daubechies filter. The main advantages in favor of Gegenbauer filters are their smaller computational effort and their constant group delay, as they are symmetric filters.
