Bayes-Optimal Joint Channel-and-Data Estimation for Massive MIMO with Low-Precision ADCs

This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver with very low-precision analog-to-digital convertors (ADCs) with the goal of developing massive MIMO antenna systems that require minimal cost and power. Previous studies demonstrated that the training duration should be {\em relatively long} to obtain acceptable channel state information. To address this requirement, we adopt a joint channel-and-data (JCD) estimation method based on Bayes-optimal inference. This method yields minimal mean square errors with respect to the channels and payload data. We develop a Bayes-optimal JCD estimator using a recent technique based on approximate message passing. We then present an analytical framework to study the theoretical performance of the estimator in the large-system limit. Simulation results confirm our analytical results, which allow the efficient evaluation of the performance of quantized massive MIMO systems and provide insights into effective system design.
