$β$-skeletons for a set of line segments in $R^2$

$β$-skeletons are well-known neighborhood graphs for a set of points. We extend this notion to sets of line segments in the Euclidean plane and present algorithms computing such skeletons for the entire range of $β$ values. The main reason of such extension is the possibility to study $β$-skeletons for points moving along given line segments. We show that relations between $β$-skeletons for $β> 1$, $1$-skeleton (Gabriel Graph), and the Delaunay triangulation for sets of points hold also for sets of segments. We present algorithms for computing circle-based and lune-based $β$-skeletons. We describe an algorithm that for $β\geq 1$ computes the $β$-skeleton for a set $S$ of $n$ segments in the Euclidean plane in $O(n^2 α(n) \log n)$ time in the circle-based case and in $O(n^2 λ_4(n))$ in the lune-based one, where the construction relies on the Delaunay triangulation for $S$, $α$ is a functional inverse of Ackermann function and $λ_4(n)$ denotes the maximum possible length of a $(n,4)$ Davenport-Schinzel sequence. When $0 < β< 1$, the $β$-skeleton can be constructed in a $O(n^3 λ_4(n))$ time. In the special case of $β= 1$, which is a generalization of Gabriel Graph, the construction can be carried out in a $O(n \log n)$ time.
