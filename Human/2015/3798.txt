A Reconfigurable USAR Robot Designed for Traversing Complex 3D Terrain

The use of robotics in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) is growing steadily from their initial inception during the 2001 World Trade Centre incident. Despite years of progress, the core design of robots currently in use for USAR purposes has deviated little, favoring software and control development and optimization of the basic robot template to improve performance instead. Presented here is a novel design description of the Cricket, an advanced robot with a broader range of physical capabilities than traditional USAR robots. By incorporating the tracked structure of earlier robots, appreciated for energy efficiency and robustness, into a multi-limbed walking design, the Cricket enables the use of advanced locomotion techniques. The ability to climb over obstacles many times the height of the robot, ascend vertical shafts without the assistance of a tether, and traverse rough and near vertical terrain improves the Cricket's capability to successfully locate victims in confined spaces.
