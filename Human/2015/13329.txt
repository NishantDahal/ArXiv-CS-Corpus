Estimation of Monotone Treatment Effects in Network Experiments

Randomized experiments on social networks pose statistical challenges, due to the possibility of interference between units. We propose new methods for estimating attributable treatment effects in such settings. The methods do not require partial interference, but instead require an identifying assumption that is similar to requiring nonnegative treatment effects. Network or spatial information can be used to customize the test statistic; in principle, this can increase power without making assumptions on the data generating process.
