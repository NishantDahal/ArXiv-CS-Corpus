Strategy-proof Pricing Approach for Cloud Market

In this paper, we design and develop a pricing model applicable to strategy proof pricing. To provide an economic stability towards its consumers. The economic model we use is Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG). By this each service provider has to provide a true cost of its services in the cloud market. For the selection of suitable service for the consumer we adopt a dynamic programing based algorithm and VCG is used to calculate the payment. Strategy proof pricing offers a unique cloud pricing service that takes the complexity out of traditional pricing and enables cloud providers to price accurately, consistently and competitively
