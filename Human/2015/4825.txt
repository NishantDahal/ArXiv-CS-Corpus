Distributed Hierarchical Control versus an Economic Model for Cloud Resource Management

We investigate a hierarchically organized cloud infrastructure and compare distributed hierarchical control based on resource monitoring with market mechanisms for resource management. The latter do not require a model of the system, incur a low overhead, are robust, and satisfy several other desiderates of autonomic computing. We introduce several performance measures and report on simulation studies which show that a straightforward bidding scheme supports an effective admission control mechanism, while reducing the communication complexity by several orders of magnitude and also increasing the acceptance rate compared to hierarchical control and monitoring mechanisms. Resource management based on market-based mechanisms can be seen as an intermediate step towards cloud self-organization, an ideal alternative to current mechanisms for cloud resource management.
