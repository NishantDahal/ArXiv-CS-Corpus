Improved Multiple Feedback Successive Interference Cancellation Algorithm for Near-Optimal MIMO Detection

In this article, we propose an improved multiple feedback successive interference cancellation (IMF-SIC) algorithm for symbol vector detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) spatial multiplexing systems. The multiple feedback (MF) strategy in successive interference cancellation (SIC) is based on the concept of shadow area constraint (SAC) where, if the decision falls in the shadow region multiple neighboring constellation points will be used in the decision feedback loop followed by the conventional SIC. The best candidate symbol from multiple neighboring symbols is selected using the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria. However, while deciding the best symbol from multiple neighboring symbols, the SAC condition may occur in subsequent layers which results in inaccurate decision. In order to overcome this limitation, in the proposed algorithm, SAC criteria is checked recursively for each layer. This results in successful mitigation of error propagation thus significantly improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. Further, we also propose an ordered IMF-SIC (OIMF-SIC) where we use log likelihood ratio (LLR) based dynamic ordering of the detection sequence. In OIMF-SIC, we use the term dynamic ordering in the sense that the detection order is updated after every successful decision. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing detectors such as conventional SIC and MF-SIC in terms of BER, and achieves a near ML performance.
