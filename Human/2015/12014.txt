Analyzing Traffic Problem Model With Graph Theory Algorithms

This paper will contribute to a practical problem, Urban Traffic. We will investigate those features, try to simplify the complexity and formulize this dynamic system. These contents mainly contain how to analyze a decision problem with combinatorial method and graph theory algorithms; how to optimize our strategy to gain a feasible solution through employing other principles of Computer Science.
