DNA Cyclic Codes Over The Ring $ \F_2[u,v]/\langle u^2-1,v^3-v,uv-vu \rangle$

In this paper, we mainly study the some structure of cyclic DNA codes of odd length over the ring $R = \F_2[u,v]/\langle u^2-1,v^3-v,uv-vu \rangle$ which play an important role in DNA computing. We established a direct link between the element of ring $R$ and 64 codons by introducing a Gray map from $R$ to $R_1 = F_2 + uF_2, u^2 = 1$ where $R_1$ is the ring of four elements. The reverse constrain and the reverse-complement constraint codes over $R$ and $R_1$ are studied in this paper. Binary image of the cyclic codes over R also study. The paper concludes with some example on DNA codes obtained via gray map.
