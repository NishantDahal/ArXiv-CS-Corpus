Large-Scale MIMO Relaying Techniques for Physical Layer Security: AF or DF?

In this paper, we consider a large scale multiple input multiple output (LS-MIMO) relaying system, where an information source sends the message to its intended destination aided by an LS-MIMO relay, while a passive eavesdropper tries to intercept the information forwarded by the relay. The advantage of a large scale antenna array is exploited to improve spectral efficiency and enhance wireless security. In particular, the challenging issue incurred by short-distance interception is well addressed. Under very practical assumptions, i.e., no eavesdropper channel state information (CSI) and imperfect legitimate CSI at the relay, this paper gives a thorough secrecy performance analysis and comparison of two classic relaying techniques, i.e., amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). Furthermore, asymptotical analysis is carried out to provide clear insights on the secrecy performance for such an LS-MIMO relaying system. We show that under large transmit powers, AF is a better choice than DF from the perspectives of both secrecy performance and implementation complexity, and prove that there exits an optimal transmit power at medium regime that maximizes the secrecy outage capacity.
