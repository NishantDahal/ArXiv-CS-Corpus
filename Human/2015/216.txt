Sliding window-based Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA

Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) and its burst degree optimizations (CRDSA++, IRSA) make use of MAC burst repetitions and Interference Cancellation (IC) making possible to reach throughput values as high as $T \simeq 0.8$ in practical implementations, whereas for the traditional slotted ALOHA $T \simeq 0.37$. However, these new techniques introduce a frame-based access to the channel that limits the performance in terms of throughput and packet delivery delay. In this paper, a new technique named Sliding Window CRDSA (SW-CRDSA) and its counterpart for irregular repetitions (SW-IRSA) are introduced in order to exploit the advantages of MAC burst repetition and Interference Cancellation (IC) with an unframed access scheme. Numerical results are also provided in order to validate the statement of better performance.
