A Novel Compressed Sensing Scheme for Photoacoustic Tomography

Speeding up the data acquisition is one of the central aims to advance tomographic imaging. On the one hand, this reduces motion artifacts due to undesired movements, and on the other hand this decreases the examination time for the patient. In this article, we propose a new scheme for speeding up the data collection process in photoacoustic tomography. Our proposal is based on compressed sensing and reduces acquisition time and system costs while maintaining image quality. As measurement data we use random combinations of pressure values that we use to recover a complete set of pressure data prior to the actual image reconstruction. We obtain theoretical recovery guarantees for our compressed sensing scheme and support the theory by reconstruction results on simulated data as well as on experimental data.
