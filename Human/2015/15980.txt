Asymptotic Behavior of Minimal-Exploration Allocation Policies: Almost Sure, Arbitrarily Slow Growing Regret

The purpose of this paper is to provide further understanding into the structure of the sequential allocation ("stochastic multi-armed bandit", or MAB) problem by establishing probability one finite horizon bounds and convergence rates for the sample (or "pseudo") regret associated with two simple classes of allocation policies $Ï€$.
  For any slowly increasing function $g$, subject to mild regularity constraints, we construct two policies (the $g$-Forcing, and the $g$-Inflated Sample Mean) that achieve a measure of regret of order $ O(g(n))$ almost surely as $n \to \infty$, bound from above and below. Additionally, almost sure upper and lower bounds on the remainder term are established. In the constructions herein, the function $g$ effectively controls the "exploration" of the classical "exploration/exploitation" tradeoff.
