Stress Testing the Booters: Understanding and Undermining the Business of DDoS Services

DDoS-for-hire services, also known as booters, have commoditized DDoS attacks and enabled abusive subscribers of these services to cheaply extort, harass and intimidate businesses and people by knocking them offline. However, due to the underground nature of these booters, little is known about their underlying technical and business structure. In this paper we empirically measure many facets of their technical and payment infrastructure. We also perform an analysis of leaked and scraped data from three major booters---Asylum Stresser, Lizard Stresser and VDO---which provides us with an in-depth view of their customers and victims. Finally, we conduct a large-scale payment intervention in collaboration with PayPal and evaluate its effectiveness. Based on our analysis we show that these services are responsible for hundreds of thousands of DDoS attacks and identify potentially promising methods of increasing booters' costs and undermining these services.
