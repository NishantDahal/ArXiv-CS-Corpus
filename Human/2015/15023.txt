Galois Self-Dual Constacyclic Codes

Generalizing Euclidean inner product and Hermitian inner product, we introduce Galois inner products, and study the Galois self-dual constacyclic codes in a very general setting by a uniform method. The conditions for existence of Galois self-dual and isometrically Galois self-dual constacyclic codes are obtained. As consequences, the results on self-dual, iso-dual and Hermitian self-dual constacyclic codes are derived.
