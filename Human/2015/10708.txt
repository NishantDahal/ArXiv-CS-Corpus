Expected-Delay-Summing Weak Bisimilarity for Markov Automata

A new weak bisimulation semantics is defined for Markov automata that, in addition to abstracting from internal actions, sums up the expected values of consecutive exponentially distributed delays possibly intertwined with internal actions. The resulting equivalence is shown to be a congruence with respect to parallel composition for Markov automata. Moreover, it turns out to be comparable with weak bisimilarity for timed labeled transition systems, thus constituting a step towards reconciling the semantics for stochastic time and deterministic time.
