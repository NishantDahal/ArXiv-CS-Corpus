Composing vibrotactile music: A multisensory experience with the Emoti-chair

The Emoti-Chair is a novel technology to enhance entertainment through vibrotactile stimulation. We assessed the experience of this technology in two workshops. In the first workshop, deaf film-makers experimented with creating vibetracks for a movie clip using a professional movie editing software. In the second workshop, trained opera singers sang and felt their voice through the Emoti-Chair. Participants in both workshops generally found the overall experience to be exciting and they were motivated to use the Chair for upcoming projects.
