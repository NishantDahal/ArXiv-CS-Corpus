Burning graphs - a probabilistic perspective

In this paper, we study a graph parameter that was recently introduced, the burning number, focusing on a few probabilistic aspects of the problem. The original burning number is revisited and analyzed for binomial random graphs G(n,p), random geometric graphs, and the Cartesian product of paths. Moreover, new variants of the burning number are introduced in which a burning sequence of vertices is selected according to some probabilistic rules. We analyze these new graph parameters for paths.
