Interactive Museum Exhibits with Microcontrollers: A Use-Case Scenario

The feasibility of using microcontrollers in real life applications is becoming more widespread. These applications have grown from do-it-yourself (DIY) projects of computer enthusiasts or robotics projects to larger scale efforts and deployments. This project developed and deployed a prototype application that allows the public to interact with features of a model and view videos from a first-person perspective on the train. Through testing the microcontrollers and their usage in a public setting, it was demonstrated that interactive features could be implemented in model train exhibits, which are featured in traditional museum environments that lack technical infrastructure. Specifically, the Arduino and Raspberry Pi provide the necessary linkages between the Internet and hardware, allowing for a greater interactive experience for museum visitors. These results provide an important use-case scenario that cultural heritage institutions can utilize when implementing microcontrollers on a larger scale, for the purpose of increasing visitors experience through greater interaction and engagement.
