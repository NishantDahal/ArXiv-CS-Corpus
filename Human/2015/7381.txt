Software Carpentry get more done in less time

The aim of this study was to investigate if participants of Software Carpentry (SC) get more done in less time. We asked 32 questions to assess 24 former participants to analyse if SC gave them the computing skills to accomplish this. Our research shows that time was already saved during the workshop as it could shorten the learning process of new skills. A majority of participants were able to use these new skills straight away and thus could speed up their day to day work.
