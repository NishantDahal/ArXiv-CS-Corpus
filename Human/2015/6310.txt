CDStore: Toward Reliable, Secure, and Cost-Efficient Cloud Storage via Convergent Dispersal

We present CDStore, which disperses users' backup data across multiple clouds and provides a unified multi-cloud storage solution with reliability, security, and cost-efficiency guarantees. CDStore builds on an augmented secret sharing scheme called convergent dispersal, which supports deduplication by using deterministic content-derived hashes as inputs to secret sharing. We present the design of CDStore, and in particular, describe how it combines convergent dispersal with two-stage deduplication to achieve both bandwidth and storage savings and be robust against side-channel attacks. We evaluate the performance of our CDStore prototype using real-world workloads on LAN and commercial cloud testbeds. Our cost analysis also demonstrates that CDStore achieves a monetary cost saving of 70% over a baseline cloud storage solution using state-of-the-art secret sharing.
