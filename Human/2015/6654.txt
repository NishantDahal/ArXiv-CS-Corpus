Evolution of as-a-Service Era in Cloud

Today, a paradigm shift is being observed in science, where the focus is gradually shifting toward the cloud environments to obtain appropriate, robust and affordable services to deal with Big Data challenges (Sharma et al. 2014, 2015a, 2015b). Cloud computing avoids any need to locally maintain the overly scaled computing infrastructure that include not only dedicated space, but the expensive hardware and software also. In this paper, we study the evolution of as-a-Service modalities, stimulated by cloud computing, and explore the most complete inventory of new members beyond traditional cloud computing stack.
