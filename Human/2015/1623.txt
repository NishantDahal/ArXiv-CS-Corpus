Optimal cyclic codes with generalized Niho type zeroes and the weight distribution

In this paper we extend the works \cite{gegeng2,XLZD} further in two directions and compute the weight distribution of these cyclic codes under more relaxed conditions. It is interesting to note that many cyclic codes in the family are optimal and have only a few non-zero weights. Besides using similar ideas from \cite{gegeng2,XLZD}, we carry out some subtle manipulation of certain exponential sums.
