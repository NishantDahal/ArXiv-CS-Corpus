Encoding CSP into CCS (Extended Version)

We study encodings from CSP into asynchronous CCS with name passing and matching, so in fact, the asynchronous pi-calculus. By doing so, we discuss two different ways to map the multi-way synchronisation mechanism of CSP into the two-way synchronisation mechanism of CCS. Both encodings satisfy the criteria of Gorla except for compositionality, as both use an additional top-level context. Following the work of Parrow and Sj√∂din, the first encoding uses a central coordinator and establishes a variant of weak bisimilarity between source terms and their translations. The second encoding is decentralised, and thus more efficient, but ensures only a form of coupled similarity between source terms and their translations.
