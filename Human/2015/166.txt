Average power limitations in Sliding Window Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha

Recently a new Random Access technique based on Aloha and using Interference Cancellation (IC) named Sliding Window Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha (SW-CRDSA) has been introduced. Differently from classic CRDSA that operates grouping slots in frames, this technique operates in an unframed manner yielding to better throughput results and smaller average packet delay with respect to frame-based CRDSA. However as classic CRDSA also SW-CRDSA relies on multiple transmission of the same packet. While this can be acceptable in systems where the only limit resides in the peak transmission power, it could represent a problem when constraints on the average power (e.g. at the transponder of a satellite system) are present. In this paper, a comparison in terms of normalized efficiency is carried out between Slotted Aloha and the two CRDSA techniques.
