A channel under simultaneous jamming and eavesdropping attack---correlated random coding capacities under strong secrecy criteria

We give a complete characterization of the correlated random coding secrecy capacity of arbitrarily varying wiretap channels (AVWCs). We apply two alternative strong secrecy criteria, which both lead to the same multi-letter formula. The difference of these criteria lies in the treatment of correlated randomness, they coincide in the case of uncorrelated codes. On the basis of the derived formula, we show that the correlated random coding secrecy capacity is continuous as a function of the AVWC, in contrast to the discontinuous uncorrelated coding secrecy capacity. In the proof of the secrecy capacity formula for correlated random codes, we apply an auxiliary channel which is compound from the sender to the intended receiver and arbitrarily varying from the sender to the eavesdropper.
