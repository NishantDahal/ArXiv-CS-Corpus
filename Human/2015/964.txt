On the physical and circuit-theoretic significance of the Memristor

It is noticed that the inductive and capacitive features of the memristor reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very presence in the resistive characteristic v = f(i) of the voltage and current state variables, associated by their electrodynamics sense with electrical and magnetic fields, forces any resister to cause to accumulate some magnetic and electrostatic fields and energies around itself. The present version is strongly extended in the sense of the circuit theory discussion.
