Hardware Impairments Aware Transceiver for Full-Duplex Massive MIMO Relaying

This paper studies the massive MIMO full-duplex relaying (MM-FDR), where multiple source-destination pairs communicate simultaneously with the help of a common full-duplex relay equipped with very large antenna arrays. Different from the traditional MM-FDR protocol, a general model where sources/destinations are allowed to equip with multiple antennas is considered. In contrast to the conventional MIMO system, massive MIMO must be built with low-cost components which are prone to hardware impairments. In this paper, the effect of hardware impairments is taken into consideration, and is modeled using transmit/receive distortion noises. We propose a low complexity hardware impairments aware transceiver scheme (named as HIA scheme) to mitigate the distortion noises by exploiting the statistical knowledge of channels and antenna arrays at sources and destinations. A joint degree of freedom and power optimization algorithm is presented to further optimize the spectral efficiency of HIA based MM-FDR. The results show that the HIA scheme can mitigate the "ceiling effect" appears in traditional MM-FDR protocol, if the numbers of antennas at sources and destinations can scale with that at the relay.
