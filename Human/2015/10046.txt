A Counter-Example to the Mismatched Decoding Converse for Binary-Input Discrete Memoryless Channels

This paper studies the mismatched decoding problem for binary-input discrete memoryless channels. An example is provided for which an achievable rate based on superposition coding exceeds the LM rate (Hui, 1983; Csiszár-Körner, 1981), thus providing a counter-example to a previously reported converse result (Balakirsky, 1995). Both numerical evaluations and theoretical results are used in establishing this claim.
