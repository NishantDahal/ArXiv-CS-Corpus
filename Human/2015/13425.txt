Limits on the Capacity of In-Band Full Duplex Communication in Uplink Cellular Networks

Simultaneous co-channel transmission and reception, denoted as in-band full duplex (FD) communication, has been promoted as an attractive solution to improve the spectral efficiency of cellular networks. However, in addition to the self-interference problem, cross-mode interference (i.e., between uplink and downlink) imposes a major obstacle for the deployment of FD communication in cellular networks. More specifically, the downlink to uplink interference represents the performance bottleneck for FD operation due to the uplink limited transmission power and venerable operation when compared to the downlink counterpart. While the positive impact of FD communication to the downlink performance has been proved in the literature, its effect on the uplink transmission has been neglected. This paper focuses on the effect of downlink interference on the uplink transmission in FD cellular networks in order to see whether FD communication is beneficial for the uplink transmission or not, and if yes for which type of network. To quantify the expected performance gains, we derive a closed form expression of the maximum achievable uplink capacity in FD cellular networks. In contrast to the downlink capacity which always improves with FD communication, our results show that the uplink performance may improve or degrade depending on the associated network parameters. Particularly, we show that the intensity of base stations (BSs) has a more prominent effect on the uplink performance than their transmission power.
