Experimental Demonstration of Capacity Increase and Rate-Adaptation by Probabilistically Shaped 64-QAM

We implemented a flexible transmission system operating at adjustable data rate and fixed bandwidth, baudrate, constellation and overhead using probabilistic shaping. We demonstrated in a transmission experiment up to 15% capacity and 43% reach increase versus 200 Gbit/s 16-QAM.
