Intra-and-Inter-Constraint-based Video Enhancement based on Piecewise Tone Mapping

Video enhancement plays an important role in various video applications. In this paper, we propose a new intra-and-inter-constraint-based video enhancement approach aiming to 1) achieve high intra-frame quality of the entire picture where multiple region-of-interests (ROIs) can be adaptively and simultaneously enhanced, and 2) guarantee the inter-frame quality consistencies among video frames. We first analyze features from different ROIs and create a piecewise tone mapping curve for the entire frame such that the intra-frame quality of a frame can be enhanced. We further introduce new inter-frame constraints to improve the temporal quality consistency. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm obviously outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.
