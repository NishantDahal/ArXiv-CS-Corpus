Optimal Operator State Migration for Elastic Data Stream Processing

A cloud-based data stream management system (DSMS) handles fast data by utilizing the massively parallel processing capabilities of the underlying platform. An important property of such a DSMS is elasticity, meaning that nodes can be dynamically added to or removed from an application to match the latter's workload, which may fluctuate in an unpredictable manner. For an application involving stateful operations such as aggregates, the addition / removal of nodes necessitates the migration of operator states. Although the importance of migration has been recognized in existing systems, two key problems remain largely neglected, namely how to migrate and what to migrate, i.e., the migration mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead and result delay during migration, and the selection of the optimal task assignment that minimizes migration costs. Consequently, migration in current systems typically incurs a high spike in result delay caused by expensive synchronization barriers and suboptimal task assignments. Motivated by this, we present the first comprehensive study on efficient operator states migration, and propose designs and algorithms that enable live, progressive, and optimized migrations. Extensive experiments using real data justify our performance claims.
