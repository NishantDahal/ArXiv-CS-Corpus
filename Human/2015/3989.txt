Symmetric matrix inversion using modified Gaussian elimination

In this paper we present two different variants of method for symmetric matrix inversion, based on modified Gaussian elimination. Both methods avoid computation of square roots and have a reduced machine time's spending. Further, both of them can be used efficiently not only for positive (semi-) definite, but for any non-singular symmetric matrix inversion. We use simulation to verify results, which represented in this paper.
