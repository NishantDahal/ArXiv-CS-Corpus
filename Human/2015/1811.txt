Sub-optimality of the Han--Kobayashi Achievable Region for Interference Channels

Han-Kobayashi achievable region is the best known inner bound for a general discrete memoryless interference channel. We show that the capacity region can be strictly larger than the Han-Kobayashi region for some channel realizations, and hence the strict sub-optimality of Han-Kobayashi achievable region.
