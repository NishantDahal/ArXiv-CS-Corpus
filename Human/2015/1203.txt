A Note on the Rate Region of Exact-Repair Regenerating Codes

The rate region of the $(5,4,4)$ exact-repair regenerating codes is provided. The outer bound is obtained through extension of the computational approach developed in an earlier work, and this region is indeed achievable using the canonical layered codes. This result is part of the online collection of "Solutions of Computed Information Theoretic Limits (SCITL)".
