Development of a Big Data Framework for Connectomic Research

This paper outlines research and development of a new Hadoop-based architecture for distributed processing and analysis of electron microscopy of brains. We show development of a new C++ library for implementation of 3D image analysis techniques, and deployment in a distributed map/reduce framework. We demonstrate our new framework on a subset of the Kasthuri11 dataset from the Open Connectome Project.
