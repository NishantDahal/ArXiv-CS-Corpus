On the Convergence of Massive MIMO Systems

In this paper we examine convergence properties of massive MIMO systems with the aim of determining the number of antennas required for massive MIMO gains. We consider three characteristics of a channel matrix and study their asymptotic behaviour. Furthermore, we derive ZF SNR and MF SINR for a scenario of unequal receive powers. In our results we include the effects of spatial correlation. We show that the rate of convergence of channel metrics is much slower than that of the ZF/MF precoder properties.
