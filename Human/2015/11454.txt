Experimentation Procedure for Offloaded Mini-Apps Executed on Cluster Architectures with Xeon Phi Accelerators

A heterogeneous cluster architecture is complex. It contains hundreds, or thousands of devices connected by a tiered communication system in order to solve a problem. As a heterogeneous system, these devices will have varying performance capabilities. To better understand the interactions which occur between the various devices during execution, an experimentation procedure has been devised to capture, store, and analyze important and meaningful data. The procedure consists of various tools, techniques, and methods for capturing relevant timing, power, and performance data for a typical execution. This procedure currently applies to architectures with Intel Xeon processors and Intel Xeon Phi accelerators. It has been applied to the Co-Design Molecular Dynamics mini-app, courtesy of the ExMatEx team. This work aims to provide end-users with a strategy for investigating codes executed on heterogeneous cluster architectures with Xeon Phi accelerators.
