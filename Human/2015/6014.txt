Documentation Generator Focusing on Symbols for the HTML-ized Mizar Library

The purpose of this project is to collect symbol information in the Mizar Mathematical Library and manipulate it into practical and organized documentation. Inspired by the MathWiki project and API reference systems for computer programs, we developed a documentation generator focusing on symbols for the HTML-ized Mizar library. The system has several helpful features, including a symbol list, incremental search, and a referrer list. It targets those who use proof assistance systems, the volume of whose libraries has been rapidly increasing year by year.
