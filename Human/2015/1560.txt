The Hartley Transform in a Finite Field

The k-trigonometric functions over the Galois Field GF(q) are introduced and their main properties derived. This leads to the definition of the cask(.) function over GF(q), which in turn leads to a finite field Hartley Transform. The main properties of this new discrete transform are presented and areas for possible applications are mentioned.
