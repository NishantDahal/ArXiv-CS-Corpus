Sparse Time-Frequency decomposition for multiple signals with same frequencies

In this paper, we consider multiple signals sharing same instantaneous frequencies. This kind of data is very common in scientific and engineering problems. To take advantage of this special structure, we modify our data-driven time-frequency analysis by updating the instantaneous frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, based on the simultaneously sparsity approximation and fast Fourier transform, some efficient algorithms is developed. Since the information of multiple signals is used, this method is very robust to the perturbation of noise. And it is applicable to the general nonperiodic signals even with missing samples or outliers. Several synthetic and real signals are used to test this method. The performances of this method are very promising.
