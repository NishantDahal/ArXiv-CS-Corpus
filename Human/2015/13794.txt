RIP-like Properties in Subsampled Blind Deconvolution

We derive near optimal performance guarantees for subsampled blind deconvolution. Blind deconvolution is an ill-posed bilinear inverse problem and additional subsampling makes the problem even more challenging. Sparsity and spectral flatness priors on unknown signals are introduced to overcome these difficulties. While being crucial for deriving desired near optimal performance guarantees, unlike the sparsity prior with a nice union-of-subspaces structure, the spectral flatness prior corresponds to a nonconvex cone structure, which is not preserved by elementary set operations. This prohibits the operator arising in subsampled blind deconvolution from satisfying the standard restricted isometry property (RIP) at near optimal sample complexity, which motivated us to study other RIP-like properties. Combined with the performance guarantees derived using these RIP-like properties in a companion paper, we show that subsampled blind deconvolution is provably solved at near optimal sample complexity by a practical algorithm.
