Low Complexity Opportunistic Interference Alignment in $K$-Transmitter MIMO Interference Channels

In this paper, we propose low complexity opportunistic methods for interference alignment in $K$-transmitter MIMO interference channels by exploiting multiuser diversity. We do not assume availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters. Receivers are required to feed back analog values indicating the extent to which the received interference subspaces are aligned. The proposed opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) achieves sum-rate comparable to conventional OIA schemes but with a significantly reduced computational complexity.
