Author Evaluation Based on H-index and Citation Response

An accurate and fair assessment of the efficiency and impact of scientific work is, despite a lot of recent research effort, still an open problem. The measurement of quality and success of individual scientists and research groups can be approached from many different directions, none of which is universal. A reason for this is inherently different behavior of different scientists within the global research community. A complex evaluation of ones publication activities requires a careful consideration of a wide variety of factors. The well-known H-index is one of the most used bibliometric indices. Despite its many imperfections, its simplicity and ease of interpretation make it a popular scientometric method. This short paper uses the ideas behind the H-index ~to analyze communities of authors who cite publishing scientists. A new author evaluation measure named aH-index is proposed, and intuitive interpretations of its properties and semantics are presented. Preliminary experiments with authors with high H-index active in the area of computer science are presented to demonstrate the properties of the proposed measure.
