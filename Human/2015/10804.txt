Prediction of Brain States of Concentration and Relaxation in Real Time with Portable Electroencephalographs

In our research, we attempt to help people recognize their brain state of concentration or relaxation more conveniently and in real time. Considering the inconvenience of wearing traditional multiple electrode electroencephalographs, we choose Muse to collect data which is a portable headband launched lately with a number of useful functions and channels and it is much easier for the public to use. Besides, traditional online analysis did not focus on the synchronism between users and computers and the time delay problem did exist. To solve the problem, by building the Analytic Hierarchy Model, we choose the two gamma wave channels of F7 and F8 as the data source instead of using both beta and alpha channels traditionally.Using the Common Space Pattern algorithm and the Support Vector Machine model, the channels we choose have a higher recognition accuracy rate and smaller amount of data to be dealt with by the computer than the traditional ones. Furthermore, we make use of the Feedforward Neural Network Model to predict subjects'brain states in half a second. Finally, we design a plane program in Python where a plane can be controlled to go up or down when users concentrate or relax. The SVM model and the Feedforward Neural Network model have both been tested by 12 subjects and they give an evaluation ranging from 1 to 10 points. The former gets 7.58 points while the latter gets 8.83, which proves that the time delay problem is improved once more.
