Sampling of stochastic operators

We develop sampling methodology aimed at determining stochastic operators that satisfy a support size restriction on the autocorrelation of the operators stochastic spreading function. The data that we use to reconstruct the operator (or, in some cases only the autocorrelation of the spreading function) is based on the response of the unknown operator to a known, deterministic test signal.
