Threes!, Fives, 1024!, and 2048 are Hard

We analyze the computational complexity of the popular computer games Threes!, 1024!, 2048 and many of their variants. For most known versions expanded to an m x n board, we show that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given starting position can be played to reach a specific (constant) tile value.
