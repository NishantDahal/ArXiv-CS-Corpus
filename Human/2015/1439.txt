Noise-shaping Quantization Methods for Frame-based and Compressive Sampling Systems

Noise shaping refers to an analog-to-digital conversion methodology in which quantization error is arranged to lie mostly outside the signal spectrum by means of oversampling and feedback. Recently it has been successfully applied to more general redundant linear sampling and reconstruction systems associated with frames as well as non-linear systems associated with compressive sampling. This chapter reviews some of the recent progress in this subject.
