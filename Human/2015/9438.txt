GenASiS: General Astrophysical Simulation System. I. Refinable Mesh and Nonrelativistic Hydrodynamics

GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System) is a new code being developed initially and primarily, though by no means exclusively, for the simulation of core-collapse supernovae on the world's leading capability supercomputers. This paper---the first in a series---demonstrates a centrally refined coordinate patch suitable for gravitational collapse and documents methods for compressible nonrelativistic hydrodynamics. We benchmark the hydrodynamics capabilities of GenASiS against many standard test problems; the results illustrate the basic competence of our implementation, demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the HLLC relative to the HLL Riemann solver in a number of interesting cases, and provide preliminary indications of the code's ability to scale and to function with cell-by-cell fixed-mesh refinement.
