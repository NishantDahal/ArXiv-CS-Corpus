Differential Modulation Exploiting the Spatial-Temporal Correlation of Wireless Channels With Moving Antenna Array

Provisioning reliable wireless services for railway passengers is becoming an increasingly critical problem to be addressed with the fast development of high speed trains (HST). In this paper, exploiting the linear mobility inherent to the HST communication scenario, we discover a new type of spatial-temporal correlation between the base station and moving antenna array on the roof top of the train. Capitalizing on the new spatial-temporal correlation structure and properties, an improved differential space-time modulation (DSTM) scheme is proposed. Analytical expressions are obtained for the pairwise error probability of the system. It is demonstrated that, the proposed approach achieves superior error performance compared with the conventional DSTM scheme. In addition, an adaptive method which dynamically adjusts the transmission block length is proposed to further enhance the system performance. Numerical results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed schemes.
