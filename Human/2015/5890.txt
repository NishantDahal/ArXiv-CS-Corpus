An alternative proof for the constructive Asymmetric Lovász Local Lemma

We provide an alternative constructive proof of the Asymmetric Lovász Local Lemma. Our proof uses the classic algorithmic framework of Moser and the analysis introduced by Giotis, Kirousis, Psaromiligkos, and Thilikos in "On the algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma and acyclic edge coloring", combined with the work of Bender and Richmond on the multivariable Lagrange Inversion formula.
