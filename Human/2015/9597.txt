On the regularity of $\{\lfloor\log_b(αn+β)\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$

Let $α,β$ be real numbers and $b\geq2$ be an integer. Allouche and Shallit showed that the sequence $\{\lfloorαn+β\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$ is $b$-regular if and only if $α$ is rational. In this paper, using a base-independent regular language, we prove a similar result that the sequence $\{\lfloor\log_b(αn+β)\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$ is $b$-regular if and only if $α$ is rational. In particular, when $α=\sqrt{2},β=0$ and $b=2$, we answer the question of Allouche and Shallit that the sequence $\{\lfloor\frac{1}{2}+\log_2n\rfloor\}_{n\geq0}$ is not $2$-regular, which has been proved by Bell, Moshe and Rowland respectively.
