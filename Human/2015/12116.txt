A weakly universal cellular automaton on the pentagrid with three states

In this paper, we prove that there is a weakly universal cellular automaton on the pentagrid with three states which is rotation invariant and which uses Ã  la Moore neighbourhood. Moreover, at each step of the computation, the set of non quiescent states has always infinitely many cycles.
