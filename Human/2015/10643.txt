Cloud-Aware Web Service Security: Information Hiding in Cloud Computing

This study concerns the security challenges that the people face in the usage and implementation of cloud computing. Despite its growth in the past few decades, this platform has experienced different challenges. They all arise from the concern of data safety that the nature of sharing in the cloud presents. This paper looks to identify the benefits of using a cloud computing platform and the issue of information security. The paper also reviews the concept of information hiding and its relevance to the cloud. This technique has two ways about it that impact how people use cloud computing in their organizations and even for personal implementations. First it presents the potential to circulate harmful information and files that can adversely affect the data those users upload on those platforms. It is also the basis of the strategies such as steganalysis and cryptographic storage architecture that are essential for data security.
