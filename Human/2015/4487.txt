Time Critical Multitasking for Multicore Microcontroller using XMOS Kit

This paper presents the research work on multicore microcontrollers using parallel, and time critical programming for the embedded systems. Due to the high complexity and limitations, it is very hard to work on the application development phase on such architectures. The experimental results mentioned in the paper are based on xCORE multicore microcontroller form XMOS. The paper also imitates multi-tasking and parallel programming for the same platform. The tasks assigned to multiple cores are executed simultaneously, which saves the time and energy. The relative study for multicore processor and multicore controller concludes that micro architecture based controller having multiple cores illustrates better performance in time critical multi-tasking environment. The research work mentioned here not only illustrates the functionality of multicore microcontroller, but also express the novel technique of programming, profiling and optimization on such platforms in real time environments.
