Optimum Decoder for an Additive Video Watermarking with Laplacian Noise in H.264

In this paper, we investigate an additive video watermarking method in H.264 standard in presence of the Laplacian noise. In some applications, due to the loss of some pixels or a region of a frame, we resort to Laplacian noise rather than Gaussian one. The embedding is performed in the transform domain; while an optimum and a sub-optimum decoder are derived for the proposed Laplacian model. Simulation results show that the proposed watermarking scheme has suitable performance with enough transparency required for watermarking applications.
