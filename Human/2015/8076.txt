Compression for trace zero points on twisted Edwards curves

We propose two optimal representations for the elements of trace zero subgroups of twisted Edwards curves. For both representations, we provide efficient compression and decompression algorithms. The efficiency of the algorithm is compared with the efficiency of similar algorithms on elliptic curves in Weierstrass form.
