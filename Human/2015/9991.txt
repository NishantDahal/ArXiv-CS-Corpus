Cellular-Automata and Innovation within Indonesian Traditional Weaving Crafts: A Discourse of Human-Computer Interaction

The paper reports the possibility of Indonesian traditional artisans of weaving designs and crafts to explore the cellular automata, a dynamical model in computation that may yield similar patterns. The reviews of the cellular automata due to the perspective of weaving process reveals that the latter would focus on macro-properties, i.e.: the strength of structural construction beside the aesthetic patterns and designs. The meeting of traditional weaving practice and the computational model is delivered and open the door for interesting discourse of computer-aided designs for the traditional artists and designers to come.
