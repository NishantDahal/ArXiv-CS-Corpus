Tasks Scheduling Technique Using League Championship Algorithm for Makespan Minimization in IaaS Cloud

Makespan minimization in tasks scheduling of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud is an NP-hard problem. A number of techniques had been used in the past to optimize the makespan time of scheduled tasks in IaaS cloud, which is propotional to the execution cost billed to customers. In this paper, we proposed a League Championship Algorithm (LCA) based makespan time minimization scheduling technique in IaaS cloud. The LCA is a sports-inspired population based algorithmic framework for global optimization over a continuous search space. Three other existing algorithms that is, First Come First Served (FCFS), Last Job First (LJF) and Best Effort First (BEF) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. All algorithms under consideration assumed to be non-preemptive. The results obtained shows that, the LCA scheduling technique perform moderately better than the other algorithms in minimizing the makespan time of scheduled tasks in IaaS cloud.
