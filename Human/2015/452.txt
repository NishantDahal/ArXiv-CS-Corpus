The Storage-Repair-Bandwidth Trade-off of Exact Repair Linear Regenerating Codes for the Case $d = k = n-1$

In this paper, we consider the setting of exact repair linear regenerating codes. Under this setting, we derive a new outer bound on the storage-repair-bandwidth trade-off for the case when $d = k = n -1$, where $(n, k, d)$ are parameters of the regenerating code, with their usual meaning. Taken together with the achievability result of Tian et. al. [1], we show that the new outer bound derived here completely characterizes the trade-off for the case of exact repair linear regenerating codes, when $d = k = n -1$. The new outer bound is derived by analyzing the dual code of the linear regenerating code.
