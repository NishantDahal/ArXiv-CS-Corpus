Linearized Reed-Solomon codes and linearized Wenger graphs

A codeword is associated to a linearized polynomial. The weight distribution of the codewords is determined as the linearized polynomial varies in a family of fixed degree. There is a corresponding result on Wenger graphs from linearized polynomials.
