Growing the Digital Repository of Mathematical Formulae with Generic LaTeX Sources

One initial goal for the DRMF is to seed our digital compendium with fundamental orthogonal polynomial formulae. We had used the data from the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) as initial seed for our DRMF project. The DLMF input LaTeX source already contains some semantic information encoded using a highly customized set of semantic LaTeX macros. Those macros could be converted to content MathML using LaTeXML. During that conversion the semantics were translated to an implicit DLMF content dictionary. This year, we have developed a semantic enrichment process whose goal is to infer semantic information from generic LaTeX sources. The generated context-free semantic information is used to build DRMF formula home pages for each individual formula. We demonstrate this process using selected chapters from the book "Hypergeometric Orthogonal Polynomials and their $q$-Analogues" (2010) by Koekoek, Lesky and Swarttouw (KLS) as well as an actively maintained addendum to this book by Koornwinder (KLSadd). The generic input KLS and KLSadd LaTeX sources describe the printed representation of the formulae, but does not contain explicit semantic information. See http://drmf.wmflabs.org.
