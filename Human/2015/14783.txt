Mobility-Aware Uplink Interference Model for 5G Heterogeneous Networks

To meet the surging demand for throughput, 5G cellular networks need to be more heterogeneous and much denser, by deploying more and more small cells. In particular, the number of users in each small cell can change dramatically due to users' mobility, resulting in random and time varying uplink interference. This paper considers the uplink interference in a 5G heterogeneous network which is jointly covered by one macro cell and several small cells. Based on the Lévy flight moving model, a mobility-aware interference model is proposed to characterize the uplink interference from macro cell users to small cell users. In this model, the total uplink interference is characterized by its moment generating function, for both closed subscriber group (CSG) and open subscriber group (CSG) femto cells. In addition, the proposed interference model is a function of basic step length, which is a key velocity parameter of Lévy flights. It is shown by both theoretical analysis and simulation results that the proposed interference model provides a flexible way of evaluating the system performance in terms of success probability and average rate.
