Lattice Index Codes from Algebraic Number Fields

Broadcasting $K$ independent messages to multiple users where each user demands all the messages and has a subset of the messages as side information is studied. Recently, Natarajan, Hong, and Viterbo proposed a novel broadcasting strategy called lattice index coding which uses lattices constructed over some principal ideal domains (PIDs) for transmission and showed that this scheme provides uniform side information gains. In this paper, we generalize this strategy to general rings of algebraic integers of number fields which may not be PIDs. Upper and lower bounds on the side information gains for the proposed scheme constructed over some interesting classes of number fields are provided and are shown to coincide asymptotically in message rates. This generalization substantially enlarges the design space and partially includes the scheme by Natarajan, Hong, and Viterbo as a special case. Perhaps more importantly, in addition to side information gains, the proposed lattice index codes benefit from diversity gains inherent in constellations carved from number fields when used over Rayleigh fading channel. Some interesting examples are also provided for which the proposed scheme allows all the messages to be from the same field.
