Quantum Look at two Common Logics: the Logic of Primitive Thinking and the Logic of Everyday Human Reasoning

Based on ideas of quantum theory of open systems and psychological dual system theory we propose two novel versions of Non-Boolean logic. The first version can be interpreted in our opinion as simplified description of primitive (mythological) thinking and the second one as the toy model of everyday human reasoning in which aside from logical deduction, heuristic elements and beliefs also play the considerable role. Several arguments in favor of the interpretations proposed are adduced and discussed in the paper as well.
