Gradient Descent Algorithm Inspired Adaptive Time Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks

Our motivation in this paper is to take another step forward from complex and heavyweight synchronization protocols to the easy-to-implement and lightweight synchronization protocols in WSNs. To this end, we present GraDeS, a novel multi-hop time synchronization protocol based upon gradient descent algorithm. We give details about our implementation of GraDeS and present its experimental evaluation in our testbed of MICAz sensor nodes. Our observations indicate that GraDeS is scalable, it has identical memory and processing overhead, better convergence time and comparable synchronization performance as compared to existing lightweight solutions.
