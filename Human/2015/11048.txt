SignEPC : A Digital Signature Scheme for Efficient and Scalable Access Control in EPCglobal Network

The EPCglobal network is a computer network which allows supply chain companies to search for their unknown partners globally and share information stored in product RFID tags with each other. Although there have been quite a number of recent research works done to improve the security of EPCglobal Network, the existing access control solutions are not efficient and scalable. For instance, when a user queries Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) for EPC event information, the EPCIS would have to query the Electronic Product Code Discovery Service (EPCDS) to check the access rights of the user. This implementation is not efficient and creates a bottleneck at EPCDS. In this paper, we design and propose a digital signature scheme, SignEPC, as a more efficient and scalable access control solution for EPCglobal network. Our paper will also evaluate SignEPC by considering the various possible attacks that could be done on our proposed model
