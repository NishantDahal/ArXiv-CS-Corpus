Maximum lifetime problem in sensor networks with limited channel capacity

In the paper we analyze the maximum lifetime problem in sensor networks with limited channel capacity for multipoint-to-multipoint and broadcast data transmission services. We show, that in order to achieve an optimal data transmission regarding the maximum lifetime problem we cannot allow for any interference of signals. We propose a new Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio function and used is to modify the Shannon-Hartley channel capacity formula. For the modified channel capacity formula we solve the maximum lifetime problem in one dimensional regular sensor network $L_N$ for discussed data transmission services.
