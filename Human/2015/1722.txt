On the Potential of Bluetooth Low Energy Technology for Vehicular Applications

With the increasing number of sensors in modern vehicles, using an Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Network (IVWSN) is a possible solution for the automotive industry to address the potential issues that arise from additional wiring harness. Such a solution could help car manufacturers develop vehicles that have better fuel economy and performance, in addition to supporting new applications. However, which wireless technology for IVWSNs should be used for maximizing the aforementioned benefits is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose to use a new wireless technology known as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and highlight a new architecture for IVWSN. Based on a comprehensive study which encompasses an example application, it is shown that BLE is an excellent option that can be used in IVWSNs for certain applications mainly due to its good performance and low-power, low-complexity, and low-cost attributes.
