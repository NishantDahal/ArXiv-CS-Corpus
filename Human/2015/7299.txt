Optimal Rates of Convergence for Noisy Sparse Phase Retrieval via Thresholded Wirtinger Flow

This paper considers the noisy sparse phase retrieval problem: recovering a sparse signal $x \in \mathbb{R}^p$ from noisy quadratic measurements $y_j = (a_j' x )^2 + ε_j$, $j=1, \ldots, m$, with independent sub-exponential noise $ε_j$. The goals are to understand the effect of the sparsity of $x$ on the estimation precision and to construct a computationally feasible estimator to achieve the optimal rates. Inspired by the Wirtinger Flow [12] proposed for noiseless and non-sparse phase retrieval, a novel thresholded gradient descent algorithm is proposed and it is shown to adaptively achieve the minimax optimal rates of convergence over a wide range of sparsity levels when the $a_j$'s are independent standard Gaussian random vectors, provided that the sample size is sufficiently large compared to the sparsity of $x$.
