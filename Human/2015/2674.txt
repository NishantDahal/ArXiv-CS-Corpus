Dynamic Power Splitting Policies for AF Relay Networks with Wireless Energy Harvesting

Wireless energy harvesting (WEH) provides an exciting way to supply energy for relay nodes to forward information for the source-destination pairs. In this paper, we investigate the problem on how the relay node dynamically adjusts the power splitting ratio of information transmission (IT) and energy harvesting (EH) in order to achieve the optimal outage performance. According to the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the relay, optimal dynamic power splitting policy with full CSI and partial CSI are both provided. Finally, through simulations, the proposed power splitting policies can improve the outage performances and the policy with full CSI achieves the best performance. It is also shown that the policy with partial CSI can approach the policy with full CSI closely and incurs far less system overhead.
