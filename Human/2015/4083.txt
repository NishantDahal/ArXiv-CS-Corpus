A new generation of science overlay maps with an application to the history of biosystematics

The paper proposes a text-mining based analytical framework aiming at the cognitive organization of complex scientific discourses. The approach is based on models recently developed in science mapping, being a generalization of the so-called Science Overlay Mapping methodology, referred to as Topic Overlay Mapping (TOM). It is shown that via applications of TOM in visualization, document clustering, time series analysis etc. the in-depth exploration and even the measurement of cognitive complexity and its dynamics is feasible for scientific domains. As a use case, an empirical study is presented into the discovery of a long-standing complex, interdisciplinary discourse, the debate on the species concept in biosystematics.
