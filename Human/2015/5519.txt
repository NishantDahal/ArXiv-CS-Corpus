Verification of Control Systems Implemented in Simulink with Assertion Checks and Theorem Proving: A Case Study

This paper presents the verification of control systems implemented in Simulink. The goal is to ensure that high-level requirements on control performance, like stability, are satisfied by the Simulink diagram. A two stage process is proposed. First, the high-level requirements are decomposed into specific parametrized sub-requirements and implemented as assertions in Simulink. Second, the verification takes place. On one hand, the sub-requirements are verified through assertion checks in simulation. On the other hand, according to their scope, some of the sub-requirements are verified through assertion checks in simulation, and others via automatic theorem proving over an ideal mathematical model of the diagram. We compare performing only assertion checks against the use of theorem proving, to highlight the advantages of the latter. Theorem proving performs verification by computing a mathematical proof symbolically, covering the entire state space of the variables. An automatic translation tool from Simulink to the language of the theorem proving tool Why3 is also presented. The paper demonstrates our approach by verifying the stability of a simple discrete linear system.
