PMSR - Poor Man's Segment Routing, a minimalistic approach to Segment Routing and a Traffic Engineering use case

The current specification of the Segment Routing (SR) architecture requires enhancements to the intra-domain routing protocols (e.g. OSPF and IS-IS) so that the nodes can advertise the Segment Identifiers (SIDs). We propose a simpler solution called PMSR (Poor Man's Segment Routing), that does not require any enhancement to routing protocol. We compare the procedures of PMSR with traditional SR, showing that PMSR can reduce the operation and management complexity. We analyze the set of use cases in the current SR drafts and we claim that PMSR can support the large majority of them. Thanks to the drastic simplification of the Control Plane, we have been able to develop an Open Source prototype of PMSR. In the second part of the paper, we consider a Traffic Engineering use case, starting from a traditional flow assignment optimization problem which allocates hop-by-hop paths to flows. We propose a SR path assignment algorithm and prove that it is optimal with respect to the number of segments allocated to a flow.
