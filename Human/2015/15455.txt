Network Coding Applications for 5G Millimeter-Wave Communications

The millimeter-wave bands have been attracting significant interest as a means to achieve major improvements in data rates and network efficiencies. One significant limitation for use of the millimeter-wave bands for cellular communication is that the communication suffers from much higher path-loss compared to the microwave bands. Millimeter-wave links have also been shown to change rapidly, causing links between devices and access points to switch among line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight and outage states. We propose using Random Linear Network Coding to overcome the unreliability of individual communication links in such millimeter-wave systems. Our system consists of devices transmitting and receiving network-coded packets through several access points. For downlink communication, network-coded packets are transmitted to a device via multiple access points. For uplink communication, the access points perform network coding of packets of several devices, and then send the network-coded packets to the core network. We compare our approach against a naive approach in which non-network coded packets are transmitted via multiple access points ("Forwarding" approach). We find that the network coding approach significantly outperforms the forwarding approach. In particular, network coding greatly improves the efficiency of the air-interface transmissions and the efficiency of the backhaul transmissions for the downlink and uplink communication, respectively.
