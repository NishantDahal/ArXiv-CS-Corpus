Lower Bound on the Capacity of Continuous-Time Wiener Phase Noise Channels

A continuous-time Wiener phase noise channel with an integrate-and-dump multi-sample receiver is studied.
  A lower bound to the capacity with an average input power constraint is derived, and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis is performed.
  The capacity pre-log depends on the oversampling factor, and amplitude and phase modulation do not equally contribute to capacity at high SNR.
