Parameterized Algorithms for Min-Max Multiway Cut and List Digraph Homomorphism

In this paper we design {\sf FPT}-algorithms for two parameterized problems. The first is \textsc{List Digraph Homomorphism}: given two digraphs $G$ and $H$ and a list of allowed vertices of $H$ for every vertex of $G$, the question is whether there exists a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ respecting the list constraints. The second problem is a variant of \textsc{Multiway Cut}, namely \textsc{Min-Max Multiway Cut}: given a graph $G$, a non-negative integer $\ell$, and a set $T$ of $r$ terminals, the question is whether we can partition the vertices of $G$ into $r$ parts such that (a) each part contains one terminal and (b) there are at most $\ell$ edges with only one endpoint in this part. We parameterize \textsc{List Digraph Homomorphism} by the number $w$ of edges of $G$ that are mapped to non-loop edges of $H$ and we give a time $2^{O(\ell\cdot\log h+\ell^2\cdot \log \ell)}\cdot n^{4}\cdot \log n$ algorithm, where $h$ is the order of the host graph $H$. We also prove that \textsc{Min-Max Multiway Cut} can be solved in time $2^{O((\ell r)^2\log \ell r)}\cdot n^{4}\cdot \log n$. Our approach introduces a general problem, called {\sc List Allocation}, whose expressive power permits the design of parameterized reductions of both aforementioned problems to it. Then our results are based on an {\sf FPT}-algorithm for the {\sc List Allocation} problem that is designed using a suitable adaptation of the {\em randomized contractions} technique (introduced by [Chitnis, Cygan, Hajiaghayi, Pilipczuk, and Pilipczuk, FOCS 2012]).
