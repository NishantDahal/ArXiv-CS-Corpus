Wireless Powered Cooperative Jamming for Secrecy Multi-AF Relaying Networks

This paper studies secrecy transmission with the aid of a group of wireless energy harvesting (WEH)-enabled amplify-and-forward (AF) relays performing cooperative jamming (CJ) and relaying. The source node in the network does simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) with each relay employing a power splitting (PS) receiver in the first phase; each relay further divides its harvested power for forwarding the received signal and generating artificial noise (AN) for jamming the eavesdroppers in the second transmission phase. In the centralized case with global channel state information (CSI), we provide closed-form expressions for the optimal and/or suboptimal AF-relay beamforming vectors to maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to individual power constraints of the relays, using the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR), which is proved to be tight. A fully distributed algorithm utilizing only local CSI at each relay is also proposed as a performance benchmark. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-AF relaying with CJ over other suboptimal designs.
