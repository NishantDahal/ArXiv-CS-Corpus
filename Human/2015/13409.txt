A secure service provisioning framework for cyber physical cloud computing systems

Cyber physical systems (CPS) are mission critical systems engineered by combination of cyber and physical systems respectively. These systems are tightly coupled, resource constrained systems and have dynamic real time applications. Due to the limitation of resources, and in order to improve the efficiency of the CPS systems, they are combined with cloud computing architecture, and are called as Cyber Physical Cloud Computing Systems (CPCCS). These CPCCS have critical care applications where security of the systems is a major concern. Therefore, we propose a Secure Service provisioning architecture for Cyber Physical Cloud Computing Systems (CPCCS), which includes the combination of technologies such as CPS, Cloud Computing and Wireless Sensor Networks. In addition to this, we also highlight various threats/attacks; security requirements and mechanisms that are applicable to CPCCS at different layers and propose two security models that can be adapted in a layered architectural format.
