Incremental LSTM-based Dialog State Tracker

A dialog state tracker is an important component in modern spoken dialog systems. We present an incremental dialog state tracker, based on LSTM networks. It directly uses automatic speech recognition hypotheses to track the state. We also present the key non-standard aspects of the model that bring its performance close to the state-of-the-art and experimentally analyze their contribution: including the ASR confidence scores, abstracting scarcely represented values, including transcriptions in the training data, and model averaging.
