A Monte Carlo method for the spread of mobile malware

A new model for the spread of mobile malware based on proximity (i.e. Bluetooth, ad-hoc WiFi or NFC) is introduced. The spread of malware is analyzed using a Monte Carlo method and the results of the simulation are compared with those from mean field theory.
