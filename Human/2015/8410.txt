Outage and Capacity Comparisons For Ground Relaying Systems Using Stochastic Geometry

Concurrent cooperative transmission for relaying purposes in mobile communication networks is relevant in current institutional systems with limited infrastructure, and and may be viewed as a potential range-extension mechanism for future commercial networks, including vehicular autonomous networking. The complexity of the overall system has encouraged certain abstractions at the physical layer which are critically analyzed in the present paper. We show via analytic stochastic geometry tools that the receiver structure plays a crucial role in the outage behavior of the relays, particularly for realistic flooding protocols. This approach aims to help understand the cross-layer aspects of such networks.
