Applying FCA toolbox to Software Testing

Software testing uses wide range of different tools to enhance the complicated process of defining quality of the system under test. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) provides us with algorithms of deriving formal ontology from a set of objects and their attributes. With the use of FCA we can considerably improve the efficiency of test case derivation. Moreover, an FCA-based machine learning system supports the analysis of regression testing results.
