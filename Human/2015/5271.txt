Heisenberg-like and Fisher-information-based uncertainty relations for $N$-electron $d$-dimensional systems

Heisenberg-like and Fisher-information-based uncertainty relations which extend and generalize previous similar expressions are obtained for $N$-fermion $d$-dimensional systems. The contributions of both spatial and spin degrees of freedom are taken into account. The accuracy of some of these generalized spinned uncertainty-like relations is numerically examined for a large number of atomic and molecular systems.
