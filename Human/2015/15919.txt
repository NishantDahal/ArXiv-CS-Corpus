Reversible Watson-Crick Automata

Watson-Crick automata are finite automata working on double strands. Extensive research work has already been done on non-deterministic Watson-Crick automata and on deterministic Watson-Crick automata. In this paper, we introduce a new model of Watson-Crick automata which is reversible in nature named reversible Watson-Crick automata and explore its computational power. We show even though the model is reversible and one way it accepts all regular languages and also analyze the state complexity of the above stated model with respect to non-deterministic block automata and non-deterministic finite automata and establish its superiority. We further explore the relation of the reversible model with twin-shuffle language and recursively enumerable languages.
