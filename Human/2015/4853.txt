"The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts": Optimization in Collaborative Crowdsourcing

In this work, we initiate the investigation of optimization opportunities in collaborative crowdsourcing. Many popular applications, such as collaborative document editing, sentence translation, or citizen science resort to this special form of human-based computing, where, crowd workers with appropriate skills and expertise are required to form groups to solve complex tasks. Central to any collaborative crowdsourcing process is the aspect of successful collaboration among the workers, which, for the first time, is formalized and then optimized in this work. Our formalism considers two main collaboration-related human factors, affinity and upper critical mass, appropriately adapted from organizational science and social theories. Our contributions are (a) proposing a comprehensive model for collaborative crowdsourcing optimization, (b) rigorous theoretical analyses to understand the hardness of the proposed problems, (c) an array of efficient exact and approximation algorithms with provable theoretical guarantees. Finally, we present a detailed set of experimental results stemming from two real-world collaborative crowdsourcing application us- ing Amazon Mechanical Turk, as well as conduct synthetic data analyses on scalability and qualitative aspects of our proposed algorithms. Our experimental results successfully demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed solutions.
