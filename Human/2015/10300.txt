The Name-Passing Calculus

Name-passing calculi are foundational models for mobile computing. Research into these models has produced a wealth of results ranging from relative expressiveness to programming pragmatics. The diversity of these results call for clarification and reorganization. This paper applies a model independent approach to the study of the name-passing calculi, leading to a uniform treatment and simplification. The technical tools and the results presented in the paper form the foundation for a theory of name-passing calculus.
