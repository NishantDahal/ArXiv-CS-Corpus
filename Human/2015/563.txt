Assessing Whole-Body Operational Space Control in a Point-Foot Series Elastic Biped: Balance on Split Terrain and Undirected Walking

In this paper we present advancements in control and trajectory generation for agile behavior in bipedal robots. We demonstrate that Whole-Body Operational Space Control (WBOSC), developed a few years ago, is well suited for achieving two types of agile behaviors, namely, balancing on a high pitch split terrain and achieving undirected walking on flat terrain. The work presented here is the first implementation of WBOSC on a biped robot, and more specifically a biped robot with series elastic actuators. We present and analyze a new algorithm that dynamically balances point foot robots by choosing footstep placements. Dealing with the naturally unstable dynamics of these type of systems is a difficult problem that requires both the controller and the trajectory generation algorithm to operate quickly and efficiently. We put forth a comprehensive development and integration effort: the design and construction of the biped system and experimental infrastructure, a customization of WBOSC for the agile behaviors, and new trajectory generation algorithms. Using this custom built controller, we conduct, for first time, an experiment in which a biped robot balances in a high pitch split terrain, demonstrating our ability to precisely regulate internal forces using force sensing feedback techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the stabilizing capabilities of our online trajectory generation algorithm in the physics-based simulator and through physical experiments with a planarized locomotion setup.
