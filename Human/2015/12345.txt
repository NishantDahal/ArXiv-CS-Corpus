Generalized conditional gradient: analysis of convergence and applications

The objectives of this technical report is to provide additional results on the generalized conditional gradient methods introduced by Bredies et al. [BLM05]. Indeed , when the objective function is smooth, we provide a novel certificate of optimality and we show that the algorithm has a linear convergence rate. Applications of this algorithm are also discussed.
