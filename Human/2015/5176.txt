Refinement in the Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework

We introduce refinement in the function-behaviour-structure framework for design, as described by John Gero, in order to deal with complexity. We do this by connecting the frameworks for the design of two models, one the refinement of the other. The result is a framework for the design of an object that supports levels of abstraction in the design. This framework can easily be extended for the design of an object on more than two levels of abstraction.
