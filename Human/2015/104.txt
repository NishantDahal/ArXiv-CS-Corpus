Embedding of binary image in the Gray planes

For watermarking of the digital grayscale image its Gray planes have been used. With the help of the introduced representation over Gray planes the LSB embedding method and detection have been discussed. It found that data, a binary image, hidden in the Gray planes is more robust to JPEG lossy compression than in the bit planes.
