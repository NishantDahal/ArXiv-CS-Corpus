A Web Environment for Geometry

The Web Geometry Laboratory, (WGL), is a blended-learning, collaborative and adaptive, Web environment for geometry. It integrates a well known dynamic geometry system. In a collaborative session, exchange of geometrical and textual information between the user engaged in the session is possible. In a normal work session (stand-alone mode), all the geometric steps done by the students are recorded, alongside the navigation information, allowing, in a latter stage, their teachers to "play back" the students sessions, using that info to assert the students level and adjust the teaching strategies to each individual student. Teachers can register and begin using one of the public servers, defining students, preparing materials to be released to the students, open collaborative sessions, etc. Using an action research methodology the WGL system is being developed, validated through case-studies, and further improved, in a cycle where the implementation steps are intertwined with case studies.
