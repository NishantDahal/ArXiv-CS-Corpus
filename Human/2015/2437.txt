An original Propagator for large array

In this paper, we demonstrate that when the ratio $n$ of the number of antenna elements $N$ to the number $P$ of radiating sources is superior or equal to $2$, then it is possible to choose a propagator from a set of $n(n+1)/2-1$ operators to compute the Angles of Arrival (AoA) of the narrowband incoming waves. This new non eigenbased approach is efficient when the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is moderate, and gives multitude of possibilities, that are dependent of the random data, to construct the complex sets whose columns are orthogonal to the signal subspace generated by the radiating sources. Elementary examples are given for $n=3$, $n=4$ and $n=6$. The simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed computational methods.
