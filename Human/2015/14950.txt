Time delay estimator for predetermined repeated signal robust to narrowband interference

In this paper, time delay estimation techniques robust to narrowband interference (NBI) are proposed. Owing to the deluge of wireless signal interference these days, narrowband interference is a common problem for communication and positioning systems. To mitigate the effect of this narrow band interference, we propose a robust time delay estimator for a predetermined repeated synchronization signal in an NBI environment. We exploit an ensemble of average and sample covariance matrices to estimate the noise profile. In addition, to increase the detection probability, we suppress the variance of likelihood value by employing a von-Mises distribution in the time-delay estimator. Our proposed time delay estimator shows a better performance in an NBI environment compared to a typical time delay estimator.
