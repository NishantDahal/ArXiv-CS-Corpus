On enery-efficient time synchronization based on source clock frequency recovery in wireless sensor networks

In this paper we study energy-efficient time synchronization schemes with focus on asymmetric wireless sensor networks, where a head node, which is connected to both wired & wireless networks, is equipped with a powerful processor and supplied power from outlet, and sensor nodes, which are connected only through wireless channels, are limited in processing and battery-powered. It is this asymmetry that we focus our study on; unlike existing schemes saving the power of all sensor nodes in the network (including the head node), we concentrate on battery-powered sensor nodes in minimizing energy consumption for synchronization. Specifically, we discuss a time synchronization scheme based on source clock frequency recovery, where we minimize the number of message transmissions from sensor nodes to the head node, and its extension to network-wide, multi-hop synchronization through gateway nodes.
