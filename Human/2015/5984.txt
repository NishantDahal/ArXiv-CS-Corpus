Encoding by DNA Relations and Randomization Through Chaotic Sequences for Image Encryption

Researchers in the field of DNA-based chaotic cryptography have recently proposed a set of novel and efficient image encryption algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive summary of those techniques, which are available in the literature. The discussion given in this paper is grouped into three main areas. At first, we give a brief sketch of the backbone architecture and the theoretical foundation of this field, based on which all the algorithms were proposed. Next, we briefly discuss the set of image encryption algorithms based on this architecture and categorized them as either encryption or cryptanalyzing techniques. Finally, we present the different evaluation metrics used to quantitatively measure the performance of such algorithms. We also discuss the characteristic differences among these algorithms. We further highlight the potential advances that are needed to improvise the present state-of-the-art image encryption technique using DNA computing and chaos theory. The primary objective of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of DNA computing and chaos theory based image encryption a comprehensive summary of the progress achieved so far and to facilitate them to identify a few challenging future research areas.
