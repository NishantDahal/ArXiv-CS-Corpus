2001-2013: Survey and Analysis of Major Cyberattacks

Widespread and extensive use of computers and their interconnections in almost all sectors like communications, finance, transportation, military, governance, education, energy etc., have made them attractive targets for adversaries to spy, disrupt or steal information by pressing of few keystrokes from any part of the world. This paper presents a survey of major cyberattacks from 2001 to 2013 and analyzes these attacks to understand the motivation, targets and technique(s) employed by the attackers. Observed trends in cyberattacks have also been discussed in the paper.
