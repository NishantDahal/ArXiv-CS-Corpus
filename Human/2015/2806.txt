Testability Measurement Model for Object Oriented Design (TMMOOD)

Measuring testability early in the development life cycle especially at design phase is a criterion of crucial importance to software designers, developers, quality controllers and practitioners. However, most of the mechanism available for testability measurement may be used in the later phases of development life cycle. Early estimation of testability, absolutely at design phase helps designers to improve their designs before the coding starts. Practitioners regularly advocate that testability should be planned early in design phase. Testability measurement early in design phase is greatly emphasized in this study; hence, considered significant for the delivery of quality software. As a result, it extensively reduces rework during and after implementation, as well as facilitate for design effective test plans, better project and resource planning in a practical manner, with a focus on the design phase. An effort has been put forth in this paper to recognize the key factors contributing in testability measurement at design phase. Additionally, testability measurement model is developed to quantify software testability at design phase. Furthermore, the relationship of Testability with these factors has been tested and justified with the help of statistical measures. The developed model has been validated using experimental tryout. Finally, it incorporates the empirical validation of the testability measurement model as the authors most important contribution.
