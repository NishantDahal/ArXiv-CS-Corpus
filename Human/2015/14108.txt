Information Rate Decomposition for Feedback Systems with Output Disturbance

This technical note considers the problem of resource allocation in linear feedback control system with output disturbance. By decomposing the information rate in the feedback communication channel, the channel resource allocation is thoroughly analyzed. The results show that certain amount of resource is used to transmit the output disturbance and this resource allocation is independent from feedback controller design.
