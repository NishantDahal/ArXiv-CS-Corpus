Cache Aided Wireless Networks: Tradeoffs between Storage and Latency

We investigate the fundamental information theoretic limits of cache-aided wireless networks, in which edge nodes (or transmitters) are endowed with caches that can store popular content, such as multimedia files. This architecture aims to localize popular multimedia content by proactively pushing it closer to the edge of the wireless network, thereby alleviating backhaul load. An information theoretic model of such networks is presented, that includes the introduction of a new metric, namely normalized delivery time (NDT), which captures the worst case time to deliver any requested content to the users. We present new results on the trade-off between latency, measured via the NDT, and the cache storage capacity of the edge nodes. In particular, a novel information theoretic lower bound on NDT is presented for cache aided networks. The optimality of this bound is shown for several system parameters.
