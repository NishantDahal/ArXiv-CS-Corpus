Mixed polarity reversible Peres gates

Reversible Peres gates with more than two all over binary-valued control signals are discussed. Methods are disclosed for the low cost realization of this kind of Peres gates without requiring ancillary lines. Proper distribution of the controlled gates and their inverses allow driving the reversible Peres gate with control signals of different polarities.
