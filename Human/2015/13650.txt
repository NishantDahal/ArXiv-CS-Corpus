A Low-Complexity Detection Algorithm for the Primary Synchronization Signal in LTE

One of the challenging tasks in LTE baseband receiver design is synchronization, which determines the symbol boundary and transmitted frame start-time, and performs cell identification. Conventional algorithms are based on correlation methods that involve a large number of multiplications and thus lead to high receiver hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper, a hardware-efficient synchronization algorithm for frame timing based on K-means clustering schemes is proposed. The algorithm reduces the complexity of the primary synchronization signal for LTE from 24 complex-multiplications, currently best known in the literature, to just 8. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has negligible performance degradation with reduced complexity relative to conventional techniques.
