Case Management: a data set of definitions

Knowledge-intensive processes (KiPs) are becoming increasingly important for organizations with the rise of the knowledge society. Due to their unpredictable and emergent characteristic worklfow management solutions are not suitable to support KiPs. Various case management related approaches have been proposed by researchers and practitioners to support characteristics of KiPs. In this paper we provide a comprehensive list of definitions available on case management, e.g. case handling, adaptive case management, dynamic case management, production case management. For every definition we present the explicit definition, paragraphs that better describe and summarize the case management approach, or extracted sequences that define the term in the referenced publication. All of these definitions are compared against characteristics of KiPs in order to get about understanding of the domain.
