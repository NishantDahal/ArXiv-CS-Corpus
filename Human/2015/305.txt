Uma análise bibliométrica do Congresso Nacional de Bibliotecários, Arquivistas e Documentalistas (1985-2012)

This article is the first bibliometric analysis of the 708 lectures published by The Librarians and Archivists National Congress between 1985 and 2012, having been developed markers for production, productivity, institutional origin and thematic analysis, in a quantitative, relational and diachronic perspective. Its results show a dynamic congress, essentially national and professional, with a strong majority of individual authorships, even with the recent growth of the ratio of collaborations. In its thematic approach, emphasis is given to public services of information, with the greatest focus being on libraries, while still giving relevance to reflections on professional and academic training in the area of Information Sciences, and also following the most recent technological developments.
