Easyprove: a tool for teaching precise reasoning

Teaching precise mathematical reasoning can be very hard. It is very easy for a student to make a subtle mistake in a proof which invalidates it, but it is often hard for the teacher to pinpoint and explain the problem in the (often chaotically written) student's proof. We present Easyprove, an interactive proof assistant aimed at first year computer science students and high school students, intended as a supplementary tool for teaching logical reasoning. The system is a Web application with a natural, mouse-oriented user interface.
