Agent-Based Product Configuration: towards Generalized Consensus Seeking

This paper will present an evolution of a fuzzy agent based platform which performed products configuration. As a first step, we used the notion of consensus to establish robust results at the end of the configuration process. We implemented the concept of generalized consensus which implied the consideration of consensuses from the beginning, in this way robust data are treated during the entire process and the final result enables the designer to distinguish the robust components and flexible ones in a set of configurations.
