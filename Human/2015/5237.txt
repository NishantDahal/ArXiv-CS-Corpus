The Implementation of Hadoop-based Crawler System and Graphlite-based PageRank-Calculation In Search Engine

Nowadays, the size of the Internet is experiencing rapid growth. As of December 2014, the number of global Internet websites has more than 1 billion and all kinds of information resources are integrated together on the Internet, however,the search engine is to be a necessary tool for all users to retrieve useful information from vast amounts of web data. Generally speaking, a complete search engine includes the crawler system, index building systems, sorting systems and retrieval system. At present there are many open source implementation of search engine, such as lucene, solr, katta, elasticsearch, solandra and so on. The crawler system and sorting system is indispensable for any kind of search engine and in order to guarantee its efficiency, the former needs to update crawled vast amounts of data and the latter requires real-time to build index on newly crawled web pages and calculae its corresponding PageRank value. It is unlikely to accomplish such huge computation tasks depending on a single hardware implementation of the crawler system and sorting system,from which aspect, the distributed cluster technology is brought to the front. In this paper, we use the hadoop Map - Reduce computing framework to implement a distributed crawler system, and use the GraphLite, a distributed synchronous graph-computing framework, to achieve the real-time computation in getting the PageRank value of the new crawled web page.
