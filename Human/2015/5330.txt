Relative Generalized Hamming Weights of Cyclic Codes

Relative generalized Hamming weights (RGHWs) of a linear code respect to a linear subcode determine the security of the linear ramp secret sharing scheme based on the code. They can be used to express the information leakage of the secret when some keepers of shares are corrupted. Cyclic codes are an interesting type of linear codes and have wide applications in communication and storage systems. In this paper, we investigate the RGHWs of cyclic codes with two nonzeros respect to any of its irreducible cyclic subcodes. Applying the method in the paper [arxiv.org/abs/1410.2702], we give two formulae for RGHWs of the cyclic codes. As applications of the formulae, explicit examples are computed.
