Software Evolution is considered to be essential and challenging characteristic in the field of software engineering. Version control system is an incremental versions tracking system, introduced to avoid unnecessary overwriting of files such as programming code, web pages and records. It also helps to decrease the confusion affected by duplicate or outdated data. In this proposed research SVN repository is maintained and analyzed for msitone.wikispaces.com to minimize the efforts as well as resources for the future users. We have used two semester data for the analysis purpose that is observed SVN repository. The result shows that, implementing the SVN repositories are helpful for maintenance of the Wikispaces as it also reduce the cost, time and efforts for their evolution. Whereas without implementing the SVN repositories Wikispaces were just supposed to be building the house by putting each brick from start.
