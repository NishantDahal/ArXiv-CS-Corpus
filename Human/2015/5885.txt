Multi-Agent Distributed Coordination Control: Developments and Directions

In this paper, the recent developments on distributed coordination control, especially the consensus and formation control, are summarized with the graph theory playing a central role, in order to present a cohesive overview of the multi-agent distributed coordination control, together with brief reviews of some closely related issues including rendezvous/alignment, swarming/flocking and containment control.In terms of the consensus problem, the recent results on consensus for the agents with different dynamics from first-order, second-order to high-order linear and nonlinear dynamics, under different communication conditions, such as cases with/without switching communication topology and varying time-delays, are reviewed, in which the algebraic graph theory is very useful in the protocol designs, stability proofs and converging analysis. In terms of the formation control problem, after reviewing the results of the algebraic graph theory employed in the formation control, we mainly pay attention to the developments of the rigid and persistent graphs. With the notions of rigidity and persistence, the formation transformation, splitting and reconstruction can be completed, and consequently the range-based formation control laws are designed with the least required information in order to maintain a formation rigid/persistent. Afterwards, the recent results on rendezvous/alignment, swarming/flocking and containment control, which are very closely related to consensus and formation control, are briefly introduced, in order to present an integrated view of the graph theory used in the coordination control problem. Finally, towards the practical applications, some directions possibly deserving investigation in coordination control are raised as well.
