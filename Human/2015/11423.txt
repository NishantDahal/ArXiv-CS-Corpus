Approximate Message Passing in Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging

We consider a compressive hyperspectral imaging reconstruction problem, where three-dimensional spatio-spectral information about a scene is sensed by a coded aperture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI). The approximate message passing (AMP) framework is utilized to reconstruct hyperspectral images from CASSI measurements, and an adaptive Wiener filter is employed as a three-dimensional image denoiser within AMP. We call our algorithm "AMP-3D-Wiener." The simulation results show that AMP-3D-Wiener outperforms existing widely-used algorithms such as gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) and two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TwIST) given the same amount of runtime. Moreover, in contrast to GPSR and TwIST, AMP-3D-Wiener need not tune any parameters, which simplifies the reconstruction process.
