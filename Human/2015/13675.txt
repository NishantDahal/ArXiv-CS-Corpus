In this paper we present our experience in using visualization in mathematics education. The experience with our university courses: "Computer tools in matematics" and "Symbolic algebra" provides the basis for mathematics teacher education program http://vizuelizacija.etf.rs/. The program is intended for elementary and high school teachers. The education program deals with modern techniques of visualization by using technologies such as GeoGegebra, JAVA and HTML.
