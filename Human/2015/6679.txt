Human Shape Variation - An Efficient Implementation using Skeleton

It is at times important to detect human presence automatically in secure environments. This needs a shape recognition algorithm that is robust, fast and has low error rates. The algorithm needs to process camera images quickly to detect any human in the range of vision, and generate alerts, especially if the object under scrutiny is moving in certain directions. We present here a simple, efficient and fast algorithm using skeletons of the images, and simple features like posture and length of the object.
