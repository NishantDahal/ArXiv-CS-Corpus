A Practical Layered Model for Flexible-grid Optical Networks to Reduce the Routing Complexity

This article proposes a new layered model to represent the spectrum assignment on flexible-grid optical networks. This model can reduce the time-complexity of existing routing and spectrum assignment methods by providing a data structure that captures the current spectrum usage of the network links.
