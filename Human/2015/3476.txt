Effective zero-dimensionality for computable metric spaces

We begin to study classical dimension theory from the computable analysis (TTE) point of view. For computable metric spaces, several effectivisations of zero-dimensionality are shown to be equivalent. The part of this characterisation that concerns covering dimension extends to higher dimensions and to closed shrinkings of finite open covers. To deal with zero-dimensional subspaces uniformly, four operations (relative to the space and a class of subspaces) are defined; these correspond to definitions of inductive and covering dimensions and a countable basis condition. Finally, an effective retract characterisation of zero-dimensionality is proven under an effective compactness condition. In one direction this uses a version of the construction of bilocated sets.
