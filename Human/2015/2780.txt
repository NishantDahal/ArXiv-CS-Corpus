On Various Parameters of $Z_q$-Simplex codes for an even integer q

In this paper, we defined the $Z_q$-linear codes and discussed its various parameters. We constructed $Z_q$-Simplex code and $Z_q$-MacDonald code and found its parameters. We have given a lower and an upper bounds of its covering radius for q is an even integer.
