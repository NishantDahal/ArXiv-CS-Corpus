Identifying Avatar Aliases in Starcraft 2

In electronic sports, cyberathletes conceal their online training using different avatars (virtual identities), allowing them not being recognized by the opponents they may face in future competitions.

Our method trains a classifier on behavioural data and processes the confusion matrix to output label pairs which concentrate confusion. We experimented with Starcraft 2 and report our first results.
