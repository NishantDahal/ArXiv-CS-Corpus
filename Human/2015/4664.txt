Heuristic algorithms for obtaining Polynomial Threshold Functions with low densities

In this paper we present several heuristic algorithms, including a Genetic Algorithm (GA), for obtaining polynomial threshold function (PTF) representations of Boolean functions (BFs) with small number of monomials. We compare these among each other and against the algorithm of Oztop via computational experiments. The results indicate that our heuristic algorithms find more parsimonious representations compared to the those of non-heuristic and GA-based algorithms.
