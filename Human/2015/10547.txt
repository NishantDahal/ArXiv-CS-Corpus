Higher Order Derivatives in Costa's Entropy Power Inequality

Let $X$ be an arbitrary continuous random variable and $Z$ be an independent Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance. For $t~>~0$, Costa proved that $e^{2h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)}$ is concave in $t$, where the proof hinged on the first and second order derivatives of $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$. Specifically, these two derivatives are signed, i.e., $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}h(X+\sqrt{t}Z) \geq 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}h(X+\sqrt{t}Z) \leq 0$. In this paper, we show that the third order derivative of $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is nonnegative, which implies that the Fisher information $J(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is convex in $t$. We further show that the fourth order derivative of $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is nonpositive. Following the first four derivatives, we make two conjectures on $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$: the first is that $\frac{\partial^n}{\partial t^n} h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is nonnegative in $t$ if $n$ is odd, and nonpositive otherwise; the second is that $\log J(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is convex in $t$. The first conjecture can be rephrased in the context of completely monotone functions: $J(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is completely monotone in $t$. The history of the first conjecture may date back to a problem in mathematical physics studied by McKean in 1966. Apart from these results, we provide a geometrical interpretation to the covariance-preserving transformation and study the concavity of $h(\sqrt{t}X+\sqrt{1-t}Z)$, revealing its connection with Costa's EPI.
