Performance evaluation of different optimization techniques for coverage and connectivity control in backbone based wireless networks

In this paper, performance evaluation of Newton-Raphson and Conjugate Gradient method has been studied in comparison to Steepest Decent method for coverage and connectivity control in backbone based wireless networks. In order to design such wireless networks, the main challenge is to ensure network requirements such as network coverage and connectivity. To optimize coverage and connectivity, backbone nodes will be repositioned by the use of mobility control based on above mentioned methods. Thus the network get self organized which autonomously achieve energy minimizing configuration. Furthermore by simulation using MATLAB R2010a, methods are compared on the basis of optimized cost, number of iterations and elapsed time i.e. total time taken to execute the algorithm.
