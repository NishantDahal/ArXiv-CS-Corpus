Self-Healing Audio System

Installed sound applications typically involve a large number of audio processors, amplifiers and speaker systems spread across the venue. They could be spatially distributed at the venue across different rack rooms and floors. These systems are commissioned and configured by sound engineers using software application(s). This is essentially a one-time activity, following which, the audio systems run independently. Detection of faults and reconfiguration of any audio device(s) that fail(s) is a time-consuming operation. This disruption in the audio system can affect the entire audio chain and affect the usability of the venue in question. In this paper, we provide an overview of an audio system that detects the replacement for any faulty audio device(s) in the network and re-purposes the same to restore the configuration to last working point.
