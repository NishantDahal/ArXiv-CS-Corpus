On the Capacity of Wireless Networks with Random Transmission Delay

In this paper, we introduce novel coding schemes for wireless networks with random transmission delays. These coding schemes obviate the need for synchronicity, reduce the number of transmissions and achieve the optimal rate region in the corresponding wired model for both multiple unicast and multicast cases with up to three users under the equal rate constraint. The coding schemes are presented in two phases; first, coding schemes for line, star and line-star topologies with random transmission delays are provided. Second, any general topology with multiple bidirectional unicast and multicast sessions is shown to be decomposable into these canonical topologies to reduce the number of transmissions without rate redundancy. As a result, the coding schemes developed for the line, star and line-star topologies serve as building blocks for the construction of more general coding schemes for all networks. The proposed schemes are proved to be Real Time (RT) for wireless networks in the sense that they achieve the minimal decoding delay. With a negligible size header, these coding schemes are shown to be applicable to unsynchronized networks, i.e., networks with random transmission delays. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of these schemes by extensive simulations. The implementation of such coding schemes on a wireless network with random transmission delay can improve performance and power efficiency.
