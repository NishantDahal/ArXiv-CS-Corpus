Characteristics polynomial of normalized Laplacian for trees

Here, we find the characteristics polynomial of normalized Laplacian of a tree. The coefficients of this polynomial are expressed by the higher order general RandiÄ‡ indices for matching, whose values depend on the structure of the tree. We also find the expression of these indices for starlike tree and a double-starlike tree, $H_m(p,q)$. Moreover, we show that two cospectral $H_m(p,q)$ of the same diameter are isomorphic.
