Boolean Computation Using Self-Sustaining Nonlinear Oscillators

Self-sustaining nonlinear oscillators of practically any type can function as latches and registers if Boolean logic states are represented physically as the phase of oscillatory signals. Combinational operations on such phase-encoded logic signals can be implemented using arithmetic negation and addition followed by amplitude limiting. With these, general-purpose Boolean computation using a wide variety of natural and engineered oscillators becomes potentially possible. Such phase-encoded logic shows promise for energy efficient computing. It also has inherent noise immunity advantages over traditional level-based logic.
