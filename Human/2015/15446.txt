5G green cellular networks considering power allocation schemes

It is important to assess the effect of transmit power allocation schemes on the energy consumption on random cellular networks. The energy efficiency of 5G green cellular networks with average and water-filling power allocation schemes is studied in this paper. Based on the proposed interference and achievable rate model, an energy efficiency model is proposed for MIMO random cellular networks. Furthermore, the energy efficiency with average and water-filling power allocation schemes are presented, respectively. Numerical results indicate that the maximum limits of energy efficiency are always there for MIMO random cellular networks with different intensity ratios of mobile stations (MSs) to base stations (BSs) and channel conditions. Compared with the average power allocation scheme, the water-filling scheme is shown to improve the energy efficiency of MIMO random cellular networks when channel state information (CSI) is attainable for both transmitters and receivers.
