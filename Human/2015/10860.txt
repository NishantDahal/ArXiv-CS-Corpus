Well Structured Transition Systems with History

We propose a formal model of concurrent systems in which the history of a computation is explicitly represented as a collection of events that provide a view of a sequence of configurations.  In our model events generated by transitions become part of the system configurations leading to operational semantics with historical data. This model allows us to formalize what is usually done in symbolic verification algorithms.  Indeed, search algorithms often use meta-information, e.g., names of fired transitions, selected processes, etc., to reconstruct (error) traces from symbolic state exploration. The other interesting point of the proposed model is related to a possible new application of the theory of well-structured transition systems (wsts). In our setting wsts theory can be applied to formally extend the class of properties that can be verified using coverability to take into consideration (ordered and unordered) historical data. This can be done by using different types of representation of collections of events and by combining them  with wsts by using closure properties of well-quasi orderings.
