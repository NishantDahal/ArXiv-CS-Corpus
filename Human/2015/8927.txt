Delay-aware data transmission of multi-carrier communications in the presence of renewable energy

In the paper, we investigate the delay-aware data transmission in renewable energy aided multi-carrier system. Besides utilizing the local renewables, the transmitter can also purchase grid power. By scheduling the amount of transmitted data (The data are stored in a buffer before transmission), the sub-carrier allocation, and the renewable allocation in each transmission period, the transmitter aims to minimize the purchasing cost under a buffer delay constraint. By theoretical analysis of the formulated stochastic optimization problem, we find that transmit the scheduled data through the subcarrier with best condition is optimal and greedy renewable energy is approximately optimal. Furthermore, based on the theoretical derives and Lyapunov optimization, an on-line algorithm, which does NOT require future information, is proposed. Numerical results illustrate the delay and cost performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the comparisons with the delay-optimal policy and cost-optimal policy are carried out.
