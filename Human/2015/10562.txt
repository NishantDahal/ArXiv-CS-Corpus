Quantum pattern matching fast on average

The $d$-dimensional pattern matching problem is to find an occurrence of a pattern of length $m \times \dots \times m$ within a text of length $n \times \dots \times n$, with $n \ge m$. This task models various problems in text and image processing, among other application areas. This work describes a quantum algorithm which solves the pattern matching problem for random patterns and texts in time $\widetilde{O}((n/m)^{d/2} 2^{O(d^{3/2}\sqrt{\log m})})$. For large $m$ this is super-polynomially faster than the best possible classical algorithm, which requires time $\widetildeÎ©( (n/m)^d + n^{d/2} )$. The algorithm is based on the use of a quantum subroutine for finding hidden shifts in $d$ dimensions, which is a variant of algorithms proposed by Kuperberg.
