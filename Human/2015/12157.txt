In-Situ Data Analysis of Protein Folding Trajectories

The transition from petascale to exascale computers is characterized by substantial changes in the computer architectures and technologies. The research community relying on computational simulations is being forced to revisit the algorithms for data generation and analysis due to various concerns, such as higher degrees of concurrency, deeper memory hierarchies, substantial I/O and communication constraints. Simulations today typically save all data to analyze later. Simulations at the exascale will require us to analyze data as it is generated and save only what is really needed for analysis, which must be performed predominately in-situ, i.e., executed sufficiently fast locally, limiting memory and disk usage, and avoiding the need to move large data across nodes.
  In this paper, we present a distributed method that enables in-situ data analysis for large protein folding trajectory datasets. Traditional trajectory analysis methods currently follow a centralized approach that moves the trajectory datasets to a centralized node and processes the data only after simulations have been completed. Our method, on the other hand, captures conformational information in-situ using local data only while reducing the storage space needed for the part of the trajectory under consideration. This method processes the input trajectory data in one pass, breaks from the centralized approach of traditional analysis, avoids the movement of trajectory data, and still builds the global knowledge on the formation of individual $α$-helices or $β$-strands as trajectory frames are generated.
