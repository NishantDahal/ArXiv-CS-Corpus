Results on the solutions of maximum weighted Renyi entropy problems

In this paper, following standard arguments, the maximum Renyi entropy problem for the weighted case is analyzed. We verify that under some constrains on weight function, the Student-r and Student-t distributions maximize the weighted Renyi entropy. Furthermore, an extended version of the Hadamard inequality is derived.
