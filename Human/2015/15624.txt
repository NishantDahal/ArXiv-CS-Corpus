Unsupervised comparable corpora preparation and exploration for bi-lingual translation equivalents

The multilingual nature of the world makes translation a crucial requirement today. Parallel dictionaries constructed by humans are a widely-available resource, but they are limited and do not provide enough coverage for good quality translation purposes, due to out-of-vocabulary words and neologisms. This motivates the use of statistical translation systems, which are unfortunately dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. Such systems have a very limited availability especially for some languages and very narrow text domains. In this research we present our improvements to current comparable corpora mining methodologies by re- implementation of the comparison algorithms (using Needleman-Wunch algorithm), introduction of a tuning script and computation time improvement by GPU acceleration. Experiments are carried out on bilingual data extracted from the Wikipedia, on various domains. For the Wikipedia itself, additional cross-lingual comparison heuristics were introduced. The modifications made a positive impact on the quality and quantity of mined data and on the translation quality.
