Wave Atom Based Watermarking

Watermarking helps in ensuring originality, ownership and copyrights of a digital image. This paper aims at embedding a Watermark in an image using Wave Atom Transform. Preference of Wave Atoms on other transformations has been due to its sparser expansion, adaptability to the direction of local pattern, and sharp frequency localization. In this scheme, we had tried to spread the watermark in an image so that the information at one place is very small and undetectable. In order to extract the watermark and verify ownership of an image, one would have the advantage of prior knowledge of embedded locations. A noise of high amplitude will be needed to be added to the image for watermark distortion. Furthermore, the information spread will ensure the robustness of the watermark data. The proposed scheme has the ability to withstand malicious operations and attacks.
