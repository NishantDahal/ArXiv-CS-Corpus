Sensitivity Gains by Mismatched Probabilistic Shaping for Optical Communication Systems

Probabilistic shaping of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is used to enhance the sensitivity of an optical communication system. Sensitivity gains of 0.43 dB and 0.8 dB are demonstrated in back-to-back experiments by shaping of 16QAM and 64QAM, respectively. Further, numerical simulations are used to prove the robustness of probabilistic shaping to a mismatch between the constellation used and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel. It is found that, accepting a 0.1 dB SNR penalty, only four shaping distributions are required to support these gains for 64QAM.
