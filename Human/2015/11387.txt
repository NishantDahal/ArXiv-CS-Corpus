Safeguarding Massive MIMO Aided HetNets Using Physical Layer Security

This paper exploits the potential of physical layer security in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) aided two-tier heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We focus on the downlink secure transmission in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We first address the impact of massive MIMO on the maximum receive power based user association. We then derive the tractable upper bound expressions for the secrecy outage probability of a HetNets user.We show that the implementation of massive MIMO significantly improves the secrecy performance, which indicates that physical layer security could be a promising solution for safeguarding massive MIMO HetNets. Furthermore, we show that the secrecy outage probability of HetNets user first degrades and then improves with increasing the density of PBSs.
