BER Analysis of the box relaxation for BPSK Signal Recovery

We study the problem of recovering an $n$-dimensional vector of $\{\pm1\}^n$ (BPSK) signals from $m$ noise corrupted measurements $\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_0+\mathbf{z}$. In particular, we consider the box relaxation method which relaxes the discrete set $\{\pm1\}^n$ to the convex set $[-1,1]^n$ to obtain a convex optimization algorithm followed by hard thresholding. When the noise $\mathbf{z}$ and measurement matrix $\mathbf{A}$ have iid standard normal entries, we obtain an exact expression for the bit-wise probability of error $P_e$ in the limit of $n$ and $m$ growing and $\frac{m}{n}$ fixed. At high SNR our result shows that the $P_e$ of box relaxation is within 3dB of the matched filter bound MFB for square systems, and that it approaches MFB as $m $ grows large compared to $n$. Our results also indicates that as $m,n\rightarrow\infty$, for any fixed set of size $k$, the error events of the corresponding $k$ bits in the box relaxation method are independent.
