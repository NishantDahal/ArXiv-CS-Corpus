Leveraging SDN for The 5G Networks: Trends, Prospects and Challenges

Today 4G mobile systems are evolving to provide IP connectivity for diverse applications and services up to 1Gbps. They are designed to optimize the network performance, improve cost efficiency and facilitate the uptake of mass market IP-based services. Nevertheless, the growing demand and the diverse patterns of mobile traffic place an increasing strain on cellular networks. To cater to the large volumes of traffic delivered by the new services and applications, the future 5G network will provide the fundamental infrastructure for billions of new devices with less predictable traffic patterns will join the network. The 5G technology is presently in its early research stages, so researches are currently underway exploring different architectural paths to address their key drivers. SDN techniques have been seen as promising enablers for this vision of carrier networks, which will likely play a crucial role in the design of 5G wireless networks. A critical understanding of this emerging paradigm is necessary to address the multiple challenges of the future SDN-enabled 5G technology. To address this requirement, a survey the emerging trends and prospects, followed by in-depth discussion of major challenges in this area are discussed.
