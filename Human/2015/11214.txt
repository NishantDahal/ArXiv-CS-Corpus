Collaborative Bibliographic System for Review/Survey Articles

This paper proposes a Bibliographic system intends to exchange bibliographic information of survey/review articles by relying on Web service technology. It allows researchers and university students to interact with system via single service using platform-independent standard named Web service to add, search and retrieve bibliographic information of review articles in various science and technology fields and build-up a dedicated database for these articles in each science and technology field. Additionally, different implementation scenarios of the proposed system are presented and described, and rich features that offered by such system are studied and described. However, this paper explains the proposed system using computing area due to the existence of detailed taxonomy of this area, which allows defining the system, their functionalities and features provided. However, the proposed system is not only confined to computing area, it can support any other science and technology area without any need to modify this system.
