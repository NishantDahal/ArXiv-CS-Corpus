On the Capacity of Symmetric Gaussian Interference Channels with Feedback

In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme for symmetric Gaussian interference channels with feedback based on the ideas of time-varying coding schemes. The proposed scheme improves the Suh-Tse and Kramer inner bounds of the channel capacity for the cases of weak and not very strong interference. This improvement is more significant when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not very high. It is shown theoretically and numerically that our coding scheme can outperform the Kramer code. In addition, the generalized degrees-of-freedom of our proposed coding scheme is equal to the Suh-Tse scheme in the strong interference case. The numerical results show that our coding scheme can attain better performance than the Suh-Tse coding scheme for all channel parameters. Furthermore, the simplicity of the encoding/decoding algorithms is another strong point of our proposed coding scheme compared with the Suh-Tse coding scheme. More importantly, our results show that an optimal coding scheme for the symmetric Gaussian interference channels with feedback can be achieved by using only marginal posterior distributions under a better cooperation strategy between transmitters.
