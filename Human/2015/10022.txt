Can JSP Code be Generated Using XML Tags?

Over the years, a variety of web services have started using server-side scripting to deliver results back to a client as a paid or free service; one such server-side scripting language is Java Server Pages (JSP). Also Extensible markup language (XML), is being adopted by most web developers as a tool to describe data.Therefore, we present a conversion method which uses predefined XML tags as input and generates the corresponding JSP code. However, the end users are required to have a basic experience with web pages. This conversion method aims to reduce the time and effort spent by the user (web developer) to get acquainted with JSP. The conversion process abstracts the user from the intricacies of JSP and enables him to focus on the business logic.
