Adaptive Digital Scan Variable Pixels

The square and rectangular shape of the pixels in the digital images for sensing and display purposes introduces several inaccuracies in the representation of digital images. The major disadvantage of square pixel shapes is the inability to accurately capture and display the details in the objects having variable orientations to edges, shapes and regions. This effect can be observed by the inaccurate representation of diagonal edges in low resolution square pixel images. This paper explores a less investigated idea of using variable shaped pixels for improving visual quality of image scans without increasing the square pixel resolution. The proposed adaptive filtering technique reports an improvement in image PSNR.
