The era of the PC platform left a legacy of competitive strategies for the future technologies to follow. However, this notion became more complicated, once the future grew out to be a present with huge bundle of innovative technologies, Internet capabilities, communication possibilities, and ease in life. A major step of moving from a product phone to a smart phone, eventually to a mobile device has created a new industry with humongous potential for further developments. The current mobile platform market is witnessing a platforms-war with big players such as Apple, Google, Nokia and Microsoft in a major role. An important aspect of today's mobile platform market is the contributions made through open source initiatives which promote innovation. This paper gives an insight into the open-source software strategies of the leading players and its implications on the market. It first gives a precise overview of the past leading to the current mobile platform market share state. Then it briefs about the open-source software components used and released by Apple, Google and Nokia platforms, leading to their mobile platform strategies with regard to open source. Finally, the paper assesses the situation from the point of view of communities of software developers complementing each platform.
