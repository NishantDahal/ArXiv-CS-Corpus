Feasibility Evaluation of 6LoWPAN over Bluetooth Low Energy

IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) is an emerging technology to enable ubiquitous IoT services. However, there are very few studies of the performance evaluation on real hardware environments. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of 6LoWPAN through conducting a preliminary performance evaluation of a commodity hardware environment, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) network, Raspberry Pi, and a laptop PC. Our experimental results show that the power consumption of 6LoWPAN over BLE is one-tenth lower than that of IP over WiFi; the performance significantly depends on the distance between devices and the message size; and the communication completely stops when bursty traffic transfers. This observation provides our optimistic conclusions on the feasibility of 6LoWPAN although the maturity of implementations is a remaining issue.
