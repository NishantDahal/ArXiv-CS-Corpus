Cyclic codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4+u\mathbb{Z}_4$

In this paper, we have studied cyclic codes over the ring $R=\mathbb{Z}_4+u\mathbb{Z}_4$, $u^2=0$. We have considered cyclic codes of odd lengths. A sufficient condition for a cyclic code over $R$ to be a $\mathbb{Z}_4$-free module is presented. We have provided the general form of the generators of a cyclic code over $R$ and determined a formula for the ranks of such codes. In this paper we have mainly focused on principally generated cyclic codes of odd length over $R$. We have determined a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for cyclic codes of odd lengths over $R$ to be $R$-free.
