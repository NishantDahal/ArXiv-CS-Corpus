Future Large-Scale Memristive Device Crossbar Arrays: Limits Imposed by Sneak-Path Currents on Read Operations

Passive crossbar arrays based upon memristive devices, at crosspoints, hold great promise for the future high-density and non-volatile memories. The most significant challenge facing memristive device based crossbars today is the problem of sneak-path currents. In this paper, we investigate a memristive device with intrinsic rectification behavior to suppress the sneak-path currents in crossbar arrays. The device model is implemented in Verilog-A language and is simulated to match device characteristics readily available in the literature. Then, we systematically evaluate the read operation performance of large-scale crossbar arrays utilizing our proposed model in terms of read margin and power consumption while considering different crossbar sizes, interconnect resistance values, HRS/LRS (High Resistance State/Low Resistance State) values, rectification ratios and different read-schemes. The outcomes of this study are understanding the trade-offs among read margin, power consumption, read-schemes and most importantly providing a guideline for circuit designers to improve the performance of a memory based crossbar structure. In addition, read operation performance comparison of the intrinsic rectifying memristive device model with other memristive device models are studied.
