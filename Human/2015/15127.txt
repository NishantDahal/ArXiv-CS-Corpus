A Survey of Digital Privacy Rights Under CISA

The recent passing of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 introduces a new framework for information sharing between private and US government entities with the expressed intent to identify cybersecurity threats. This is the latest in a series of similar bills that have been introduced to Congress over the last several years. While each of the previous standalone bills were defeated following widespread public resistance, the latest edition was included as an amendment to the United States' 2016 spending bill. This means that any dissenting congressmen unwilling to pass the spending bill with the CISA rider would be willing to risk another government shutdown due to the inability to come to terms on the budget measures. This paper seeks to explore the potential impacts of the measures introduced or enabled by CISA, and consider the formalization of digital privacy rights in an increasingly online and monitored world.
