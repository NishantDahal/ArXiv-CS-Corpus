Interference-Nulling Time-Reversal Beamforming for mm-Wave Massive MIMO in Multi-User Frequency-Selective Indoor Channels

Millimeter wave (mm-wave) and massive MIMO have been proposed for next generation wireless systems. However, there are many open problems for the implementation of those technologies. In particular, beamforming is necessary in mm-wave systems in order to counter high propagation losses. However, conventional beamsteering is not always appropriate in rich scattering multipath channels with frequency selective fading, such as those found in indoor environments. In this context, time-reversal (TR) is considered a promising beamforming technique for such mm-wave massive MIMO systems. In this paper, we analyze a baseband TR beamforming system for mm-wave multi-user massive MIMO. We verify that, as the number of antennas increases, TR yields good equalization and interference mitigation properties, but inter-user interference (IUI) remains a main impairment. Thus, we propose a novel technique called interference-nulling TR (INTR) to minimize IUI. We evaluate numerically the performance of INTR and compare it with conventional TR and equalized TR beamforming. We use a 60 GHz MIMO channel model with spatial correlation based on the IEEE 802.11ad SISO NLoS model. We demonstrate that INTR outperforms conventional TR with respect to average BER per user and achievable sum rate under diverse conditions, providing both diversity and multiplexing gains simultaneously.
