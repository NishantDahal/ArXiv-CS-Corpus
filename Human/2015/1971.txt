Modeling Curved Carbon Fiber Composite (CFC) Structures in the Transmission-Line Modeling (TLM) Method

A new embedded model for curved thin panels is developed in the Transmission Line Modeling (TLM) method. In this model, curved panels are first linearized and then embedded between adjacent 2D TLM nodes allowing for arbitrary positioning between adjacent node centers. The embedded model eliminates the necessity for fine discretization thus reducing the run time and memory requirements for the calculation. The accuracy and convergence of the model are verified by comparing the resonant frequencies of an elliptical cylinder formed using carbon fiber composite (CFC) materials with those of the equivalent metal cylinder. Furthermore, the model is used to analyze the shielding performance of CFC airfoil NACA2415.
