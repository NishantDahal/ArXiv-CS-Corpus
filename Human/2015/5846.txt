Pfaffian Systems of A-Hypergeometric Systems II --- Holonomic Gradient Method

We give two efficient methods to derive Pfaffian systems for A-hypergeometric systems for the application to the holonomic gradient method for statistics. We utilize the Hilbert driven Buchberger algorithm and Macaulay type matrices in the two methods.
