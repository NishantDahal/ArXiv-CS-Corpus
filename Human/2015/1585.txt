Bi-Level Image Thresholding obtained by means of Kaniadakis Entropy

In this paper we are proposing the use of Kaniadakis entropy in the bi-level thresholding of images, in the framework of a maximum entropy principle. We discuss the role of its entropic index in determining the threshold and in driving an "image transition", that is, an abrupt transition in the appearance of the corresponding bi-level image. Some examples are proposed to illustrate the method and for comparing it to the approach which is using the Tsallis entropy.
