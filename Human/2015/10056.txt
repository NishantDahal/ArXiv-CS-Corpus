Easy steps towards a sane IT policy in hospitals

We witnessed the low quality of IT solutions in Paris hospitals. The price paid to private companies for these solutions and the cost incurred from their inefficiency constitute a gross and appalling waste of public resources. We propose to bootstrap a change in IT policy by having heads of department hire IT workers ; we give advice to the central decision making body on how to incentivize them. Easily measurable efficiency gains as well as hard-to-quantify positive externalities will follow.
