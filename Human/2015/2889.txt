A Finite Model Property for Intersection Types

We show that the relational theory of intersection types known as BCD has the finite model property; that is, BCD is complete for its finite models.  Our proof uses rewriting techniques which have as an immediate by-product the polynomial time decidability of the preorder <= (although this also follows from the so called beta soundness of BCD).
