Anonymous online purchases with exhaustive operational security

This paper describes the process of remaining anonymous online and its concurrent operational security that has to be performed. It focusses particularly on remaining anonymous while purchasing online goods, resulting in anonymously bought items. Different aspects of the operational security process as well as anonymously funding with cryptocurrencies are described. Eventually it is shown how to anonymously purchase items and services from the hidden web, as well as the delivery. It is shown that, while becoming increasingly difficult, it is still possible to make anonymous purchases. Our presented work combines existing best-practices and deliberately avoids untested novel approaches when possible.
