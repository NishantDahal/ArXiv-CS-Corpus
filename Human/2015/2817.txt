Project portfolio selection: Multi-criteria analysis and interactions between projects

In the project portfolio management, the project selection phase presents the greatest interest. In this article, we focus on this important phase by proposing a new method of projects selection consisting of several steps. We propose as a first step, a classification of projects based on the three most important criteria namely the value maximization, risk minimization and strategic alignment. The second step is building alternatives portfolio by the portfolio managers taking into account the classification of projects already completed in the first step. The third and final step enables the identification of the alternative portfolio to consider the contribution of projects to achieve the organization objectives as well as interactions between projects.
