Empirical Coordination with Two-Sided State Information and Correlated Source and State

The coordination of autonomous agents is a critical issue for decentralized communication networks. Instead of transmitting information, the agents interact in a coordinated manner in order to optimize a general objective function. A target joint probability distribution is achievable if there exists a code such that the sequences of symbols are jointly typical. The empirical coordination is strongly related to the joint source-channel coding with two-sided state information and correlated source and state. This problem is also connected to state communication and is open for non-causal encoder and decoder. We characterize the optimal solutions for perfect channel, for lossless decoding, for independent source and channel, for causal encoding and for causal decoding.
