MaxOutProbe: An Algorithm for Increasing the Size of Partially Observed Networks

Networked representations of real-world phenomena are often partially observed, which lead to incomplete networks. Analysis of such incomplete networks can lead to skewed results. We examine the following problem: given an incomplete network, which $b$ nodes should be probed to bring the largest number of new nodes into the observed network? Many graph-mining tasks require having observed a considerable amount of the network. Examples include community discovery, belief propagation, influence maximization, etc. For instance, consider someone who has observed a portion (say 1%) of the Twitter retweet network via random tweet sampling. She wants to estimate the size of the largest connected component of the fully observed retweet network. To improve her estimate, how should she use her limited budget to reduce the incompleteness of the network? In this work, we propose a novel algorithm, called MaxOutProbe, which uses a budget $b$ (on nodes probed) to increase the size of the observed network in terms of the number of nodes. Our experiments, across a range of datasets and conditions, demonstrate the advantages of MaxOutProbe over existing methods.
