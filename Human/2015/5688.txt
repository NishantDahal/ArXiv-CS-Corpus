Efficient Multiplex for Band-Limited Channels: Galois-Field Division Multiple Access

A new Efficient-bandwidth code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) for band-limited channels is introduced which is based on finite field transforms. A multilevel code division multiplex exploits orthogonality properties of nonbinary sequences defined over a complex finite field. Galois-Fourier transforms contain some redundancy and just cyclotomic coefficients are needed to be transmitted yielding compact spectrum requirements. The primary advantage of such schemes regarding classical multiplex is their better spectral efficiency. This paper estimates the \textit{bandwidth compactness factor} relatively to Time Division Multiple Access TDMA showing that it strongly depends on the alphabet extension. These multiplex schemes termed Galois Division Multiplex (GDM) are based on transforms for which there exists fast algorithms. They are also convenient from the implementation viewpoint since they can be implemented by a Digital Signal Processor.
