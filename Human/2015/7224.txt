Optimal $γ$ and $C$ for $ε$-Support Vector Regression with RBF Kernels

The objective of this study is to investigate the efficient determination of $C$ and $γ$ for Support Vector Regression with RBF or mahalanobis kernel based on numerical and statistician considerations, which indicates the connection between $C$ and kernels and demonstrates that the deviation of geometric distance of neighbour observation in mapped space effects the predict accuracy of $ε$-SVR. We determinate the arrange of $γ$ & $C$ and propose our method to choose their best values.
