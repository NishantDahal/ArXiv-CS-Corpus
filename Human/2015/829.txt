Adaptive Control of 4-DoF Robot manipulator

In experimental robotics, researchers may face uncertainties in parameters of a robot manipulator that they are working with. This uncertainty may be caused by deviations in the manufacturing process of a manipulator, or changes applied to manipulator in the lab for sake of experiments. Another situation when dynamical and inertial parameters of a robot are uncertain arises, is the grasping of objects by a manipulator. In all these situations there is a need for adaptive control strategies that would identify changes in dynamical properties of manipulator and adjust for them. This article presents a work on designing of an adaptive control strategy for 4-DoF manipulator with uncertain dynamical properties, and outcomes of testing of this strategy applied to control of simulator of robot.
