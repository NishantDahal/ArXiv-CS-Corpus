On the Effect of I/Q Imbalance on Energy Detection and a Novel Four-Level Hypothesis Spectrum Sensing

Direct-conversion transceivers are in demand, due to low implementation cost of analog front-ends. However, these transmitters or receivers introduce imperfections such as in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalances. In this paper, we first investigate the effect of I/Q imbalance on the performance of primary system, and show that these impairments can severely degrade the performance of cognitive radio system that are based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple access scheme. Next, we design a new four-level hypothesis blind detector for spectrum sensing in such cognitive radio system, and show that the proposed detector is less vulnerable to I/Q imbalance than conventional two-level detectors.
