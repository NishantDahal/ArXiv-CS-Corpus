Frequency Hopping on a 5G Millimeter-Wave Uplink

In order to overcome the anticipated tremendous growth in the volume of mobile data traffic, the next generation of cellular networks will need to exploit the large bandwidth offered by the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. A key distinguishing characteristic of mmWave is its use of highly directional and steerable antennas. In addition, future networks will be highly densified through the proliferation of base stations and their supporting infrastructure. With the aim of further improving the overall throughput of the network by mitigating the effect of frequency-selective fading and co-channel interference, 5G cellular networks are also expected to aggressively use frequency-hopping. This paper outlines an analytical framework that captures the main characteristics of a 5G cellular uplink. This framework is used to emphasize the benefits of network infrastructure densification, antenna directivity, mmWave propagation characteristics, and frequency hopping.
