Wavelet based Watermarking approach in the Compressive Sensing Scenario

Due to the wide distribution and usage of digital media, an important issue is protection of the digital content. There is a number of algorithms and techniques developed for the digital watermarking.In this paper, the invisible image watermark procedure is considered. Watermark is created as a pseudo random sequence, embedded in the certain region of the image, obtained using Haar wavelet decomposition. Generally, the watermarking procedure should be robust to the various attacks-filtering, noise etc. Here we assume the Compressive sensing scenario as a new signal processing technique that may influence the robustness. The focus of this paper was the possibility of the watermark detection under Compressive Sensing attack with different number of available image coefficients. The quality of the reconstructed images has been evaluated using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).The theory is supported with experimental results.
