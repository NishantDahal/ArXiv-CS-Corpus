HALO: Report and Predicted Response Times

HALO: Heterogeneity-Aware Load Balancing is a paper that proposes a class of heterogeneity-aware Load Balancers (LBs) for cluster systems. LBs that are heterogeneity-aware are able to detect when servers differ in speeds and in number of cores. Response times for heterogeneous systems are calculated and presented.
