Interference Functionals in Poisson Networks

We propose and prove a theorem that allows the calculation of a class of functionals on Poisson point processes that have the form of expected values of sum-products of functions. In proving the theorem, we present a variant of the Campbell-Mecke theorem from stochastic geometry. We proceed to apply our result in the calculation of expected values involving interference in wireless Poisson networks. Based on this, we derive outage probabilities for transmissions in a Poisson network with Nakagami fading. Our results extend the stochastic geometry toolbox used for the mathematical analysis of interference-limited wireless networks.
