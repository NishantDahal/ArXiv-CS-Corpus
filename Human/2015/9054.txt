Quantum Computing Assisted Medium Access Control for Multiple Client Station Networks

A medium access control protocol based on quantum entanglement has been introduced by Berces and Imre (2006) and Van Meter (2012). This protocol entirely avoids collisions. It is assumed that the network consists of one access point and two client stations. We extend this scheme to a network with an arbitrary number of client stations. We propose three approaches, namely, the qubit distribution, transmit first election and temporal ordering protocols. The qubit distribution protocol leverages the concepts of Bell-EPR pair or W state triad. It works for networks of up to four CSs. With up to three CSs, there is no probability of collision. In a four-CS network, there is a low probability of collision. The transmit first election protocol and temporal ordering protocols work for a network with any number of CSs. The transmit first election builds upon the concept of W state of size corresponding to the number of client stations. It is fair and collision free. The temporal ordering protocol employs the concepts of Lehmer code and quantum oracle. It is collision free, has a normalized throughput of 100% and achieves quasi-fairness.
