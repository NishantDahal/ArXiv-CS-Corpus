Proceedings 8th International Workshop on Computing with Terms and Graphs

This volume contains the post-proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Computing with Terms and Graphs (TERMGRAPH 2014). The workshop took place in Vienna on July 13, 2014 and was affiliated with the joint RTA and TLCA conference, which was part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC), which in turn participated in the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) 2014.
  The four regular papers in these proceedings are significantly extended versions of their pre-proceedings version. They were subjected to an additional round of reviewing. The paper by Samuel Mimram is an invited contribution.
