A Fuzzy MLP Approach for Non-linear Pattern Classification

In case of decision making problems, classification of pattern is a complex and crucial task. Pattern classification using multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained with back propagation learning becomes much complex with increase in number of layers, number of nodes and number of epochs and ultimate increases computational time [31]. In this paper, an attempt has been made to use fuzzy MLP and its learning algorithm for pattern classification. The time and space complexities of the algorithm have been analyzed. A training performance comparison has been carried out between MLP and the proposed fuzzy-MLP model by considering six cases. Results are noted against different learning rates ranging from 0 to 1. A new performance evaluation factor 'convergence gain' has been introduced. It is observed that the number of epochs drastically reduced and performance increased compared to MLP. The average and minimum gain has been found to be 93% and 75% respectively. The best gain is found to be 95% and is obtained by setting the learning rate to 0.55.
