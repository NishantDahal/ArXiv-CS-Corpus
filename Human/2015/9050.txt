Compensation of Amplifier Distortion for OFDM signals based on Iterative Hard Thresholding

The mitigation of nonlinear distortion caused by power amplifiers (PA) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems is an essential issue to enable energy efficient operation. In this work we proposed a new algorithm for receiver-based clipping estimation in OFDM systems that combines the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) method with a weighting corresponding to the estimated probability of clipping. Thereby a more general amplifier input-output characteristic is considered, which is assumed to be unknown at the receiver side. Further, we avoid the use of dedicated subcarriers and formulate the recovery problem solely on reliably detected sub-carriers. Through simulations, we show that the proposed technique achieves a better complexity-performance tradeoff compared to existing methods.
