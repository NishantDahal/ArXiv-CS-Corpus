Implementation of Auto Monitoring and Short-Message-Service System via GSM Modem

Auto-Monitoring and Short-Messaging-Service System is a real-time monitoring system for any critical operational environments. It detects an undesired event occurring in the environment, generates an alert with detailed message and sends it to the user to prevent hazards. This system employs a Friendly ARM as main controller while, sensors and terminals to interact with the real world. A GSM network is utilized to bridge the communication between monitoring system and user. This paper presents details of prototyping the system.
