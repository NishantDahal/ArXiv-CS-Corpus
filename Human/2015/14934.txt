Guarding the Vertices of an Orthogonal Terrain using Vertex Guards

A terrain T is an x-monotone polygonal chain in the plane; T is orthogonal if each edge of T is either horizontal or vertical. In this paper, we give an exact algorithm for the problem of guarding the convex vertices of an orthogonal terrain with the minimum number of reflex vertices.
