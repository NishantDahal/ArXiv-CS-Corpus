Green WSN- Optimization of Energy Use Through Reduction in Communication Workload

Applications of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are growing day by day due to the ease of deployment, reduction in costs to affordable levels and versatility of these networks. Besides developing advanced micro fabrication technologies means are being devised to reduce energy consumption to bring the network setup and operational costs down. With increasing applications amount of energy consumed in these networks is enormous. Even a small savings in energy consumption will result in huge benefits in energy consumption globally. Bulk of the energy is consumed in communication activity of these networks. It is our endeavor to optimize this activity to make these networks energy efficient and thereby reducing their impact on the overall environment in line with the principle Go Green.
