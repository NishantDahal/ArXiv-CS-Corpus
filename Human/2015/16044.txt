On the complexity of computing Gröbner bases for weighted homogeneous systems

Solving polynomial systems arising from applications is frequently    made easier by the structure of the systems. Weighted homogeneity    (or quasi-homogeneity) is one example of such a structure: given a    system of weights $W=(w\_{1},\dots,w\_{n})$, $W$-homogeneous    polynomials are polynomials which are homogeneous w.r.t the weighted    degree    $°\_{W}(X\_{1}^{α\_{1}},\dots,X\_{n}^{α\_{n}}) = \sum    w\_{i}α\_{i}$.        Gröbner bases for weighted homogeneous systems can be computed by    adapting existing algorithms for homogeneous systems to the weighted    homogeneous case.  We show that in this case, the complexity    estimate for Algorithm~\F5    $\left(\binom{n+\dmax-1}{\dmax}^ω\right)$ can be divided by a    factor $\left(\prod w\_{i} \right)^ω$. For zero-dimensional    systems, the complexity of Algorithm~\FGLM $nD^ω$ (where $D$    is the number of solutions of the system) can be divided by the same    factor $\left(\prod w\_{i} \right)^ω$.    Under genericity    assumptions, for zero-dimensional weighted homogeneous systems of    $W$-degree $(d\_{1},\dots,d\_{n})$, these complexity estimates are polynomial in    the weighted Bézout bound    $\prod\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{i} / \prod\_{i=1}^{n}w\_{i}$.    Furthermore, the maximum degree reached in a run of Algorithm \F5 is    bounded by the weighted Macaulay bound $\sum (d\_{i}-w\_{i}) + w\_{n}$,    and this bound is sharp if we can order the weights so that    $w\_{n}=1$. For overdetermined semi-regular systems, estimates from    the homogeneous case can be adapted to the weighted case.    We provide some experimental results based on systems arising from a    cryptography problem and from polynomial inversion problems. They    show that taking advantage of the weighted homogeneous structure    yields substantial speed-ups, and allows us to solve systems which    were otherwise out of reach.
