A Circular Interference Model for Asymmetric Aggregate Interference

Scaling up the number of base stations per unit area is one of the major trends in mobile cellular systems of the fourth (4G)- and fifth generation (5G), making it increasingly difficult to characterize aggregate interference statistics with system models of low complexity. This paper proposes a new circular interference model that aggregates given interferer deployments to power profiles along circles. The model accurately preserves the original interference statistics while considerably reducing the amount of relevant interferers. In comparison to common approaches from stochastic geometry, it enables to characterize cell-center- and cell-edge users, and preserves effects that are otherwise concealed by spatial averaging. To enhance the analysis of given power profiles and to validate the accuracy of the circular model, a new finite sum representation for the sum of Gamma random variables with integer-valued shape parameter is introduced. The approach allows to decompose the distribution of the aggregate interference into the contributions of the individual interferers. Such knowledge is particularly expedient for the application of base station coordination- and cooperation schemes. Moreover, the proposed approach enables to accurately predict the corresponding signal-to-interference-ratio- and rate statistics.
