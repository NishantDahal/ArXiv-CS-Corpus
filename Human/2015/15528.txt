Computational Models for Multiview Dense Depth Maps of Dynamic Scene

This paper reviews the recent progresses of the depth map generation for dynamic scene and its corresponding computational models. This paper mainly covers the homogeneous ambiguity models in depth sensing, resolution models in depth processing, and consistency models in depth optimization. We also summarize the future work in the depth map generation.
