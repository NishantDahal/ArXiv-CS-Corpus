Extracting Traceability Information from C# Projects

The maintenance portion of the software lifecycle represents a major drain on most software companys resources. The transition from programmers to maintainers is high risk, since usually the maintainers have to learn the system from scratch before they can begin modifying it appropriately. This paper introduces a method for automatically extracting important traceability information from a C# software projects source code. Using this traceability information, maintainers (and programmers) are better able to evaluate the impacts their actions will have on the entire project.
