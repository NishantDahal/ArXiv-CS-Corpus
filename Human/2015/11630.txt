Leveraging One-hop Information in Massive MIMO Full-Duplex Wireless Systems

We consider a single-cell massive MIMO full-duplex wireless communication system, where the base-station (BS) is equipped with a large number of antennas. We consider the setup where the single-antenna mobile users operate in half- duplex, while each antenna at the BS is capable of full-duplex transmissions, i.e., it can transmit and receive simultaneously using the same frequency spectrum. The fundamental challenge in this system is intra-cell inter-node interference, generated by the transmissions of uplink users to the receptions at the downlink users. The key operational challenge is estimating and aggregating inter-mobile channel estimates, which can potentially overwhelm any gains from full-duplex operation.
  In this work, we propose a scalable and distributed scheme to optimally manage the inter-node interference by utilizing a "one- hop information architecture". In this architecture, the BS only needs to know the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) from the downlink users. Each uplink user needs its own SINR, along with a weighted signal-plus-noise metric from its one-hop neighboring downlink users, which are the downlink users that it interferes with. The proposed one-hop information architecture does not require any network devices to comprehensively gather the vast inter-node interference channel knowledge, and hence significantly reduces the overhead. Based on the one-hop information architecture, we design a distributed power control algorithm and implement such architecture using overheard feedback information. We show that, in typical asymptotic regimes with many users and antennas, the proposed distributed power control scheme improves the overall network utility and reduces the transmission power of the uplink users.
