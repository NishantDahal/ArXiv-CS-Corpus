Science Gateway for Distributed Multiscale Course Management in e-Science and e-Learning - Use Case for Study and Investigation of Functionalized Nanomaterials

The current tendency of human learning and teaching is targeted to development and integration of digital technologies (like cloud solutions, mobile technology, learning analytics, big data, augmented reality, natural interaction technologies, etc.). Our Science Gateway (http://scigate.imp.kiev.ua) in collaboration with High Performance Computing Center (http://hpcc.kpi.ua) is aimed on the close cooperation among the main actors in learning and researching world (teachers, students, scientists, supporting personnel, volunteers, etc.) with industry and academia to propose the new frameworks and interoperability requirements for the building blocks of a digital ecosystem for learning (including informal learning) that develops and integrates the current and new tools and systems. It is the portal for management of distributed courses (workflows), tools, resources, and users, which is constructed on the basis of the Liferay framework and gUSE/WS-PGRADE technology. It is based on development of multi-level approach (as to methods/algorithms) for effective study and research through flexible selection and combination of unified modules ("gaming" with modules as with LEGO-bricks). It allows us to provide the flexible and adjustable framework with direct involvement in real-world and scientific use cases motivated by the educational aims of students and real scientific aims in labs.
