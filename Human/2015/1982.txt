A discontinuous Galerkin method for cohesive zone modelling

We propose a discontinuous finite element method for small strain elasticity allowing for cohesive zone modeling. The method yields a seamless transition between the discontinuous Galerkin method and classical cohesive zone modeling. Some relevant numerical examples are presented.
