Distributed Security Constrained Economic Dispatch

In this paper, we investigate two decomposition methods for their convergence rate which are used to solve security constrained economic dispatch (SCED): 1) Lagrangian Relaxation (LR), and 2) Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation (ALR). First, the centralized SCED problem is posed for a 6-bus test network and then it is decomposed into subproblems using both of the methods. In order to model the tie-line between decomposed areas of the test network, a novel method is proposed. The advantages and drawbacks of each method are discussed in terms of accuracy and information privacy. We show that there is a tradeoff between the information privacy and the convergence rate. It has been found that ALR converges faster compared to LR, due to the large amount of shared data.
