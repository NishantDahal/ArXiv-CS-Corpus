A New DNA-Based Approach of Generating Key-dependent ShiftRows Transformation

The use of key-dependent shiftRows can be considered as one of the applied methods for altering the quality of a cryptographic algorithm. This article describes one approach for changing the ShiftRows transformation employed in the algorithm AES. The approach employs methods inspired from DNA processes and structure which depended on the key while the parameters of the created new ShiftRows have characteristics identical to those of the original algorithm AES in addition to increase its resistance against attacks. The proposed new ShiftRows were tested for coefficient correlation for dynamic and static independence between the input and output. The NIST Test Suite tests were used to test the randomness for the block cipher that used the new transformation.
