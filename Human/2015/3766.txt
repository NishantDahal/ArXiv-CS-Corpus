On two conjectures of Maurer concerning basis graphs of matroids

We characterize 2-dimensional complexes associated canonically with basis graphs of matroids as simply connected triangle-square complexes satisfying some local conditions. This proves a version of a (disproved) conjecture by Stephen Maurer (Conjecture 3 of S. Maurer, Matroid basis graphs I, JCTB 14 (1973), 216-240). We also establish Conjecture 1 from the same paper about the redundancy of the conditions in the characterization of basis graphs. We indicate positive-curvature-like aspects of the local properties of the studied complexes. We characterize similarly the corresponding 2-dimensional complexes of even $Î”$-matroids.
