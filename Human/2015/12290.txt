Computational models of attention

This chapter reviews recent computational models of visual attention. We begin with models for the bottom-up or stimulus-driven guidance of attention to salient visual items, which we examine in seven different broad categories. We then examine more complex models which address the top-down or goal-oriented guidance of attention towards items that are more relevant to the task at hand.
