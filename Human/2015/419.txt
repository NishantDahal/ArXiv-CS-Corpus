Optimal Signaling of MISO Full-Duplex Two-Way Wireless Channel

We model the self-interference in a multiple input single output (MISO) full-duplex two-way channel and evaluate the achievable rate region. We formulate the boundary of the achievable rate region termed as the Pareto boundary by a family of coupled, non-convex optimization problems. Our main contribution is decoupling and reformulating the original non-convex optimization problems to a family of convex semidefinite programming problems. For a MISO full-duplex two-way channel, we prove that beamforming is an optimal transmission strategy which can achieve any point on the Pareto boundary. Furthermore, we present a closed-form expression for the optimal beamforming weights. In our numerical examples we quantify gains in the achievable rates of the proposed beamforming over the zero-forcing beamforming.
