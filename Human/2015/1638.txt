Structured Descriptions of Roles, Activities,and Procedures in the Roman Constitution

A highly structured description of entities and events in histories can support flexible exploration of those histories by users and, ultimately, support richly-linked full-text digital libraries. Here, we apply the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) to structure a passage about the Roman Constitution from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Specifically, we consider the specification of Roles such as Consuls, Activities associated with those Roles, and Procedures for accomplishing those Activities.
