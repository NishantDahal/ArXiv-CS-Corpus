A Cyberinfrastructure-based Approach to Real Time Water Temperature Prediction

The prediction of water temperature is crucial for aquatic ecosystem studies and management. In this paper, we raise challenging issues in supporting real time water temperature prediction and present a system called WT-Agabus to address those issues. The WT-Agabus system is designed to be a cyberinfrastructure and to support various prediction models in a uniform way. In addition, we present a neural network-based water temperature prediction model to use only data available online from Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). In this paper, we also show the current prototype implementation of the WT-Agabus system to support the prediction model
