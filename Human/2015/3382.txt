A New Chaos-Based Cryptosystem for Secure Transmitted Images

This paper presents a novel and robust chaos-based cryptosystem for secure transmitted images and four other versions. In the proposed block encryption/decryption algorithm, a 2D chaotic map is used to shuffle the image pixel positions. Then, substitution (confusion) and permutation (diffusion) operations on every block, with multiple rounds, are combined using two perturbed chaotic PWLCM maps. The perturbing orbit technique improves the statistical properties of encrypted images. The obtained error propagation in various standard cipher block modes demonstrates that the proposed cryptosystem is suitable to transmit cipher data over a corrupted digital channel. Finally, to quantify the security level of the proposed cryptosystem, many tests are performed and experimental results show that the suggested cryptosystem has a high security level.
