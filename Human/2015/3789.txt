Polar Codes with Mixed-Kernels

A generalization of the polar coding scheme called mixed-kernels is introduced. This generalization exploits several homogeneous kernels over alphabets of different sizes. An asymptotic analysis of the proposed scheme shows that its polarization properties are strongly related to the ones of the constituent kernels. Simulation of finite length instances of the scheme indicate their advantages both in error correction performance and complexity compared to the known polar coding structures.
