Evolving hypernetwork model based on WeChat user relations

Based on the theory of hypernetwork and WeChat online social relations, the paper proposes an evolving hypernetwork model with the competitiveness and the age of nodes. In the model, nodes arrive at the system in accordance with Poisson process and are gradual aging. We analyze the model by using a Poisson process theory and a continuous technique, and give a characteristic equation of hyperdegrees. We obtain the stationary average hyperdegree distribution of the hypernetwork by the characteristic equation. The numerical simulations of the models agree with the analytical results well. It is expected that our work may give help to the study of WeChat information transmission dynamics and mobile e-commerce.
