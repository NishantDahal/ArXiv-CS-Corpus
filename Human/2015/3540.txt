Enhancing Satellite System Throughput Using Adaptive HARQ for Delay Tolerant Services in Mobile Communications

In this paper we propose the introduction of adaptive hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) in the context of mobile satellite communications. HARQ schemes which are commonly used in terrestrial links, can be adapted to improve the throughput for delay tolerant services. The proposed method uses the estimation of the mutual information between the received and the sent symbols, in order to estimate the number of bits necessary to decode the message at next transmission. We evaluate the performance of our method by simulating a land mobile satellite (LMS) channel. We compare our results with the static HARQ scheme, showing that our adaptive retransmission technique has better efficiency while keeping an acceptable delay for services.
