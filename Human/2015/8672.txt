Supervised Hierarchical Classification for Student Answer Scoring

This paper describes a hierarchical system that predicts one label at a time for automated student response analysis. For the task, we build a classification binary tree that delays more easily confused labels to later stages using hierarchical processes. In particular, the paper describes how the hierarchical classifier has been built and how the classification task has been broken down into binary subtasks. It finally discusses the motivations and fundamentals of such an approach.
