Hardware Probing Interface and Test Robustness

Computerized integrity test of an electronic product hardware interface and product probing validation are considered. Integrity testing is based on a current voltage characteristic measurement, when a small voltage and/or current stimuli are applied to the product pads including power supply circuitry pads, so that the product is not normally powered on. Test fixture needles validation is a part of a self test maintenance scenario designed to predict deterioration of product probing.
