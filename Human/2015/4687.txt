3D visual analysis of seabed on smartphone

We create a 'virtual-seabed' platform to realize the 3D visual analysis of seabed on smartphone. The 3D seabed platform is based on a 'section-drilling' model, implementing visualization and analysis of the integrated data of seabed on the 3D browser on smartphone. Some 3D visual analysis functions are developed. This work presents a thorough and interesting way of presenting seabed data on smartphone, which raises many application possibilities. This platform is another practical proof based on our WebVRGIS platform.
