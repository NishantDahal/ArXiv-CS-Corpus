Forecasting the Israeli 2015 elections using a smartphone application

We developed a smartphone application, Ha'Midgam, to poll and forecast the results of the 2015 Israeli elections. The application was downloaded by over 7,500 people. We present the method used to control bias in our sample and our forecasts. We discuss limitations of our approach and suggest possible solutions to control bias in similar applications.
