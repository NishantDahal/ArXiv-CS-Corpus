Balancing Communication for Multi-party Interactive Coding

We consider interactive coding in a setting where $n$ parties wish to compute a joint function of their inputs via an interactive protocol over imperfect channels. We assume that adversarial errors can comprise a $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n})$ fraction of the total communication, occurring anywhere on the communication network. Our goal is to maintain a constant multiplicative overhead in the total communication required, as compared to the error-free setting, and also to balance the workload over the different parties. We build upon the prior protocol of Jain, Kalai, and Lewko, but while that protocol relies on a single coordinator to shoulder a heavy burden throughout the protocol, we design a mechanism to pass the coordination duties from party to party, resulting in a more even distribution of communication over the course of the computation.
