Applying Social Media Intelligence for Predicting and Identifying On-line Radicalization and Civil Unrest Oriented Threats

Research shows that various social media platforms on Internet such as Twitter, Tumblr (micro-blogging websites), Facebook (a popular social networking website), YouTube (largest video sharing and hosting website), Blogs and discussion forums are being misused by extremist groups for spreading their beliefs and ideologies, promoting radicalization, recruiting members and creating online virtual communities sharing a common agenda. Popular microblogging websites such as Twitter are being used as a real-time platform for information sharing and communication during planning and mobilization if civil unrest related events. Applying social media intelligence for predicting and identifying online radicalization and civil unrest oriented threats is an area that has attracted several researchers' attention over past 10 years. There are several algorithms, techniques and tools that have been proposed in existing literature to counter and combat cyber-extremism and predicting protest related events in much advance. In this paper, we conduct a literature review of all these existing techniques and do a comprehensive analysis to understand state-of-the-art, trends and research gaps. We present a one class classification approach to collect scholarly articles targeting the topics and subtopics of our research scope. We perform characterization, classification and an in-depth meta analysis meta-anlaysis of about 100 conference and journal papers to gain a better understanding of existing literature.
