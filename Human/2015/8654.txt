{dasasap}, an App for Syllogisms

The main goal of this contribution is to introduce a cross-platform application to learn-teach syllogistic. We call this application \textit{dasasap} for \textit{develop all syllogisms as soon as possible}. To introduce this application we show the logical foundations for the game with a system we call $\mathcal{L}_\square$, and its interface developed with LiveCode.
