Procams-Based Cybernetics

Procams-based cybernetics is a unique, emerging research field, which aims at enhancing and supporting our activities by naturally connecting human and computers/machines as a cooperative integrated system via projector-camera systems (procams). It rests on various research domains such as virtual/augmented reality, computer vision, computer graphics, projection display, human computer interface, human robot interaction and so on. This laboratory presentation provides a brief history including recent achievements of our procams-based cybernetics project.
