Monotone Increasing Properties and Their Phase Transitions in Uniform Random Intersection Graphs

Uniform random intersection graphs have received much interest and been used in diverse applications. A uniform random intersection graph with $n$ nodes is constructed as follows: each node selects a set of $K_n$ different items uniformly at random from the same pool of $P_n$ distinct items, and two nodes establish an undirected edge in between if and only if they share at least one item. For such graph denoted by $G(n, K_n, P_n)$, we present the following results in this paper. First, we provide an exact analysis on the probabilities of $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ having a perfect matching and having a Hamilton cycle respectively, under $P_n = ω\big(n (\ln n)^5\big)$ (all asymptotic notation are understood with $n \to \infty$). The analysis reveals that just like ($k$-)connectivity shown in prior work, for both properties of perfect matching containment and Hamilton cycle containment, $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ also exhibits phase transitions: for each property above, as $K_n$ increases, the limit of the probability that $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ has the property increases from $0$ to $1$. Second, we compute the phase transition widths of $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ for $k$-connectivity (KC), perfect matching containment (PMC), and Hamilton cycle containment (HCC), respectively. For a graph property $R$ and a positive constant $a < \frac{1}{2}$, with the phase transition width $d_n(R, a)$ defined as the difference between the minimal $K_n$ ensuring $G(n, K_n, P_n)$ having property $R$ with probability at least $1-a$ or $a$, we show for any positive constants $a<\frac{1}{2}$ and $k$: (i) If $P_n=Ω(n)$ and $P_n=o(n\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)$ is either $0$ or $1$ for each $n$ sufficiently large. (ii) If $P_n=Θ(n\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)=Θ(1)$. (iii) If $P_n=ω(n\ln n)$, then $d_n(KC, a)=ω(1)$. (iv) If $P_n=ω\big(n (\ln n)^5\big)$, $d_n(PMC, a)$ and $d_n(HCC, a)$ are both $ω(1)$.
