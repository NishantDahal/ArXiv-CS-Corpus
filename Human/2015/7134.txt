Semi-canonical binary matrices

In this paper, we define the concepts of semi-canonical and canonical binary matrix. Strictly mathematical, we prove the correctness of these definitions. We describe and we implement an algorithm for finding all semi-canonical binary matrices taking into account the number of 1 in each of them. This problem relates to the combinatorial problem of finding all pairs of disjoint S-permutation matrices. In the described algorithm, the bit-wise operations are substantially used.
