Generating ordered list of Recommended Items: a Hybrid Recommender System of Microblog

Precise recommendation of followers helps in improving the user experience and maintaining the prosperity of twitter and microblog platforms. In this paper, we design a hybrid recommender system of microblog as a solution of KDD Cup 2012, track 1 task, which requires predicting users a user might follow in Tencent Microblog. We describe the background of the problem and present the algorithm consisting of keyword analysis, user taxonomy, (potential)interests extraction and item recommendation. Experimental result shows the high performance of our algorithm. Some possible improvements are discussed, which leads to further study.
