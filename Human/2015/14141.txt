Tiling with Small Tiles

We look at sets of tiles that can tile any region of size greater than 1 on the square grid. This is not the typical tiling question, but relates closely to it and therefore can help solve other tiling problems -- we give an example of this. We also present a result to a more classic tiling question with dominoes and L-shape tiles.
