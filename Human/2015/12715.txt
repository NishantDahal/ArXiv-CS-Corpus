Sponges and Engines: An introduction to Keccak and Keyak

In this document we present an introductory overview of the algorithms and design components underlying the Keccac cryptographic primitive and the Keyak encryption scheme for authenticated (session-supporting) encryption. This document aims to familiarize readers with the basic principles of authenticated encryption, the Sponge and Duplex constructions (full-state, keyed as well as regular versions), the permutation functions underlying Keccak and Keyak as well as Keyak v2's Motorist mode of operation.
