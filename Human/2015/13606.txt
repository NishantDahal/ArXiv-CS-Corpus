When is P such that l_0-minimization Equals to l_p-minimization

In this paper, we present an analysis expression of p(A,b) such that the unique solution to l_0-minimization also can be the unique solution to l_p-minimization for any 0<p<p(A,b). Furthermore, the main contribution of this paper isn't only the analysis expressed of such p^(A,b) but also its proof. Finally, we display the results of two examples to confirm the validity of our conclusions
