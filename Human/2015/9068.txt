Analysis of Activities and Operations in the Current E-Health Landscape in Tanzania: Focus on Interoperability and Collaboration

Although the basic application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the Tanzanian health care systems started years ago, still fragmentation of Information Systems (IS) and limited interoperability remain to be big challenges. In this paper, we present an analysis done on the present health care delivery service, HIS and on some of existing eHealth solutions focusing on interoperability and collaboration. Through interviews, questionnaires and analysis on e-health implementations in relation to interoperability and collaboration we have established that, the lack of standard procedures to guide the lifecycle of eHealth systems across the health sector and poor willingness to collaboration among health stakeholders are key issues which hinders the manifestation of the benefit of ICT use in the health sector of Tanzania. Based on the findings, we provide some recommendations with a view to improve interoperability and collaboration.
