Bounding the Clique-Width of $H$-free Split Graphs

A graph is $H$-free if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$. We continue a study into the boundedness of clique-width of subclasses of perfect graphs. We identify five new classes of $H$-free split graphs whose clique-width is bounded. Our main result, obtained by combining new and known results, provides a classification of all but two stubborn cases, that is, with two potential exceptions we determine all graphs $H$ for which the class of $H$-free split graphs has bounded clique-width.
