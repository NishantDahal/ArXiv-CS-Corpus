Practical Algorithms for Linear Boolean-width

In this paper, we give a number of new exact algorithms and heuristics to compute linear boolean decompositions, and experimentally evaluate these algorithms. The experimental evaluation shows that significant improvements can be made with respect to running time without increasing the width of the generated decompositions. We also evaluated dynamic programming algorithms on linear boolean decompositions for several vertex subset problems. This evaluation shows that such algorithms are often much faster (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to theoretical worst case bounds.
