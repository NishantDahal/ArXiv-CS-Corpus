Outage Probability of Overhearing Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Relaying

This paper investigates the outage performance of overhearing amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative relaying, where a source transmits information to its destination through multiple helping overhearing AF relays with space-time network coding (STNC) employed. Firstly, the transmission protocol of such a relaying system, i.e., cooperative relaying with overhearing AF relays based on STNC (STNC-OHAF) is presented. Then, the instantaneous end-to-end SNR expression of STNC-OHAF is analysed. Based on this, an explicit expression of the outage probability for STNC-OHAF over independent but not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Rayleigh fading channels is theoretically derived. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and show that by introducing overhearing among relays, the outage performance of the system can be greatly improved. It also shows that there is a trade-off between system sum outage capacity and the transmitted number of symbols.
