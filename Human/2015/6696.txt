Parallel Vectorized Algebraic AES in MATLAB for Rapid Prototyping of Encrypted Sensor Processing Algorithms and Database Analytics

The increasing use of networked sensor systems and networked databases has led to an increased interest in incorporating encryption directly into sensor algorithms and database analytics. MATLAB is the dominant tool for rapid prototyping of sensor algorithms and has extensive database analytics capabilities. The advent of high level and high performance Galois Field mathematical environments allows encryption algorithms to be expressed succinctly and efficiently. This work leverages the Galois Field primitives found the MATLAB Communication Toolbox to implement a mode of the Advanced Encrypted Standard (AES) based on first principals mathematics. The resulting implementation requires 100x less code than standard AES implementations and delivers speed that is effective for many design purposes. The parallel version achieves speed comparable to native OpenSSL on a single node and is sufficient for real-time prototyping of many sensor processing algorithms and database analytics.
