Parabolic equations on digital spaces. Solutions on the digital Moebius strip and the digital projective plane

In this work, we define a parabolic equation on digital spaces and study its properties. The equation can be used in investigation of mechanical, aerodynamic, structural and technological properties of a Moebius strip, which is used as a basic element of a new configuration of an airplane wing. Condition for existence of exact solutions by a matrix method and a method of separation of variables are studied and determined. As examples, numerical solutions on Moebius strip and projective plane are presented.
