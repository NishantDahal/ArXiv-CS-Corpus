Wikipedia Page View Reflects Web Search Trend

The frequency of a web search keyword generally reflects the degree of public interest in a particular subject matter. Search logs are therefore useful resources for trend analysis. However, access to search logs is typically restricted to search engine providers. In this paper, we investigate whether search frequency can be estimated from a different resource such as Wikipedia page views of open data. We found frequently searched keywords to have remarkably high correlations with Wikipedia page views. This suggests that Wikipedia page views can be an effective tool for determining popular global web search trends.
