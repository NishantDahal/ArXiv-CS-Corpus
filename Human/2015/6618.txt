Perfect graphs: a survey

Perfect graphs were defined by Claude Berge in the 1960s. They are important objects for graph theory, linear programming and combinatorial optimization. Claude Berge made a conjecture about them, that was proved by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas in 2002, and is now called the strong perfect graph theorem. This is a survey about perfect graphs, mostly focused on the strong perfect graph theorem.
