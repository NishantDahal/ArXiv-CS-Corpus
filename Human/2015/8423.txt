Opportunistic Beamforming with Wireless Powered 1-bit Feedback Through Rectenna Array

This letter deals with the opportunistic beamforming (OBF) scheme for multi-antenna downlink with spatial randomness. In contrast to conventional OBF, the terminals return only 1-bit feedback, which is powered by wireless power transfer through a rectenna array. We study two fundamental topologies for the combination of the rectenna elements; the direct-current combiner and the radio-frequency combiner. The beam outage probability is derived in closed form for both combination schemes, by using high order statistics and stochastic geometry.
