A note on the dynamic dominant resource fairness mechanism

Multi-resource fair allocation has beena hot topic of resource allocation. Most recently, a dynamic dominant resource fairness (DRF) mechanism is proposed for dynamic multi-resource fair allocation. In this paper, we prove that the competitive ratio of the dynamic DRF mechanism is the reciprocal of the number of resource types, for two different objectives. Moreover, we develop a linear-time algorithm to find a dynamic DRF solution at each step.
