Optimization of Quality of Experience through File Duplication in Video Sharing Servers

Consumers of short videos on Internet can have a bad Quality of Experience QoE due to the long distance between the consumers and the servers that hosting the videos. We propose an optimization of the file allocation in telecommunication operators content sharing servers to improve the QoE through files duplication, thus bringing the files closer to the consumers. This optimization allows the network operator to set the level of QoE and to have control over the users access cost by setting a number of parameters. Two optimization methods are given and are followed by a comparison of their efficiency. Also, the hosting costs versus the gain of optimization are analytically discussed.
