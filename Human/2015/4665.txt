An extension of the Ky Fan inequality

The aim of this paper is to analyze the weighted KyFan inequality proposed in [11]. A number of numerical simulations involving the exponential weighted function is given. We show that in several cases and types of examples one can imply an improvement of the standard KyFan inequality.
