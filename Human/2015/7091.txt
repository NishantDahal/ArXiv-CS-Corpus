On relative weighted entropies with central moments weight functions

Following [1], the aim of this paper is to analyze the relative weighted entropy involving the central moments weight functions. We compare the standard relative entropy with the weighted case in two particular forms of Gaussian distributions. As an application, the weighted deviance information criterion is proposed.
