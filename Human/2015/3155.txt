Brain Tumor Segmentation: A Comparative Analysis

Five different threshold segmentation based approaches have been reviewed and compared over here to extract the tumor from set of brain images. This research focuses on the analysis of image segmentation methods, a comparison of five semi-automated methods have been undertaken for evaluating their relative performance in the segmentation of tumor. Consequently, results are compared on the basis of quantitative and qualitative analysis of respective methods. The purpose of this study was to analytically identify the methods, most suitable for application for a particular genre of problems. The results show that of the region growing segmentation performed better than rest in most cases.
