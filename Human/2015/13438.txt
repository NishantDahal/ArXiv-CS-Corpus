The Quasi cellular nets-based models of transport and logistic systems

There are many systems in different subjects such as industry, medicine, transport, social and others, can be discribed on their dynamic of flows. Nowadays models of flows consist of micro- and macro-models. In practice there is a problem of convertation from different levels of simulation. In the different articles author descriptes quasi cellular nets. Quasi cellular nets are new type of discrete structures without signature. It may be used for simulation instruments. This structures can simulate flows on micro- and macro levels on the single model structure. In this article described using quasi cellular nets in transport and logistics of open-cast mining.
