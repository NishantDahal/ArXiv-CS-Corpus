A lower bound for the dispersion on the torus

We consider the volume of the largest axis-parallel box in the $d$-dimensional torus that contains no point of a given point set $\mathcal{P}_n$ with $n$ elements. We prove that, for all natural numbers $d, n$ and every point set $\mathcal{P}_n$, this volume is bounded from below by $\min\{1,d/n\}$. This implies the same lower bound for the discrepancy on the torus.
