Robustness enhancement of cloud computing network based on coupled networks model

As a novel technology, cloud computing attracts more and more people including technology enthusiasts and malicious users. Different from the classical network architecture, cloud environment has many its own features which make the traditional defense mechanism invalid. To make the network more robust against a malicious attack, we introduce a new method to mitigate this risk efficiently and systematically. In this paper, we first propose a coupled networks model which adequately considers the interactions between physical layer and virtual layer in a practical cloud computing environment. Based on this new model and our systematical method, we show that with the addition of protection of some specific nodes in the network structure, the robustness of cloud computing's network can be significantly improved whereas their functionality remains unchanged. Our results demonstrate that our new method can effectively settle the hard problems which cloud computing now is facing without much cost.
