Time vs. Information Tradeoffs for Leader Election in Anonymous Trees

The leader election task calls for all nodes of a network to agree on a single node. If the nodes of the network are anonymous, the task of leader election is formulated as follows: every node $v$ of the network must output a simple path, coded as a sequence of port numbers, such that all these paths end at a common node, the leader. In this paper, we study deterministic leader election in anonymous trees.
  Our aim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $τ$ and the amount of information that has to be given $\textit{a priori}$ to the nodes to enable leader election in time $τ$ in all trees for which leader election in this time is at all possible. Following the framework of $\textit{algorithms with advice}$, this information (a single binary string) is provided to all nodes at the start by an oracle knowing the entire tree. The length of this string is called the $\textit{size of advice}$. For an allocated time $τ$, we give upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform leader election in time $τ$.
  We consider $n$-node trees of diameter $diam \leq D$. While leader election in time $diam$ can be performed without any advice, for time $diam-1$ we give tight upper and lower bounds of $Θ(\log D)$. For time $diam-2$ we give tight upper and lower bounds of $Θ(\log D)$ for even values of $diam$, and tight upper and lower bounds of $Θ(\log n)$ for odd values of $diam$. For the time interval $[β\cdot diam, diam-3]$ for constant $β>1/2$, we prove an upper bound of $O(\frac{n\log n}{D})$ and a lower bound of $Ω(\frac{n}{D})$, the latter being valid whenever $diam$ is odd or when the time is at most $diam-4$. Finally, for time $α\cdot diam$ for any constant $α<1/2$ (except for the case of very small diameters), we give tight upper and lower bounds of $Θ(n)$.
