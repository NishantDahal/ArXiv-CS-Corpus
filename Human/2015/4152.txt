On the Security of a Revised Fragile Watermarking Scheme

This paper analyzes a revised fragile watermarking scheme proposed by Botta et al. which was developed as a revision of the watermarking scheme previously proposed by Rawat et al. A new attack is presented that allows an attacker to apply a valid watermark on tampered images, therefore circumventing the protection that the watermarking scheme under study was supposed to offer. Furthermore, the presented attack has very low computational and memory requirements.
