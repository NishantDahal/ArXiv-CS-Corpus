CarPed -- A Hybrid and Macroscopic Traffic and Pedestrian Simulator

Dense human flow has been a concern for the safety of public events for a long time. Macroscopic pedestrian models, which are mainly based on fluid dynamics, are often used to simulate huge crowds due to their low computational costs (Columbo & Rosini 2005). Similar approaches are used in the field of traffic simulations (Lighthill & Whitham 1955). A combined macroscopic simulation of vehicles and pedestrians is extremely helpful for all-encompassing traffic control. Therefore, we developed a hybrid model that contains networks for vehicular traffic and human flow. This comprehensive model supports concurrent multi-modal simulations of traffic and pedestrians.
