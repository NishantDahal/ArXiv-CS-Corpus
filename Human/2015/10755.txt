Optimal Release Time Decision from Fuzzy Mathematical Programming Perspective

Demand for high software reliability requires rigorous testing followed by requirement of robust modeling techniques for software quality prediction. On one side, firms have to steadily manage the reliability by testing it vigorously, the optimal release time determination is their biggest concern. In past many models have been developed and much research has been devoted towards assessment of release time of software. However, majority of the work deals in crisp study. This paper addresses the problem of release time prediction using fuzzy Logic. Here we have formulated a Fuzzy release time problem considering the cost of testing under the impact of warranty period. Results show that fuzzy model has good adaptability.
