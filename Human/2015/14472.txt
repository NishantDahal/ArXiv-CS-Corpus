Energy-Efficient Scheduling for Homogeneous Multiprocessor Systems

We present a number of novel algorithms, based on mathematical optimization formulations, in order to solve a homogeneous multiprocessor scheduling problem, while minimizing the total energy consumption. In particular, for a system with a discrete speed set, we propose solving a tractable linear program. Our formulations are based on a fluid model and a global scheduling scheme, i.e. tasks are allowed to migrate between processors. The new methods are compared with three global energy/feasibility optimal workload allocation formulations. Simulation results illustrate that our methods achieve both feasibility and energy optimality and outperform existing methods for constrained deadline tasksets. Specifically, the results provided by our algorithm can achieve up to an 80% saving compared to an algorithm without a frequency scaling scheme and up to 70% saving compared to a constant frequency scaling scheme for some simulated tasksets. Another benefit is that our algorithms can solve the scheduling problem in one step instead of using a recursive scheme. Moreover, our formulations can solve a more general class of scheduling problems, i.e. any periodic real-time taskset with arbitrary deadline. Lastly, our algorithms can be applied to both online and offline scheduling schemes.
