Lazy Probabilistic Model Checking without Determinisation

The bottleneck in the quantitative analysis of Markov chains and Markov decision processes against specifications given in LTL or as some form of nondeterministic BÃ¼chi automata is the inclusion of a determinisation step of the automaton under consideration. In this paper, we show that full determinisation can be avoided: subset and breakpoint constructions suffice. We have implemented our approach---both explicit and symbolic versions---in a prototype tool. Our experiments show that our prototype can compete with mature tools like PRISM.
