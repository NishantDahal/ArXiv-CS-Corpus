Splicing Systems from Past to Future: Old and New Challenges

A splicing system is a formal model of a recombinant behaviour of sets of double stranded DNA molecules when acted on by restriction enzymes and ligase. In this survey we will concentrate on a specific behaviour of a type of splicing systems, introduced by PÄƒun and subsequently developed by many researchers in both linear and circular case of splicing definition. In particular, we will present recent results on this topic and how they stimulate new challenging investigations.
