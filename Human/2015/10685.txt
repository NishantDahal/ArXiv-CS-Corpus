Retinex filtering of foggy images: generation of a bulk set with selection and ranking

In this paper we are proposing the use of GIMP Retinex, a filter of the GNU Image Manipulation Program, for enhancing foggy images. This filter involves adjusting four different parameters to find the output image which has to be preferred according to some specific purposes. Aiming to obtain a processing, which is able of choosing automatically the best image from a given set, we are proposing a method for the generation a bulk set of GIMP Retinex filtered images and a preliminary approach for selecting and ranking them.
