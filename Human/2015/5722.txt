An Approach to Data Prefetching Using 2-Dimensional Selection Criteria

We propose an approach to data memory prefetching which augments the standard prefetch buffer with selection criteria based on performance and usage pattern of a given instruction. This approach is built on top of a pattern matching based prefetcher, specifically one which can choose between a stream, a stride, or a stream followed by a stride. We track the most recently called instructions to make a decision on the quantity of data to prefetch next. The decision is based on the frequency with which these instructions are called and the hit/miss rate of the prefetcher. In our approach, we separate the amount of data to prefetch into three categories: a high degree, a standard degree and a low degree. We ran tests on different values for the high prefetch degree, standard prefetch degree and low prefetch degree to determine that the most optimal combination was 1, 4, 8 lines respectively. The 2 dimensional selection criteria improved the performance of the prefetcher by up to 9.5% over the first data prefetching championship winner. Unfortunately performance also fell by as much as 14%, but remained similar on average across all of the benchmarks we tested.
