Digital Cancelation of Self-Interference for Single-Frequency Full-Duplex Relay Stations via Sampled-Data Control

In this article, we propose sampled-data design of digital filters that cancel the continuous-time effect of coupling waves in a single-frequency full-duplex relay station. In this study, we model a relay station as a continuoustime system while conventional researches treat it as a discrete-time system. For a continuous-time model, we propose digital feedback canceler based on the sampled-data H-infinity control theory to cancel coupling waves taking intersample behavior into account. We also propose robust control against unknown multipath interference. Simulation results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
