Extended Unary Coding

Extended variants of the recently introduced spread unary coding are described. These schemes, in which the length of the code word is fixed, allow representation of approximately n^2 numbers for n bits, rather than the n numbers of the standard unary coding. In the first of two proposed schemes the spread increases, whereas in the second scheme the spread remains constant.
