A Robust Lane Detection and Departure Warning System

In this work, we have developed a robust lane detection and departure warning technique. Our system is based on single camera sensor. For lane detection a modified Inverse Perspective Mapping using only a few extrinsic camera parameters and illuminant Invariant techniques is used. Lane markings are represented using a combination of 2nd and 4th order steerable filters, robust to shadowing. Effect of shadowing and extra sun light are removed using Lab color space, and illuminant invariant representation. Lanes are assumed to be cubic curves and fitted using robust RANSAC. This method can reliably detect lanes of the road and its boundary. This method has been experimented in Indian road conditions under different challenging situations and the result obtained were very good. For lane departure angle an optical flow based method were used.
