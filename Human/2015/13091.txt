CoMPflex: CoMP for In-Band Wireless Full Duplex

In this letter we consider emulation of a Full Duplex (FD) cellular base station (BS) by using two spatially separated and coordinated half duplex (HD) BSs. The proposed system is termed CoMPflex (CoMP for In-Band Wireless Full Duplex) and at a given instant it serves two HD mobile stations (MSs), one in the uplink and one in the downlink, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our scheme by using a geometric extension of the one-dimensional Wyner model, which takes into account the distances between the devices. The results show that CoMPflex leads to gains in terms of sum-rate and energy efficiency with respect to the ordinary FD, as well as with respect to a baseline scheme based on unidirectional traffic.
