CloudSimNFV: Modeling and Simulation of Energy-Efficient NFV in Cloud Data Centers

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) takes advantage of hardware virtualization to undertake software processing for various functions, and complements the drawbacks of traditional network technology. To speed up NFV related research, we need a user friendly and easy to use research tool, which could support data center simulation, scheduling algorithms implementation and extension, and provide energy consumption simulation. As a cloud simulation toolkit, CloudSim has strong extendibility that could be extended to simulate NFV environment. This paper introduces a NFV cloud framework based on CloudSim and an energy consumption model based on multi-dimensional extension, implementing a toolkit named ClousimNFV to simulate the NFV scenario, proposing several scheduling algorithm based on for NFV applications. The toolkit validation and algorithm performance comparison are also given.
