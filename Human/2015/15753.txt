Fast and High Quality Highlight Removal from A Single Image

Specular reflection exists widely in photography and causes the recorded color deviating from its true value, so fast and high quality highlight removal from a single nature image is of great importance. In spite of the progress in the past decades in highlight removal, achieving wide applicability to the large diversity of nature scenes is quite challenging. To handle this problem, we propose an analytic solution to highlight removal based on an L2 chromaticity definition and corresponding dichromatic model. Specifically, this paper derives a normalized dichromatic model for the pixels with identical diffuse color: a unit circle equation of projection coefficients in two subspaces that are orthogonal to and parallel with the illumination, respectively. In the former illumination orthogonal subspace, which is specular-free, we can conduct robust clustering with an explicit criterion to determine the cluster number adaptively. In the latter illumination parallel subspace, a property called pure diffuse pixels distribution rule (PDDR) helps map each specular-influenced pixel to its diffuse component. In terms of efficiency, the proposed approach involves few complex calculation, and thus can remove highlight from high resolution images fast. Experiments show that this method is of superior performance in various challenging cases.
