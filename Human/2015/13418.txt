Word Existence Algorithm

The current scenario in the field of computing is largely affected by the speed at which data can be accessed and recalled. In this paper, we present the word existence algorithm which is used to check if the word given as an input is part of a particular database or not. We have taken the English language as an example here. This algorithm tries to solve the problem of lookup by using a uniformly distributed hash function. We have also addressed the problem of clustering and collision. A further contribution is that we follow a direct hashed model where each hash value is linked to another table if the continuity for the function holds true. The core of the algorithm lies in the data model being used during preordering. Our focus lies on the formation of a continuity series and validating the words that exists in the database. This algorithm can be used in applications where we there is a requirement to search for just the existence of a word, example Artificial Intelligence responding to input ,look up for neural networks and dictionary lookups and more. We have observed that this algorithm provides a faster search time
