Molecular MIMO Communication Link

In this demonstration, we will present the world's first molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication link to deliver two data streams in a spatial domain. We show that chemical signals such as concentration gradients could be used in MIMO fashion to transfer sequential data. Until now it was unclear whether MIMO techniques, which are used extensively in modern radio communication, could be applied to molecular communication. In the demonstration, using our devised MIMO apparatus and carefully designed detection algorithm, we will show that we can achieve about 1.7 times higher data rate than single input single output (SISO) molecular communication systems.
