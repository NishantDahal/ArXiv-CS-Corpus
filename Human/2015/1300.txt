Undergraduate Signal Processing Laboratories for the Android Operating System

We present a DSP simulation environment that will enable students to perform laboratory exercises using Android mobile devices and tablets. Due to the pervasive nature of the mobile technology, education applications designed for mobile devices have the potential to stimulate student interest in addition to offering convenient access and interaction capabilities. This paper describes a portable signal processing laboratory for the Android platform. This software is intended to be an educational tool for students and instructors in DSP, and signals and systems courses. The development of Android JDSP (A-JDSP) is carried out using the Android SDK, which is a Java-based open source development platform. The proposed application contains basic DSP functions for convolution, sampling, FFT, filtering and frequency domain analysis, with a convenient graphical user interface. A description of the architecture, functions and planned assessments are presented in this paper.
