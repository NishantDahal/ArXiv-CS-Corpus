Regular sequences and the joint spectral radius

We classify the growth of a $k$-regular sequence based on information from its $k$-kernel. In order to provide such a classification, we introduce the notion of a growth exponent for $k$-regular sequences and show that this exponent is equal to the joint spectral radius of any set of a special class of matrices determined by the $k$-kernel.
