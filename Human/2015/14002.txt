Low-Cost Eye-Trackers: Useful for Information Systems Research?

Research investigating cognitive aspects of information systems is often dependent on detail-rich data. Eye-trackers promise to provide respective data, but the associated costs are often beyond the researchers' budget. Recently, eye-trackers have entered the market that promise eye-tracking support at a reasonable price. In this work, we explore whether such eye-trackers are of use for information systems research and explore the accuracy of a low-cost eye-tracker (Gazepoint GP3) in an empirical study. The results show that Gazepoint GP3 is well suited for respective research, given that experimental material acknowledges the limits of the eye-tracker. To foster replication and comparison of results, all data, experimental material as well as the source code developed for this study are made available online.
