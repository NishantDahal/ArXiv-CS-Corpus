Skip This Paper - RINASim: Your Recursive InterNetwork Architecture Simulator

Recursive InterNetwork Architecture is a clean-slate approach to how to deal with the current issues of the Internet based on the traditional TCP/IP networking stack. Instead of using a fixed number of layers with dedicated functionality, RINA proposes a single generic layer with programmable functionality that may be recursively stacked. We introduce a brand new framework for modeling and simulation of RINA that is intended for OMNeT++.
