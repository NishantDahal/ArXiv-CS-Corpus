A Framework to Explore the Knowledge Structure of Multidisciplinary Research Fields

Understanding emerging areas of a multidisciplinary research field is crucial for researchers,policymakers and other stakeholders. For them a knowledge structure based on longitudinal bibliographic data can be an effective instrument. But with the vast amount of available online information it is often hard to understand the knowledge structure for data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for retrieving online bibliographic data and propose a framework for exploring knowledge structure. We also present several longitudinal analyses to interpret and visualize the last 20 years of published obesity research data.
