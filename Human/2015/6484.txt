Adaptive Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment for Dual-Polarized MIMO Systems

Fifth generation wireless systems are expected to employ multiple antenna communication at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies using small cells within heterogeneous cellular networks. The high path loss of mmWave as well as physical obstructions make communication challenging. To compensate for the severe path loss, mmWave systems may employ a beam alignment algorithm that facilitates highly directional transmission by aligning the beam direction of multiple antenna arrays. This paper discusses a mmWave system employing dual-polarized antennas. First, we propose a practical soft-decision beam alignment (soft-alignment) algorithm that exploits orthogonal polarizations. By sounding the orthogonal polarizations in parallel, the equality criterion of the Welch bound for training sequences is relaxed. Second, the analog beamforming system is adapted to the directional characteristics of the mmWave link assuming a high Ricean K-factor and poor scattering environment. The soft-algorithm enables the mmWave system to align innumerable narrow beams to channel subspace in an attempt to effectively scan the mmWave channel. Thirds, we propose a method to efficiently adapt the number of channel sounding observations to the specific channel environment based on an approximate probability of beam misalignment. Simulation results show the proposed soft-alignment algorithm with adaptive sounding time effectively scans the channel subspace of a mobile user by exploiting polarization diversity.
