Live Video Synopsis for Multiple Cameras

Video surveillance cameras generate most of recorded video, and there is far more recorded video than operators can watch. Much progress has recently been made using summarization of recorded video, but such techniques do not have much impact on live video surveillance.
  We assume a camera hierarchy where a Master camera observes the decision-critical region, and one or more Slave cameras observe regions where past activity is important for making the current decision. We propose that when people appear in the live Master camera, the Slave cameras will display their past activities, and the operator could use past information for real-time decision making.
  The basic units of our method are action tubes, representing objects and their trajectories over time. Our object-based method has advantages over frame based methods, as it can handle multiple people, multiple activities for each person, and can address re-identification uncertainty.
