RDF Validation Requirements - Evaluation and Logical Underpinning

There are many case studies for which the formulation of RDF constraints and the validation of RDF data conforming to these constraint is very important. As a part of the collaboration with the W3C and the DCMI working groups on RDF validation, we identified major RDF validation requirements and initiated an RDF validation requirements database which is available to contribute at http://purl.org/net/rdf-validation. The purpose of this database is to collaboratively collect case studies, use cases, requirements, and solutions regarding RDF validation. Although, there are multiple constraint languages which can be used to formulate RDF constraints (associated with these requirements), there is no standard way to formulate them. This paper serves to evaluate to which extend each requirement is satisfied by each of these constraint languages. We take reasoning into account as an important pre-validation step and therefore map constraints to DL in order to show that each constraint can be mapped to an ontology describing RDF constraints generically.
