Applying Semantic Web Technologies for Improving the Visibility of Tourism Data

Tourism industry is an extremely information-intensive, complex and dynamic activity. It can benefit from semantic Web technologies, due to the significant heterogeneity of information sources and the high volume of on-line data. The management of semantically diverse annotated tourism data is facilitated by ontologies that provide methods and standards, which allow flexibility and more intelligent access to on-line data. This paper provides a description of some of the early results of the Tourinflux project which aims to apply semantic Web technologies to support tourist actors in effectively finding and publishing information on the Web.
