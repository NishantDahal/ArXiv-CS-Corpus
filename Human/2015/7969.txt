On the Gaussian Many-to-One X Channel

In this paper, the Gaussian many-to-one X channel, which is a special case of general multiuser X channel, is studied. In the Gaussian many-to-one X channel, communication links exist between all transmitters and one of the receivers, along with a communication link between each transmitter and its corresponding receiver. As per the X channel assumption, transmission of messages is allowed on all the links of the channel. This communication model is different from the corresponding many-to-one interference channel (IC). Transmission strategies which involve using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference from a subset of transmitters as noise are formulated for the above channel. Sum-rate is used as the criterion of optimality for evaluating the strategies. Initially, a $3 \times 3$ many-to-one X channel is considered and three transmission strategies are analyzed. The first two strategies are shown to achieve sum-rate capacity under certain channel conditions. For the third strategy, a sum-rate outer bound is derived and the gap between the outer bound and the achieved rate is characterized. These results are later extended to the $K \times K$ case. Next, a region in which the many-to-one X channel can be operated as a many-to-one IC without loss of sum-rate is identified. Further, in the above region, it is shown that using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference as noise achieves a rate point that is within $K/2 -1$ bits from the sum-rate capacity. Subsequently, some implications of the above results to the Gaussian many-to-one IC are discussed. Transmission strategies for the many-to-one IC are formulated and channel conditions under which the strategies achieve sum-rate capacity are obtained. A region where the sum-rate capacity can be characterized to within $K/2-1$ bits is also identified.
