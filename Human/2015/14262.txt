Solving the Join Ordering Problem via Mixed Integer Linear Programming

We transform join ordering into a mixed integer linear program (MILP). This allows to address query optimization by mature MILP solver implementations that have evolved over decades and steadily improved their performance. They offer features such as anytime optimization and parallel search that are highly relevant for query optimization.
  We present a MILP formulation for searching left-deep query plans. We use sets of binary variables to represent join operands and intermediate results, operator implementation choices or the presence of interesting orders. Linear constraints restrict value assignments to the ones representing valid query plans. We approximate the cost of scan and join operations via linear functions, allowing to increase approximation precision up to arbitrary degrees. Our experimental results are encouraging: we are able to find optimal plans for joins between 60 tables; a query size that is beyond the capabilities of prior exhaustive query optimization methods.
