Trigonometric dictionary based codec for music compression with high quality recovery

A codec for compression of music signals is proposed. The method belongs to the class of transform lossy compression. It is conceived to be applied in the high quality recovery range though. The transformation, endowing the codec with its distinctive feature, relies on the ability to construct high quality sparse approximation of music signals. This is achieved by a redundant trigonometric dictionary and a dedicated pursuit strategy. The potential of the approach is illustrated by comparison with the OGG Vorbis format, on a sample consisting of clips of melodic music. The comparison evidences remarkable improvements in compression performance for the identical quality of the decompressed signal.
