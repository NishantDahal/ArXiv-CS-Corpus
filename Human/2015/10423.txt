A Preliminary Review of Influential Works in Data-Driven Discovery

The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation ran an Investigator Competition as part of its Data-Driven Discovery Initiative in 2014. We received about 1,100 applications and each applicant had the opportunity to list up to five influential works in the general field of "Big Data" for scientific discovery. We collected nearly 5,000 references and 53 works were cited at least six times. This paper contains our preliminary findings.
