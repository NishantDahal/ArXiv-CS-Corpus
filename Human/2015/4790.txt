Sensitivity Analysis for additive STDP rule

Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a Hebbian like synaptic learning rule. The basis of STDP has strong experimental evidences and it depends on precise input and output spike timings. In this paper we show that under biologically plausible spiking regime, slight variability in the spike timing leads to drastically different evolution of synaptic weights when its dynamics are governed by the additive STDP rule.
