Performance assessment and design of finite length LDPC codes for the Gaussian wiretap channel

In this work we study the reliability and secrecy performance achievable by practical LDPC codes over the Gaussian wiretap channel. While several works have already addressed this problem in asymptotic conditions, i.e., under the hypothesis of codewords of infinite length, only a few approaches exist for the finite length regime. We propose an approach to measure the performance of practical codes and compare it with that achievable in asymptotic conditions. Moreover, based on the secrecy metrics we adopt to achieve this target, we propose a code optimization algorithm which allows to design irregular LDPC codes able to approach the ultimate performance limits even at moderately small codeword lengths (in the order of 10000 bits).
