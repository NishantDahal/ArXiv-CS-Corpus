Network MIMO with Partial Cooperation between Radar and Cellular Systems

To meet the growing spectrum demands, future cellular systems are expected to share the spectrum of other services such as radar. In this paper, we consider a network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with partial cooperation model where radar stations cooperate with cellular base stations (BS)s to deliver messages to intended mobile users. So the radar stations act as BSs in the cellular system. However, due to the high power transmitted by radar stations for detection of far targets, the cellular receivers could burnout when receiving these high radar powers. Therefore, we propose a new projection method called small singular values space projection (SSVSP) to mitigate these harmful high power and enable radar stations to collaborate with cellular base stations. In addition, we formulate the problem into a MIMO interference channel with general constraints (MIMO-IFC-GC). Finally, we provide a solution to minimize the weighted sum mean square error minimization problem (WSMMSE) with enforcing power constraints on both radar and cellular stations.
