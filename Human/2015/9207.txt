On the Well Extension of Partial Well Orderings

In this paper, we study the well extension of strict(irreflective) partial well orderings. We first prove that any partially well-ordered structure <A, R> can be extended to a well-ordered one. Then we prove that every linear extension of <A, R> is well-ordered if and only if A has no infinite totally unordered subset under R.
