Cyclic Codes from Two-Prime Generalized Cyclotomic Sequences of Order 6

Cyclic codes have wide applications in data storage systems and communication systems. Employing two-prime Whiteman generalized cyclotomic sequences of order 6, we construct several classes of cyclic codes over the finite field GF}(q) and give their generator polynomials. And we also calculate the minimum distance of some cyclic codes and give lower bounds of the minimum distance for some other cyclic codes.
