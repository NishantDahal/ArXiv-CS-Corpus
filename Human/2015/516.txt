Higher dimensional homodyne filtering for suppression of incidental phase artifacts in multichannel MRI

The aim of this paper is to introduce procedural steps for extension of the 1D homodyne phase correction for k-space truncation in all gradient encoding directions. Compared to the existing method applied to 2D partial k-space, signal losses introduced by the phase correction filter is observed to be minimal for the extended approach. In addition, the modified form of phase correction mitigates Incidental Phase Artifacts (IPA) due to truncation. For parallel imaging with undersampling along phase encode direction, the extended homodyne filtering is shown to be effective for minimizing these artifacts when each of the channel k-spaces are truncated along both phase and frequency encode directions. This is illustrated with 2D partial k-space for flow compensated multichannel Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI). Extension of our method to 3D partial k-space shows improved reconstruction of flow information in phase contrast angiography.
