A Limit Theorem for Radix Sort and Tries with Markovian Input

Tries are among the most versatile and widely used data structures on words. In particular, they are used in fundamental sorting algorithms such as radix sort which we study in this paper. While the performance of radix sort and tries under a realistic probabilistic model for the generation of words is of significant importance, its analysis, even for simplest memoryless sources, has proved difficult. In this paper we consider a more realistic model where words are generated by a Markov source. By a novel use of the contraction method combined with moment transfer techniques we prove a central limit theorem for the complexity of radix sort and for the external path length in a trie. This is the first application of the contraction method to the analysis of algorithms and data structures with Markovian inputs; it relies on the use of systems of stochastic recurrences combined with a product version of the Zolotarev metric.
