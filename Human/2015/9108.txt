Linear Transceiver Optimization in Multicell MIMO Based on the Generalized Benders Decomposition

We study the maximum sum rate optimization problem in the multiple-input multiple-output interfering broadcast channel. The multiple-antenna transmitters and receivers are assumed to have perfect channel state information. In this setting, finding the optimal linear transceiver design is an NP-hard problem. We show that a reformulation of the problem renders the application of generalized Benders decomposition suitable. The decomposition provides us with an optimization structure which we exploit to apply two different optimization approaches. While one approach is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum of the original problem, the other approach hinges on techniques which can be promising for devising a global optimization method.
