Energetic Galerkin Projection of Electromagnetic Fields between Different Meshes

In order to project electromagnetic fields between different meshes with respect to the conservation of energetic values, Galerkin projection formulations based on the energetic norm are developed in this communication. The proposed formulations are applied to an academic example.
