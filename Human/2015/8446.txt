Hand Gesture Recognition Library

In this paper we have presented a hand gesture recognition library. Various functions include detecting cluster count, cluster orientation, finger pointing direction, etc. To use these functions first the input image needs to be processed into a logical array for which a function has been developed. The library has been developed keeping flexibility in mind and thus provides application developers a wide range of options to develop custom gestures.
