On Basic Properties of Jumping Finite Automata

We complete the initial study of jumping finite automata, which was started in a former article of Meduna and Zemek \citep{athMED1}. The open questions about basic closure properties are solved. Besides this, we correct erroneous results presented in the article. Finally, we point out important relations between jumping finite automata and some other models studied in the literature.
