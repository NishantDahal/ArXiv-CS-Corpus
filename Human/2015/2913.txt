Information Content in Data Sets for a Nucleated-Polymerization Model

We illustrate the use of tools (asymptotic theories of standard error quantification using appropriate statistical models, bootstrapping, model comparison techniques) in addition to sensitivity that may be employed to determine the information content in data sets. We do this in the context of recent models [23] for nucleated polymerization in proteins, about which very little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms; thus the methodology we develop here may be of great help to experimentalists.
