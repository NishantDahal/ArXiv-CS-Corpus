Anomalous Contagion and Renormalization in Dynamical Networks with Nodal Mobility

The common real-world feature of individuals migrating through a network -- either in real space or online -- significantly complicates understanding of network processes. Here we show that even though a network may appear static on average, underlying nodal mobility can dramatically distort outbreak profiles. Highly nonlinear dynamical regimes emerge in which increasing mobility either amplifies or suppresses outbreak severity. Predicted profiles mimic recent outbreaks of real-space contagion (social unrest) and online contagion (pro-ISIS support). We show that this nodal mobility can be renormalized in a precise way for a particular class of dynamical networks.
