Vanishing Point Attracts Eye Movements in Scene Free-viewing

Eye movements are crucial in understanding complex scenes. By predicting where humans look in natural scenes, we can understand how they percieve scenes and priotriaze information for further high-level processing. Here, we study the effect of a particular type of scene structural information known as vanishing point and show that human gaze is attracted to vanishing point regions. We then build a combined model of traditional saliency and vanishing point channel that outperforms state of the art saliency models.
