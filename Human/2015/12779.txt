This report presents a first sketch of the Service Provider DevOps concept including four major management processes to support the roles of both service and VNF developers as well as the operator in a more agile manner. The sketch is based on lessons learned from a study of management and operational practices in the industry and recent related work with respect to management of SDN and cloud. Finally, the report identifies requirements for realizing SP-DevOps within an combined cloud and transport network environment as outlined by the UNIFY NFV architecture.
