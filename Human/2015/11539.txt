Brain Computer Interfaces for Mobile Apps: State-of-the-art and Future Directions

In recent times, there have been significant advancements in utilizing the sensing capabilities of mobile devices for developing applications. The primary objective has been to enhance the way a user interacts with the application by making it effortless and convenient. This paper explores the capabilities of using Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), an evolving subset of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) paradigms, to control mobile devices. We present a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in this area, discussing the challenges and limitations in using BCI for mobile applications. Further we propose possible modalities that in future can benefit with BCI applications. This paper consolidates research directions being pursued in this domain, and draws conclusions on feasibility and benefits of using BCI systems effectively augmented to the mobile application development domain.
