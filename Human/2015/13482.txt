Cloud-based DDoS Attacks and Defenses

Safety and reliability are important in the cloud computing environment. This is especially true today as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks constitute one of the largest threats faced by Internet users and cloud computing services. DDoS attacks target the resources of these services, lowering their ability to provide optimum usage of the network infrastructure. Due to the nature of cloud computing, the methodologies for preventing or stopping DDoS attacks are quite different compared to those used in traditional networks. In this paper, we investigate the effect of DDoS attacks on cloud resources and recommend practical defense mechanisms against different types of DDoS attacks in the cloud environment.
