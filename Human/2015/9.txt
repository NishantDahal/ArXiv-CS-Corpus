GREAT Process Modeller user manual

This report contains instructions to install, uninstall and use GREAT Process Modeller, a tool that supports Communication Analysis, a communication-oriented business process modelling method. GREAT allows creating communicative event diagrams (i.e. business process models), specifying message structures (which describe the messages associated to each communicative event), and automatically generating a class diagram (representing the data model of an information system that would support such organisational communication). This report briefly describes the methodological background of the tool. This handbook explains the modelling techniques in detail: España, S., A. González, Ó. Pastor and M. Ruiz (2012).
