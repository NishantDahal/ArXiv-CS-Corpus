Content-Aware Delivery of Scalable Video in Network Coding Enabled Named Data Networks

In this paper, we propose a novel network coding enabled NDN architecture for the delivery of scalable video. Our scheme utilizes network coding in order to address the problem that arises in the original NDN protocol, where optimal use of the bandwidth and caching resources necessitates the coordination of the forwarding decisions. To optimize the performance of the proposed network coding based NDN protocol and render it appropriate for transmission of scalable video, we devise a novel rate allocation algorithm that decides on the optimal rates of Interest messages sent by clients and intermediate nodes. This algorithm guarantees that the achieved flow of Data objects will maximize the average quality of the video delivered to the client population. To support the handling of Interest messages and Data objects when intermediate nodes perform network coding, we modify the standard NDN protocol and introduce the use of Bloom filters, which store efficiently additional information about the Interest messages and Data objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated for transmission of scalable video over PlanetLab topologies. The evaluation shows that the proposed scheme performs very close to the optimal performance.
