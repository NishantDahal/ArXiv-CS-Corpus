A Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Inter-cell Interference Coordination and Intra-cell Diversity

Inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) and intra-cell diversity (ICD) play important roles in improving cellular downlink coverage. Modeling cellular base stations (BSs) as a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), this paper provides explicit finite-integral expressions for the coverage probability with ICIC and ICD, taking into account the temporal/spectral correlation of the signal and interference. In addition, we show that in the high-reliability regime, where the user outage probability goes to zero, ICIC and ICD affect the network coverage in drastically different ways: ICD can provide order gain while ICIC only offers linear gain. In the high-spectral efficiency regime where the SIR threshold goes to infinity, the order difference in the coverage probability does not exist, however the linear difference makes ICIC a better scheme than ICD for realistic path loss exponents. Consequently, depending on the SIR requirements, different combinations of ICIC and ICD optimize the coverage probability.
