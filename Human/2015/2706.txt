Real-time Dynamic MRI Reconstruction using Stacked Denoising Autoencoder

In this work we address the problem of real-time dynamic MRI reconstruction. There are a handful of studies on this topic; these techniques are either based on compressed sensing or employ Kalman Filtering. These techniques cannot achieve the reconstruction speed necessary for real-time reconstruction. In this work, we propose a new approach to MRI reconstruction. We learn a non-linear mapping from the unstructured aliased images to the corresponding clean images using a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE). The training for SDAE is slow, but the reconstruction is very fast - only requiring a few matrix vector multiplications. In this work, we have shown that using SDAE one can reconstruct the MRI frame faster than the data acquisition rate, thereby achieving real-time reconstruction. The quality of reconstruction is of the same order as a previous compressed sensing based online reconstruction technique.
