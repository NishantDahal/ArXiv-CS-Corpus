A Model for Web-Intelligence Index to Evaluate the Web Intelligence Capacity of Government Web Sites of Sri Lanka

Web intelligence can be considered as a subset of Artificial Intelligence. It uses existing data in web to produce new data, knowledge and wisdom to support decision making and new predictions for web users. Artificial Intelligence is ever changing and evolving field of computer science and it is extensively used in wide array of web based business applications. Although it is used substantially in web based systems in developed countries, it is not examined whether it is being substantially used in Sri Lanka. Every Sri Lankan citizen depends on Public Service more or less throughout his/ her life time and at least more than 3 times: at birth, marriage and death. So providing most of these services to its citizen, Sri Lankan Government uses more or less of its country web portal. This paper presents a model to evaluate web intelligence capability based on weight to key functionalities with respect to web intelligence. The government websites were checked by the proposed criteria to show the potential of using web intelligent technology to provide website based services. The result indicates that the use of web intelligence techniques openly and publicly to provide web based services through government web portal to its citizens is not satisfactory. It also indicates that lack of using the technologies pertaining to web intelligence in the public service web hinders the most of the advantages that citizen and government can gain from such technological involvement.
