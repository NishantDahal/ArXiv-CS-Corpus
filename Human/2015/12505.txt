MSoS: A Multi-Screen-Oriented Web Page Segmentation Approach

In this paper we describe a multiscreen-oriented approach for segmenting web pages. The segmentation is an automatic and hybrid visual and structural method. It aims at creating coherent blocks which have different functions determined by the multiscreen environment. It is also characterized by a dynamic adaptation to the page content. Experiments are conducted on a set of existing applications that contain multimedia elements, in particular YouTube and video player pages. Results are compared with one seg-mentation method from the literature and with a ground truth manually created. With a 75% precision, the MSoS is a promising method that is capable of producing good segmentation results.
