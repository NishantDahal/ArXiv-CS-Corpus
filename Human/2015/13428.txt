A New Coordinated Beamformer for MIMO-based Ad Hoc Networks

The study proposes a new scheme for MIMO-based ad hoc networks. This is accomplished, while using the Interference Driving Technique (IDT) over Nakagami-m fading channels with perfect channel state information at both the transmitter and receiver. The use of this technique is proposed to decrease the impact of all the unwanted interferences, routinely caused by the overlap of the defined radio transmission ranges related to the used nodes. Indeed, IDT is utilized as a coordinated beamformer in a cooperative scheme, according to mean squared error criterion. The methodology and also analytical results are conducted to prove the aptitude of the paper.
