Optimal Power Allocation for Secure Communications in Large-Scale MIMO Relaying Systems

In this paper, we address the problem of optimal power allocation at the relay in two-hop secure communications. In order to solve the challenging issue of short-distance interception in secure communications, the benefit of large-scale MIMO (LS-MIMO) relaying techniques is exploited to improve the secrecy performance significantly, even in the case without eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). The focus of this paper is on the analysis and design of optimal power allocation for the relay, so as to maximize the secrecy outage capacity. We reveal the condition that the secrecy outage capacity is positive, prove that there is one and only one optimal power, and present an optimal power allocation scheme. Moreover, the asymptotic characteristics of the secrecy outage capacity is carried out to provide some clear insights for secrecy performance optimization. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
