Supporting the monitoring of the verification process of critical systems'software

Critical software systems face stringent requirements in safety, security, and reliability due to the circumstances surrounding their operation. Safety and security have progressively gained importance over the years due to the integration of hardware with software-intensive deployments that introduce additional sources of errors. It is, then, necessary to follow high-quality exhaustive software development processes that besides the needed development activities to increase safety and security also integrate techniques to increase the reliability of the software development process itself. In practice, the use of automated techniques for the verification of the verification process is, however, not sufficiently wide spread. This is mainly due to the high cost of the required techniques and to their degree of complexity when adjusting to the different norms and regulations. This work presents an approach for comprehensive management of the verification processes; the approach allows engineers to monitor and control the project status regarding the applicable standards. This approach has been validated through its implementation in a tool and its application to real projects.
