Detecting the large entries of a sparse covariance matrix in sub-quadratic time

The covariance matrix of a $p$-dimensional random variable is a fundamental quantity in data analysis. Given $n$ i.i.d. observations, it is typically estimated by the sample covariance matrix, at a computational cost of $O(np^{2})$ operations. When $n,p$ are large, this computation may be prohibitively slow. Moreover, in several contemporary applications, the population matrix is approximately sparse, and only its few large entries are of interest. This raises the following question, at the focus of our work: Assuming approximate sparsity of the covariance matrix, can its large entries be detected much faster, say in sub-quadratic time, without explicitly computing all its $p^{2}$ entries? In this paper, we present and theoretically analyze two randomized algorithms that detect the large entries of an approximately sparse sample covariance matrix using only $O(np\text{ poly log } p)$ operations. Furthermore, assuming sparsity of the population matrix, we derive sufficient conditions on the underlying random variable and on the number of samples $n$, for the sample covariance matrix to satisfy our approximate sparsity requirements. Finally, we illustrate the performance of our algorithms via several simulations.
