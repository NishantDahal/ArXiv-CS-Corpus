Control with Probabilistic Signal Temporal Logic

Autonomous agents often operate in uncertain environments where their decisions are made based on beliefs over states of targets. We are interested in controller synthesis for complex tasks defined over belief spaces. Designing such controllers is challenging due to computational complexity and the lack of expressivity of existing specification languages. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic extension to signal temporal logic (STL) that expresses tasks over continuous belief spaces. We present an efficient synthesis algorithm to find a control input that maximises the probability of satisfying a given task. We validate our algorithm through simulations of an unmanned aerial vehicle deployed for surveillance and search missions.
