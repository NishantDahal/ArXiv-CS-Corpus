Behavioural equivalences for coalgebras with unobservable moves

We introduce a general categorical framework for the definition of weak behavioural equivalences, building on and extending recent results in the field. This framework is based on parametrized saturation categories, i.e. categories whose hom-sets are endowed with complete orders and a suitable iteration operators; this structure allows us to provide the abstract definitions of various (weak) behavioural equivalence. We show that the Kleisli categories of many common monads are categories of this kind. This allows us to readily instantiate the abstract definitions to a wide range of existing systems (weighted LTS, Segala systems, calculi with names, etc.), recovering the corresponding notions of weak behavioural equivalences. Moreover, we can provide neatly new weak behavioural equivalences for more complex behaviours, like those definable on topological spaces, measurable spaces, etc.
