Boosting Spatial Reuse via Multiple Paths Multi-Hop Scheduling for Directional mmWave WPANs

With huge unlicensed bandwidth available in most parts of the world, millimeter wave (mmWave) communications in the 60 GHz band has been considered as one of the most promising candidates to support multi-gigabit wireless services. Due to high propagation loss of mmWave channels, beamforming is likely to become adopted as an essential technique. Consequently, transmission in 60 GHz band is inherently directional. Directivity enables concurrent transmissions (spatial reuse), which can be fully exploited to improve network capacity. In this paper, we propose a multiple paths multi-hop scheduling scheme, termed MPMH, for mmWave wireless personal area networks, where the traffic across links of low channel quality is transmitted through multiple paths of multiple hops to unleash the potential of spatial reuse. We formulate the problem of multiple paths multi-hop scheduling as a mixed integer linear program (MILP), which is generally NP-hard. To enable the implementation of the multiple paths multi-hop transmission in practice, we propose a heuristic scheme including path selection, traffic distribution, and multiple paths multi-hop scheduling to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Finally, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate MPMH achieves near-optimal network performance in terms of transmission delay and throughput, and enhances the network performance significantly compared with existing protocols.
