Design and Implementation of an Integrated Information System to Support Scientific Research

Computerization of research activities led to the creation of large specialized information resources, platforms, services and software to support scientific research. However, their shortcomings do not allow to fully realizing the comprehensive support of scientific activity, and the absence of a single entry point to divide the scientific community fragmented groups interests. The article based on analysing the existing solutions and approaches to the tools of information and communication technologies of various types of scientific activity, and taking into account the research lifecycle proposed and formulated the basic principles of designing and implementing an integrated information system to support scientific research.
