Delay Analysis of Hybrid WiFi-LiFi System

Heterogeneous wireless networks are capable of effectively leveraging different access technologies to provide a wide variety of coverage areas. In this paper, the coexistence of WiFi and visible light communication (VLC) is investigated as a paradigm. The delay of two configurations of such heterogeneous system has been evaluated. In the first configuration, the non-aggregated system, any request is either allocated to WiFi or VLC. While in the second configuration, the aggregated system, each request is split into two pieces, one is forwarded to WiFi and the other is forwarded to VLC. Under the assumptions of Poisson arrival process of requests and the exponential distribution of requests size, it is mathematically proved that the aggregated system provides lower minimum average system delay than that of the non-aggregated system. For the non-aggregated system, the optimal traffic allocation ratio is derived. For the aggregated system, an efficient solution for the splitting ratio is proposed. Empirical results show that the solution proposed here incurs a delay penalty (less than 3\%) over the optimal result.
