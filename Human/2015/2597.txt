Towards Controlling Refinements of Statecharts

In incremental development strategies, modelers frequently refine Statecharts models to satisfy requirements and changes. Although several solutions exist to the problem of Statecharts refinement, they provide such levels of freedom that a statechart cannot make assumptions or guarantees about its future structure. In this paper, we propose a set of bounding rules to limit the allowable Statecharts refinement operations such that certain assumptions will hold.
