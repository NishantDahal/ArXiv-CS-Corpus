Contention-based Geographic Forwarding Strategies for Wireless Sensors Networks

This paper studies combined relay selection and opportunistic geographic routing strategies for autonomous wireless sensor networks where transmissions occur over multiple hops. The proposed solution is built upon three constituent parts: (i) relay selection algorithm, (ii) contention resolution mechanism, and (iii) geographic forwarding strategy. Using probability generating function and spatial point process as the theoretic background, we propose an auction-based algorithm for selecting the relay node that relies on the network topology as side-information. Our results show that geographic solutions that iteratively exploit the local knowledge of the topology to ponder the algorithm operation outperforms established random approaches.
