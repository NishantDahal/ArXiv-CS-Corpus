Enhanced Lasso Recovery on Graph

This work aims at recovering signals that are sparse on graphs. Compressed sensing offers techniques for signal recovery from a few linear measurements and graph Fourier analysis provides a signal representation on graph. In this paper, we leverage these two frameworks to introduce a new Lasso recovery algorithm on graphs. More precisely, we present a non-convex, non-smooth algorithm that outperforms the standard convex Lasso technique. We carry out numerical experiments on three benchmark graph datasets.
