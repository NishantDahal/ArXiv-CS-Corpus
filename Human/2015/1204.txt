A Note on the Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching

The fundamental limit of coded caching is investigated for the case with $N=3$ files and $K=3$ users. An improved outer bound is obtained through the computational approach developed by the author in an earlier work. This result is part of the online collection of "Solutions of Computed Information Theoretic Limits (SCITL)".
