KBCV 2.0 - Automatic Completion Experiments

This paper describes the automatic mode of the new version of the Knuth-Bendix Completion Visualizer. The internally used data structures have been overhauled and the performance was dramatically improved by introducing caching, parallelization, and term- indexing in the computation of critical pairs and simplification. The new version is much faster and can complete three more systems.
