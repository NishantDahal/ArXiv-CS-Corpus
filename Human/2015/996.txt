New Algebraic Soft Decision Decoding Algorithm for Reed-Solomon Code

In this paper, a new algebraic soft-decision decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon code is presented. It is based on rational interpolation and the interpolation points are constructed by Berlekamp-Messay algorithm. Unlike the traditional K{รถ}tter-Vardy algorithm, new algorithm needs interpolation for two smaller multiplicity matrixes, due to the corresponding factorization algorithm for re-constructing codewords.
