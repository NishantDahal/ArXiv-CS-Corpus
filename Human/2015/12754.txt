Using Socrative to Enhance In-Class Student Engagement and Collaboration

Learning and teaching experiment was designed to incorporate SRS Student Response System to measure and assess student engagement in higher education for level 5 engineering students. The SRS system was based on getting an immediate student feedback to short quizzes lasting 10 to 15 minutes using Socrative software. The structure of the questions was a blend of true or false, multiple choice and short answer questions. The experiment was conducted through semester 2 of yearlong engineering module. The outcome of the experiment was analyzed quantitatively based on student performance and qualitatively through student questionnaire. The results indicate that using student paced assessments method using Socrative enhanced students performance. The results showed that 53% of the students improved their performance while 23% neither improved nor underperformed. Qualitative data showed students felt improvement in their learning experience. Overall results indicate positive impact using this technology in teaching and learning for engineering modules in higher education
