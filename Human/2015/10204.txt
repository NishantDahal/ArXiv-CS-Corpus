Detection of Critical Number of People in Interlocked Doors for Security Access Control by Exploiting a Microwave Transceiver-Array

Counting the number of people is something many security application focus on, when dealing with controlling accesses in restricted areas, as it occurs with banks, airports, railway stations and governmental offices. This paper presents an automated solution for detecting the presence of more than one person into interlocked doors adopted in many accesses. In most cases, interlocked doors are small areas where other pieces of information and sensors are placed in order to detect the presence of guns, explosive, etc. The general goals and the required environmental condition, allowed us to implement a detection system at lower costs and complexity, with respect to other existing techniques. The system consists of a fixed array of microwave transceiver modules, whose received signals are processed to collect information related to a sort of volume occupied in the interlocked door cabin. The proposed solution has been statistically validated by using statistical analysis. The whole solution has been also implemented to be used in a real time environment and thus validated against real experimental measures.
