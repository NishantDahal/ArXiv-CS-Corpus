Low Power Wideband Sensing for One-Bit Quantized Cognitive Radio Systems

We proposes an ultra low power wideband spectrum sensing architecture by utilizing a one-bit quantization at the cognitive radio (CR) receiver. The impact of this aggressive quantization is quantified and it is shown that the proposed method is robust to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). We derive closed-form expressions for both false alarm and detection probabilities. The sensing performance and the analytical results are assessed through comparisons with respective results from computer simulations. The results indicate that the proposed method provides significant saving in power, complexity, and sensing period on the account of an acceptable range of performance degradation.
