A Green Perspective on Wi-Fi Offloading

Due to increased energy consumption and carbon emissions of the ICT industry, operators worldwide are focusing on reducing energy consumption of their networks from financial as well as corporate responsibility perspectives. The subject of green or energy efficient operation of cellular access network has attracted a lot of attention in the research community recently. In this regard, dynamically powering down the radio network equipment has emerged as a promising solution. In literature, research around this type of techniques has mainly focused on quantifying the energy saving potential. However, little efforts have been made towards practical realization of these energy saving concepts. On the other hand, Wi-Fi networks are undergoing a paradigm shift towards ubiquity. The main objective of this paper is to provide novel mechanisms for practically realizing the concept of improving power efficiency in the cellular access network through opportunistically offloading users to Wi- Fi networks. These mechanisms are based on the principles of cognitive network management. Performance evaluation shows the potential of proposed mechanisms as a viable solution for achieving energy efficiency in the cellular access network.
