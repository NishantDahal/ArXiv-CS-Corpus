Algorithms for two variants of Satisfaction Approval Voting

Multi-winner voting rules based on approval ballots have received increased attention in recent years. In particular Satisfaction Approval Voting (SAV) and its variants have been proposed. In this note, we show that the winning set can be determined in polynomial time for two prominent and natural variants of SAV. We thank Arkadii Slinko for suggesting these problems in a talk at the Workshop on Challenges in Algorithmic Social Choice, Bad Belzig, October 11, 2014.
