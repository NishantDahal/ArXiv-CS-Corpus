On the Total Number of Bends for Planar Octilinear Drawings

An octilinear drawing of a planar graph is one in which each edge is drawn as a sequence of horizontal, vertical and diagonal at 45 degrees line-segments. For such drawings to be readable, special care is needed in order to keep the number of bends small. As the problem of finding planar octilinear drawings of minimum number of bends is NP-hard, in this paper we focus on upper and lower bounds. From a recent result of Keszegh et al. on the slope number of planar graphs, we can derive an upper bound of 4n-10 bends for 8-planar graphs with n vertices. We considerably improve this general bound and corresponding previous ones for triconnected 4-, 5- and 6-planar graphs. We also derive non-trivial lower bounds for these three classes of graphs by a technique inspired by the network flow formulation of Tamassia.
