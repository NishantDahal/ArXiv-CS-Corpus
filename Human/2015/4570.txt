Proceedings Tenth Workshop on Model Based Testing

The workshop is devoted to model-based testing of both software and hardware. Model-based testing uses models describing the required behavior of the system under consideration to guide such efforts as test selection and test results evaluation. Testing validates the real system behavior against models and checks that the implementation conforms to them, but is capable also to find errors in the models themselves.
  The intent of this workshop is to bring together researchers and users of model-based testing techniques and tools to discuss the state of the art in theory, applications, tools, and industrialization of model-based testing and related domains.
