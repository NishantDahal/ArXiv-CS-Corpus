PanoSwarm: Collaborative and Synchronized Multi-Device Panoramic Photography

Taking a picture has been traditionally a one-persons task. In this paper we present a novel system that allows multiple mobile devices to work collaboratively in a synchronized fashion to capture a panorama of a highly dynamic scene, creating an entirely new photography experience that encourages social interactions and teamwork. Our system contains two components: a client app that runs on all participating devices, and a server program that monitors and communicates with each device. In a capturing session, the server collects in realtime the viewfinder images of all devices and stitches them on-the-fly to create a panorama preview, which is then streamed to all devices as visual guidance. The system also allows one camera to be the host and to send direct visual instructions to others to guide camera adjustment. When ready, all devices take pictures at the same time for panorama stitching. Our preliminary study suggests that the proposed system can help users capture high quality panoramas with an enjoyable teamwork experience.
