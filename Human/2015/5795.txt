A Comparative Study of Homomorphic and Searchable Encryption Schemes for Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a popular distributed network and utility model based technology. Since in cloud the data is outsourced to third parties, the protection of confidentiality and privacy of user data becomes important. Different methods for securing the data in cloud have been proposed by researchers including but not limited to Oblivious RAM, Searchable Encryption, Functional Encryption, Homomorphic Encryption etc. This paper focuses on Searchable and Homomorphic Encryption methods. Finally, a comparative study of these two efficient cloud cryptographic methods has been carried out and given here.
