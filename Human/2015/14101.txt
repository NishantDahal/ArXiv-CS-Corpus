Go-Smart: Web-based Computational Modeling of Minimally Invasive Cancer Treatments

The web-based Go-Smart environment is a scalable system that allows the prediction of minimally invasive cancer treatment. Interventional radiologists create a patient-specific 3D model by semi-automatic segmentation and registration of pre-interventional CT (Computed Tomography) and/or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images in a 2D/3D browser environment. This model is used to compare patient-specific treatment plans and device performance via built-in simulation tools. Go-Smart includes evaluation techniques for comparing simulated treatment with real ablation lesions segmented from follow-up scans. The framework is highly extensible, allowing manufacturers and researchers to incorporate new ablation devices, mathematical models and physical parameters.
