HT-Ring Paxos: Theory of High Throughput State-Machine Replication for Clustered Data Centers

Implementations of state-machine replication (SMR) prevalently use the variants of Paxos. Some of the recent variants of Paxos like, Ring Paxos, Multi-Ring Paxos, S-Paxos and HT-Paxos achieve significantly high throughput. However, to meet the growing demand of high throughput, we are proposing HT-Ring Paxos, a variant of Paxos that is basically derived from the classical Paxos. Moreover, it also adopts some fundamental concepts of Ring Paxos, S-Paxos and HT-Paxos for increasing throughput. Furthermore, HT-Ring Paxos is best suitable for clustered data centers and achieves comparatively high throughput among all variants of Paxos. However, similar to Ring Paxos, latency of the HT-Ring Paxos is quite high as compared with other variants of Paxos.
