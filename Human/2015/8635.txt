Euler diagrams as an introduction to set-theoretical models

Understanding the notion of a model is not always easy in logic courses. Hence, tools such as Euler diagrams are frequently applied as informal illustrations of set-theoretical models. We formally investigate Euler diagrams as an introduction to set-theoretical models. We show that the model-theoretic notions of validity and invalidity are characterized by Euler diagrams, and, in particular, that model construction can be described as a manipulation of Euler diagrams.
