A Family of Erasure Correcting Codes with Low Repair Bandwidth and Low Repair Complexity

We present the construction of a new family of erasure correcting codes for distributed storage that yield low repair bandwidth and low repair complexity. The construction is based on two classes of parity symbols. The primary goal of the first class of symbols is to provide good erasure correcting capability, while the second class facilitates node repair, reducing the repair bandwidth and the repair complexity. We compare the proposed codes with other codes proposed in the literature.
