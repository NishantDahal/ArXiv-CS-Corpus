Flexible Widely-Linear Multi-Branch Decision Feedback Detection Algorithms for Massive MIMO Systems

This paper presents widely-linear multi-branch decision feedback detection techniques for large-scale multiuser multiple-antenna systems. We consider a scenario with impairments in the radio-frequency chain in which the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components exhibit an imbalance, which degrades the receiver performance and originates non-circular signals. A widely-linear multi-branch decision feedback receiver is developed to mitigate both the multiuser interference and the I/Q imbalance effects. An iterative detection and decoding scheme with the proposed receiver and convolutional codes is also devised. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques outperform existing algorithms.
