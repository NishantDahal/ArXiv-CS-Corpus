Two-step Input Spatial Auditory BCI for Japanese Kana Characters

We present an auditory stimulus optimization and a pilot study of a two-step input speller application combined with a spatial auditory brain-computer interface (saBCI) for paralyzed users. The application has been developed for 45, out of 48 defining the full set, Japanese kana characters in a two-step input procedure setting for an easy-to-use BCI-speller interface. The user first selects the representative letter of a subset, defining the second step. In the second step, the final choice is made. At each interfacing step, the choices are classified based on the P300 event related potential (ERP) responses captured in the EEG, as in the classic oddball paradigm. The BCI online experiment and EEG responses classification results of the pilot study confirm the effectiveness of the proposed spelling method.
