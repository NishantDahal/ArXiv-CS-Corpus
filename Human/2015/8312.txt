MOBISPA: A Reference Framework for Mobile as a Personal Assistant

Mobile is taking center stage and becoming the device of preference for all aspects of communication because of our increasingly on the go lifestyles. With this the demands on mobile capability to execute increasingly complex operations are also on the rise. However, despite improvements in device computing power in the last couple of years a mobile device continues to have limitations. Mobile driven everyday use cases are increasingly raising expectations that rest on mobile technologies that are still evolving. A number of fragmented approaches and solutions have been created that address various requirements unique to mobility, however there is a lack of a single framework that serves as a unifying reference for industry and solution architectures. The paper addresses this concern through the specification of a comprehensive reference framework for mobility that is generic and vendor neutral.
