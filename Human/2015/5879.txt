A Dynamic Spectrum Access on SDR for IEEE 802.15.4 networks

Our paper deals with a Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and its implementation on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) for IEEE 802.15.4e Networks. The network nodes select the carrier frequency after Energy-Detection based Spectrum Sensing (SS). To ensure frequency hoping between two nodes in IEEE 802.15.4e Network, we propose a synchronization algorithm. We considerate the IEEE 802.15.4e Network is Secondary User (SU), and all other networks are Primary Users (PUs) in unlicensed 868/915 MHz and 2450 MHz bands of a Cognitive Radio (CR). However, the algorithm and the energy-sensor have been implemented over GNU Radio and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) SDR. In addition, real packet transmissions have been performed in two cases. In the first case, SU communicates in static carrier-frequency, while in the second case with the implemented DSA. For each case, PU transmitter disturbs SU, which calculates Packet Success Rate (PSR) to measure the robustness of a used DSA. The obtained PSR is improved by 80\% when the SU accomplished DSA rather than a static access.
