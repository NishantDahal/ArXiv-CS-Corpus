Mixing Rates of Random Walks with Little Backtracking

Many regular graphs admit a natural partition of their edge set into cliques of the same order such that each vertex is contained in the same number of cliques. In this paper, we study the mixing rate of certain random walks on such graphs and we generalize previous results of Alon, Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin regarding the mixing rates of non-backtracking random walks on regular graphs.
