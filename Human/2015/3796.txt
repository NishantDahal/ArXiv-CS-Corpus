Unfolding Smooth Prismatoids

We define a notion for unfolding smooth, ruled surfaces, and prove that every smooth prismatoid (the convex hull of two smooth curves lying in parallel planes), has a nonoverlapping "volcano unfolding." These unfoldings keep the base intact, unfold the sides outward, splayed around the base, and attach the top to the tip of some side rib. Our result answers a question for smooth prismatoids whose analog for polyhedral prismatoids remains unsolved.
