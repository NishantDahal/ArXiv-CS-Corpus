Comparing Weakest Precondition and Weakest Liberal Precondition

In this article we investigate the relationships between the classical notions of weakest precondition and weakest liberal precondition, and provide several results, namely that in general, weakest liberal precondition is neither stronger nor weaker than weakest precondition, however, given a deterministic and terminating sequential while program and a postcondition, they are equivalent. Hence, in such situation, it does not matter which definition is used.
