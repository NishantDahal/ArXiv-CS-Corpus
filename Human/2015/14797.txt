Lax functors and coalgebraic weak bisimulation

We generalize the work by Soboci≈Ñski on relational presheaves and their connection with weak (bi)simulation for labelled transistion systems to a coalgebraic setting. We show that the coalgebraic notion of saturation studied in our previous work can be expressed in the language of lax functors in terms of existence of a certain adjunction between categories of lax functors. This observation allows us to generalize the notion of the coalgebraic weak bisimulation to lax functors. We instantiate this definition on two examples of timed systems and show that it coincides with their time-abstract behavioural equivalence.
