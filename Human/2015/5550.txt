Workspace and Singularity analysis of a Delta like family robot

Workspace and joint space analysis are essential steps in describing the task and designing the control loop of the robot, respectively. This paper presents the descriptive analysis of a family of delta-like parallel robots by using algebraic tools to induce an estimation about the complexity in representing the singularities in the workspace and the joint space. A Gr{รถ}bner based elimination is used to compute the singularities of the manipulator and a Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition algorithm is used to study the workspace and the joint space. From these algebraic objects, we propose some certified three dimensional plotting describing the the shape of workspace and of the joint space which will help the engineers or researchers to decide the most suited configuration of the manipulator they should use for a given task. Also, the different parameters associated with the complexity of the serial and parallel singularities are tabulated, which further enhance the selection of the different configuration of the manipulator by comparing the complexity of the singularity equations.
