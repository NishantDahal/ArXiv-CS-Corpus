Efficient SDP Inference for Fully-connected CRFs Based on Low-rank Decomposition

Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have been widely used in a variety of computer vision tasks. Conventional CRFs typically define edges on neighboring image pixels, resulting in a sparse graph such that efficient inference can be performed. However, these CRFs fail to model long-range contextual relationships. Fully-connected CRFs have thus been proposed. While there are efficient approximate inference methods for such CRFs, usually they are sensitive to initialization and make strong assumptions. In this work, we develop an efficient, yet general algorithm for inference on fully-connected CRFs. The algorithm is based on a scalable SDP algorithm and the low- rank approximation of the similarity/kernel matrix. The core of the proposed algorithm is a tailored quasi-Newton method that takes advantage of the low-rank matrix approximation when solving the specialized SDP dual problem. Experiments demonstrate that our method can be applied on fully-connected CRFs that cannot be solved previously, such as pixel-level image co-segmentation.
