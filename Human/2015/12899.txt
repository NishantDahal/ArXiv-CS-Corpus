An empirical study of Unfairness and Oscillation in ETSI DCC

-Performance of Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) in high node density situation has long been a major field of studies. Particular attention has been paid to the frequent exchange of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) on which many road safety applications rely. In the present paper, se focus on the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism, particularly on the evaluation of its facility layers component when applied in the context of dense networks. For this purpose, a set of simulations has been conducted over several scenarios, considering rural highway and urban mobility in order to investigate unfairness and oscillation issues, and analyze the triggering factors. The experimental results show that the latest technical specification of the ETSI DCC presents a significant enhancement in terms of fairness. In contrast, the stability criterion leaves room for improvement as channel load measurement presents (i) considerable fluctuations when only the facility layer control is applied and (i.i) severe state oscillation when different DCC control methods are combined.
