Looking into Hardware-in-the-Loop Coupling of OMNeT++ and RoSeNet

Network emulation using real sensor node hardware is used to increase the accuracy of pure network simulations. Coupling OMNeT++ with network emulation platforms and tools introduces new application possibilities for both sides. This work-in-progress report covers our experiences of using OMNeT++ as a test driver for RoSeNet, a network emulation and test platform for low-power wireless technologies like IEEE 802.15.4. OMNeT++ and RoSeNet were interconnected to enable a co-simulation of real sensor networks with a MAC layer simulation model. Experiences and insights on this Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation together with ideas to extend OMNeT++ and to provide a generic interconnection API complete the report.
