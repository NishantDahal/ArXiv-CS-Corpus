SAT is a problem with exponential complexity measured by negentropy

In this paper the reason why entropy reduction (negentropy) can be used to measure the complexity of any computation was first elaborated both in the aspect of mathematics and informational physics. In the same time the equivalence of computation and information was clearly stated. Then the complexities of three specific problems: logical compare, sorting and SAT, were analyzed and measured. The result showed SAT was a problem with exponential complexity which naturally leads to the conclusion that no efficient algorithm exists to solve it. That's to say: NP!=P.
