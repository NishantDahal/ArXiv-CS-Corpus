Geometry on the Utility Space

We study the geometrical properties of the utility space (the space of expected utilities over a finite set of options), which is commonly used to model the preferences of an agent in a situation of uncertainty. We focus on the case where the model is neutral with respect to the available options, i.e. treats them, a priori, as being symmetrical from one another. Specifically, we prove that the only Riemannian metric that respects the geometrical properties and the natural symmetries of the utility space is the round metric. This canonical metric allows to define a uniform probability over the utility space and to naturally generalize the Impartial Culture to a model with expected utilities.
