A Review of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

This paper presents a survey of man-in-the-middle (MIM) attacks in communication networks and methods of protection against them. In real time communication, the attack can in many situations be discovered by the use of timing information. The most common attacks occur due to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache poisoning, DNS spoofing, session hijacking, and SSL hijacking.
