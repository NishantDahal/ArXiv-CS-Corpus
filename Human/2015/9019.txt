Assume-Admissible Synthesis

In this paper, we introduce a novel rule for synthesis of reactive systems, applicable to systems made of n components which have each their own objectives. It is based on the notion of admissible strategies. We compare our novel rule with previous rules defined in the literature, and we show that contrary to the previous proposals, our rule defines sets of solutions which are rectangular. This property leads to solutions which are robust and resilient. We provide algorithms with optimal complexity and also an abstraction framework.
