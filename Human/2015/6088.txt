New 2D CA based Image Encryption Scheme and a novel Non-Parametric Test for Pixel Randomness

In this paper we have proposed a new test for pixel randomness using non-parametric method in statistics. In order to validate this new non-parametric test we have designed an encryption scheme based on 2D cellular automata. The strength of the designed encryption scheme is first assessed by standard methods for security analysis and the pixel randomness is then determined by the newly proposed non-parametric method.
