Application Distribution Model In Volunteer Computing Environment Using Peer-to-Peer Torrent Like Approach

Volunteer computing has been known as an alternative solution to solve complex problems. It is acknowledged for its simplicity and its ability to work on multiple operating systems. Nonetheless, setting up a server for volunteer computing can be time consuming and relatively complex to be implemented. This paper offer a model which can ease the effort of setting up a server by making the agent works two ways, as seeder and leecher, like P2P torrent approaches. The model consists of measurement units to manage applications to be distributed, system hierarchy, and basic procedures for the server and the agent. The model has been tested in four scenarios using 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 integer data employing up to six nodes. The tests demonstrate speedup in three of the scenarios.
