Quantum Algorithm for Triangle Finding in Sparse Graphs

This paper presents a quantum algorithm for triangle finding over sparse graphs that improves over the previous best quantum algorithm for this task by Buhrman et al. [SIAM Journal on Computing, 2005]. Our algorithm is based on the recent $\tilde O(n^{5/4})$-query algorithm given by Le Gall [FOCS 2014] for triangle finding over dense graphs (here $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the graph). We show in particular that triangle finding can be solved with $O(n^{5/4-ε})$ queries for some constant $ε>0$ whenever the graph has at most $O(n^{2-c})$ edges for some constant $c>0$.
