Weak measurement combined with quantum delayed-choice experiment and implementation in optomechanical system

Weak measurement [1,19] combined with quantum delayed-choice experiment that use quantum beam splitter instead of the beam splitter give rise to a surprising amplification effect, i.e., counterintuitive negative amplification effect. We show that this effect is caused by the wave and particle behaviours of the system to be and can't be explained by a semiclassical wave theory, due to the entanglement of the system and the ancilla in quantum beam splitter. The amplification mechanism about wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics lead us to a scheme for implementation of weak measurement in optomechanical system.
