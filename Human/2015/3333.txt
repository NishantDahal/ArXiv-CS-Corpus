Sparsity Aware Normalized Least Mean p-power Algorithms with Correntropy Induced Metric Penalty

For identifying the non-Gaussian impulsive noise systems, normalized LMP (NLMP) has been proposed to combat impulsive-inducing instability. However, the standard algorithm is without considering the inherent sparse structure distribution of unknown system. To exploit sparsity as well as to mitigate the impulsive noise, this paper proposes a sparse NLMP algorithm, i.e., Correntropy Induced Metric (CIM) constraint based NLMP (CIMNLMP). Based on the first proposed algorithm, moreover, we propose an improved CIM constraint variable regularized NLMP(CIMVRNLMP) algorithm by utilizing variable regularized parameter(VRP) selection method which can further adjust convergence speed and steady-state error. Numerical simulations are given to confirm the proposed algorithms.
