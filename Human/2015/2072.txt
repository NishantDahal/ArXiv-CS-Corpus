Modified Fast Fractal Image Compression Algorithm in spatial domain

In this paper a new fractal image compression algorithm is proposed in which the time of encoding process is considerably reduced. The algorithm exploits a domain pool reduction approach, along with using innovative predefined values for contrast scaling factor, S, instead of searching it across [0,1]. Only the domain blocks with entropy greater than a threshold are considered as domain pool. As a novel point, it is assumed that in each step of the encoding process, the domain block with small enough distance shall be found only for the range blocks with low activity (equivalently low entropy). This novel point is used to find reasonable estimations of S, and use them in the encoding process as predefined values, mentioned above, the remaining range blocks are split into four new smaller range blocks and the algorithm must be iterated for them, considered as the other step of encoding process. The algorithm has been examined for some of the well-known images and the results have been compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The experiments show that our proposed algorithm has considerably lower encoding time than the other where the encoded images are approximately the same in quality.
