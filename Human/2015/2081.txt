A Gradient Descent Approach to Optimal Coherent Quantum LQG Controller Design

This paper is concerned with the Coherent Quantum Linear Quadratic Gaussian (CQLQG) control problem of finding a stabilizing measurement-free quantum controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize an infinite-horizon mean square performance index for the fully quantum closed-loop system. In comparison with the observation-actuation structure of classical controllers, the coherent quantum feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics and quantum information. Both the plant and the controller are open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must satisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions, which are organised as quadratic constraints on the controller matrices and reflect the preservation of CCRs in time. The CQLQG problem is a constrained optimization problem for the steady-state quantum covariance matrix of the plant-controller system satisfying an algebraic Lyapunov equation. We propose a gradient descent algorithm equipped with adaptive stepsize selection for the numerical solution of the problem. The algorithm finds a local minimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling operators of a stabilizing PR quantum controller, thus taking the PR constraints into account. A convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. A numerical example of a locally optimal CQLQG controller design is provided to demonstrate the algorithm performance.
