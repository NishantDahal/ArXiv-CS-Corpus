On the Security of MTA-OTIBASs (Multiple-TA One-Time Identity-Based Aggregate Signatures)

In [3] the authors proposed a new aggregate signature scheme referred to as multiple-TA (trusted authority) one-time identity-based aggregate signature (MTA-OTIBAS). Further, they gave a concrete MTA-OTIBAS scheme. We recall here the definition of MTA-OTIBAS and the concrete proposed scheme. Then we prove that our MTA-OTIBAS concrete scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptively chosen-message attacks in the random oracle model under the co-CDH problem assumption.
