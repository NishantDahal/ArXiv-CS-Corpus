Coding for classical-quantum channels with rate limited side information at the encoder: An information-spectrum approach

We study the hybrid classical-quantum version of the channel coding problem for the famous Gel'fand-Pinsker channel. In the classical setting for this channel the conditional distribution of the channel output given the channel input is a function of a random parameter called the channel state. We study this problem when a rate limited version of the channel state is available at the encoder for the classical-quantum Gel'fand-Pinsker channel. We establish the capacity region for this problem in the information-spectrum setting. The capacity region is quantified in terms of spectral-sup classical mutual information rate and spectral-inf quantum mutual information rate.
