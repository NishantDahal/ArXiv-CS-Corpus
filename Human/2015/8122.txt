The CLT Analogue for Cyclic Urns

A cyclic urn is an urn model for balls of types $0,\ldots,m-1$ where in each draw the ball drawn, say of type $j$, is returned to the urn together with a new ball of type $j+1 \mod m$. The case $m=2$ is the well-known Friedman urn. The composition vector, i.e., the vector of the numbers of balls of each type after $n$ steps is, after normalization, known to be asymptotically normal for $2\le m\le 6$. For $m\ge 7$ the normalized composition vector does not converge. However, there is an almost sure approximation by a periodic random vector. In this paper the asymptotic fluctuations around this periodic random vector are identified. We show that these fluctuations are asymptotically normal for all $m\ge 7$. However, they are of maximal dimension $m-1$ only when $6$ does not divide $m$. For $m$ being a multiple of $6$ the fluctuations are supported by a two-dimensional subspace.
