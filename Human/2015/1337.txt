System Interactive Cyber Presence for E learning to Break Down Learner Isolation

The development of technologies of multimedia, linked to that of Internet and democratization of high speed, has made henceforth E-learning possible for learners being in virtual classes and geographically distributed. One benefit to taking course online is that the online course structure is typically more student focused than teacher centered and encouraging more active participation by students in collaborative learning activities. The quality and quantity of asynchronous and synchronous communications are the key elements for E-learning success. A potential problem that has received little exploration is student's feeling of isolation. It is important to have a propitious supervision to breaking down learner feeling isolation in E learning environment. This feeling of isolation is among the main causes of loss and high rates of dropout in E-learning. It impacts on their levels of participation, satisfaction and learning. To overcome this feeling of isolation, we aim, by this research, to provide the trainer and each learner with an environment allowing them to behave as if being face to face; in other words, to approach the pedagogy of classroom teaching. Our contribution to reduce the feeling of isolation is to ensure the presence of the teacher in the educational tools. These tools aim to establish a real dialogue with the learner, forcing him to take an active part in their learning. Among the tools we offer, video conference Openmeeting integrated in Moodle providing the possibility of using the notion of class and whiteboard, the indicator of motivation quantification tool based hand gesture that we developed and finally social networks web 2. 0 like Facebook, youtube, twitter to promote collaboration, sharing and communication of the learner with his peers.
