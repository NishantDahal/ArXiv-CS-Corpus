Exploiting Multimodal Biometrics in E-Privacy Scheme for Electronic Health Records

Existing approaches to protect the privacy of Electronic Health Records are either insufficient for existing medical laws or they are too restrictive in their usage. For example, smart card-based encryption systems require the patient to be always present to authorize access to medical records. Questionnaires were administered by 50 medical practitioners to identify and categorize different Electronic Health Records attributes. The system was implemented using multi biometrics of patients to access patient record in pre-hospital care.The software development tools employed were JAVA and MySQL database. The system provides applicable security when patients records are shared either with other practitioners, employers, organizations or research institutes. The result of the system evaluation shows that the average response time of 6 seconds and 11.1 seconds for fingerprint and iris respectively after ten different simulations. The system protects privacy and confidentiality by limiting the amount of data exposed to users.The system also enables emergency medical technicians to gain easy and reliable access to necessary attributes of patients Electronic Health Records while still maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of the data using the patients fingerprint and iris.
