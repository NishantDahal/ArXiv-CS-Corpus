Comparative Studies of Six Programming Languages

Comparison of programming languages is a common topic of discussion among software engineers. Multiple programming languages are designed, specified, and implemented every year in order to keep up with the changing programming paradigms, hardware evolution, etc. In this paper we present a comparative study between six programming languages: C++, PHP, C#, Java, Python, VB ; These languages are compared under the characteristics of reusability, reliability, portability, availability of compilers and tools, readability, efficiency, familiarity and expressiveness.
