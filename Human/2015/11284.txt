Invited Abstract: A Simulation Package for Energy Consumption of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are becoming an integral part of the future generation Internet. Traditionally, these networks have been designed with the goals of traffic offload and the improvement of users' quality of experience (QoE), but the energy consumption is also becoming an indispensable design factor for CDNs to be a sustainable solution. To study and improve the CDN architectures using this new design metric, we are planning to develop a generic and flexible simulation package in OMNet++. This package is aimed to render a holistic view about the CDN energy consumption behaviour by incorporating the state-of-the-art energy consumption models proposed for the individual elements of CDNs (e.g. servers, routers, wired and wireless links, wireless devices, etc.) and for the various Internet contents (web pages, files, streaming video, etc.).
