Comments on "Achievable Rates in Cognitive Radio Channels"

In a premier paper on the information-theoretic analysis of a two-user cognitive interference channel(CIC), Devroye et al. presented an achievable rate region for the two-user discrete memoryless CIC. The coding scheme proposed by Devroye et al. is correct but unfortunately some rate-terms in the derived achievable rate region are incorrect (in fact incomplete) because of occurring some mistakes in decoding and analysis of error probability. We correct and complete the wrong rate-terms and thereby show that the corrected achievable rate region includes the rate region presented in.
