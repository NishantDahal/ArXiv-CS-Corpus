*-Continuous Kleene $ω$-Algebras

We define and study basic properties of *-continuous Kleene $ω$-algebras that involve a *-continuous Kleene algebra with a *-continuous action on a semimodule and an infinite product operation that is also *-continuous. We show that *-continuous Kleene $ω$-algebras give rise to iteration semiring-semimodule pairs. We show how our work can be applied to solve certain energy problems for hybrid systems.
