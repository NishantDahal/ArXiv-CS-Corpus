Multi-Comm-Core Architecture for Terabit/s Wireless

Wireless communications along with the Internet has been the most transformative technology in the past 50 years. We expect that wireless data growth driven by new mobile applications, need to connect all humankind (not just 1/3) as well as Billions of things to the Internet will require Terabit/s shared links for ground based local area and wide area wireless access, for wireless backhaul as well as access via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellites. We present a new scalable radio architecture that we refer to multi-comm-core (MCC) to enable low-cost ultra-high speed wireless communications using both traditional and millimeter wave spectrum.
