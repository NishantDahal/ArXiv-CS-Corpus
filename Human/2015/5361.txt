Finding Influential Bloggers

Blogging is a popular way of expressing opinions and discussing topics. Bloggers demonstrate different levels of commitment and most interesting are influential bloggers. Around such bloggers, the groups are forming, which concentrate users sharing similar interests. Finding such bloggers is an important task and has many applications e.g. marketing, business, politics. Influential ones affect others which is related to the process of diffusion. However, there is no objective way to telling which blogger is more influential. Therefore, researchers take into consideration different criteria to assess bloggers (e.g. SNA centrality measures). In this paper we propose new, efficient method for influential bloggers discovery which is based on relation of commenting in blogger's thread and is defined on bloggers level. Next, we compare results with other, comparative method proposed by Agarwal et al. called iFinder which is based on links between posts.
