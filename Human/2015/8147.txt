An algorithm for online tensor prediction

We present a new method for online prediction and learning of tensors ($N$-way arrays, $N >2$) from sequential measurements. We focus on the specific case of 3-D tensors and exploit a recently developed framework of structured tensor decompositions proposed in [1]. In this framework it is possible to treat 3-D tensors as linear operators and appropriately generalize notions of rank and positive definiteness to tensors in a natural way. Using these notions we propose a generalization of the matrix exponentiated gradient descent algorithm [2] to a tensor exponentiated gradient descent algorithm using an extension of the notion of von-Neumann divergence to tensors. Then following a similar construction as in [3], we exploit this algorithm to propose an online algorithm for learning and prediction of tensors with provable regret guarantees. Simulations results are presented on semi-synthetic data sets of ratings evolving in time under local influence over a social network. The result indicate superior performance compared to other (online) convex tensor completion methods.
