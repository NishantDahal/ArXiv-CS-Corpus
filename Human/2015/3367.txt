Real-Time Model Checking Support for AADL

We describe a model-checking toolchain for the behavioral verification of AADL models that takes into account the realtime semantics of the language and that is compatible with the AADL Behavioral Annex. We give a high-level view of the tools and transformations involved in the verification process and focus on the support offered by our framework for checking user-defined properties. We also describe the experimental results obtained on a significant avionic demonstrator, that models a network protocol in charge of data communications between an airplane and ground stations.
