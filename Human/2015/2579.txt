Sum Secrecy Rate in MISO Full-Duplex Wiretap Channel with Imperfect CSI

In this paper, we consider the achievable sum secrecy rate in MISO (multiple-input-single-output) {\em full-duplex} wiretap channel in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and imperfect channel state information (CSI). We assume that the users participating in full-duplex communication have multiple transmit antennas, and that the users and the eavesdropper have single receive antenna each. The users have individual transmit power constraints. They also transmit jamming signals to improve the secrecy rates. We obtain the achievable perfect secrecy rate region by maximizing the worst case sum secrecy rate. We also obtain the corresponding transmit covariance matrices associated with the message signals and the jamming signals. Numerical results that show the impact of imperfect CSI on the achievable secrecy rate region are presented.
