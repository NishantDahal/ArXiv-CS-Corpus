A composite constraints approach to declarative agent-based modeling

Agent-based models (ABMs) are ubiquitous in research and industry. Currently, simulating ABMs involves at least some imperative (step-by-step) computer instructions. An alternative approach is declarative programming, in which a set of requirements is described at a high level of abstraction. Here we describe a fully declarative approach to the automated construction of simulations for ABMs. In this framework, logic for ABM simulations is encapsulated into predefined components. The user specifies a set of requirements describing the desired functionality. Additionally, each component has a set of consistency requirements. The framework iteratively seeks a simulation design that satisfies both user and system requirements. This approach allows the user to omit most details from the simulation specification, simplifying simulation design.
