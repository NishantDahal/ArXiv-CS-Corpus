On Base Field of Linear Network Coding

For a (single-source) multicast network, the size of a base field is the most known and studied algebraic identity that is involved in characterizing its linear solvability over the base field. In this paper, we design a new class $\mathcal{N}$ of multicast networks and obtain an explicit formula for the linear solvability of these networks, which involves the associated coset numbers of a multiplicative subgroup in a base field. The concise formula turns out to be the first that matches the topological structure of a multicast network and algebraic identities of a field other than size. It further facilitates us to unveil \emph{infinitely many} new multicast networks linearly solvable over GF($q$) but not over GF($q'$) with $q < q'$, based on a subgroup order criterion. In particular, i) for every $k\geq 2$, an instance in $\mathcal{N}$ can be found linearly solvable over GF($2^{2k}$) but \emph{not} over GF($2^{2k+1}$), and ii) for arbitrary distinct primes $p$ and $p'$, there are infinitely many $k$ and $k'$ such that an instance in $\mathcal{N}$ can be found linearly solvable over GF($p^k$) but \emph{not} over GF($p'^{k'}$) with $p^k < p'^{k'}$. On the other hand, the construction of $\mathcal{N}$ also leads to a new class of multicast networks with $Θ(q^2)$ nodes and $Θ(q^2)$ edges, where $q \geq 5$ is the minimum field size for linear solvability of the network.
