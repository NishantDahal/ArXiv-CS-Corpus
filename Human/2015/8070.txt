Normal forms for linear displacement context-free grammars

In this paper we prove several results on normal forms for linear displacement context-free grammars. The results themselves are rather simple and use well-known techniques, but they are extensively used in more complex constructions. Therefore this article mostly serves educational and referential purposes.
