Two-dimensional Burst Error Correcting Code using Finite Field Fourier Transforms

We construct two-dimensional codes for correcting burst errors using the finite field Fourier transform. The encoding procedure is performed in the transformed domain using the conjugacy property of the finite field Fourier transform. The decoding procedure is also done in the transformed domain. Our code is capable of correcting multiple non-overlapping occurrence of different error patterns from a finite set of predefined error patterns. The code construction is useful for encoding data in two dimensions for application in data storage and bar codes
