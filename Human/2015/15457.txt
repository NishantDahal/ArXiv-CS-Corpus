Breaking the log n barrier on rumor spreading

$O(\log n)$ rounds has been a well known upper bound for rumor spreading using push&pull in the random phone call model (i.e., uniform gossip in the complete graph). A matching lower bound of $Î©(\log n)$ is also known for this special case. Under the assumption of this model and with a natural addition that nodes can call a partner once they learn its address (e.g., its IP address) we present a new distributed, address-oblivious and robust algorithm that uses push&pull with pointer jumping to spread a rumor to all nodes in only $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, w.h.p. This algorithm can also cope with $F= O(n/2^{\sqrt{\log n}})$ node failures, in which case all but $O(F)$ nodes become informed within $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, w.h.p.
