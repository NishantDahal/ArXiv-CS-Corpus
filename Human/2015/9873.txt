Discrete Route/Trajectory Decision Making Problems

The paper focuses on composite multistage decision making problems which are targeted to design a route/trajectory from an initial decision situation (origin) to goal (destination) decision situation(s). Automobile routing problem is considered as a basic physical metaphor. The problems are based on a discrete (combinatorial) operations/states design/solving space (e.g., digraph). The described types of discrete decision making problems can be considered as intelligent design of a route (trajectory, strategy) and can be used in many domains: (a) education (planning of student educational trajectory), (b) medicine (medical treatment), (c) economics (trajectory of start-up development). Several types of the route decision making problems are described: (i) basic route decision making, (ii) multi-goal route decision making, (iii) multi-route decision making, (iv) multi-route decision making with route/trajectory change(s), (v) composite multi-route decision making (solution is a composition of several routes/trajectories at several corresponding domains), and (vi) composite multi-route decision making with coordinated routes/trajectories. In addition, problems of modeling and building the design spaces are considered. Numerical examples illustrate the suggested approach. Three applications are considered: educational trajectory (orienteering problem), plan of start-up company (modular three-stage design), and plan of medical treatment (planning over digraph with two-component vertices).
