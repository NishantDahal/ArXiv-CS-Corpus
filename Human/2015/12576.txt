Characterization of Vehicle Behavior with Information Theory

This work proposes the use of Information Theory for the characterization of vehicles behavior through their velocities. Three public data sets were used: i.Mobile Century data set collected on Highway I-880, near Union City, California; ii.Borlänge GPS data set collected in the Swedish city of Borlänge; and iii.Beijing taxicabs data set collected in Beijing, China, where each vehicle speed is stored as a time series. The Bandt-Pompe methodology combined with the Complexity-Entropy plane were used to identify different regimes and behaviors. The global velocity is compatible with a correlated noise with f^{-k} Power Spectrum with k >= 0. With this we identify traffic behaviors as, for instance, random velocities (k aprox. 0) when there is congestion, and more correlated velocities (k aprox. 3) in the presence of free traffic flow.
