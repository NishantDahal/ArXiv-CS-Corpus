Andriod Based Punjabi TTS System

The usage of mobile phones is nearly 3.5 times more than that of personal computers. Android has the largest share among its counter parts like IOS, Windows and Symbian Android applications have a very few restrictions on them. TTS systems on Android are available for many languages but a very few systems of this type are available for Punjabi language. Our research work had the aim to develop an application that will be able to produce synthetic Punjabi speech. The paper examines the methodology used to develop speech synthesis TTS system for the Punjabi content, which is written in Gurmukhi script. For the development of this system, we use concatenative speech synthesis method with phonemes as the basic units of concatenation. Some challenges like application size, processing time, must be considered, while porting this TTS system to resource-limited devices like mobile phones.
