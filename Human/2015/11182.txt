Adaptive Lookup for Unstructured Peer-to-Peer Overlays

Scalability and efficient global search in unstructured peer-to-peer overlays have been extensively studied in the literature. The global search comes at the expense of local interactions between peers. Most of the unstructured peer-to-peer overlays do not provide any performance guarantee. In this work we propose a novel Quality of Service enabled lookup for unstructured peer-to-peer overlays that will allow the user's query to traverse only those overlay links which satisfy the given constraints. Additionally, it also improves the scalability by judiciously using the overlay resources. Our approach selectively forwards the queries using QoS metrics like latency, bandwidth, and overlay link status so as to ensure improved performance in a scenario where the degree of peer joins and leaves are high. User is given only those results which can be downloaded with the given constraints. Also, the protocol aims at minimizing the message overhead over the overlay network.
