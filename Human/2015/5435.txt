Simple rate-adaptive LDPC coding for quantum key distribution

Although quantum key distribution (QKD) comes from the development of quantum theory, the implementation of a practical QKD system does involve a lot of classical process, such as key reconciliation and privacy amplification, which is called post-processing. Post-processing has been a crucial element to high speed QKD systems, even the bottleneck of it because of its relatively high time consumption. Low density parity check (LDPC) is now becoming a promising approach of overcoming the bottleneck due to its good performance in processing throughput. In this article we propose and simulate an easily implemented but efficiently rate-adaptive LDPC coding approach of reconciliation, different from the previously proposed puncturing- and shortening-based approach. We also give a measure for choosing the optimal LDPC parameter for our rate-adaptive approach according to error rates.
