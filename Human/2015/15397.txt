The Quantum Car

I explore the use of quantum information as a security enabler for the future driverless vehicle. Specifically, I investigate the role combined classical and quantum information can have on the most important characteristic of the driverless vehicle paradigm - the vehicle location. By using information-theoretic verification frameworks, coupled with emerging quantum-based location-verification procedures, I show how vehicle positions can be authenticated with a probability of error simply not attainable in classical-only networks. I also discuss how other quantum applications can be seamlessly encapsulated within the same vehicular communication infrastructure required for location verification. The two technology enablers required for the driverless quantum vehicle are an increase in current quantum memory timescales (likely) and wide-scale deployment of classical vehicular communication infrastructure (underway). I argue the enhanced safety features delivered by the `Quantum Car' mean its eventual deployment is inevitable.
