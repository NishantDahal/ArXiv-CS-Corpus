Completeness-via-canonicity for coalgebraic logics

This thesis aims to provide a suite of techniques to generate completeness results for coalgebraic logics with axioms of arbitrary rank. We have chosen to investigate the possibility to generalize what is arguably one of the most successful methods to prove completeness results in `classical' modal logic, namely completeness-via-canonicity. This technique is particularly well-suited to a coalgebraic generalization because of its clean and abstract algebraic formalism.
