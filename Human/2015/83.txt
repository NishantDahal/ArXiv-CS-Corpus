Accelerate micromagnetic simulations with GPU programming in MATLAB

A finite-difference Micromagnetic simulation code written in MATLAB is presented with Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration. The high performance of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is demonstrated compared to a typical Central Processing Unit (CPU) based code. The speed-up of GPU to CPU is shown to be greater than 30 for problems with larger sizes on a mid-end GPU in single precision. The code is less than 200 lines and suitable for new algorithm developing.
