On Galois-Division Multiple Access Systems: Figures of Merit and Performance Evaluation

A new approach to multiple access based on finite field transforms is investigated. These schemes, termed Galois-Division Multiple Access (GDMA), offer compact bandwidth requirements. A new digital transform, the Finite Field Hartley Transform (FFHT) requires to deal with fields of characteristic p, p \neq 2. A binary-to-p-ary (p \neq 2) mapping based on the opportunistic secondary channel is introduced. This allows the use of GDMA in conjunction with available digital systems. The performance of GDMA is also evaluated.
