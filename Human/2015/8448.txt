Throughput-Optimal Multihop Broadcast on Directed Acyclic Wireless Networks

We study the problem of efficiently broadcasting packets in multi-hop wireless networks. At each time slot the network controller activates a set of non-interfering links and forwards selected copies of packets on each activated link. A packet is considered jointly received only when all nodes in the network have obtained a copy of it. The maximum rate of jointly received packets is referred to as the broadcast capacity of the network. Existing policies achieve the broadcast capacity by balancing traffic over a set of spanning trees, which are difficult to maintain in a large and time-varying wireless network. We propose a new dynamic algorithm that achieves the broadcast capacity when the underlying network topology is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This algorithm is decentralized, utilizes local queue-length information only and does not require the use of global topological structures such as spanning trees. The principal technical challenge inherent in the problem is the absence of work-conservation principle due to the duplication of packets, which renders traditional queuing modelling inapplicable. We overcome this difficulty by studying relative packet deficits and imposing in-order delivery constraints to every node in the network. Although in-order packet delivery, in general, leads to degraded throughput in graphs with cycles, we show that it is throughput optimal in DAGs and can be exploited to simplify the design and analysis of optimal algorithms. Our characterization leads to a polynomial time algorithm for computing the broadcast capacity of any wireless DAG under the primary interference constraints. Additionally, we propose an extension of our algorithm which can be effectively used for broadcasting in any network with arbitrary topology.
