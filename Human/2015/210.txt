Bit-oriented quantum public-key encryption

We propose a bit-oriented quantum public-key scheme which uses Boolean function as private-key and randomly changed pairs of quantum state and classical string as public-keys. Contrast to the typical classical public-key scheme, one private-key in our scheme corresponds to an exponential number of public-keys. The goal of our scheme is to achieve information-theoretic security, and the security analysis is also given.
