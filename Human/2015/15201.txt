On A Testing and Implementation of Quantum Gate and Measurement Emulator (QGAME)

Today, people are looking forward to get an awesome computational power. This kind of desire can be answered by quantum computing. By adopting quantum mechanics theory, it can generate a very fast computation result. As known, quantum mechanics can establish that particle can also become wave; it shows that electron can be in duality. Through this theory, even a human teleportation is issued can be really happened in the future. However, it needs a high requirement of hardware support to implement the real quantum computing. That is why it is difficult to bring quantum computing into reality. This research presents a study about quantum computing. Here it is studied, a specialty of quantum computing, like superposition, as if the classical computer can do it. Since there was a marvellous research about quantum computer simulation that runs on classical computer, this research provides an analysis about our testing and implementation of Quantum Gate and Measurement Emulator (QGAME). Our analysis, testing and implementation are based on a method that always use in the software engineering field.
