An Optimal Algorithm for Tiling the Plane with a Translated Polyomino

We give a $O(n)$-time algorithm for determining whether translations of a polyomino with $n$ edges can tile the plane. The algorithm is also a $O(n)$-time algorithm for enumerating all such tilings that are also regular, and we prove that at most $Î˜(n)$ such tilings exist.
