Technologies for Web and cloud service interaction: a survey

The evolution of Web and service technologies has led to a wide landscape of standards and protocols for interaction between loosely coupled software components. Examples range from Web applications, mashups, apps, and mobile devices to enterprise-grade services. Cloud computing is the industrialization of service provision and delivery, where Web and enterprise services are converging on a technological level. The article discusses this technological landscape and, in particular, current trends with respect to cloud computing. The survey focuses on the communication aspect of interaction by reviewing languages, protocols, and architectures that drive today's standards and software implementations applicable in clouds. Technological advances will affect both client side and service side. There is a trend toward multiplexing, multihoming, and encryption in upcoming transport mechanisms, especially for architectures, where a client simultaneously sends a large number of requests to some service. Furthermore, there are emerging client-to-client communication capabilities in Web clients that could establish a foundation for upcoming Web-based messaging architectures.
