Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group in Voting Theory and Game Theory

This paper is a survey of some of the ways in which the representation theory of the symmetric group has been used in voting theory and game theory. In particular, we use permutation representations that arise from the action of the symmetric group on tabloids to describe, for example, a surprising relationship between the Borda count and Kemeny rule in voting. We also explain a powerful representation-theoretic approach to working with linear symmetric solution concepts in cooperative game theory. Along the way, we discuss new research questions that arise within and because of the representation-theoretic framework we are using.
