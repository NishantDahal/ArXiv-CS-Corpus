ARG: Virtual Tool to Teaching Argumentation Theory

Researchers look for new virtual instruments that can improve and maximize traditional forms of teaching and learning. In this paper, we present the ARG system, a virtual tool developed to help the teaching/learning process in argumentation theory, especially in the field of Law. ARG was developed based on Araucaria by Reed and Rowe, Room 5 by Ronald P. Loui, as well on systems such as Argue!-System and ArguMed by Bart Verheij. ARG is a platform for online collaboration and applies the theory of Stephen Toulmin to produce arguments that are more concise, precise, minimally structured and more resistant to criticism.
