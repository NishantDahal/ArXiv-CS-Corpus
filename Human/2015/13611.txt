Case Study on Cloud Based Library Software as a Service: Evaluating EZproxy

There is a growing relationship between academic libraries and cloud computing. Therefore, understanding the beginnings and the current use of cloud base services in libraries is important. This will help understand the factors that libraries should consider in the future. The purpose of this paper is to better understand the future implementation of the cloud based software in academic settings. Using cloud based, web based, and other remote services may bring both advantages and disadvantages, some of which this paper will bring out. First, a brief literature review of the academic literature, and a review of available general-purpose cloud-based library products are conducted. Next, a real-life scenario for a mid-sized New Zealand institution of higher education is evaluated. This case involves moving from a locally hosted version of EZproxy to a cloud based version with support from the vendor. As this information system decision is an important one, this paper makes a contribution to the available literature and can be informative for librarians. In conclusion, academic libraries will gradually involve more pervasive use of cloud based systems. The examples of important factors to be considered in future decisions include timing and staffing.
