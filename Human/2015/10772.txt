An Efficient Local Strategy to Control Information Spreading in Network

In social networks, control of rumor spread is an active area of research. SIR model is generally used to study the rumor dynamics in network while considering the rumor as an epidemic. In disease spreading model, epidemic is controlled by removing central nodes in the network. Full network information is needed for such removal. To have the information of complete network is difficult proposition. As a consequence, the search of an algorithm that may control epidemic without needing global information is a matter of great interest. In this paper, an immunization strategy is proposed that uses only local information available at a node, viz. degree of the node and average degree of its neighbour nodes. Proposed algorithm has been evaluated for scale-free network using SIR model. Numerical results show that proposed method has less complexity and gives significantly better results in comparison with other strategies while using only local information.
