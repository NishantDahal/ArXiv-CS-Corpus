Attribute-Based Multi-Dimensional Scalable Access Control For Social Media Sharing

Media sharing is an extremely popular paradigm of social interaction in online social networks (OSNs) nowadays. The scalable media access control is essential to perform information sharing among users with various access privileges. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional scalable media access control (MD-SMAC) system based on the proposed scalable ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (SCP-ABE) algorithm. In the proposed MD-SMAC system, fine-grained access control can be performed on the media contents encoded in a multi-dimensional scalable manner based on data consumers' diverse attributes. Through security analysis, we show that the proposed MC-SMAC system is able to resist collusion attacks. Additionally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the efficiency performance of the proposed system, especially on mobile devices.
