Proceedings of the Combined 22th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and 12th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics

This volume contains the proceedings of the Combined 22nd International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and the 12th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2015) which was held on 31 August 2015 in Madrid, Spain, as an affiliated workshop of CONCUR 2015, the 26th International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency. Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS workshop series has run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus has become broadly construed. The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS. Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have organized an annual combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop on the expressiveness of mathematical models of computation and the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts.
