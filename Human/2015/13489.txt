Capacity Bounds for Discrete-Time, Amplitude-Constrained, Additive White Gaussian Noise Channels

The capacity-achieving input distribution of the discrete-time, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an amplitude constraint is discrete and seems difficult to characterize explicitly. A dual capacity expression is used to derive analytic capacity upper bounds for scalar and vector AWGN channels. The scalar bound improves on McKellips' bound and is within 0.1 bits of capacity for all signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The two-dimensional bound is within 0.15 bits of capacity provably up to 4.5 dB, and numerical evidence suggests a similar gap for all SNRs.
