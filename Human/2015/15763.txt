Interactive Visualization of 2-D Persistence Modules

The goal of this work is to extend the standard persistent homology pipeline for exploratory data analysis to the 2-D persistence setting, in a practical, computationally efficient way. To this end, we introduce RIVET, a software tool for the visualization of 2-D persistence modules, and present mathematical foundations for this tool. RIVET provides an interactive visualization of the barcodes of 1-D affine slices of a 2-D persistence module $M$. It also computes and visualizes the dimension of each vector space in $M$ and the bigraded Betti numbers of $M$. At the heart of our computational approach is a novel data structure based on planar line arrangements, on which we can perform fast queries to find the barcode of any slice of $M$. We present an efficient algorithm for constructing this data structure and establish bounds on its complexity.
