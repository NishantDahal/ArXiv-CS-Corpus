Estimation of the direct-to-reverberant Energy Ratio using a spherical microphone array

This paper proposes a practical approach to estimate the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) using a spherical microphone array without having knowledge of the source signal. We base our estimation on a theoretical relationship between the DRR and the coherence estimation function between coincident pressure and particle velocity. We discuss the proposed method's ability to estimate the DRR in a wide variety of room sizes, reverberation times and source receiver distances with appropriate examples. Test results show that the method can estimate the room DRR for frequencies between 199 - 2511 Hz, with $\pm$ 3 dB accuracy.
