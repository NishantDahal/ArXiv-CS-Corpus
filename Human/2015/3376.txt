Segment-Sliding Reconstruction of Pulsed Radar Echoes with Sub-Nyquist Sampling

It has been shown that analog-to-information con- version (AIC) is an efficient scheme to perform sub-Nyquist sampling of pulsed radar echoes. However, it is often impractical, if not infeasible, to reconstruct full-range Nyquist samples because of huge storage and computational load requirements. Based on the analyses of AIC measurement system, this paper develops a novel segment-sliding reconstruction (SegSR) scheme to effectively reconstruct the Nyquist samples. The SegSR per- forms segment-by-segment reconstruction in a sliding mode and can be implemented in real-time. An important characteristic that distinguish the proposed SegSR from the existing methods is that the measurement matrix in each segment satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition. Partial support in the previous segment can be incorporated into the estimation of the Nyquist samples in the current segment. The effect of interference intro- duced from adjacent segments is theoretically analyzed, and it is revealed that the interference consists of two interference levels having different impacts to the signal reconstruction performance. With these observations, a two-step orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure is proposed for segment reconstruction, which takes into account different interference levels and partially known support of the previous segment. The proposed SegSR achieves nearly optimal reconstruction performance with a signi- ficant reduction of computational loads and storage requirements. Theoretical analyses and simulations verify its effectiveness.
