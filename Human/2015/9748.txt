Review and Perspective for Distance Based Trajectory Clustering

In this paper we tackle the issue of clustering trajectories of geolocalized observations. Using clustering technics based on the choice of a distance between the observations, we  first provide a comprehensive review of the different distances used in the literature to  compare trajectories. Then based on the limitations of these methods, we  introduce a new distance : Symmetrized Segment-Path Distance (SSPD). We finally compare this new distance to the others  according to their corresponding clustering results obtained using both hierarchical clustering and affinity propagation methods.
