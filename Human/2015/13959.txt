Power Distribution of Device-to-Device Communications in Underlaid Cellular Networks

Device-to-device (D2D) communications have recently emerged as a novel transmission paradigm in wireless cellular networks. D2D transmissions take place concurrently with the usual cellular connections, and thus, controlling the interference brought to the macro-cellular user equipment (UE) is of vital importance. In this paper, we consider the uplink transmission of a tier of D2D users that operates as an underlay for the traditional cellular network. Using network model based on stochastic geometry, we derive the equilibrium cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the D2D transmit power. Considering interference-limited and relatively lossy environment cases, closed form equations are derived for the power CDF. Finally, a tight closed-form upper-bound for the derived power distribution is proposed, and the analytical results are validated via simulation.
