Efficient Edge Detection on Low-Cost FPGAs

Improving the efficiency of edge detection in embedded applications, such as UAV control, is critical for reducing system cost and power dissipation. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are a good platform for making improvements because of their specialised internal structure. However, current FPGA edge detectors do not exploit this structure well. A new edge detection architecture is proposed that is better optimised for FPGAs. The basis of the architecture is the Sobel edge kernels that are shown to be the most suitable because of their separability and absence of multiplications. Edge intensities are calculated with a new 4:2 compressor that consists of two custom-designed 3:2 compressors. Addition speed is increased by breaking carry propagation chains with look-ahead logic. Testing of the design showed it gives a 28% increase in speed and 4.4% reduction in area over previous equivalent designs, which demonstrated that it will lower the cost of edge detection systems, dissipate less power and still maintain high-speed control.
