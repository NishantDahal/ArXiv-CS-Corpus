On the BER of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Underwater Wireless Optical Communication Systems

In this paper we analyze and investigate the bit error rate (BER) performance of multiple-input multiple-output underwater wireless optical communication (MIMO-UWOC) systems. In addition to exact BER expressions, we also obtain an upper bound on the system BER. To effectively estimate the BER expressions, we use Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula as well as approximation to the sum of log-normal random variables. We confirm the accuracy of our analytical expressions by evaluating the BER through photon-counting approach. Our simulation results show that MIMO technique can mitigate the channel turbulence-induced fading and consequently, can partially extend the viable communication range, especially for channels with stronger turbulence.
