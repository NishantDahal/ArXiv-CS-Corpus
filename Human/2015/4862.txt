Dynamic Bandwidth-Efficient BCube Topologies for Virtualized Data Center Networks

Network virtualization enables computing networks and data center (DC) providers to manage their networking resources in a flexible manner using software running on physical computers. In this paper, we address the existing issues with the classic DC network topologies in virtualized environment, and investigate a set of DC network topologies with the capability of providing dynamic structures according to the service-level required by the active traffic in a virtual DC network. In particular, we propose three main approaches to modify the structure of a classic BCube topology as a topology benchmark, and investigate their associated structural features and maximum achievable interconnected bandwidth for different routing scenarios. Finally, we run an extensive simulation program to check the performance of the proposed modified topologies in a simulation environment which considers failure analysis and also traffic congestion. Our simulation experiments, which are consistent to our design goals, show the efficiency of the proposed modified topologies comparing to the classic BCube in terms of bandwidth availability and failure resiliency.
