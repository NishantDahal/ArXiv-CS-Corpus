Cascade Learning by Optimally Partitioning

Cascaded AdaBoost classifier is a well-known efficient object detection algorithm. The cascade structure has many parameters to be determined. Most of existing cascade learning algorithms are designed by assigning detection rate and false positive rate to each stage either dynamically or statically. Their objective functions are not directly related to minimum computation cost. These algorithms are not guaranteed to have optimal solution in the sense of minimizing computation cost. On the assumption that a strong classifier is given, in this paper we propose an optimal cascade learning algorithm (we call it iCascade) which iteratively partitions the strong classifiers into two parts until predefined number of stages are generated. iCascade searches the optimal number ri of weak classifiers of each stage i by directly minimizing the computation cost of the cascade. Theorems are provided to guarantee the existence of the unique optimal solution. Theorems are also given for the proposed efficient algorithm of searching optimal parameters ri. Once a new stage is added, the parameter ri for each stage decreases gradually as iteration proceeds, which we call decreasing phenomenon. Moreover, with the goal of minimizing computation cost, we develop an effective algorithm for setting the optimal threshold of each stage classifier. In addition, we prove in theory why more new weak classifiers are required compared to the last stage. Experimental results on face detection demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
