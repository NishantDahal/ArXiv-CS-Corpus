Generation and Validation of Custom Multiplication IP Blocks from the Web

Every CPU carries one or more arithmetical and logical units. One popular operation that is performed by these units is multiplication. Automatic generation of custom VHDL models for performing this operation, allows the designer to achieve a time efficient design space exploration. Although these units are heavily utilized in modern digital circuits and DSP, there is no tool, accessible from the web, to generate the HDL description of such designs for arbitrary and different input bitwidths. In this paper, we present our web accessible tool to construct completely custom optimized multiplication units together with random generated test vectors for their verification. Our novel tool is one of the firsts web based EDA tools to automate the design of such units and simultaneously provide custom testbenches to verify their correctness. Our synthesized circuits on Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA, operate up to 589 Mhz.
