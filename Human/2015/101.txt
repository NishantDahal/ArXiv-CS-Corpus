On the stability of asynchronous Random Access Schemes

Slotted Aloha-based Random Access (RA) techniques have recently regained attention in light of the use of Interference Cancellation (IC) as a mean to exploit diversity created through the transmission of multiple burst copies per packet content (CRDSA). Subsequently, the same concept has been extended to pure ALOHA-based techniques in order to boost the performance also in case of asynchronous RA schemes. In this paper, throughput as well as packet delay and related stability for asynchronous ALOHA techniques under geometrically distributed retransmissions are analyzed both in case of finite and infinite population size. Moreover, a comparison between pure ALOHA, its evolution (known as CRA) and CRDSA techniques is presented, in order to give a measure of the achievable gain that can be reached in a closed-loop scenario with respect to the previous state of the art.
