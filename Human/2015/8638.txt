Teaching natural deduction in the right order with Natural Deduction Planner

We describe a strategy-based approach to teaching natural deduction using a notation that emphasises the order in which deductions are constructed, together with a {\LaTeX} package and Java app to aid in the production of teaching resources and classroom demonstrations. Our approach is aimed at students with little exposure to mathematical method and has been developed while teaching undergraduate classes for philosophy students over the last ten years.
