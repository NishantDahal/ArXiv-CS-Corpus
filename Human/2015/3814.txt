Rule based lexicographical permutation sequences

In a permutation sequence built by means of sub permutations the transition between successive permutations are subject to a set of n(n - 1)/2 rules that group into n - 1 matrices with a high degree of regularity. By means of these rules the sequence can be produced in O(3n!) time and O(n^3) space.
