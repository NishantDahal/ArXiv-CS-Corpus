Planning in the Wild: Modeling Tools for PDDL

Even though there are sophisticated AI planning algorithms, many integrated, large-scale projects do not use planning. One reason seems to be the missing support by engineering tools such as syntax highlighting and visualization. We propose myPDDL - a modular toolbox for efficiently creating PDDL domains and problems. To evaluate myPDDL, we compare it to existing knowledge engineering tools for PDDL and experimentally assess its usefulness for novice PDDL users.
