Resilient Big Data Monetization

Resilient Big Data monetization is devised as k-dominance and m-connectivity problems, such that common-interests are connected by k-ways to measurement tools, which are tied within each other in m-ways. Consequently, a greedy approximation algorithm Plutus (i.e resembling Greek god of wealth) is proposed, which isolates measurement tools to ac-quire domination over common-interests, establishes synergy from common-interests to measurement tools and then acquires divergence and sustains it within measurement tools
