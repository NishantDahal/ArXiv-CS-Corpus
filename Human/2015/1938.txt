Taylor Series as Wide-sense Biorthogonal Wavelet Decomposition

Pointwise-supported generalized wavelets are introduced, based on Dirac, doublet and further derivatives of delta. A generalized biorthogonal analysis leads to standard Taylor series and new Dual-Taylor series that may be interpreted as Laurent Schwartz distributions. A Parseval-like identity is also derived for Taylor series, showing that Taylor series support an energy theorem. New representations for signals called derivagrams are introduced, which are similar to spectrograms. This approach corroborates the impact of wavelets in modern signal analysis.
