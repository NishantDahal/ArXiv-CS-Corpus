On throughput capacity for a class of buffer-limited MANETs

Available throughput performance studies for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) suffer from two major limitations: they mainly focus on the scaling law study of throughput, while the exact throughput of such networks remains largely unknown; they usually consider the infinite buffer scenarios, which are not applicable to the practical networks with limited buffer. As a step to address these limitations, this paper develops a general framework for the exact throughput capacity study of a class of buffer-limited MANETs with the two-hop relay. We first provide analysis to reveal how the throughput capacity of such a MANET is determined by its relay-buffer blocking probability (RBP). Based on the Embedded Markov Chain Theory and Queuing Theory, a novel theoretical framework is then developed to enable the RBP and closed-form expression for exact throughput capacity to be derived. We further conduct case studies under two typical transmission scheduling schemes to illustrate the applicability of our framework and to explore the corresponding capacity optimization as well as capacity scaling law. Finally, extensive simulation and numerical results are provided to validate the efficiency of our framework and to show the impacts brought by the buffer constraint.
