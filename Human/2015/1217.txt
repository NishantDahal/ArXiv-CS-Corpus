Secret Image Sharing Based CTS with Cheating Detection

Cheque Truncation System(CTS) is an automatic cheque clearance system implemented by RBI.CTS uses cheque image, instead of the physical cheque itself, for cheque clearance thus reducing the turn around time drastically. This approach holds back the physical movement of cheque from presenting bank to the drawee bank. In CTS, digital image of the cheque is protected using standard public key and symmetric key encryptions like RSA, triple DES etc. This involves a lot of computation overhead and key management. The security also depends on the hard mathematical problem and is only computationally secure.Information theoretically secure, secret image sharing techniques can be used in the CTS for the secure and efficient processing of cheque image .In this paper, we propose two simple and efficient secret image sharing schemes and a Cheque Truncation System based on these algorithms . In the proposed scheme,the presenting bank is acting as the dealer and the participants are the customer, and the drawee bank.The dealer should generate the shares of cheque and distributes it to customer and drawee bank.The validity of the shares are important during the reconstruction process. The proposed scheme also suggests a method for cheating detection which identify any invalid shares submitted by the customers, using the hashing technique. The experimental results shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure compared with the existing scheme.
