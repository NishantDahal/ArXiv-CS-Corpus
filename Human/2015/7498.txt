Programs as Polypeptides

We describe a visual programming language for defining behaviors manifested by reified actors in a 2D virtual world that can be compiled into programs comprised of sequences of combinators that are themselves reified as actors. This makes it possible to build programs that build programs from components of a few fixed types delivered by diffusion using processes that resemble chemistry as much as computation.
