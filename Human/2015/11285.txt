Invited Abstract: Issues with State-based Energy Consumption Modelling

Energy consumption modelling by state based approaches often assume constant energy consumption values in each state. However, it happens in certain situations that during state transitions or even during a state the energy consumption is not constant and does fluctuate. This paper discusses those issues by presenting some examples from wireless sensor and wireless local area networks for such cases and possible solutions.
