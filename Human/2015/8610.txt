Using interrogative logic to teach classical logic

In the paper I discuss a tool for helping students in their symbolizations of natural language sentences using the formal language of classical first order logic (CFOL). The tool is an extension of Hintikka's concept of (Inquirer's) range of attention in the context of interrogative games. Any given text is reconstructed as the answer to a "big" or principal question obtained through the answers of a series of "small" or operative questions. The tool brings some "narrative flavor" to the symbolization and offers a convenient mold that can be used by students in many different contexts.
