Adding modular predicates to first-order fragments

We investigate the decidability of the definability problem for fragments of first order logic over finite words enriched with modular predicates. Our approach aims toward the most generic statements that we could achieve, which successfully covers the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first order logic and some of its fragments. We obtain that deciding this problem for each level of the alternation hierarchy of both first order logic and its two-variable fragment when equipped with all regular numerical predicates is not harder than deciding it for the corresponding level  equipped with only the linear order and the successor. For two-variable fragments we also treat the case of the signature containing only the order and modular predicates.Relying on some recent results, this proves the decidability for each level of the alternation hierarchy of the two-variable first order fragmentwhile in the case of the first order logic the question remains open for levels greater than two.The main ingredients of the proofs are syntactic transformations of first order formulas as well as the algebraic framework of finite categories.
