Workload Trace Generation for Dynamic Environments in Cloud Computing

Cloud computing datacenters provide millions of virtual machines in actual cloud markets. In this context, Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) is one of the most challenging problems in cloud infrastructure management, considering the large number of possible optimization criteria and different formulations that could be studied. Considering the on-demand model of cloud computing, the VMP problem should be optimized dynamically to efficiently attend typical workload of modern applications. This work proposes several dynamic environments for solving the VMP from the providers' perspective based on the most relevant dynamic parameters studied so far in the VMP literature. A complete set of environments and workload traces examples are presented in this work.
