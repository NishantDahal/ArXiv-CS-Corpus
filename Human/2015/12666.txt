Impartial Redistricting: A Markov Chain Approach

The gerrymandering problem is a worldwide problem which sets great threat to democracy and justice in district based elections. Thanks to partisan redistricting commissions, district boundaries are often manipulated to benefit incumbents. Since an independent commission is hard to come by, the possibility of impartially generating districts with a computer is explored in this thesis. We have developed an algorithm to randomly produce legal redistricting schemes for Pennsylvania.
