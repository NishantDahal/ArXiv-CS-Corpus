ms2: A molecular simulation tool for thermodynamic properties, new version release

A new version release (2.0) of the molecular simulation tool ms2 [S. Deublein et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 182 (2011) 2350] is presented. Version 2.0 of ms2 features a hybrid parallelization based on MPI and OpenMP for molecular dynamics simulation to achieve higher scalability. Furthermore, the formalism by Lustig [R. Lustig, Mol. Phys. 110 (2012) 3041] is implemented, allowing for a systematic sampling of Massieu potential derivatives in a single simulation run. Moreover, the Green-Kubo formalism is extended for the sampling of the electric conductivity and the residence time. To remove the restriction of the preceding version to electro-neutral molecules, Ewald summation is implemented to consider ionic long range interactions. Finally, the sampling of the radial distribution function is added.
