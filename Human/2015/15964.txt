Linear Codes from a Generic Construction

A generic construction of linear codes over finite fields has recently received a lot of attention, and many one-weight, two-weight and three-weight codes with good error correcting capability have been produced with this generic approach. The first objective of this paper is to establish relationships among some classes of linear codes obtained with this approach, so that the parameters of some classes of linear codes can be derived from those of other classes with known parameters. In this way, linear codes with new parameters will be derived. The second is to present a class of three-weight binary codes and consider their applications in secret sharing.
