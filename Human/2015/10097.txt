On cyclic DNA codes over the Ring $\Z_4 + u \Z_4$

In this paper, we study the theory for constructing DNA cyclic codes of odd length over $\Z_4[u]/\langle u^2 \rangle$ which play an important role in DNA computing. Cyclic codes of odd length over $\Z_4 + u \Z_4$ satisfy the reverse constraint and the reverse-complement constraint are studied in this paper. The structure and existence of such codes are also studied. The paper concludes with some DNA example obtained via the family of cyclic codes.
