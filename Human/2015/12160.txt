Performance evaluation of multiple precision matrix multiplications using parallelized Strassen and Winograd algorithms

It is well known that Strassen and Winograd algorithms can reduce the computational costs associated with dense matrix multiplication. We have already shown that they are also very effective for software-based multiple precision floating-point arithmetic environments such as the MPFR/GMP library. In this paper, we show that we can obtain the same effectiveness for double-double (DD) and quadruple-double (QD) environments supported by the QD library, and that parallelization can increase the speed of these multiple precision matrix multiplications. Finally, we demonstrate that our implemented parallelized Strassen and Winograd algorithms can increase the speed of parallelized LU decomposition.
