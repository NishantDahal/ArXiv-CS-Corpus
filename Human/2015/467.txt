Development of a multifactor authentication result checker system through GSM

This work is an implementation of a multifactor authentication SMS based result checking system. The objectives of this work were to improve on the available authentication methods and apply it on examination result checking system. The work takes care of only course codes with their grades, the current GPA and the overall CGPA. It employs the Pull SMS service, built on an independent service and a modem. Examination results consist of sensitive information, hence the need to further enhance the ones already in place so as to ensure further privacy and integrity, In the course of this project, the following assumptions were made: That a system that does the computation of students' result, calculate of GPA and CGPA is already in place. The implemented system was connected to the database of the existing system. A database that contains the bio-data of each student admitted exists. That SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) modem exists and should have been used but to reduce cost, a modem that can act like a SIM browser is used with a standard SIM card inserted in it and connected via cable to the application server. The system showed that further security and privacy could be achieved when multifactor authentication is employed. For further work, the system could be developed and built as a dependent service which involves having the application server connected to the service provider's SMS Center (SMSC).
