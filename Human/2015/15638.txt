Differential Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Using Linear Combining in Time-Varying Channels

Differential encoding and decoding can be employed to circumvent channel estimation in wireless relay networks. This article studies differential amplify-and-forward relaying using linear combining with arbitrary fixed combining weights in time-varying channels. An exact bit error rate (BER) analysis is obtained for this system using DBPSK modulation and over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels. The analysis is verified with simulation results for several sets of combining weights and in various fading scenarios.
