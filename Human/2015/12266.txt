Impact of Imbalance Usage of Social Networking Sites on Families

With the proliferation of social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook and Google+, investigating the impact of SNSs on our lives has become an important research area in recent years. Though SNS usage plays a key role in connecting people with friends and families from distant places, SNSs also bring concern for families. We focus on imbalance SNS usage, i.e., an individual remains busy in using SNSs when her family member is expecting to spend time with her. More specifically, we investigate the cause and pattern of imbalance SNS usage and how the emotion of family members may become affected, if they use SNSs in an imbalanced way in a regular manner. This paper is the first attempt to identify the relationship between an individual's imbalance SNS usage and the emotion of her family member in the context of a developing country.
