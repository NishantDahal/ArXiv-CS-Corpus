SenseDroid: A Context-Aware Information Exchange Framework for Mobile Sensor Networks Using Android Phones

Mobile phones and smartphones have evolved to be very powerful devices that have the potential to be utilized in many application areas apart from generic communication. With each passing year, we see increasingly powerful smartphones being manufactured, which have a plethora of powerful embedded sensors like microphone, camera, digital compass, GPS, accelerometer, temperature sensors and many more. Moreover, the ability to easily program today's smartphones, enables us to exploit these sensors, in a wide variety of application such as personal safety, emergency and calamity response, situation awareness, remote activity monitoring, transportation and environment monitoring. In this paper, we survey the existing mobile phone sensing methodologies and application areas. We also formulate the architectural framework of our project, SenseDroid, its utility, limitations and possible future applications.
