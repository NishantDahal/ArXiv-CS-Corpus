Practical Accounting in Content-Centric Networking (extended version)

Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a new class of network architectures designed to address some key limitations of the current IP-based Internet. One of its main features is in-network content caching, which allows requests for content to be served by routers. Despite improved bandwidth utilization and lower latency for popular content retrieval, in-network content caching offers producers no means of collecting information about content that is requested and later served from network caches. Such information is often needed for accounting purposes. In this paper, we design some secure accounting schemes that vary in the degree of consumer, router, and producer involvement. Next, we identify and analyze performance and security tradeoffs, and show that specific per-consumer accounting is impossible in the presence of router caches and without application-specific support. We then recommend accounting strategies that entail a few simple requirements for CCN architectures. Finally, our experimental results show that forms of native and secure CCN accounting are both more viable and practical than application-specific approaches with little modification to the existing architecture and protocol.
