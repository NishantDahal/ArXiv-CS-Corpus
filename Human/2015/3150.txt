Genomic Imaging Based on Codongrams and a^2grams

This paper introduces new tools for genomic signal processing, which can assist for genomic attribute extracting or describing biologically meaningful features embedded in a DNA. The codongrams and a2grams are offered as an alternative to spectrograms and scalograms. Twenty different a^2grams are defined for a genome, one for each amino acid (valgram is an a^2gram for valine; alagram is an a^2gram for alanine and so on). They provide information about the distribution and occurrence of the investigated amino acid. In particular, the metgram can be used to find out potential start position of genes within a genome. This approach can help implementing a new diagnosis test for genetic diseases by providing a type of DNA-medical imaging.
