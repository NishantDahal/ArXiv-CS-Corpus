Central Pattern Generators for the control of robotic systems

Bio-inspired control of motion is an active field of research with many applications in real world tasks. In the case of robotic systems that need to exhibit oscillatory behaviour (i.e. locomotion of snake-type or legged robots), Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are among the most versatile solutions. These controllers are often based on loosely-coupled oscillators similar to those found in the neural circuits of many animal species, and can be more robust to uncertainty (i.e. external perturbations) than traditional control approaches. This project provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in the field of CPGs, and in particular their applications within robotic systems. The project also tackles the implementation of a CPG-based controller in a small 3D-printed hexapod.
