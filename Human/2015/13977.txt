Coefficient of Restitution based Cross Layer Interference Aware Routing Protocol in Wireless Mesh Networks

In Multi-Radio Multi-Channel (MRMC) Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN), Partially Overlapped Channels (POC) has been used to increase the parallel transmission. But adjacent channel interference is very severe in MRMC environment; it decreases the network throughput very badly. In this paper, we propose a Coefficient of Restitution based Cross layer Interference aware Routing protocol (CoRCiaR) to improve TCP performance in Wireless Mesh Networks. This approach comprises of two-steps: Initially, the interference detection algorithm is developed at MAC layer by enhancing the RTS/CTS method. Based on the channel interference, congestion is identified by Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements, and subsequently the route discovery module selects the alternative path to send the data packet. The packets are transmitted to the congestion free path seamlessly by the source. The performance of the proposed CoRCiaR protocol is measured by Coefficient of Restitution (COR) parameter. The impact of the rerouting is experienced on the network throughput performance. The simulation results show that the proposed cross layer interference aware dynamic routing enhances the TCP performance on WMN.
