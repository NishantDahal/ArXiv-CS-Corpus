Pixel-wise Segmentation of Street with Neural Networks

Pixel-wise street segmentation of photographs taken from a drivers perspective is important for self-driving cars and can also support other object recognition tasks. A framework called SST was developed to examine the accuracy and execution time of different neural networks. The best neural network achieved an $F_1$-score of 89.5% with a simple feedforward neural network which trained to solve a regression task.
