Domain Representations Induced by Dyadic Subbases

We study domain representations induced by dyadic subbases and show that a proper dyadic subbase S of a second-countable regular space X induces an embedding of X in the set of minimal limit elements of a subdomain D of $\{0,1,\perp\}ω$. In particular, if X is compact, then X is a retract of the set of limit elements of D.
