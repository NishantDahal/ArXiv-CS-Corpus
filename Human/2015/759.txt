Linear decomposition attack on public key exchange protocols using semidirect products of (semi)groups

We show that a linear decomposition attack based on the decomposition method introduced by the author works by finding the exchanged secret keys in all main protocols using semidirect products of (semi)grops proposed by Kahrobaei, Shpilrain, Habeeb, Koupparis and Lam.
