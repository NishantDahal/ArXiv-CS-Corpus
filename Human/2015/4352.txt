An New Type Of Artificial Brain Using Controlled Neurons

Plans for a new type of artificial brain are possible because of realistic neurons in logically structured arrays of controlled toggles, one toggle per neuron. Controlled toggles can be made to compute, in parallel, parameters of critical importance for each of several complex images recalled from associative long term memory. Controlled toggles are shown below to amount to a new type of neural network that supports autonomous behavior and action.
