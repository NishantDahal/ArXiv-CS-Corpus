Transitioning to Proof

This paper describes some strategies used in a `transition' course. Such courses help undergraduate mathematics majors move from learning procedures to learning to function as critical mathematicians in order to understand and work with abstract concepts. One of the co-authors of this paper was a student of Leon Henkin. His influence on her helped shape the strategies used in the course, and is described at the end of the paper.
