A Method of Evaluating Effect of QoS Degradation on Multidimensional QoE of Web Service with ISO - based Usability

This paper studies a method of investigating effect of IP performance (QoS) degradation on quality of experience (QoE) for a Web service; it considers the usability based on the ISO 9241-11 as multidimensional QoE of a Web service (QoE-Web) and the QoS parameters standardized by the IETF. Moreover, the paper tackles clarification of the relationship between ISO-based QoE-Web and IETF-based QoS by the multiple regression analysis. The experiment is intended for the two actual Japanese online shopping services and utilizes 35 subjects. From the results, the paper quantitatively discusses how the QoE-Web deteriorates owing to the QoS degradation and shows that it is appropriate to evaluate the proposed method.
