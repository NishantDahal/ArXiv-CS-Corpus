New Classes of Permutation Binomials and Permutation Trinomials over Finite Fields

Permutation polynomials over finite fields play important roles in finite fields theory. They also have wide applications in many areas of science and engineering such as coding theory, cryptography, combinatorial design, communication theory and so on. Permutation binomials and trinomials attract people's interest due to their simple algebraic form and additional extraordinary properties. In this paper, several new classes of permutation binomials and permutation trinomials are constructed. Some of these permutation polynomials are generalizations of known ones.
