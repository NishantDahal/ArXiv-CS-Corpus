SGPD Volume Maximization for Community Detection

In this note we briefly study the feasibility of community detection in complex networks using peripheral vertices. Our method suggests a novel direction in axiomizing the problem of clustering in graphs and complex networks by looking at the topological role each vertex plays in the community structure, regardless of the attributes. The promising strength of pseudo-peripheral vertices as a lever for analysis of complex networks is also demonstrated on real-world data.
