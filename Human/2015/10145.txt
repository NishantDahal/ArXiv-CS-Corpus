On the Security of Privacy-Preserving Vehicular Communication Authentication with Hierarchical Aggregation and Fast Response

In [3], the authors proposed a highly efficient secure and privacy-preserving scheme for secure vehicular communications. The proposed scheme consists of four protocols: system setup, protocol for STP and STK distribution, protocol for common string synchronization, and protocol for vehicular communications. Here we define the security models for the protocol for STP and STK distribution, and the protocol for vehicular communications,respectively. We then prove that these two protocols are secure in our models.
