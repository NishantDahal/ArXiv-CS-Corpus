Information Leakage of Heterogeneous Encoded Correlated Sequences over Eavesdropped Channel

Correlated sources are present in communication systems where protocols ensure that there is some predetermined information for sources. Here correlated sources across an eavesdropped channel that incorporate a heterogeneous encoding scheme and their effect on the information leakage when some channel information and a source have been wiretapped is investigated. The information leakage bounds for the Slepian-Wolf scenario are provided. Thereafter, the Shannon cipher system approach is presented. Further, an implementation method using a matrix partition approach is described.
