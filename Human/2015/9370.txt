Improving Energy Efficiency in Upstream EPON Channels by Packet Coalescing

In this paper, we research the feasibility of adapting the packet coalescing algorithm, used successfully in IEEE 802.3az Ethernet cards, to upstream EPON channels. Our simulation experiments show that, using this algorithm, great power savings are feasible without requiring any changes to the deployed access network infrastructure nor to protocols.
