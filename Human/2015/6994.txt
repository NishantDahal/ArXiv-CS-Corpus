ModularityCheck: A Tool for Assessing Modularity using Co-Change Clusters

It is widely accepted that traditional modular structures suffer from the dominant decomposition problem. Therefore, to improve current modularity views, it is important to investigate the impact of design decisions concerning modularity in other dimensions, as the evolutionary view. In this paper, we propose the ModularityCheck tool to assess package modularity using co-change clusters, which are sets of classes that usually changed together in the past. Our tool extracts information from version control platforms and issue reports, retrieves co-change clusters, generates metrics related to co-change clusters, and provides visualizations for assessing modularity. We also provide a case study to evaluate the tool. http://youtu.be/7eBYa2dfIS8
