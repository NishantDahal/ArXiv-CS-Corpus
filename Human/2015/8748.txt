Meshfree C^2-Weighting for Shape Deformation

Handle-driven deformation based on linear blending is widely used in many applications because of its merits in intuitiveness, efficiency and easiness of implementation. We provide a meshfree method to compute the smooth weights of linear blending for shape deformation. The C2-continuity of weighting is guaranteed by the carefully formulated basis functions, with which the computation of weights is in a closed-form. Criteria to ensure the quality of deformation are preserved by the basis functions after decomposing the shape domain according to the Voronoi diagram of handles. The cost of inserting a new handle is only the time to evaluate the distances from the new handle to all sample points in the space of deformation. Moreover, a virtual handle insertion algorithm has been developed to allow users freely placing handles while preserving the criteria on weights. Experimental examples for real-time 2D/3D deformations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
