Finite-SNR Bounds on the Sum-Rate Capacity of Rayleigh Block-Fading Multiple-Access Channels with no a Priori CSI

We provide nonasymptotic upper and lower bounds on the sum-rate capacity of Rayleigh block-fading multiple-access channels for the setup where a priori channel state information is not available. The upper bound relies on a dual formula for channel capacity and on the assumption that the users can cooperate perfectly. The lower bound is derived assuming a noncooperative scenario, where each user employs unitary space-time modulation (independently from the other users). Numerical results show that the gap between the upper and the lower bound is small already at moderate SNR values. This suggests that the sum-rate capacity gains obtainable through user cooperation are minimal.
