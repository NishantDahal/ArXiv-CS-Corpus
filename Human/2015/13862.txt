Transceiver Design to Maximize Sum Secrecy Rate in Full Duplex SWIPT Systems

This letter considers secrecy simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in full duplex systems. In such a system, full duplex capable base station (FD-BS) is designed to transmit data to one downlink user and concurrently receive data from one uplink user, while one idle user harvests the radio-frequency (RF) signals energy to extend its lifetime. Moreover, to prevent eavesdropping, artificial noise (AN) is exploited by FD-BS to degrade the channel of the idle user, as well as to provide energy supply to the idle user. To maximize the sum of downlink secrecy rate and uplink secrecy rate, we jointly optimize the information covariance matrix, AN covariance matrix and receiver vector, under the constraints of the sum transmission power of FD-BS and the minimum harvested energy of the idle user. Since the problem is non-convex, the log-exponential reformulation and sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method are used. Extensive simulation results are provided and demonstrate that our proposed full duplex scheme extremely outperforms the half duplex scheme.
