Ensembles based on the Rich-Club and how to use them to build soft-communities

Ensembles of networks are used as null-models to discriminate network structures. We present an efficient algorithm, based on the maximal entropy method to generate network ensembles defined by the degree sequence and the rich-club coefficient. The method is applicable for unweighted, undirected networks. The ensembles are used to generate correlated and uncorrelated null--models of a real networks. These ensembles can be used to define the partition of a network into soft communities.
