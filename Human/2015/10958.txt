An Immersive Visualization Tool for Teaching and Simulation of Smart Grid Technologies

Intelligent power grid research, i.e. smart grid, involves many simultaneous users spread over a relatively large geographical area. A tool for advancing research and community education is presented utilizing large-scale visualization centers, e.g. planetariums, in simulating smart grid interactions. This approach immerses the user in virtual smart grid visualization and allows the user, with several other users, to interact in real time. This facilitates community education by demonstrating how the power grid functions with smart technologies. The simulation is sophisticated enough to also be used as a research tool for industry and higher education to test software algorithms, deployment strategies, communications protocols, and even new hardware.
