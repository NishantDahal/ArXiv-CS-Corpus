Chiminey: Reliable Computing and Data Management Platform in the Cloud

The enabling of scientific experiments that are embarrassingly parallel, long running and data-intensive into a cloud-based execution environment is a desirable, though complex undertaking for many researchers. The management of such virtual environments is cumbersome and not necessarily within the core skill set for scientists and engineers. We present here Chiminey, a software platform that enables researchers to (i) run applications on both traditional high-performance computing and cloud-based computing infrastructures, (ii) handle failure during execution, (iii) curate and visualise execution outputs, (iv) share such data with collaborators or the public, and (v) search for publicly available data.
