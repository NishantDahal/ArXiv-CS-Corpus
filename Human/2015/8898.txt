A note on the clique number of complete $k$-partite graphs

In this note, we show that a complete $k$-partite graph is the only graph with clique number $k$ among all degree-equivalent simple graphs. This result gives a lower bound on the clique number, which is sharper than existing bounds on a large family of graphs.
