A Nested Family of $k$-total Effective Rewards for Positional Games

We consider Gillette's two-person zero-sum stochastic games with perfect information. For each $k \in \ZZ_+$ we introduce an effective reward function, called $k$-total. For $k = 0$ and $1$ this function is known as {\it mean payoff} and {\it total reward}, respectively. We restrict our attention to the deterministic case. For all $k$, we prove the existence of a saddle point which can be realized by uniformly optimal pure stationary strategies. We also demonstrate that $k$-total reward games can be embedded into $(k+1)$-total reward games.
