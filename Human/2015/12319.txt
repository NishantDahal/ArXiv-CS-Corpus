Characteristic Formulae for Session Types (extended version)

Subtyping is a crucial ingredient of session type theory and its applications, notably to programming language implementations. In this paper, we study effective ways to check whether a session type is a subtype of another by applying a characteristic formulae approach to the problem. Our core contribution is an algorithm to generate a modal mu-calculus formula that characterises all the supertypes (or subtypes) of a given type. Subtyping checks can then be off-loaded to model checkers, thus incidentally yielding an efficient algorithm to check safety of session types, soundly and completely. We have implemented our theory and compared its cost with other classical subtyping algorithms.
