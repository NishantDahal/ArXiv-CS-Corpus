Creative Gardens

Can we move beyond simply networking creative individuals to establishing diverse communities of practice for innovation through discursive methods. Furthermore, can we digitise their creativity activities within an integrative socio-cultural collaborative technology platform that could then support distributed innovation. First, we consider the complexity of creative cultures from the perspective of design innovation, including how to nurture creativity activities in what we call Creative Gardens. Specifically, how they could grow, diverge, and combine, be- ing cultivated to nurture emergent, disruptive, collaborative innovation. Then, we consider the digitisation of Creative Gardens from the perspective of digital culture. Specifically, the tenets of Creative Gardens as dynamic and innovative communities. This includes considering the challenges and opportunities around digitisation, the influences around the connectivity with knowledge cultivation, and the potential for distributed innovation as collective intelligence to utilise diverse expertise. We conclude be considering the importance of the issues and questions raised, and their potential for the future.
