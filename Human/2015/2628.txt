Developing Educational Computer Animation Based on Human Personality Types

Computer animation in the past decade has become one of the most noticeable features of technology-based learning environments. With today's high educational demands as well as the lack of time provided for certain courses, classical educational methods have shown deficiencies in keeping up with the drastic changes observed in the digital era. Without taking into account various significant factors such as gender, age, level of interest and memory level, educational animation may turn out to be insufficient for learners or fail to meet their needs. However, we have noticed that the applications of animation for education have been given only inadequate attention, and students' personality types have never been taken into account. We suggest there is an interesting relationship here, and propose essential factors in creating educational animations based on students' personality types. Particularly, we investigate how information in computer animation may be presented in a preferable way based on the fundamental elements of computer animation. The present study believes that it is likely to have wide benefits in the field of education. Considering the personality types in designing educational computer animations with the aid of gathered empirical results might be a promising avenue to enhance the learning process.
