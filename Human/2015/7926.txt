Weihrauch degrees of finding equilibria in sequential games

We consider the degrees of non-computability (Weihrauch degrees) of finding winning strategies (or more generally, Nash equilibria) in infinite sequential games with certain winning sets (or more generally, outcome sets). In particular, we show that as the complexity of the winning sets increases in the difference hierarchy, the complexity of constructing winning strategies increases in the effective Borel hierarchy.
