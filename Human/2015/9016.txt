Simple, Fast Semantic Parsing with a Tensor Kernel

We describe a simple approach to semantic parsing based on a tensor product kernel. We extract two feature vectors: one for the query and one for each candidate logical form. We then train a classifier using the tensor product of the two vectors. Using very simple features for both, our system achieves an average F1 score of 40.1% on the WebQuestions dataset. This is comparable to more complex systems but is simpler to implement and runs faster.
