Computer simulation of Poisson's ratio of soft polydisperse discs at zero temperature

A simple algorithm is proposed for studies of structural and elastic properties in the presence of structural disorder at zero temperature. The algorithm is used to determine the properties of the polydisperse soft disc system. It is shown that the Poisson's ratio of the system essentially depends on the size polydispersity parameter - larger polydispersity implies larger Poisson's ratio. In the presence of any size polidispersity the Poisson's ratio increases also when the interactions between the particles tend to the hard potential.
