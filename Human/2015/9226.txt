Spaced seeds improve k-mer-based metagenomic classification

Metagenomics is a powerful approach to study genetic content of environmental samples that has been strongly promoted by NGS technologies. To cope with massive data involved in modern metagenomic projects, recent tools [4, 39] rely on the analysis of k-mers shared between the read to be classified and sampled reference genomes. Within this general framework, we show in this work that spaced seeds provide a significant improvement of classification accuracy as opposed to traditional contiguous k-mers. We support this thesis through a series a different computational experiments, including simulations of large-scale metagenomic projects. Scripts and programs used in this study, as well as supplementary material, are available from http://github.com/gregorykucherov/spaced-seeds-for-metagenomics.
