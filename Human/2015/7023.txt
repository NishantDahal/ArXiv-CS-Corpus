wHealth - Transforming Telehealth Services

A worldwide increase in proportions of older people in the population poses the challenge of managing their increasing healthcare needs within limited resources. To achieve this many countries are interested in adopting telehealth technology. Several shortcomings of state-of-the-art telehealth technology constrain widespread adoption of telehealth services. We present an ensemble-sensing framework - wHealth (short form of wireless health) for effective delivery of telehealth services. It extracts personal health information using sensors embedded in everyday devices and allows effective and seamless communication between patients and clinicians. Due to the non-stigmatizing design, ease of maintenance, simplistic interaction and seamless intervention, our wHealth platform has the potential to enable widespread adoption of telehealth services for managing elderly healthcare. We discuss the key barriers and potential solutions to make the wHealth platform a reality.
