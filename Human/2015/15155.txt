When the extension property does not hold for vector space alphabets

In our recent paper we characterized the extension property for symmetrized weight composition for linear codes over a module alphabet. Several improvements for the case of vector space alphabets are given in this paper. A detailed description of the property of $G$-pseudo-injectivity for vector spaces is made.
