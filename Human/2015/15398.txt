A Unified Approach to Error Bounds for Structured Convex Optimization Problems

Error bounds, which refer to inequalities that bound the distance of vectors in a test set to a given set by a residual function, have proven to be extremely useful in analyzing the convergence rates of a host of iterative methods for solving optimization problems. In this paper, we present a new framework for establishing error bounds for a class of structured convex optimization problems, in which the objective function is the sum of a smooth convex function and a general closed proper convex function. Such a class encapsulates not only fairly general constrained minimization problems but also various regularized loss minimization formulations in machine learning, signal processing, and statistics. Using our framework, we show that a number of existing error bound results can be recovered in a unified and transparent manner. To further demonstrate the power of our framework, we apply it to a class of nuclear-norm regularized loss minimization problems and establish a new error bound for this class under a strict complementarity-type regularity condition. We then complement this result by constructing an example to show that the said error bound could fail to hold without the regularity condition. Consequently, we obtain a rather complete answer to a question raised by Tseng. We believe that our approach will find further applications in the study of error bounds for structured convex optimization problems.
