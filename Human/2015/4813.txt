Reduced Complexity Calculation of LMMSE Filter Coefficients for GFDM

A low-complexity algorithm for calculation of the LMMSE filter coefficients for GFDM in a block-fading multipath environment is derived in this letter. The simplification is based on the block circularity of the involved matrices. The proposal reduces complexity from cubic to squared order. The proposed approach can be generalized to other waveforms with circular pulse shaping.
