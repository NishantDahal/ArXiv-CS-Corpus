3D Reconstruction from Full-view Fisheye Camera

In this report, we proposed a 3D reconstruction method for the full-view fisheye camera. The camera we used is Ricoh Theta, which captures spherical images and has a wide field of view (FOV). The conventional stereo apporach based on perspective camera model cannot be directly applied and instead we used a spherical camera model to depict the relation between 3D point and its corresponding observation in the image. We implemented a system that can reconstruct the 3D scene using captures from two or more cameras. A GUI is also created to allow users to control the view perspective and obtain a better intuition of how the scene is rebuilt. Experiments showed that our reconstruction results well preserved the structure of the scene in the real world.
