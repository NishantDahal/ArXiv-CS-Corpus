Local digital algorithms applied to Boolean models

We investigate the estimation of specific intrinsic volumes of stationary Boolean models by local digital algorithms; that is, by weighted sums of $n \times\ldots \times n$ configuration counts. We show that asymptotically unbiased estimators for the specific surface area or integrated mean curvature do not exist if the dimension is at least two or three, respectively. For 3-dimensional stationary, isotropic Boolean models, we derive asymptotically unbiased estimators for the specific surface area and integrated mean curvature. For a Boolean model with balls as grains we even obtain an asymptotically unbiased estimator for the specific Euler characteristic.
