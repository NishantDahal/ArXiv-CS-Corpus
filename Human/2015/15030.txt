A Process Algebra for Wireless Mesh Networks

We propose a process algebra for wireless mesh networks that combines novel treatments of local broadcast, conditional unicast and data structures. In this framework, we model the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol and (dis)prove crucial properties such as loop freedom and packet delivery.
