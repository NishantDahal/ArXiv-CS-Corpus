Stochastic Parity Games on Lossy Channel Systems

We give an algorithm for solving stochastic parity games with almost-sure winning conditions on {\it lossy channel systems}, under the constraint that both players are restricted to finite-memory strategies. First, we describe a general framework, where we consider the class of 2 1/2-player games with almost-sure parity winning conditions on possibly infinite game graphs, assuming that the game contains a {\it finite attractor}. An attractor is a set of states (not necessarily absorbing) that is almost surely re-visited regardless of the players' decisions. We present a scheme that characterizes the set of winning states for each player. Then, we instantiate this scheme to obtain an algorithm for {\it stochastic game lossy channel systems}.
