Microwave Surveillance based on Ghost Imaging and Distributed Antennas

In this letter, we proposed a ghost imaging (GI) and distributed antennas based microwave surveillance scheme. By analyzing its imaging resolution and sampling requirement, the potential of employing microwave GI to achieve high-quality surveillance performance with low system complexity has been demonstrated. The theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed microwave surveillance method are also validated via simulations.
