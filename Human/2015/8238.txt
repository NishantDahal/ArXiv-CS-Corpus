Implications of MBTI in Software Engineering Education

A number of approaches exist to aid the understanding of individual differences and their effects on teaching and learning. Educators have been using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to understand differences in learning styles and to develop teaching methods that cater for the various personality styles. Inspired by the MBTI, we developed a range of practices for effective teaching and learning in a software engineering course. Our aim is to reach every student, but in different ways, by devising various teaching approaches.
