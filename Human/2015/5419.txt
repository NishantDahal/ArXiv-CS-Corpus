The Complete Weight Enumerator of A Class of Linear Codes

Linear codes can be employed to construct authentication codes, which is an interesting area of cryptography. The parameters of the authentication codes depend on the complete weight enumerator of the underlying linear codes. In order to obtain an authentication code with good parameters, the underlying linear code must have proper parameters. The first objective of this paper is to determine the complete weight enumerators of a class of linear codes with two weights and three weights. The second is to employ these linear codes to construct authentication codes with new parameters.
