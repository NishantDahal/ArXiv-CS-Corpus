SAP: an Architecture for Selectively Approximate Wireless Communication

Integrity checking is ubiquitous in data networks, but not all network traffic needs integrity protection. Many applications can tolerate slightly damaged data while still working acceptably, trading accuracy versus efficiency to save time and energy. Such applications should be able to receive damaged data if they so desire. In today's network stacks, lower-layer integrity checks discard damaged data regardless of the application's wishes, violating the End-to-End Principle. This paper argues for optional integrity checking and gently redesigns a commodity network architecture to support integrity-unprotected data. Our scheme, called Selective Approximate Protocol (SAP), allows applications to coordinate multiple network layers to accept potentially damaged data. Unlike previous schemes that targeted video or media streaming, SAP is generic. SAP's improved throughput and decreased retransmission rate is a good match for applications in the domain of approximate computing.
  Implemented atop WiFi as a case study, SAP works with existing physical layers and requires no hardware changes. SAP's benefits increase as channel conditions degrade. In tests of an error-tolerant file-transfer application over WiFi, SAP sped up transmission by about 30% on average.
