A Polynomial-Time Attack on the BBCRS Scheme

The BBCRS scheme is a variant of the McEliece public-key encryption scheme where the hiding phase is performed by taking the inverse of a matrix which is of the form $\mathbf{T} +\mathbf{R}$ where $\mathbf{T}$ is a sparse matrix with average row/column weight equal to a very small quantity $m$, usually $m < 2$, and $\mathbf{R}$ is a matrix of small rank $z\geqslant 1$. The rationale of this new transformation is the reintroduction of families of codes, like generalized Reed-Solomon codes, that are famously known for representing insecure choices. We present a key-recovery attack when $z = 1$ and $m$ is chosen between $1$ and $1 + R + O( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} )$ where $R$ denotes the code rate. This attack has complexity $O(n^6)$ and breaks all the parameters suggested in the literature.
