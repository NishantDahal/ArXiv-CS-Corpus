Anima: Adaptive Personalized Software Keyboard

We present a Software Keyboard for smart touchscreen devices that learns its owner's unique dictionary in order to produce personalized typing predictions. The learning process is accelerated by analysing user's past typed communication. Moreover, personal temporal user behaviour is captured and exploited in the prediction engine. Computational and storage issues are addressed by dynamically forgetting words that the user no longer types. A prototype implementation is available at Google Play Store.
