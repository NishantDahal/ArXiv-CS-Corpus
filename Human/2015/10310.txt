TDD for Embedded Systems: A Basic Approach and Toolset

The evolution of information technology and electronics in general has been consistently increasing the use of embedded systems. While hardware development for these systems is already consistent, software development for embedded systems still lacks a consolidated methodology. This paper describes a process and toolset for Embedded Systems Validation and Verification using FSM (Finite State Machines) and TDD (Test Driven Development).
