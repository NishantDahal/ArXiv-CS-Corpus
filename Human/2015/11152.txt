Optimal Policies for Wireless Networks with Energy Harvesting Transmitters and Receivers: Effects of Decoding Costs

We consider the effects of decoding costs in energy harvesting communication systems. In our setting, receivers, in addition to transmitters, rely solely on energy harvested from nature, and need to spend some energy in order to decode their intended packets. We model the decoding energy as an increasing convex function of the rate of the incoming data. In this setting, in addition to the traditional energy causality constraints at the transmitters, we have the decoding causality constraints at the receivers, where energy spent by the receiver for decoding cannot exceed its harvested energy. We first consider the point-to-point single-user problem where the goal is to maximize the total throughput by a given deadline subject to both energy and decoding causality constraints. We show that decoding costs at the receiver can be represented as generalized data arrivals at the transmitter, and thereby moving all system constraints to the transmitter side. Then, we consider several multi-user settings. We start with a two-hop network where the relay and the destination have decoding costs, and show that separable policies, where the transmitter's throughput is maximized irrespective of the relay's transmission energy profile, are optimal. Next, we consider the multiple access channel (MAC) and the broadcast channel (BC) where the transmitters and the receivers harvest energy from nature, and characterize the maximum departure region. In all multi-user settings considered, we decompose our problems into inner and outer problems. We solve the inner problems by exploiting the structure of the particular model, and solve the outer problems by water-filling algorithms.
