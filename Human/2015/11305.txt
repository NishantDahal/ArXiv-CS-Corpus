Learning Sparse Feature Representations using Probabilistic Quadtrees and Deep Belief Nets

Learning sparse feature representations is a useful instrument for solving an unsupervised learning problem. In this paper, we present three labeled handwritten digit datasets, collectively called n-MNIST. Then, we propose a novel framework for the classification of handwritten digits that learns sparse representations using probabilistic quadtrees and Deep Belief Nets. On the MNIST and n-MNIST datasets, our framework shows promising results and significantly outperforms traditional Deep Belief Networks.
