Evolvable Autonomic Management

Autonomic management is aimed at adapting to uncertainty. Hence, it is devised as m-connected k-dominating set problem, resembled by dominator and dominate, such that dominators are resilient up to m-1 uncertainty among them and dominate are resilient up to k-1 uncertainty on their way to dominators. Therefore, an evolutionary algorithm GENESIS is proposed, which resolves uncertainty by evolving population of solutions, while considering uncertain constraints as sub-problems, started by initial populations by a greedy algorithm AVIDO. Theoretical analysis first justifies original problem as NP-hard problem. Eventually, the absence of polynomial time approximation scheme necessitates justification of original problem as multiobjective optimization problem. Furthermore, approximation to Pareto front is verified to be decomposed into scalar optimization sub-problems, which lays out the theoretical foundation for decomposition based evolutionary solution. Finally, case-study, feasibility analysis and exemplary implication are presented for evolvable autonomic management in combined cancer treatment with in-vivo sensor networks.
