Analysis of Joint Transmit-Receive Diversity in Downlink MIMO Heterogeneous Cellular Networks

We study multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) based downlink heterogeneous cellular network (HetNets) with joint transmit-receive diversity using orthogonal space-time block codes at the base stations (BSs) and maximal-ratio combining (MRC) at the users. MIMO diversity with MRC is especially appealing in cellular networks due to the relatively low hardware complexity at both the BS and user device. Using stochastic geometry, we develop a tractable stochastic model for analyzing such HetNets taking into account the irregular and multi-tier BS deployment. We derive the coverage probability for both interference-blind (IB) and interference-aware (IA) MRC as a function of the relevant tier-specific system parameters such as BS density and power, path loss law, and number of transmit (Tx) antennas. Important insights arising from our analysis for typical HetNets are for instance: (i) IA-MRC becomes less favorable than IB-MRC with Tx diversity due to the smaller interference variance and increased interference correlation across Rx antennas; (ii) ignoring spatial interference correlation significantly overestimates the performance of IA-MRC; (iii) for small number of Rx antennas, selection combining may offer a better complexity-performance trade-off than MRC.
