An Encrypted Trust-Based Routing Protocol

The interest in trust-based routing protocols has grown with the advancements achieved in ad-hoc wireless networks.However, regardless of the many security approaches and trust metrics available, trust-based routing still faces some security challenges, especially with respect to privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel trust-based routing protocol based on a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. The new protocol allows nodes, which collaborate in a dynamic environment, to evaluate their knowledge on the trustworthiness of specific routes and securely share this knowledge.
