Fully Quantum Source Compression with a Quantum Helper

We study source compression with a helper in the fully quantum regime, extending our earlier result on classical source compression with a quantum helper [arXiv:1501.04366, 2015]. We characterise the quantum resources involved in this problem, and derive a single-letter expression of the achievable rate region when entanglement assistance is available. The direct coding proof is based on a combination of two fundamental protocols, namely the quantum state merging protocol and the quantum reverse Shannon theorem (QRST). This result demonstrates an unexpected connection between distributed source compression with the QRST protocol, a quantum protocol that consumes noiseless resources to simulate a noisy quantum channel.
