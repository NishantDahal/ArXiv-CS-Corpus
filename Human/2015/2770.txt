Analysis and Throughput Optimization of Selective Chase Combining for OFDM Systems

In this paper, we present throughput analysis and optimization of bandwidth efficient selective retransmission method at modulation layer for conventional Chase Combining (CC) method under orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling. Most of the times, there are fewer errors in a failed packet and receiver can recover from errors receiving partial copy of original frame. The proposed selective retransmission method at modulation layer for OFDM modulation requests retransmission of information corresponding to the poor quality subcarriers. In this work, we propose cross-layer multiple selective Chase combining (MSCC) method and Chase combining with selective retransmission (CCWS) at modulation level. We also present bit-error rate (BER) and throughput analysis of the proposed MSCC and CCWS methods. In order to maximize throughput of the proposed methods under OFDM signaling, we formulate optimization problem with respect to amount of information to be retransmitted in selective retransmission in the event of packet failure. We present tight BER upper bounds and tight throughput lower bounds for the proposed selective Chase combining methods. The simulation results demonstrate significant throughput gain of the optimized selective retransmission methods over conventional retransmission methods. The throughput gain of the proposed selective retransmission atmodulation layer are also holds for conventional for hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) methods.
