Emphatic TD Bellman Operator is a Contraction

Recently, \citet{SuttonMW15} introduced the emphatic temporal differences (ETD) algorithm for off-policy evaluation in Markov decision processes. In this short note, we show that the projected fixed-point equation that underlies ETD involves a contraction operator, with a $\sqrtγ$-contraction modulus (where $γ$ is the discount factor). This allows us to provide error bounds on the approximation error of ETD. To our knowledge, these are the first error bounds for an off-policy evaluation algorithm under general target and behavior policies.
