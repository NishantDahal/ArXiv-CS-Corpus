New Algorithms for Computing a Single Component of the Discrete Fourier Transform

This paper introduces the theory and hardware implementation of two new algorithms for computing a single component of the discrete Fourier transform. In terms of multiplicative complexity, both algorithms are more efficient, in general, than the well known Goertzel Algorithm.
