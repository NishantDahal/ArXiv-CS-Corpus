Efficient Algorithms for Personalized PageRank

We present new, more efficient algorithms for estimating random walk scores such as Personalized PageRank from a given source node to one or several target nodes. These scores are useful for personalized search and recommendations on networks including social networks, user-item networks, and the web. Past work has proposed using Monte Carlo or using linear algebra to estimate scores from a single source to every target, making them inefficient for a single pair. Our contribution is a new bidirectional algorithm which combines linear algebra and Monte Carlo to achieve significant speed improvements. On a diverse set of six graphs, our algorithm is 70x faster than past state-of-the-art algorithms. We also present theoretical analysis: while past algorithms require $Î©(n)$ time to estimate a random walk score of typical size $\frac{1}{n}$ on an $n$-node graph to a given constant accuracy, our algorithm requires only $O(\sqrt{m})$ expected time for an average target, where $m$ is the number of edges, and is provably accurate.
  In addition to our core bidirectional estimator for personalized PageRank, we present an alternative algorithm for undirected graphs, a generalization to arbitrary walk lengths and Markov Chains, an algorithm for personalized search ranking, and an algorithm for sampling random paths from a given source to a given set of targets. We expect our bidirectional methods can be extended in other ways and will be useful subroutines in other graph analysis problems.
