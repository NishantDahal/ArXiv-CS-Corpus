Wise Computing: Towards Endowing System Development with True Wisdom

Encouraged by significant advances in algorithms and tools for verification and analysis, high level modeling and programming techniques, natural language programming, etc., we feel it is time for a major change in the way complex software and systems are developed. We present a vision that will shift the power balance between human engineers and the development and runtime environments. The idea is to endow the computer with human-like wisdom - not general wisdom, and not AI in the standard sense of the term - but wisdom geared towards classical system-building, which will be manifested, throughout development, in creativity and proactivity, and deep insights into the system's own structure and behavior, its overarching goals and rationale. Ideally, the computer will join the development team as an equal partner - knowledgeable, concerned, and responsibly active. We present a running demo of our initial efforts on the topic, illustrating on a small example what we feel is the feasibility of the ideas.
