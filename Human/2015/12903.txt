Alternative forms of representation of Boolean functions in Cryptographic Information Security Facilities

The work offers a new approach to the formation of functions which are used in cryptography and cryptanalysis. It will use alternative forms of representation of Boolean functions, that is, those which are different from the classical form, which is formed in a Boolean basis AND-OR-NOT. An example of this is, in particular, the formation of cryptographic functions with the use of alternative forms of representation, namely Cognate-representation of Boolean functions. This form is, by definition, multivariant and allows you to choose the best variant from a plurality of possible and permissible forms. Moreover, criteria of admissibility can be also selected depending on the particular situation, since it is known that an improvement of one criterion usually leads to deterioration of others. The methods suggested in the project, exemplified by Cognate-form representations of Boolean functions, show that the use of alternative forms of representation of Boolean functions in forming of cryptographic functions, algorithms and devices can significantly improve their parameters and properties. And their use in cryptographic means of protection allow to optimize the process of logical design of cryptographic devices and improve the safety performance of information and communication systems.
