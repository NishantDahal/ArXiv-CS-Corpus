Resource Allocation Techniques for Wireless Powered Communication Networks with Energy Storage Constraint

This paper studies multi-user wireless powered communication networks, where energy constrained users charge their energy storages by scavenging energy of the radio frequency signals radiated from a hybrid access point (H-AP). The energy is then utilized for the users' uplink information transmission to the H-AP in time division multiple access mode. In this system, we aim to maximize the uplink sum rate performance by jointly optimizing energy and time resource allocation for multiple users in both infinite capacity and finite capacity energy storage cases. First, when the users are equipped with the infinite capacity energy storages, we derive the optimal downlink energy transmission policy at the H-AP. Based on this result, analytical resource allocation solutions are obtained. Next, we propose the optimal energy and time allocation algorithm for the case where each user has finite capacity energy storage. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithms offer 30% average sum rate performance gain over conventional schemes.
