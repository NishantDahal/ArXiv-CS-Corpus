Edge modification criteria for enhancing the communicability of digraphs

We introduce new broadcast and receive communicability indices that can be used as global measures of how effectively information is spread in a directed network. Furthermore, we describe fast and effective criteria for the selection of edges to be added to (or deleted from) a given directed network so as to enhance these network communicability measures. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
