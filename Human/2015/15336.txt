Discrete-Time Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM (POPS-OFDM) Operating on Time and Frequency Dispersive Channels for 5G Systems

The Fourth Generation (4G) of mobile communication systems was optimized to offer high data rates with high terminal mobility by ensuring strict synchronism and perfect orthogonality. However, the trend for novel applications, that had not been feasible a few years back, reveals major limits of this strict synchronism and imposes new challenges and severe requirements. But, coarse synchronization can dramatically damage the waveforms orthogonality in the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals, which results in oppressive Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI). As a consequence, the use of non-orthogonal waveforms becomes further essential in order to meet the upcoming requirements. In this context, we propose here a novel waveform construction, referred to Ping-pong Optimized Pulse Shaping-OFDM (POPS-OFDM), which is believed to be an attractive candidate for the optimization of the radio interface of next 5G mobile communication systems. Through a maximization of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), this approach allows optimal and straightforward waveform design for multicarrier systems at the Transmitter (Tx) and Receiver (Rx) sides. In this paper, we analyze several characteristics of the proposed waveforms and shed light on relevant features, which make it a powerful candidate for the design of 5G system radio interface waveforms.
