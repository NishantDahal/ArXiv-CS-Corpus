Ciberseguridad Inteligente

The Internet Economy has a strong dependency on cyberspace. This raises security risk scenarios due to the increasing number of vulnerabilities and the increased frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks, especially with the advent of advanced threats of APT type. This paper presents a model of Intelligent Cybersecurity (ICS) for detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive and destroy enemy capabilities in cyberspace. This is achieved through the conceptual and technical development of a Capacity for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) which aims to interfere destructively C2 capabilities of the adversary, penetrating its decision loops with the speed necessary to displace him to a reactive posture. Finally, unlike the security models raised classically, the concept of ICSI suggests that the advantage in the conflict can be obtained by defense and not always by the attacker. As theoretical support, the "Offensive System Reference Model" (OSRM) is presented, which is used to think cyber conflict at all levels, from a perspective coordinated and synchronized with the rest of the traditional forces under the present set; and a justification of the capacity from the modern perspective C2.
