Model-based Optimization of Compressive Antennas for High-Sensing-Capacity Applications

This paper presents a novel, model-based compressive antenna design method for high sensing capacity imaging applications. Given a set of design constraints, the method maximizes the sensing capacity of the compressive antenna by varying the constitutive properties of scatterers distributed along the antenna. Preliminary 2D design results demonstrate the new method's ability to produce antenna configurations with enhanced imaging capabilities.
