Algorithm that Solves 3-SAT in Polynomial Time

The question of whether the complexity class P is equal to the complexity class NP has been a seemingly intractable problem for over 4 decades. It has been clear that if an algorithm existed that would solve the problems in the NP class in polynomial time then P would equal NP. However, no one has yet been able to create that algorithm or to successfully prove that such an algorithm cannot exist. The algorithm that will be presented in this paper solves the 3-satisfiability or 3-CNF-SAT problem, which has been proven to be NP-complete.
