Set theory and tableaux for teaching propositional logic

In this work we suggest the use of a set-theoretical interpretation of semantic tableaux for teaching propositional logic. If the student has previous notions of basic set theory, this approach to semantical tableaux can clarify her the way semantic trees operate, linking the syntactical and semantical sides of the process. Also, it may be useful for the introduction of more advanced topics in logic, like modal logic.
