Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory, Diffusion Maps and their applications to Clustering and Biclustering

In this paper, we describe an algorithm FARDiff (Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Dif- fusion) which combines Diffusion Maps and Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory to do clustering on high dimensional data. We describe some applications of this method and some problems for future research.
