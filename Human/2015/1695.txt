On the greatest solution of equations in $\text{CLL}_R$

It is shown that, for any equation $X=_{RS} t_X$ in the LLTS-oriented process calculus $\text{CLL}_R$, if $X$ is strongly guarded in $t_X$, then the recursive term $\langle X|X=t_X \rangle$ is the greatest solution of this equation w.r.t LÃ¼ttgen and Vogler's ready simulation.
