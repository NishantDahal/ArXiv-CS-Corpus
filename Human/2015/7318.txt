Students Exeat Monitoring System Using Fingerprint Biometric Authentication and Mobile Short Message Service

Exeat is a generic term commonly used to describe a period of absence from a centre of learning either for entire day, or parts of a day for appointments, interviews, open days and other fixtures in privately owned academic environment. The current method of monitoring students movement is inefficient and brings difficulty to the University Halls management checking students exit or entry into the halls of residence as well as impersonation. By using nexus combination of Ubiquitous Mobile Computing Technology through Mobile Short Message Service and biometric fingerprint approach exeat management and monitoring is quick and easy. Result after testing of the designed and simulated system shows that exeat monitoring systems is less prone to forgery as stakeholders are carried along, capable of preventing impersonation among students, and provide absolute electronic compliance to the policy of issuing exeat to students in the University Halls of Residence.
