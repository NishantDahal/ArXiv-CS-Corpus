Implementing generating functions to obtain power indices with coalition configuration

We consider the Banzhaf-Coleman and Owen power indices for weighted majority games modified by a coalition configuration. We present calculation algorithms of them that make use of the method of generating functions. We programmed the procedure in the open language R and it is illustrated by a real life example taken from social sciences.
