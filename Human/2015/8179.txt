Proceedings Tenth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta Languages: Theory and Practice

This volume constitutes the proceedings of LFMTP 2015, the Tenth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice, held on August 1st, 2015 in Berlin, Germany.  The workshop was a one-day satellite event of CADE-25, the 25th International Conference on Automated Deduction. Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design and implementation and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal computational systems have been the focus of considerable research over the last two decades. This workshop brought together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various aspects impinging on the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques and the expressiveness and lucidity of the reasoning process.
