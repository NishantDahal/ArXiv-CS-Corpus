OR-Benchmark: An Open and Reconfigurable Digital Watermarking Benchmarking Framework

Benchmarking digital watermarking algorithms is not an easy task because different applications of digital watermarking often have very different sets of requirements and trade-offs between conflicting requirements. While there have been some general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking systems available, they normally do not support complicated benchmarking tasks and cannot be easily reconfigured to work with different watermarking algorithms and testing conditions. In this paper, we propose OR-Benchmark, an open and highly reconfigurable general-purpose digital watermarking benchmarking framework, which has the following two key features: 1) all the interfaces are public and general enough to support all watermarking applications and benchmarking tasks we can think of; 2) end users can easily extend the functionalities and freely configure what watermarking algorithms are tested, what system components are used, how the benchmarking process runs, and what results should be produced. We implemented a prototype of this framework as a MATLAB software package and used it to benchmark a number of digital watermarking algorithms involving two types of watermarks for content authentication and self-restoration purposes. The benchmarking results demonstrated the advantages of the proposed benchmarking framework, and also gave us some useful insights about existing image authentication and self-restoration watermarking algorithms which are an important but less studied topic in digital watermarking.
