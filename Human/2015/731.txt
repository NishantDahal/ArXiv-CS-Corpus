Alamouti OFDM/OQAM systems with time reversal technique

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (OFDM/OQAM) is a multicarrier modulation scheme that can be considered as an alternative to the conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) with Cyclic Prefix (CP) for transmission over multipath fading channels. In this paper, we investigate the combination of the OFDM/OQAM with Alamouti system with Time Reversal (TR) technique. TR can be viewed as a precoding scheme which can be combined with OFDM/OQAM and easily carried out in a Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) context such as Alamouti system. We present the simulation results of the performance of OFDM/OQAM system in SISO case compared with the conventional CP-OFDM system and the performance of the combination Alamouti OFDM/OQAM with TR compared to Alamouti CP-OFDM. The performance is derived by computing the Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of the transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
