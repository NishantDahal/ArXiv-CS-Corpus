Recognition of collapsible complexes is NP-complete

We prove that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given (3-dimensional) simplicial complex is collapsible. This work extends a result of Malgouyres and Franc√©s showing that it is NP-complete to decide whether a given simplicial complex collapses to a 1-complex.
