Synchronizing delay for binary uniform morphisms

Circular D0L-systems are those with finite synchronizing delay. We introduce a tool called graph of overhangs which can be used to find the minimal value of synchronizing delay of a given D0L-system. By studying the graphs of overhangs, a general upper bound on the minimal value of a synchronizing delay of a circular D0L-system with a binary uniform morphism is given.
