iDART-Intruder Detection and Alert in Real Time

In this work, we design and develop a smart intruder detection and alert system which aims to elevate the security as well as the likelihood of true positive identification of trespassers and intruders as compared to other commonly deployed electronic security systems. Using multiple sensors, this system can gauge the extent of danger exhibited by a person or animal in or around the home premises, and can forward various critical information regarding the event to home owners as well as other specified entities, such as relevant security authorities.
