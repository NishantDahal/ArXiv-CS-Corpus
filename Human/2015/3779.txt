Pebble Games and Linear Equations

We give a new, simplified and detailed account of the correspondence between levels of the Sherali-Adams relaxation of graph isomorphism and levels of pebble-game equivalence with counting (higher-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman colour refinement). The correspondence between basic colour refinement and fractional isomorphism, due to Tinhofer (1986, 1991) and Ramana, Scheinerman and Ullman (1994), is re-interpreted as the base level of Sherali-Adams and generalised to higher levels in this sense by Atserias and Maneva (2012) and Malkin (2014), who prove that the two resulting hierarchies interleave.
  In carrying this analysis further, we here give
  (a) a precise characterisation of the level-k Sherali-Adams relaxation in terms of a modified counting pebble game;
  (b) a variant of the Sherali-Adams levels that precisely match the k-pebble counting game;
  (c) a proof that the interleaving between these two hierarchies is strict.
  We also investigate the variation based on boolean arithmetic instead of real/rational arithmetic and obtain analogous correspondences and separations for plain k-pebble equivalence (without counting). Our results are driven by considerably simplified accounts of the underlying combinatorics and linear algebra.
