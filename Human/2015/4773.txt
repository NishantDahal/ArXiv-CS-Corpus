Fully explicit large deviation inequalities for empirical processes with applications to information-based complexity

In the present paper we obtain fully explicit large deviation inequalities for empirical processes indexed by a Vapnik--Chervonenkis class of sets (or functions). Furthermore we illustrate the importance of such results for the theory of information-based complexity.
