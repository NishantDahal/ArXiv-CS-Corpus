The implementation and optimization of Bitonic sort algorithm based on CUDA

This paper describes in detail the bitonic sort algorithm,and implements the bitonic sort algorithm based on cuda architecture.At the same time,we conduct two effective optimization of implementation details according to the characteristics of the GPU,which greatly improve the efficiency. Finally,we survey the optimized Bitonic sort algorithm on the GPU with the speedup of quick sort algorithm on the CPU.Since Quick Sort is not suitable to be implemented in parallel,but it is more efficient than other sorting algorithms on CPU to some extend.Hence,to see the speedup and performance,we compare bitonic sort on GPU with quick Sort on CPU. For a series of 32-bit random integer,the experimental results show that the acceleration of our work is nearly 20 times.When array size is about 216,the speedup ratio is even up to 30.
