Proceedings Seventh Workshop on Intersection Types and Related Systems

This volume contains a final and revised selection of papers presented at the Seventh Workshop on Intersection Types and Related Systems (ITRS 2014), held in Vienna (Austria) on July 18th, affiliated with TLCA 2014, Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (held jointly with RTA, Rewriting Techniques and Applications) as part of FLoC and the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) 2014. Intersection types have been introduced in the late 1970s as a language for describing properties of lambda calculus which were not captured by all previous type systems. They provided the first characterisation of strongly normalising lambda terms and have become a powerful syntactic and semantic tool for analysing various normalisation properties as well as lambda models. Over the years the scope of research on intersection types has broadened. Recently, there have been a number of breakthroughs in the use of intersection types and similar technology for practical purposes such as program analysis, verification and concurrency, and program synthesis. The aim of the ITRS workshop series is to bring together researchers working on both the theory and practical applications of systems based on intersection types and related approaches (e.g., union types, refinement types, behavioral types).
