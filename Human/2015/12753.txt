Inband device-to-device relays in cellular networks

A new design for two-hop opportunistic relaying in cellular networks is proposed, with the objective of throughput improvement. We propose using idle UEs in a cellular system with better channel to the base station to relay traffic for active UEs. One of the key ideas proposed is the use of (only) uplink spectrum for the Access links, and corresponding interference management schemes for managing interference between Access and Backhaul links. The proposed algorithms and architecture show a median throughput gain of 110% for downlink and 40% for uplink in system simulations performed according to the 3GPP methodology.
