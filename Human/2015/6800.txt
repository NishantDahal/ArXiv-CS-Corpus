Speech Controlled Quadruped

The project which we have performed is based on voice recognition and we desire to create a four legged robot that can acknowledge the given instructions which are given through vocal commands and perform the tasks. The main processing unit of the robot will be Arduino Uno. We are using 8 servos for the movement of its legs while two servos will be required for each leg. The interface between a human and the robot is generated through Python programming and Eclipse software and it is implemented by using Bluetooth module HC 06.
