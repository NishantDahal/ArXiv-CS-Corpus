Algorithmic Aspects of Upper Domination

In this paper we study combinatorial and algorithmic resp. complexity questions of upper domination, i.e., the maximum cardinality of a minimal dominating set in a graph. We give a full classification of the related maximisation and minimisation problems, as well as the related parameterised problems, on general graphs and on graphs of bounded degree, and we also study planar graphs.
