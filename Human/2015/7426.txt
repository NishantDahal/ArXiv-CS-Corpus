Describing Common Human Visual Actions in Images

Which common human actions and interactions are recognizable in monocular still images? Which involve objects and/or other people? How many is a person performing at a time? We address these questions by exploring the actions and interactions that are detectable in the images of the MS COCO dataset. We make two main contributions. First, a list of 140 common `visual actions', obtained by analyzing the largest on-line verb lexicon currently available for English (VerbNet) and human sentences used to describe images in MS COCO. Second, a complete set of annotations for those `visual actions', composed of subject-object and associated verb, which we call COCO-a (a for `actions'). COCO-a is larger than existing action datasets in terms of number of actions and instances of these actions, and is unique because it is data-driven, rather than experimenter-biased. Other unique features are that it is exhaustive, and that all subjects and objects are localized. A statistical analysis of the accuracy of our annotations and of each action, interaction and subject-object combination is provided.
