A New IEEE 802.15.4 Simulation Model for OMNeT++ / INET

This paper introduces a new IEEE 802.15.4 simulation model for OMNeT++ / INET. 802.15.4 is an important underlying standard for wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things scenarios. The presented implementation is designed to be compatible with OMNeT++ 4.x and INET 2.x and laid-out to be expandable for newer revisions of the 802.15.4 standard.
