Teaching Logic to Information Systems Students: Challenges and Opportunities

In contrast to Computer Science, where the fundamental role of Logic is widely recognized, it plays a practically non-existent role in Information Systems curricula. In this paper we argue that instead of Logic's exclusion from the IS curriculum, a significant adaptation of the contents, as well as teaching methodologies, is required for an alignment with the needs of IS practitioners. We present our vision for such adaptation and report on concrete steps towards its implementation in the design and teaching of a course for graduate IS students at the University of Haifa. We discuss the course plan and present some data on the students' feedback on the course.
