Elastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Graph Processing Platforms

Distributed graph platforms like Pregel have used vertex- centric programming models to process the growing corpus of graph datasets using commodity clusters. The irregular structure of graphs cause load imbalances across machines operating on graph partitions, and this is exacerbated for non-stationary graph algorithms such as traversals, where not all parts of the graph are active at the same time. As a result, such graph platforms, even as they scale, do not make efficient use of distributed resources. Clouds offer elastic virtual machines that can be leveraged to improve the resource utilization for such platforms and hence reduce the monetary cost for their execution. In this paper, we propose strategies for elastic placement of graph partitions on Cloud VMs for subgraphcentric programming model to reduce the cost of execution compared to a static placement, even as we minimize the increase in makespan. These strategies are innovative in modeling the graph algorithms behavior. We validate our strategies for several graphs, using runtime tra- ces for their distributed execution of a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms on our subgraph-centric GoFFish graph platform. Our strategies are able to reduce the cost of exe- cution by up to 42%, compared to a static placement, while achieving a makespan that is within 29% of the optimal
