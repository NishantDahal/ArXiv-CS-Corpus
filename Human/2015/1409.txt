Development of a VO Registry Subject Ontology using Automated Methods

We report on our initial work to automate the generation of a domain ontology using subject fields of resources held in the Virtual Observatory registry. Preliminary results are comparable to more generalized ontology learning software currently in use. We expect to be able to refine our solution to improve both the depth and breadth of the generated ontology.
