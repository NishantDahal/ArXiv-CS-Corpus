Environment Based Secure Transfer of Data in Wireless Sensor Networks

Most critical sensor readings (Top-k Monitoring) in environment monitoring system are important to many wireless sensor applications. In such applications, sensor nodes transmit the data continuously for a specific time period to the storage nodes. It is responsible for transferring the received results to the Authority on Top-k Query request from them. Dummy data's were added into the original text data to secure the data against adversary in case of hacking the sensor and storage nodes. If storage node gets hacked by adversary, false details will be sent to the authority. An effective technique named aggregate signature to validate the source of the message and also to protect the data against latest security attacks, cryptography technique combined with steganography has been introduced. Indexed based scheme for the database access has also been proposed, to validate the resources against availability before forwarding the data fetch request to storage nodes from Authority.
