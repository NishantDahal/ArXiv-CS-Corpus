On 4-Map Graphs and 1-Planar Graphs and their Recognition Problem

We establish a one-to-one correspondence between 1-planar graphs and general and hole-free 4-map graphs and show that 1-planar graphs can be recognized in polynomial time if they are crossing-augmented, fully triangulated, and maximal 1-planar, respectively, with a polynomial of degree 120, 3, and 5, respectively.
