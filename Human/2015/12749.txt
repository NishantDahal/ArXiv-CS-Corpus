Functional Frank-Wolfe Boosting for General Loss Functions

Boosting is a generic learning method for classification and regression. Yet, as the number of base hypotheses becomes larger, boosting can lead to a deterioration of test performance. Overfitting is an important and ubiquitous phenomenon, especially in regression settings. To avoid overfitting, we consider using $l_1$ regularization. We propose a novel Frank-Wolfe type boosting algorithm (FWBoost) applied to general loss functions. By using exponential loss, the FWBoost algorithm can be rewritten as a variant of AdaBoost for binary classification. FWBoost algorithms have exactly the same form as existing boosting methods, in terms of making calls to a base learning algorithm with different weights update. This direct connection between boosting and Frank-Wolfe yields a new algorithm that is as practical as existing boosting methods but with new guarantees and rates of convergence. Experimental results show that the test performance of FWBoost is not degraded with larger rounds in boosting, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis.
