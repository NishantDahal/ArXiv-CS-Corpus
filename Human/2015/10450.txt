Predicting Virtual Learning Environment adoption - A case study

Purpose - To qualify the significance of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory with regard to Virtual Learning Environments. To apply an existing Diffusion of Innovations instrument on a case organisation, the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB), in order to compare its results with previous findings. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were deployed to analyze adopter group memberships and predictor significance in Virtual Learning Environment adoption and use. Findings - The Diffusion of Innovations theory is not stable across organizations when it comes to predicting different user categories or the distribution of users. However, it was possible to achieve reliable results for virtual learning environments within a particular organization. Research limitations ND implications - The study questions scholarly attempts to establish models of this type across organizations. Practical implications - Professionals should be aware that cross-organizational generalizations from Diffusion Of Innovation findings within the domain of virtual learning environments may be very unreliable. Originality and value - The study challenges the massively cited Diffusion of Innovation literature. It provides data from Bhutan, which is underrepresented in empirical investigations.
