Pushing towards the Limit of Sampling Rate: Adaptive Chasing Sampling

Measurement samples are often taken in various monitoring applications. To reduce the sensing cost, it is desirable to achieve better sensing quality while using fewer samples. Compressive Sensing (CS) technique finds its role when the signal to be sampled meets certain sparsity requirements. In this paper we investigate the possibility and basic techniques that could further reduce the number of samples involved in conventional CS theory by exploiting learning-based non-uniform adaptive sampling.
  Based on a typical signal sensing application, we illustrate and evaluate the performance of two of our algorithms, Individual Chasing and Centroid Chasing, for signals of different distribution features. Our proposed learning-based adaptive sampling schemes complement existing efforts in CS fields and do not depend on any specific signal reconstruction technique. Compared to conventional sparse sampling methods, the simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms allow $46\%$ less number of samples for accurate signal reconstruction and achieve up to $57\%$ smaller signal reconstruction error under the same noise condition.
