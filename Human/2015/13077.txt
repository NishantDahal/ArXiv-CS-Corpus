Self-Interference Suppression for the Full-Duplex Wireless Communication with Large-Scale Antenna

In this letter, we proposed a shared-antenna full-duplex massive MIMO model for the multiuser MIMO system. This model exploits a single antenna array at the base station (BS) to transmit and receive the signals simultaneously. It has the merits of both the full-duplex system and the time-division duplex (TDD) massive MIMO system, i.e., the high spectral efficiency and the channel reciprocity. We focus on the zero-forcing (ZF) and the maximal-ratio transmission/maximal-ratio combining (MRT/MRC) linear processing methods, which are commonly used in the massive MIMO system. As the main finding, we prove that the self-interference (SI) in a shared-antenna full-duplex massive MU-MIMO system can be suppressed in the completely dependent uplink and downlink channels when the number of antennas becomes large enough.
