Effective Use of Human Computer Interaction in Digital Academic Supportive Devices

In this research, a literature in human-computer interaction is reviewed and the technology aspect of human computer interaction related with digital academic supportive devices is also analyzed. According to all these concerns, recommendations to design good human-computer digital academic supportive devices are analyzed and proposed. Due to improvements in both hardware and software, digital devices have unveiled continuous advances in efficiency and processing capacity. However, many of these systems are also becoming larger and increasingly more complex. Although such complexity usually poses no difficulties for many users, it often creates barriers for academic users while using digital devices. Usually, in designing those digital devices, the human-computer interaction is left behind without consideration. To achieve dependable, usable, and well-engineered interactive digital academic supportive devices requires applied human computer interaction research and awareness of its issues.
