Quantum Gaussian Channels with Weak Measurements

In this paper we perform a novel analysis of quantum Gaussian channels in the context of weak measurements. Suppose Alice sends classical information to Bob using a quantum channel. Suppose Bob is allowed to use only weak measurements, what would be the channel capacity? We formulate weak measurement theory in these terms and discuss the above question.
