An Average Classification Algorithm

Many classification algorithms produce a classifier that is a weighted average of kernel evaluations. When working with a high or infinite dimensional kernel, it is imperative for speed of evaluation and storage issues that as few training samples as possible are used in the kernel expansion. Popular existing approaches focus on altering standard learning algorithms, such as the Support Vector Machine, to induce sparsity, as well as post-hoc procedures for sparse approximations. Here we adopt the latter approach. We begin with a very simple classifier, given by the kernel mean $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=i}^{n} y_i K(x_i,x) $$ We then find a sparse approximation to this kernel mean via herding. The result is an accurate, easily parallelized algorithm for learning classifiers.
