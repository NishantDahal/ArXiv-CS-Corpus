Excluding A Grid Minor In Planar Digraphs

In [Directed tree-width, J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 82 (2001), 138-154] we introduced the notion of tree-width of directed graphs and presented a conjecture, formulated during discussions with Noga Alon and Bruce Reed, stating that a digraph of huge tree-width has a large "cylindrical grid" minor. Here we prove the conjecture for planar digraphs, but many steps of the proof work in general.
  This is an unedited and unpolished manuscript from October 2001. Since many people asked for copies we are making it available in the hope that it may be useful. The conjecture was proved by Kawarabayashi and Kreutzer in arXiv:1411.5681.
