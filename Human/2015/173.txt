Random access congestion control in DVB-RCS2 interactive satellite terminals

The next generation of interactive satellite terminals is going to play a crucial role in the future of DVB standards. As a matter of fact in the current standard, satellite terminals are expected to be interactive thus offering apart from the possibility of logon signalling and control signalling also data transmission in the return channel with satisfying quality. Considering the nature of the traffic from terminals that is by nature bursty and with big periods of inactivity, the use of a Random Access technique could be preferred. In this paper Random Access congestion control in DVB-RCS2 is considered with particular regard to the recently introduced Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha technique, able to boost the performance compared to Slotted Aloha. The paper analyzes the stability of such a channel with particular emphasis on the design and on limit control procedures that can be applied in order to ensure stability of the channel even in presence of possible instability due to statistical fluctuations.
