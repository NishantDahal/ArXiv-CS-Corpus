Efficient Scheduling and Power Allocation for D2D-assisted Wireless Caching Networks

We study an one-hop device-to-device (D2D) assisted wireless caching network, where popular files are randomly and independently cached in the memory of end-users. Each user may obtain the requested files from its own memory without any transmission, or from a helper through an one-hop D2D transmission, or from the base station (BS). We formulate a joint D2D link scheduling and power allocation problem to maximize the system throughput. However, the problem is non-convex and obtaining an optimal solution is computationally hard. Alternatively, we decompose the problem into a D2D link scheduling problem and an optimal power allocation problem. To solve the two subproblems, we first develop a D2D link scheduling algorithm to select the largest number of D2D links satisfying both the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and the transmit power constraints. Then, we develop an optimal power allocation algorithm to maximize the minimum transmission rate of the scheduled D2D links. Numerical results indicate that both the number of the scheduled D2D links and the system throughput can be improved simultaneously with the Zipf-distribution caching scheme, the proposed D2D link scheduling algorithm, and the proposed optimal power allocation algorithm compared with the state of arts.
