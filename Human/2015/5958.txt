Evolving Boolean Networks with RNA Editing

The editing of transcribed RNA by other molecules such that the form of the final product differs from that specified in the corresponding DNA sequence is ubiquitous. This paper uses an abstract, tunable Boolean genetic regulatory network model to explore aspects of RNA editing. In particular, it is shown how dynamically altering expressed sequences via a guide RNA-inspired mechanism can be selected for by simulated evolution under various single and multicellular scenarios.
