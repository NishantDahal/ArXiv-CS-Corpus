Energy Efficient Symbol-Level Precoding in Multiuser MISO Channels

This paper investigates the idea of exploiting interference among the simultaneous multiuser transmissions in the downlink of multiple antennas systems. Using symbol level precoding, a new approach towards addressing the multiuser interference is discussed through jointly utilizing the channel state information (CSI) and data information (DI). In this direction, the interference among the data streams is transformed under certain conditions to useful signal that can improve the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) of the downlink transmissions. In this context, new constructive interference precoding techniques that tackle the transmit power minimization (min power) with individual SINR constraints at each user's receivers are proposed. Furthermore, we investigate the CI precoding design under the assumption that the received MPSK symbol can reside in a relaxed region in order to be correctly detected.
