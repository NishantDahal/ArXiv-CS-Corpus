Matrix-F5 algorithms and tropical Gröbner bases computation

Let $K$ be a field equipped with a valuation. Tropical varieties over $K$ can be defined with a theory of Gröbner bases taking into account the valuation of $K$. Because of the use of the valuation, this theory is promising for stable computations over polynomial rings over a $p$-adic fields.We design a strategy to compute such tropical Gröbner bases by adapting the Matrix-F5 algorithm. Two variants of the Matrix-F5 algorithm, depending on how the Macaulay matrices are built, are available to tropical computation with respective modifications. The former is more numerically stable while the latter is faster.Our study is performed both over any exact field with valuation and some inexact fields like $\mathbb{Q}\_p$ or $\mathbb{F}\_q \llbracket t \rrbracket.$ In the latter case, we track the loss in precision, and show that the numerical stability can compare very favorably to the case of classical Gröbner bases when the valuation is non-trivial. Numerical examples are provided.
