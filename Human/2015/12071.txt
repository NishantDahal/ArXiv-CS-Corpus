Finite-time Convergent Gossiping

Gossip algorithms are widely used in modern distributed systems, with applications ranging from sensor networks and peer-to-peer networks to mobile vehicle networks and social networks. A tremendous research effort has been devoted to analyzing and improving the asymptotic rate of convergence for gossip algorithms. In this work we study finite-time convergence of deterministic gossiping. We show that there exists a symmetric gossip algorithm that converges in finite time if and only if the number of network nodes is a power of two, while there always exists an asymmetric gossip algorithm with finite-time convergence, independent of the number of nodes. For $n=2^m$ nodes, we prove that a fastest convergence can be reached in $nm=n\log_2 n$ node updates via symmetric gossiping. On the other hand, under asymmetric gossip among $n=2^m+r$ nodes with $0\leq r<2^m$, it takes at least $mn+2r$ node updates for achieving finite-time convergence. It is also shown that the existence of finite-time convergent gossiping often imposes strong structural requirements on the underlying interaction graph. Finally, we apply our results to gossip algorithms in quantum networks, where the goal is to control the state of a quantum system via pairwise interactions. We show that finite-time convergence is never possible for such systems.
