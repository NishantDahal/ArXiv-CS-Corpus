decimalInfinite: All Decimals In Bits, No Loss, Same Order, Simple

This paper introduces a binary encoding that supports arbitrarily large, small and precise decimals. It completely preserves information and order. It does not rely on any arbitrary use-case-based choice of calibration and is readily implementable and usable, as is. Finally, it is also simple to explain and understand.
