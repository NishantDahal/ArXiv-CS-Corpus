BitSim: An Algebraic Similarity Measure for Description Logics Concepts

In this paper, we propose an algebraic similarity measure σBS (BS stands for BitSim) for assigning semantic similarity score to concept definitions in ALCH+ an expressive fragment of Description Logics (DL). We define an algebraic interpretation function, I_B, that maps a concept definition to a unique string (ω_B) called bit-code) over an alphabet Σ_B of 11 symbols belonging to L_B - the language over P B. IB has semantic correspondence with conventional model-theoretic interpretation of DL. We then define σ_BS on L_B. A detailed analysis of I_B and σ_BS has been given.
