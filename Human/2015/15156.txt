Asymptotic Behavior of Mean Partitions in Consensus Clustering

Although consistency is a minimum requirement of any estimator, little is known about consistency of the mean partition approach in consensus clustering. This contribution studies the asymptotic behavior of mean partitions. We show that under normal assumptions, the mean partition approach is consistent and asymptotic normal. To derive both results, we represent partitions as points of some geometric space, called orbit space. Then we draw on results from the theory of Fr√©chet means and stochastic programming. The asymptotic properties hold for continuous extensions of standard cluster criteria (indices). The results justify consensus clustering using finite but sufficiently large sample sizes. Furthermore, the orbit space framework provides a mathematical foundation for studying further statistical, geometrical, and analytical properties of sets of partitions.
