SDCA without Duality

Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent is a popular method for solving regularized loss minimization for the case of convex losses. In this paper we show how a variant of SDCA can be applied for non-convex losses. We prove linear convergence rate even if individual loss functions are non-convex as long as the expected loss is convex.
