Multicast Multigroup Beamforming for Per-antenna Power Constrained Large-scale Arrays

Large in the number of transmit elements, multi-antenna arrays with per-element limitations are in the focus of the present work. In this context, physical layer multigroup multicasting under per-antenna power constrains, is investigated herein. To address this complex optimization problem low-complexity alternatives to semi-definite relaxation are proposed. The goal is to optimize the per-antenna power constrained transmitter in a maximum fairness sense, which is formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Therefore, the recently developed tool of feasible point pursuit and successive convex approximation is extended to account for practical per-antenna power constraints. Interestingly, the novel iterative method exhibits not only superior performance in terms of approaching the relaxed upper bound but also a significant complexity reduction, as the dimensions of the optimization variables increase. Consequently, multicast multigroup beamforming for large-scale array transmitters with per-antenna dedicated amplifiers is rendered computationally efficient and accurate. A preliminary performance evaluation in large-scale systems for which the semi-definite relaxation constantly yields non rank-1 solutions is presented.
