Real-Time Bidding Benchmarking with iPinYou Dataset

Being an emerging paradigm for display advertising, Real-Time Bidding (RTB) drives the focus of the bidding strategy from context to users' interest by computing a bid for each impression in real time. The data mining work and particularly the bidding strategy development becomes crucial in this performance-driven business. However, researchers in computational advertising area have been suffering from lack of publicly available benchmark datasets, which are essential to compare different algorithms and systems. Fortunately, a leading Chinese advertising technology company iPinYou decided to release the dataset used in its global RTB algorithm competition in 2013. The dataset includes logs of ad auctions, bids, impressions, clicks, and final conversions. These logs reflect the market environment as well as form a complete path of users' responses from advertisers' perspective. This dataset directly supports the experiments of some important research problems such as bid optimisation and CTR estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset on RTB display advertising. Thus, they are valuable for reproducible research and understanding the whole RTB ecosystem. In this paper, we first provide the detailed statistical analysis of this dataset. Then we introduce the research problem of bid optimisation in RTB and the simple yet comprehensive evaluation protocol. Besides, a series of benchmark experiments are also conducted, including both click-through rate (CTR) estimation and bid optimisation.
