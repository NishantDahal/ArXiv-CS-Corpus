Clues on Software Engineers Learning Styles

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) has proved to be a useful instrument for understanding student learning preferences and has enable comparisons of the learning preferences for various personality types. Regarding learning styles, there is no one best combination of characteristics, since each preference has its own advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, it is a fallacy to think that professors can devise a single teaching technique that would always appeal to all students at the same time. The ideas presented in this paper have been taken into account in two 4th year courses, named Software Requirements and Software Design in which the students develop their capstone projects. The results of this investigation may help college instructors to understanding the preferred leaning style of software engineers.
