Designing Hardware/Software Systems for Embedded High-Performance Computing

In this work, we propose an architecture and methodology to design hardware/software systems for high-performance embedded computing on FPGA. The hardware side is based on a many-core architecture whose design is generated automatically given a set of architectural parameters. Both the architecture and the methodology were evaluated running dense matrix multiplication and sparse matrix-vector multiplication on a ZYNQ-7020 FPGA platform. The results show that using a system-level design of the system avoids complex hardware design and still provides good performance results.
