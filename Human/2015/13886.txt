Binary CPMs with Improved Spectral Efficiency

We design new continuous phase modulation (CPM) formats which are based on the combination of a proper precoder with binary input and a ternary CPM. The proposed precoder constrains the signal phase evolution in order to increase the minimum Euclidean distance, and to limit the bandwidth expansion due to the use of a ternary CPM. The resulting schemes are highly spectrally efficient and outperform classical binary and quaternary formats in terms of coded and uncoded performance.
