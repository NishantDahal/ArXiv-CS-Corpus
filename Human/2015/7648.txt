Providing Current and Future Cellular Services to High Speed Trains

The demand for a broadband wireless connection is nowadays no longer limited to stationary situations, but also required while traveling. Therefore, there exist combined efforts to provide wireless access also on High Speed Trains (HSTs), in order to add to the attractiveness of this means for transportation. Installing an additional relay on the train, to facilitate the communication, is an approach that has already been extensively discussed in literature. The possibility of a direct communication between the base station and the passenger has been neglected until now, despite it having numerous advantages. Therefore, a comparison between these two opposing approaches is presented in this paper, accompanied by a detailed discussion of the related aspects. The focus is set on the feasibility of the direct link approach, including simulation results. Further technical issues are also presented, especially regarding the interdependencies of the different aspects and providing a view of mobile- and train-operators on the topic.
