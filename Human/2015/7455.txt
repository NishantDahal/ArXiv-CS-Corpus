Taming Subgraph Isomorphism for RDF Query Processing

RDF data are used to model knowledge in various areas such as life sciences, Semantic Web, bioinformatics, and social graphs. The size of real RDF data reaches billions of triples. This calls for a framework for efficiently processing RDF data. The core function of processing RDF data is subgraph pattern matching. There have been two completely different directions for supporting efficient subgraph pattern matching. One direction is to develop specialized RDF query processing engines exploiting the properties of RDF data for the last decade, while the other direction is to develop efficient subgraph isomorphism algorithms for general, labeled graphs for over 30 years. Although both directions have a similar goal (i.e., finding subgraphs in data graphs for a given query graph), they have been independently researched without clear reason. We argue that a subgraph isomorphism algorithm can be easily modified to handle the graph homomorphism, which is the RDF pattern matching semantics, by just removing the injectivity constraint. In this paper, based on the state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithm, we propose an in-memory solution, TurboHOM++, which is tamed for the RDF processing, and we compare it with the representative RDF processing engines for several RDF benchmarks in a server machine where billions of triples can be loaded in memory. In order to speed up TurboHOM++, we also provide a simple yet effective transformation and a series of optimization techniques. Extensive experiments using several RDF benchmarks show that TurboHOM++ consistently and significantly outperforms the representative RDF engines. Specifically, TurboHOM++ outperforms its competitors by up to five orders of magnitude.
