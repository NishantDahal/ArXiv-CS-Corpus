Improving the Speed of Response of Learning Algorithms Using Multiple Models

This is the first of a series of papers that the authors propose to write on the subject of improving the speed of response of learning systems using multiple models. During the past two decades, the first author has worked on numerous methods for improving the stability, robustness, and performance of adaptive systems using multiple models and the other authors have collaborated with him on some of them. Independently, they have also worked on several learning methods, and have considerable experience with their advantages and limitations. In particular, they are well aware that it is common knowledge that machine learning is in general very slow. Numerous attempts have been made by researchers to improve the speed of convergence of algorithms in different contexts. In view of the success of multiple model based methods in improving the speed of convergence in adaptive systems, the authors believe that the same approach will also prove fruitful in the domain of learning. In this paper, a first attempt is made to use multiple models for improving the speed of response of the simplest learning schemes that have been studied. i.e. Learning Automata.
