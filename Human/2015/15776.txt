Uplink One-tone Filtered Multitone Modulation Transmission for Machine Type Communications

To accommodate current machine type communications (MTC), an uplink waveform is proposed where MTC nodes use one carrier to transmit signal, and central nodes demodulate different nodes' signal jointly. Furthermore, the carrier bandwidth is variable to fit for the channels of nodes. This waveform may reduce the hardware complexity of low cost MTC nodes, and loose the time and frequency domain synchronization requirements of the entire system. This paper also provides the interference analysis and complexity comparisons of proposed scheme and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).
