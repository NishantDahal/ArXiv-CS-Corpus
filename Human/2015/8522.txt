Accessible Banking: Experiences and Future Directions

This is a short position paper drawing on experience working with the UK banking industry and their disabled and ageing customers in the Business Disability Forum, a UK non-profit member organisation funded by a large body of UK private and public sector businesses. We describe some commonly reported problems of disabled customers who use modern banking technologies, relating them to UK law and best practice. We describe some of the recent banking industry innovations and the hope they may offer for improved inclusive and accessible multi-channel banking.
