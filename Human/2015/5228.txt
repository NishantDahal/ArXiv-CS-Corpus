Digital image watermarking using normal matrices

This paper presents techniques for digital image watermarking based on eigenvalue decomposition of normal matrices. The introduced methods are convenient and self-explanatory, achieve satisfactory results, as well as require less and easy computations compared to some current methods. Through the proposed methods, host images and watermarks are transformed to the space of normal matrices, and the properties of spectral decompositions are dealt with to obtain watermarked images. Watermark extraction is carried out via a procedure similar to embedding. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the reliability and robustness of the methods.
