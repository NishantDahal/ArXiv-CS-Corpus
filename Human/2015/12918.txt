A Least Squares Approach for Stable Phase Retrieval from Short-Time Fourier Transform Magnitude

We address the problem of recovering a signal (up to global phase) from its short-time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude measurements. This problem arises in several applications, including optical imaging and speech processing. In this paper we suggest three interrelated algorithms. The first algorithm estimates the signal efficiently from noisy measurements by solving a simple least-squares (LS) problem. In contrast to previously proposed algorithms, the LS approach has stability guarantees and does not require any prior knowledge on the sought signal. However, the recovery is guaranteed under relatively strong restrictions on the STFT window. The second approach is guaranteed to recover a non-vanishing signal efficiently from noise-free measurements, under very moderate conditions on the STFT window. Finally, the third method estimates the signal robustly from noisy measurements by solving a semi-definite program (SDP). The proposed SDP algorithm contains an inherent trade-off between its robustness and the restrictions on the STFT windows that can be used.
