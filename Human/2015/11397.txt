Audio Steganography: LSB Technique Using a Pyramid Structure and Range of Bytes

The demand for keeping the information secure and confidential simultaneously has been progressively increasing. Among various techniques- Audio Steganography, a technique of embedding information transparently in a digital media thereby restricting the access to such information has been prominently developed. Imperceptibility, robustness, and payload or hiding capacity are the main character for it. In earlier, LSB techniques increased payload capacity would hamper robustness as well as imperceptibility of the cover media and vice versa. The proposed technique overcomes the problem. It provides relatively good improvement in the payload capacity by dividing the bytes of cover media into ranges to hide the bits of secret message appropriately. As well as due to the use of ranges of bytes the robustness of cover media has maintained and imperceptibility preserved by using a pyramid structure.
