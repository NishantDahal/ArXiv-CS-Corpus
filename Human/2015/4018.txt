Recent Advances in Real Geometric Reasoning

In the 1930s Tarski showed that real quantifier elimination was possible, and in 1975 Collins gave a remotely practicable method, albeit with doubly-exponential complexity, which was later shown to be inherent. We discuss some of the recent major advances in Collins method: such as an alternative approach based on passing via the complexes, and advances which come closer to "solving the question asked" rather than "solving all problems to do with these polynomials".
