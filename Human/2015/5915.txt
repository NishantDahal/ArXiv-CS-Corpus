Processing heterogeneous data space measurement subpolar territories to formulate stochastic models assessment geohazards

The article describes the development of a knowledge base of forecasting the state of the individual parameters geoenvironment circumpolar territory using satellite data. The paper provides an analysis of the parameters characterizing the state of polar territory. Select a model and method for processing geodata. Developing an information system of formation of the knowledge base, taking into account development trends (predicting) the values of these parameters.
