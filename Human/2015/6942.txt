Typologies of the Popular Science Web Video

The creation of popular science web videos on the Internet has increased in recent years. The diversity of formats, genres, and producers makes it difficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not every producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an institutional sense, and professionalism and success on video platforms no longer depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs. Entertainment, content quality, and authenticity have become the keys to community building and success. The democratization of science video production allows a new variety of genres, styles, and forms. This article provides a first overview of the typologies and characteristics of popular science web videos. To avoid a misleading identification of science web videos with institutionally produced videos, we steer clear of the term science communication video, since many of the actual producers are not even familiar with the academic discussion on science communication, and since the subject matter does not depend on political or educational strategies. A content analysis of 200 videos from 100 online video channels was conducted. Several factors such as narrative strategies, video editing techniques, and design tendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of montage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to an increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of institutional or personal commitments: in general, it can be said that supposed amateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. This study represents an important step in understanding the essence of current popular science web videos and provides an evidence-based definition as a helpful cornerstone for further studies on science communication within this kind of new media.
