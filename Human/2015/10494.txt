Robust Visual Tracking via Convolutional Networks

Deep networks have been successfully applied to visual tracking by learning a generic representation offline from numerous training images. However the offline training is time-consuming and the learned generic representation may be less discriminative for tracking specific objects. In this paper we present that, even without offline training with a large amount of auxiliary data, simple two-layer convolutional networks can be powerful enough to develop a robust representation for visual tracking. In the first frame, we employ the k-means algorithm to extract a set of normalized patches from the target region as fixed filters, which integrate a series of adaptive contextual filters surrounding the target to define a set of feature maps in the subsequent frames. These maps measure similarities between each filter and the useful local intensity patterns across the target, thereby encoding its local structural information. Furthermore, all the maps form together a global representation, which is built on mid-level features, thereby remaining close to image-level information, and hence the inner geometric layout of the target is also well preserved. A simple soft shrinkage method with an adaptive threshold is employed to de-noise the global representation, resulting in a robust sparse representation. The representation is updated via a simple and effective online strategy, allowing it to robustly adapt to target appearance variations. Our convolution networks have surprisingly lightweight structure, yet perform favorably against several state-of-the-art methods on the CVPR2013 tracking benchmark dataset with 50 challenging videos.
