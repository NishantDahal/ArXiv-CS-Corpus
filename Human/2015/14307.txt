Note on Perfect Forests in Digraphs

A spanning subgraph $F$ of a graph $G$ is called {\em perfect} if $F$ is a forest, the degree $d_F(x)$ of each vertex $x$ in $F$ is odd, and each tree of $F$ is an induced subgraph of $G$. Alex Scott (Graphs \& Combin., 2001) proved that every connected graph $G$ contains a perfect forest if and only if $G$ has an even number of vertices. We consider four generalizations to directed graphs of the concept of a perfect forest. While the problem of existence of the most straightforward one is NP-hard, for the three others this problem is polynomial-time solvable. Moreover, every digraph with only one strong component contains a directed forest of each of these three generalization types. One of our results extends Scott's theorem to digraphs in a non-trivial way.
