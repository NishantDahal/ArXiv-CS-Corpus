Proceedings 12th International Workshop on Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures

The aim of the FESCA workshop is to bring together junior researchers from formal methods, software engineering, and industry interested in the development and application of formal modelling approaches as well as associated analysis and reasoning techniques with practical benefits for software engineering.
  In recent years, the growing importance of functional correctness and the increased relevance of system quality properties (e.g. performance, reliability, security) have stimulated the emergence of analytical and modelling techniques for the design and development of software systems. With the increasing complexity of today's software systems, FESCA aims at addressing two research questions: (1) what role the software architecture can play in systematic addressing of the analytical and modelling challenges, and (2) how formal and semi-formal techniques can be applied effectively to make the issues easier to address automatically, with lower human intervention.
