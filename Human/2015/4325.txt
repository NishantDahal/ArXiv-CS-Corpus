Design Issues of JPQ: a Pattern-based Query Language for Document Databases

Document databases are becoming popular, but how to present complex document query to obtain useful information from the document remains an important topic to study. In this paper, we describe the design issues of a pattern-based document database query language named JPQ. JPQ uses various expressive patterns to extract and construct document fragments following a JSON-like document data model. It adopts tree-like extraction patterns with a coherent pattern composition mechanism to extract data elements from hierarchically structured documents and maintain the logical relationships among the elements. Based on these relationships, JPQ deploys a deductive mechanism to declaratively specify the data transformation requests and considers also data filtering on hierarchical data structure. We use various examples to show the features of the language and to demonstrate its expressiveness and declarativeness in presenting complex document queries.
