Yang-Baxter Equations, Computational Methods and Applications

Computational methods are an important tool for solving the Yang-Baxter equations(in small dimensions), for classifying (unifying) structures, and for solving related problems. This paper is an account of some of the latest developments on the Yang-Baxter equation, its set-theoretical version, and its applications. We construct new set-theoretical solutions for the Yang-Baxter equation. Unification theories and other results are proposed or proved.
