Evolution of an Emerging Symmetric Quantum Cryptographic Algorithm

With the rapid evolution of data exchange in network environments, information security has been the most important process for data storage and communication. In order to provide such information security, the confidentiality, data integrity, and data origin authentication must be verified based on cryptographic encryption algorithms. This paper presents a new emerging trend of modern symmetric encryption algorithm by development of the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm. The new development focuses on the integration between Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and an enhanced version of AES. A new quantum symmetric encryption algorithm, which is abbreviated as Quantum-AES (QAES), is the output of such integration. QAES depends on generation of dynamic quantum S-Boxes (DQS-Boxes) based quantum cipher key, instead of the ordinary used static S-Boxes. Furthermore, QAES exploits the specific selected secret key generated from the QKD cipher using two different modes (online and off-line).
