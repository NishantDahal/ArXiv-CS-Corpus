Incorporating Inductions and Game Semantics into Logic Programming

Inductions and game semantics are two useful extensions to traditional logic programming. To be specific, inductions can capture a wider class of provable formulas in logic programming. Adopting game semantics can make logic programming more interactive.
  In this paper, we propose an execution model for a logic language with these features. This execution model follows closely the reasoning process in real life.
