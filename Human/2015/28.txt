Multi-task Image Classification via Collaborative, Hierarchical Spike-and-Slab Priors

Promising results have been achieved in image classification problems by exploiting the discriminative power of sparse representations for classification (SRC). Recently, it has been shown that the use of \emph{class-specific} spike-and-slab priors in conjunction with the class-specific dictionaries from SRC is particularly effective in low training scenarios. As a logical extension, we build on this framework for multitask scenarios, wherein multiple representations of the same physical phenomena are available. We experimentally demonstrate the benefits of mining joint information from different camera views for multi-view face recognition.
