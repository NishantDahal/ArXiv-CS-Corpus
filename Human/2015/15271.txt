Multilevel Diversity Coding with Regeneration: Separate Coding Achieves the MBR Point

The problem of multilevel diversity coding with regeneration is considered in this work. Two new outer bounds on the optimal tradeoffs between the normalized storage capacity and repair bandwidth are established, by which the optimality of separate coding at the minimum-bandwidth-regeneration (MBR) point follows immediately. This resolves a question left open in a previous work by Tian and Liu.
