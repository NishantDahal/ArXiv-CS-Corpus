Pairwise Constraint Propagation: A Survey

As one of the most important types of (weaker) supervised information in machine learning and pattern recognition, pairwise constraint, which specifies whether a pair of data points occur together, has recently received significant attention, especially the problem of pairwise constraint propagation. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is that compared to the data label, pairwise constraints are more general and easily to collect, and the second is that since the available pairwise constraints are usually limited, the constraint propagation problem is thus important.
  This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of pairwise constraint propagation research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of pairwise constraint propagation. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing propagation techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category.
