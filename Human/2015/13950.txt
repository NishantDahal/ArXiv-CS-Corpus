Application-Aware Resource Block and Power Allocation for LTE

In this paper, we implement an application-aware scheduler that differentiates users running real-time applications and delay-tolerant applications while allocating resources. This approach ensures that the priority is given to real-time applications over delay-tolerant applications. In our system model, we include realistic channel effects of Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. Our application-aware scheduler runs in two stages, the first stage is resource block allocation and the second stage is power allocation. In the optimal solution of resource block allocation problem, each user is inherently guaranteed a minimum Quality of Experience (QoE) while ensuring priority given to users with real-time applications. In the power allocation problem, a new power allocation method is proposed which utilizes the optimal solution of the application-aware resource block scheduling problem. As a proof of concept, we run a simulation comparison between a conventional proportional fairness scheduler and the application-aware scheduler. The simulation results show better QoE with the application-aware scheduler.
