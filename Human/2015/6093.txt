Code Generator Composition for Model-Driven Engineering of Robotics Component & Connector Systems

Engineering software for robotics applications requires multidomain and application-specific solutions. Model-driven engineering and modeling language integration provide means for developing specialized, yet reusable models of robotics software architectures. Code generators transform these platform independent models into executable code specific to robotic platforms. Generative software engineering for multidomain applications requires not only the integration of modeling languages but also the integration of validation mechanisms and code generators. In this paper we sketch a conceptual model for code generator composition and show an instantiation of this model in the MontiArc- Automaton framework. MontiArcAutomaton allows modeling software architectures as component and connector models with different component behavior modeling languages. Effective means for code generator integration are a necessity for the post hoc integration of applicationspecific languages in model-based robotics software engineering.
