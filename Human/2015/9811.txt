Topological representation of intuitionistic and distributive abstract logics

We continue work of our earlier paper (Lewitzka and Brunner: Minimally generated abstract logics, Logica Universalis 3(2), 2009), where abstract logics and particularly intuitionistic abstract logics are studied. Abstract logics can be topologized in a direct and natural way. This facilitates a topological study of classes of concrete logics whenever they are given in abstract form. Moreover, such a direct topological approach avoids the often complex algebraic and lattice-theoretic machinery usually applied to represent logics. Motivated by that point of view, we define in this paper the category of intuitionistic abstract logics with stable logic maps as morphisms, and the category of implicative spectral spaces with spectral maps as morphisms. We show the equivalence of these categories and conclude that the larger categories of distributive abstract logics and distributive sober spaces are equivalent, too.
