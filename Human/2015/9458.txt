Numerical Methods for the Inverse Nonlinear Fourier Transform

We introduce a new numerical method for the computation of the inverse nonlinear Fourier transform and compare its computational complexity and accuracy to those of other methods available in the literature. For a given accuracy, the proposed method requires the lowest number of operations
