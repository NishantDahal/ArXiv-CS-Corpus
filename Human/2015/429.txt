User involvement in the partner program of the educational social network

The paper describes experiments to attract active online system users to the partner program. The objective is to grow the number of users by involving existing system users in viral mechanics. Several examples of user motivation are given, along with the specific interface implementations and viral mechanics. Viral K-factor was used as the metrics for the resulting system growth assessment. Specific examples show both positive and negative outcomes. Growth of the target system parameters is discussed.
