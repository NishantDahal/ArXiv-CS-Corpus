aDTN - Undetectable Communication in Wireless Delay-tolerant Networks (Working Draft)

This document describes a best-effort delay-tolerant communication system that protects the privacy of users in wireless ad-hoc networks by making their communication undetectable. The proposed system is a wireless broadcast-based adaptation of mix networks where each user belongs to at least one group it trusts, and each group acts as a mix node. Assuming encryption is not broken, it provides undetectability of all users and messages against external adversaries, as well as undetectability of users and messages in non-compromised groups against internal adversaries.
