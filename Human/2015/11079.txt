Bipodal structure in oversaturated random graphs

We study the asymptotics of large simple graphs constrained by the limiting density of edges and the limiting subgraph density of an arbitrary fixed graph $H$. We prove that, for all but finitely many values of the edge density, if the density of $H$ is constrained to be slightly higher than that for the corresponding Erdős-Rényi graph, the typical large graph is bipodal with parameters varying analytically with the densities. Asymptotically, the parameters depend only on the degree sequence of $H$.
