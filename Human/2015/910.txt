Decidability and Universality of Quasiminimal Subshifts

We introduce the quasiminimal subshifts, subshifts having only finitely many subsystems. With $\mathbb{N}$-actions, their theory essentially reduces to the theory of minimal systems, but with $\mathbb{Z}$-actions, the class is much larger. We show many examples of such subshifts, and in particular construct a universal system with only a single proper subsystem, refuting a conjecture of [Delvenne, KÅ¯rka, Blondel, '05].
