System Descriptions of the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA'15)

This volume contains the system description of the 18 solvers submitted to the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation (ICCMA'15) and therefore gives an overview on state-of-the-art of computational approaches to abstract argumentation problems. Further information on the results of the competition and the performance of the individual solvers can be found on at http://argumentationcompetition.org/2015/.
