Graph Theory Applications in Network Security

Graph theory has become a very critical component in many applications in the computing field including networking and security. Unfortunately, it is also amongst the most complex topics to understand and apply.
  In this paper, we review some of the key applications of graph theory in network security. We first cover some algorithmic aspects, then present network coding and its relation to routing.
