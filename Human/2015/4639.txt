A Survey of P2P Network Security

This paper presents a review of peer-to-peer network security. Popular for sharing of multimedia files, these networks carry risks and vulnerabilities relating to data integrity, spyware, adware, and unwanted files. Further attacks include those of forgery, pollution, repudiation, membership and Eclipse attacks, neighbor selection attacks, Sybil, DoS, and omission attacks. We review some protection mechanisms that have been devised.
