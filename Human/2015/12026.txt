MoM-SO: a Complete Method for Computing the Impedance of Cable Systems Including Skin, Proximity, and Ground Return Effects

The availability of accurate and broadband models for underground and submarine cable systems is of paramount importance for the correct prediction of electromagnetic transients in power grids. Recently, we proposed the MoM-SO method for extracting the series impedance of power cables while accounting for skin and proximity effect in the conductors. In this paper, we extend the method to include ground return effects and to handle cables placed inside a tunnel. Numerical tests show that the proposed method is more accurate than widely-used analytic formulas, and is much faster than existing proximity-aware approaches like finite elements. For a three-phase cable system in a tunnel, the proposed method requires only 0.3 seconds of CPU time per frequency point, against the 8.3 minutes taken by finite elements, for a speed up beyond 1000 X.
