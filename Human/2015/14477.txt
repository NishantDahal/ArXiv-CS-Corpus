Proactive Eavesdropping via Jamming for Rate Maximization over Rayleigh Fading Channels

Instead of against eavesdropping, this letter proposes a new paradigm in wireless security by studying how a legitimate monitor (e.g., government agencies) efficiently eavesdrops a suspicious wireless communication link. The suspicious transmitter controls its communication rate over Rayleigh fading channels to maintain a target outage probability at the receiver, and the legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop only when its achievable rate is no smaller than the suspicious communication rate. We propose a proactive eavesdropping via jamming approach to maximize the average eavesdropping rate, where the legitimate monitor sends jamming signals with optimized power control to moderate the suspicious communication rate.
