A Class of Deterministic Sensing Matrices and Their Application in Harmonic Detection

In this paper, a class of deterministic sensing matrices are constructed by selecting rows from Fourier matrices. These matrices have better performance in sparse recovery than random partial Fourier matrices. The coherence and restricted isometry property of these matrices are given to evaluate their capacity as compressive sensing matrices. In general, compressed sensing requires random sampling in data acquisition, which is difficult to implement in hardware. By using these sensing matrices in harmonic detection, a deterministic sampling method is provided. The frequencies and amplitudes of the harmonic components are estimated from under-sampled data. The simulations show that this under-sampled method is feasible and valid in noisy environments.
