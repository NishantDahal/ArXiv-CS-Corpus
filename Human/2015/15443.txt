Semantic Arabic Information Retrieval Framework

The continuous increasing in the amount of the published and stored information requires a special Information Retrieval (IR) frameworks to search and get information accurately and speedily. Currently, keywords-based techniques are commonly used in information retrieval. However, a major drawback of the keywords approach is its inability of handling the polysemy and synonymy phenomenon of the natural language. For instance, the meanings of words and understanding of concepts differ in different communities. Same word use for different concepts (polysemy) or use different words for the same concept (synonymy). Most of information retrieval frameworks have a weakness to deal with the semantics of the words in term of (indexing, Boolean model, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) , Latent semantic Index (LSI) and semantic ranking, etc.). Traditional Arabic Information Retrieval (AIR) models performance insufficient with semantic queries, which deal with not only the keywords but also with the context of these keywords. Therefore, there is a need for a semantic information retrieval model with a semantic index structure and ranking algorithm based on semantic index.
