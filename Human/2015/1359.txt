Bibliometrics/Citation networks

In addition to shaping social networks, for example, in terms of co-authorship relations, scientific communications induce and reproduce cognitive structures. Scientific literature is intellectually organized in terms of disciplines and specialties; these structures are reproduced and networked reflexively by making references to the authors, concepts and texts embedded in these literatures. The concept of a cognitive structure was introduced in social network analysis (SNA) in 1987 by David Krackhardt, but the focus in SNA has hitherto been on cognition as a psychological attribute of human agency. In bibliometrics, and in science and technology studies (STS) more generally, socio-cognitive structures refer to intellectual organization at the supra-individual level. This intellectual organization emerges and is reproduced by the collectives of authors who are organized not only in terms of inter-personal relations, but also more abstractly in terms of codes of communication that are field-specific. Citations can serve as indicators of this codification process.
