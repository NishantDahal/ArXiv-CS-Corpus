Managing Multi-Granular Linguistic Distribution Assessments in Large-Scale Multi-Attribute Group Decision Making

Linguistic large-scale group decision making (LGDM) problems are more and more common nowadays. In such problems a large group of decision makers are involved in the decision process and elicit linguistic information that are usually assessed in different linguistic scales with diverse granularity because of decision makers' distinct knowledge and background. To keep maximum information in initial stages of the linguistic LGDM problems, the use of multi-granular linguistic distribution assessments seems a suitable choice, however to manage such multigranular linguistic distribution assessments, it is necessary the development of a new linguistic computational approach. In this paper it is proposed a novel computational model based on the use of extended linguistic hierarchies, which not only can be used to operate with multi-granular linguistic distribution assessments, but also can provide interpretable linguistic results to decision makers. Based on this new linguistic computational model, an approach to linguistic large-scale multi-attribute group decision making is proposed and applied to a talent selection process in universities.
