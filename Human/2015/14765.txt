Gaussian elimination in unitary groups with an application to cryptography

Gaussian elimination is used in special linear groups to solve the word problem. In this paper, we extend Gaussian elimination to unitary groups. These algorithms have an application in building a public-key cryptosystem, we demonstrate that.
