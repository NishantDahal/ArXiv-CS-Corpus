Massively Parallel Ray Tracing Algorithm Using GPU

Ray tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of high-quality global illumination at a heavy computational cost. Because of the high computation complexity, it can't reach the requirement of real-time rendering. The emergence of many-core architectures, makes it possible to reduce significantly the running time of ray tracing algorithm by employing the powerful ability of floating point computation. In this paper, a new GPU implementation and optimization of the ray tracing to accelerate the rendering process is presented.
