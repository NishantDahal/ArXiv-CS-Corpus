Flexibility of Networks: a new measure for network design space analysis?

Flexibility is often claimed as a competitive advantage when proposing new network designs. However, most proposals provide only qualitative arguments for their improved support of flexibility. Quantitative arguments vary a lot among different proposals. A general understanding for flexibility is not yet clearly defined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions based on background information. The term flexibility is commonly defined as the ability to adapt to changes. For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to adapt the available network resources, such as flows or topology, to changes of design requirements, e.g., shorter latency budgets or different traffic distributions. Recent concepts such as Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization have emerged claiming to provide more flexibility in networks. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of what flexibility means and how it could be quantified to compare different network designs remains open. In this paper, we ask whether flexibility can be a new measure for network design space analysis. As it is quite challenging to formulate a flexibility measure that covers all network aspects, we propose an initial set of flexibility aspects to start grounding guidelines. Our initial selection is backed up by an analysis of Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization for their support of the selected flexibility aspects. Our research methodology is based on a systematic approach that leads to network design guidelines with respect to flexibility.
