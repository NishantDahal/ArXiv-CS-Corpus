On the Convergence of the Pairwise Comparisons Inconsistency Reduction Process

This study investigates a powerful model, targeted to subjective assessments, based on pairwise comparisons. It provides a proof that a distance-based inconsistency reduction transforms an inconsistent pairwise comparisons (PC) matrix into a consistent PC matrix which is generated by the geometric means of rows of a given inconsistent PC matrix. The distance-based inconsistency indicator was defined in 1993 for pairwise comparisons. Its convergence was analyzed in 1996 (regretfully, with an incomplete proof; finally completed in 2010). However, there was no clear interpretation of the convergence limit which is of considerable importance for applications and this study does so.
