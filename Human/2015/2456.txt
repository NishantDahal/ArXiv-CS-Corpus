Internet comments as a barometer of public opinion

Social susceptibility is defined and analyzed using data from CNN news website. The current models of opinion dynamics, voting, and herding in closed communities are extended, and the community's response to the injection of a group with predetermined and permanent opinions is calculated. A method to estimate the values of possible response in Internet communities that follow a specific developing subject is developed. The level of social influence in a community follows from the statistics of responses ("like" and "dislike" votes) to the comments written by the members of the same community. Three real cases of developing news stories are analyzed. We suggest that Internet comments may predict the level of social response similar to a barometer that predicts the intensity of a coming storm in still calm environment.
