A Novel Image Steganographic Approach for Hiding Text in Color Images using HSI Color Model

Image Steganography is the process of embedding text in images such that its existence cannot be detected by Human Visual System (HVS) and is known only to sender and receiver. This paper presents a novel approach for image steganography using Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) color space based on Least Significant Bit (LSB). The proposed method transforms the image from RGB color space to Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) color space and then embeds secret data inside the Intensity Plane (I-Plane) and transforms it back to RGB color model after embedding. The said technique is evaluated by both subjective and Objective Analysis. Experimentally it is found that the proposed method have larger Peak Signal-to Noise Ratio (PSNR) values, good imperceptibility and multiple security levels which shows its superiority as compared to several existing methods
