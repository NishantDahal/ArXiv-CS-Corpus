Theory of Semi-Instantiation in Abstract Argumentation

We study instantiated abstract argumentation frames of the form $(S,R,I)$, where $(S,R)$ is an abstract argumentation frame and where the arguments $x$ of $S$ are instantiated by $I(x)$ as well formed formulas of a well known logic, for example as Boolean formulas or as predicate logic formulas or as modal logic formulas. We use the method of conceptual analysis to derive the properties of our proposed system. We seek to define the notion of complete extensions for such systems and provide algorithms for finding such extensions. We further develop a theory of instantiation in the abstract, using the framework of Boolean attack formations and of conjunctive and disjunctive attacks. We discuss applications and compare critically with the existing related literature.
