Low-cost Sensor Glove with Force Feedback for Learning from Demonstrations using Probabilistic Trajectory Representations

Sensor gloves are popular input devices for a large variety of applications including health monitoring, control of music instruments, learning sign language, dexterous computer interfaces, and tele-operating robot hands. Many commercial products as well as low-cost open source projects have been developed. We discuss here how low-cost (approx. 250 EUROs) sensor gloves with force feedback can be build, provide an open source software interface for Matlab and present first results in learning object manipulation skills through imitation learning on the humanoid robot iCub.
