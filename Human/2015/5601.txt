Natural Data Storage: A Review on sending Information from now to then via Nature

Digital data explosion drives a demand for robust and reliable data storage medium. Development of better digital storage device to accumulate Zetta bytes (1 ZB = $10^{21}$ bytes ) of data that will be generated in near future is a big challenge. Looking at limitations of present day digital storage devices, it will soon be a big challenge for data scientists to provide reliable. affordable and dense storage medium. As an alternative, researcher used natural medium of storage like DNA, bacteria and protein as information storage systems. This article discuss DNA based information storage system in detail along with an overview about bacterial and protein data storage systems.
