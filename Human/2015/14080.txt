Combining features of the Unreal and Unity Game Engines to hone development skills

Two of the most popular game engines today, Unreal Engine v4.x and Unity Game Engine v5.x have recently adopted competitive and very appealing pricing structures for individual game developers and small teams. One may lean towards one or the other game engine based on various criteria: existing familiarization / vested interest, steepness of learning curve, quality, richness, variability and pricing of add-on assets, initial cost of basic ownership versus subscribing to updates and acquiring needed modules, etc. In this paper we present complementary features of the Unreal and Unity game engines that can be combined to enhance understanding game development and to hone relevant skills. Such combinations of different game engine features can increase the added value for our undergraduate informatics engineering students taking a "Game Technologies" class.
