A Survey on Methods and Systems for Graph Compression

We present an informal survey (meant to accompany another paper) on graph compression methods. We focus on lossless methods, briefly list available pproaches, and compare them where possible or give some indicators on their compression ratios. We also mention some relevant results from the field of lossy compression and algorithms specialized for the use on large graphs. --- Note: The comparison is by no means complete. This document is a first draft and will be updated and extended.
