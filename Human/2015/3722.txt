Automated identification and characterization of parcels (AICP) with OpenStreetMap and Points of Interest

Against the paucity of urban parcels in China, this paper proposes a method to automatically identify and characterize parcels (AICP) with OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Points of Interest (POI) data. Parcels are the basic spatial units for fine-scale urban modeling, urban studies, as well as spatial planning. Conventional ways of identification and characterization of parcels rely on remote sensing and field surveys, which are labor intensive and resource-consuming. Poorly developed digital infrastructure, limited resources, and institutional barriers have all hampered the gathering and application of parcel data in developing countries. Against this backdrop, we employ OSM road networks to identify parcel geometries and POI data to infer parcel characteristics. A vector-based CA model is adopted to select urban parcels. The method is applied to the entire state of China and identifies 82,645 urban parcels in 297 cities. Notwithstanding all the caveats of open and/or crowd-sourced data, our approach could produce reasonably good approximation of parcels identified from conventional methods, thus having the potential to become a useful supplement.
