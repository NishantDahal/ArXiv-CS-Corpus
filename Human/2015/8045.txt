Robust Detection of Intensity Variant Clones in Forged and JPEG Compressed Images

Digitization of images has made image editing easier. Ease of image editing tempted users and professionals to manipulate digital images leading to digital image forgeries. Today digital image forgery has posed a great threat to the authenticity of the popular digital media, the digital images. A lot of research is going on worldwide to detect image forgery and to separate the forged images from their authentic counterparts. This paper provides a novel intensity invariant detection model (IIDM) for detection of intensity variant clones that is robust against JPEG compression, noise attacks and blurring.
