A Hypercomputation in Brouwer's Constructivism

In contrast to other constructivist schools, for Brouwer, the notion of "constructive object" is not restricted to be presented as `words' in some finite alphabet of symbols, and choice sequences which are non-predetermined and unfinished objects are legitimate constructive objects. In this way, Brouwer's constructivism goes beyond Turing computability. Further, in 1999, the term hypercomputation was introduced by J. Copeland. Hypercomputation refers to models of computation which go beyond Church-Turing thesis. In this paper, we propose a hypercomputation called persistently evolutionary Turing machines based on Brouwer's notion of being constructive.
