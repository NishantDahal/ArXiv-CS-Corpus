Linear codes with two or three weights from weakly regular bent functions

Linear codes with few weights have applications in consumer electronics, communication, data storage system, secret sharing, authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular graphs. This paper first generalizes the method of constructing two-weight and three-weight linear codes of Ding et al. \cite{DD2015} and Zhou et al. \cite{ZLFH2015} to general weakly regular bent functions and determines the weight distributions of these linear codes. It solves the open problem of Ding et al. \cite{DD2015}. Further, this paper constructs new linear codes with two or three weights and presents the weight distributions of these codes. They contains some optimal codes meeting certain bound on linear codes.
