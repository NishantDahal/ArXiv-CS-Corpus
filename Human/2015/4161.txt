Application of Enhanced-2D-CWT in Topographic Images for Mapping Landslide Risk Areas

There has been lately a number of catastrophic events of landslides and mudslides in the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Those were caused by intense rain in localities where there was unplanned occupation of slopes of hills and mountains. Thus, it became imperative creating an inventory of landslide risk areas in densely populated cities. This work presents a way of demarcating risk areas by using the bidimensional Continuous Wavelet Transform (2D-CWT) applied to high resolution topographic images of the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro.
