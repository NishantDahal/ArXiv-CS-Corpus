SCION Five Years Later: Revisiting Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-Generation Networks

The SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation on Next-generation Networks) inter-domain network architecture was proposed to address the availability, scalability, and security shortcomings of the current Internet. This paper presents a retrospective of the SCION goals and design decisions, its attacker model and limitations, and research highlights of work conducted in the 5 years following SCION's initial publication.
