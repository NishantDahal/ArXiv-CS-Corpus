Can Other People Make You Less Creative?

This paper explains in layperson's terms how an agent-based model was used to investigate the hypothesis that culture evolves more effectively when novelty-generating creative processes are tempered by imitation processes that preserve proven successful ideas. Using EVOC, an agent-based model of cultural evolution we found that (1) the optimal ratio of inventing to imitating ranged from 1:1 to 2:1 depending on the fitness function, (2) there was a trade-off between the proportion of creators to conformers and how creative the creators were, and (3) when agents in increased or decreased their creativity depending on the success of their latest creative efforts, they segregated into creators and conformers, and the mean fitness of ideas across the society was higher. It is tentatively suggested that through the unconscious use of social cues, members of a society self-organizes to achieve a balanced mix of creators and conformers.
