A Java Implementation of the SGA, UMDA, ECGA, and HBOA

The Simple Genetic Algorithm, the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm, the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm, and the Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm are all well known Evolutionary Algorithms.
  In this report we present a Java implementation of these four algorithms with detailed instructions on how to use each of them to solve a given set of optimization problems. Additionally, it is explained how to implement and integrate new problems within the provided set. The source and binary files of the Java implementations are available for free download at https://github.com/JoseCPereira/2015EvolutionaryAlgorithmsJava.
