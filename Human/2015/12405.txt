Joint Deployment of Small Cells and Wireless Backhaul Links in Next-Generation Networks

In this paper, a novel approach for optimizing the joint deployment of small cell base stations and wireless backhaul links is proposed. This joint deployment scenario is cast as a multi-objective optimization problem under the constraints of limited backhaul capacity and outage probability. To address the problem,a novel adaptive algorithm that integrates $Îµ$-method, Lagrangian relaxation and tabu search is proposed to obtain the Pareto optimal solution set. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in finding the optimal solutions. The proposed joint deployment model can be used for planning small cell networks.
