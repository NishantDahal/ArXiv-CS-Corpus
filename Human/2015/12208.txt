iCellular: Define Your Own Cellular Network Access on Commodity Smartphones

Leveraging multi-carrier access offers a promising approach to boosting access quality in mobile networks. However, our experiments show that the potential benefits are hard to fulfill due to fundamental limitations in the network-controlled design. To overcome these limitations, we propose iCellular, which allows users to define and intelligently select their own cellular network access from multiple carriers. iCellular reuses the existing device-side mechanisms and the standard cellular network procedure, but leverages the end device's intelligence to be proactive and adaptive in multi-carrier selection. It performs adaptive monitoring to ensure responsive selection and minimal service disruption, and enhances carrier selection with online learning and runtime decision fault prevention. It is deployable on commodity phones without any infrastructure/hardware change. We implement iCellular on commodity Nexus 6 phones and leverage Google Project-Fi's efforts to test multi-carrier access among two top US carriers: T-Mobile and Sprint. Our experiments confirm that iCellular helps users with up to 3.74x throughput improvement (7x suspension and 1.9x latency reduction) over the state-of-art selection. Moreover, iCellular locates the best-quality carrier in most cases, with negligible overhead on CPU, memory and energy consumption.
