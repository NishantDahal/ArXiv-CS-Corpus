Topology-Aware Node Selection for Data Regeneration in Heterogeneous Distributed Storage Systems

Distributed storage systems introduce redundancy to protect data from node failures. After a storage node fails, the lost data should be regenerated at a replacement storage node as soon as possible to maintain the same level of redundancy. Minimizing such a regeneration time is critical to the reliability of distributed storage systems. Existing work commits to reduce the regeneration time by either minimizing the regenerating traffic, or adjusting the regenerating traffic patterns, whereas nodes participating data regeneration are generally assumed to be given beforehand. However, such regeneration time also depends heavily on the selection of the participating nodes. Selecting different participating nodes actually involve different data links between the nodes. Real-world distributed storage systems usually exhibit heterogeneous link capacities. It is possible to further reduce the regeneration time via exploiting such link capacity differences and avoiding the link bottlenecks. In this paper, we consider the minimization of the regeneration time by selecting the participating nodes in heterogeneous networks. We analyze the regeneration time and propose node selection algorithms for overlay networks and real-world topologies. Considering that the flexible amount of data blocks from each provider may deeply influence the regeneration time, several techniques are designed to enhance our schemes in overlay networks. Experimental results show that our node selection schemes can significantly reduce the regeneration time for each topology, especially in practical networks with heterogeneous link capacities.
