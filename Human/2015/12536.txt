A Brief Survey of Image Processing Algorithms in Electrical Capacitance Tomography

To study the fundamental physics of complex multiphase flow systems using advanced measurement techniques, especially the electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) approach, this article carries out an initial literature review of the ECT method from a point of view of signal processing and algorithm design. After introducing the physical laws governing the ECT system, we will focus on various reconstruction techniques that are capable to recover the image of the internal characteristics of a specified region based on the measuring capacitances of multi-electrode sensors surrounding the region. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations, and many algorithms have been examined by simulations or experiments. Future researches in 3D reconstruction and other potential improvements of the system are discussed in the end.
