Decentralized Sequential Composite Hypothesis Test Based on One-Bit Communication

This paper considers the sequential composite hypothesis test with multiple sensors. The sensors observe random samples in parallel and communicate with a fusion center, who makes the global decision based on the sensor inputs. On one hand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely transmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio test (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected sample size as error rates tend to zero. On the other hand, for systems with limited power and bandwidth resources, decentralized solutions that only send a summary of local samples (we particularly focus on a one-bit communication protocol) to the fusion center is of great importance. To this end, we first consider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized statistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a uniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its suboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of the quantized statistics under both hypotheses. We then propose a decentralized GSPRT based on level-triggered sampling. That is, each sensor runs its own GSPRT repeatedly and reports its local decision to the fusion center asynchronously. We show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal as the local thresholds and global thresholds grow large at different rates. Lastly, two particular models and their associated applications are studied to compare the centralized and decentralized approaches. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed level-triggered sampling based decentralized scheme aligns closely with the centralized scheme with substantially lower communication overhead, and significantly outperforms the uniform sampling and quantization based decentralized scheme.
