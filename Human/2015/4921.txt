LIVEIA: A Light-based Immersive Visualization Environment for Imaginative Actualization

This paper describes an immersive and interactive visualization environment that uses light as a metaphor for psychological phenomena. Creative life force is portrayed as ambient light, and peoples' psyches are represented by spheres that amplify and transform light. Personality characteristics, situations, and relationships are systematically depicted using a systematic visual language based on the properties of light and how it interacts with physical objects. The technology enables users to visualize and creatively experiment with light-based representations of themselves and others, including patterns of interaction and how they have come about, and how they could change and unfold in the future.
