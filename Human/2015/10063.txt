Using the VBARMS method in parallel computing

The paper describes an improved parallel MPI-based implementation of VBARMS, a variable block variant of the pARMS preconditioner proposed by Li,~Saad and Sosonkina [NLAA, 2003] for solving general nonsymmetric linear systems. The parallel VBARMS solver can detect automatically exact or approximate dense structures in the linear system, and exploits this information to achieve improved reliability and increased throughput during the factorization. A novel graph compression algorithm is discussed that finds these approximate dense blocks structures and requires only one simple to use parameter. A complete study of the numerical and parallel performance of parallel VBARMS is presented for the analysis of large turbulent Navier-Stokes equations on a suite of three-dimensional test cases.
