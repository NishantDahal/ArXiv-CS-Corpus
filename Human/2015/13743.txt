Actually, It's About Ethics in Computational Social Science: A Multi-party Risk-Benefit Framework for Online Community Research

Managers regularly face a complex ethical dilemma over how to best govern online communities by evaluating the effectiveness of different social or technical strategies. What ethical considerations should guide researchers and managers when they employ causal research methods that make different community members bear different risks and benefits, under different levels of consent? We introduce a structural framework for evaluating the flows of risks and benefits in social systems with multiple interacting parties. This framework has implications for understanding the governmentality of managing socio-technical systems, for making research ethics discussions more commensurable, and for enumerating alternative goals researchers might pursue with interventions.
