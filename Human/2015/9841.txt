PTILE: A framework for the Evaluation of Power Transformer Insulation Life in Electric Power System

In this paper, a framework is developed for power transformer (Generator Step up Unit) insulation life evaluation (PTILE) study on power system Network. Parameters used for studies include real time sample data obtained from power transformer field studies in the South-South Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It is used for performing simulations over varying number of years. Simulation reports shows a polynomial running time complexity and validates the stochastic Hot Spot theory indicating that the transformers in such region should be replaced sooner due to higher hot spots and transformer loading in such regions
