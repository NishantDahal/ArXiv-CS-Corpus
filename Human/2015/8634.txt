TryLogic tutorial: an approach to Learning Logic by proving and refuting

Aiming to offer a framework for blended learning to the teaching of proof theory, the present paper describes an interactive tutorial, called \textsc{TryLogic}, teaching how to solve logical conjectures either by proofs or refutations. The paper also describes the integration of our infrastructure with the Virtual Learning Environment \texttt{Moodle} through the IMS Learning Tools Interoperability specification, and evaluates the tool we have developed.
