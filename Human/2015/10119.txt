Reducible Cyclic Codes Constructed as the Direct Sum of Two Semiprimitive Cyclic Codes

We present a family of reducible cyclic codes constructed as the direct sum of two different semiprimitive two-weight irreducible cyclic codes. This family generalizes the class of reducible cyclic codes that was reported in the main result of B. Wang, {\em et al.} \cite{once}. Moreover, despite of what was stated therein, we show that, at least for the codes studied here, it is still possible to compute the frequencies of their weight distributions through the cyclotomic numbers in a very easy way.
