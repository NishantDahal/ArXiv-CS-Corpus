Capacity Analysis of One-Bit Quantized MIMO Systems with Transmitter Channel State Information

With bandwidths on the order of a gigahertz in emerging wireless systems, high-resolution analog-to-digital convertors (ADCs) become a power consumption bottleneck. One solution is to employ low resolution one-bit ADCs. In this paper, we analyze the flat fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with one-bit ADCs. Channel state information is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver. For the multiple-input single-output channel, we derive the exact channel capacity. For the single-input multiple-output and MIMO channel, the capacity at infinite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is found. We also derive upper bound at finite SNR, which is tight when the channel has full row rank. In addition, we propose an efficient method to design the input symbols to approach the capacity achieving solution. We incorporate millimeter wave channel characteristics and find the bounds on the infinite SNR capacity. The results show how the number of paths and number of receive antennas impact the capacity.
