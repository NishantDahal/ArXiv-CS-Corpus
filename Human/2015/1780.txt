Coalgebraic Tools for Bisimilarity and Decorated Trace Semantics

The modelling, specification and study of the semantics of concurrent reactive systems have been interesting research topics for many years now. The aim of this thesis is to exploit the strengths of the (co)algebraic framework in modelling reactive systems and reasoning on several types of associated semantics, in a uniform fashion. In particular, we are interested in handling notions of behavioural equivalence/preorder ranging from bisimilarity for systems that can be represented as non-deterministic coalgebras, to decorated trace semantics for labelled transition systems and probabilistic systems, and testing semantics for labelled transition systems with internal behaviour. Moreover, we aim at deriving a suite of corresponding verification algorithms suitable for implementation in automated tools.
