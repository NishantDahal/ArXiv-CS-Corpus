Design of Raptor Codes in the Low SNR Regime with Applications in Quantum Key Distribution

The focus of this work is on the design of Raptor codes for continuous variable Quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems. We design a highly efficient Raptor code for very low signal to noise ratios (SNRs), which enables CV-QKD systems to operate over long distances with a significantly higher secret key rate compared to conventional fixed rate codes. The degree distribution design of Raptor codes in the low SNR regime is formulated as a linear program, where a set of optimized degree distributions are also obtained through linear programming. Simulation results show that the designed code achieves efficiencies higher than 94\% for SNRs as low as -20 dB and -30 dB. We further propose a new error reconciliation protocol for CV-QKD systems by using Raptor codes and show that it can achieve higher secret key rates over long distances compared to existing protocols.
