On Web-grid Implementation Using Single System Image

With the latest innovations and trend towards personalizing users' web browsing experience, the web has been increasingly dominated by dynamic contents. However, delivering dynamic content remains a challenge due to the many dependencies involved in compiling the content, specifically personalized ones. This paper presents the use of Single System Image (SSI) clustering systems for a cheap, off-the-shelf, local lightweight distributed web-grid composed of desktop PCs. The three clustering systems considered in the study are Kerrighed, OpenSSI and openMosix. Through an online simulation technique, the performance savings achieved by the clustering systems were measured. Results showed that Kerrighed has the least number of missed requests while the response time is comparable with the rest.
