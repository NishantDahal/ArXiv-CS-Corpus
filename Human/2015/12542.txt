SINR Model with Best Server Association for High Availability Studies of Wireless Networks

The signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is of key importance for the analysis and design of wireless networks. For addressing new requirements imposed on wireless communication, in particular high availability, a highly accurate modeling of the SINR is needed. We propose a stochastic model of the SINR distribution where shadow fading is characterized by random variables. Therein, the impact of shadow fading on the user association is incorporated by modification of the distributions involved. The SINR model is capable to describe all parts of the SINR distribution in detail, especially the left tail which is of interest for studies of high availability.
