Random Laplacian matrices and convex relaxations

The largest eigenvalue of a matrix is always larger or equal than its largest diagonal entry. We show that for a large class of random Laplacian matrices, this bound is essentially tight: the largest eigenvalue is, up to lower order terms, often the size of the largest diagonal entry.
  Besides being a simple tool to obtain precise estimates on the largest eigenvalue of a large class of random Laplacian matrices, our main result settles a number of open problems related to the tightness of certain convex relaxation-based algorithms. It easily implies the optimality of the semidefinite relaxation approaches to problems such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Synchronization and Stochastic Block Model recovery. Interestingly, this result readily implies the connectivity threshold for Erdős-Rényi graphs and suggests that these three phenomena are manifestations of the same underlying principle. The main tool is a recent estimate on the spectral norm of matrices with independent entries by van Handel and the author.
