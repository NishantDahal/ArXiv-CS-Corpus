Permanent versus determinant: not via saturations

Let Det_n denote the closure of the GL_{n^2}(C)-orbit of the determinant polynomial det_n with respect to linear substitution. The highest weights (partitions) of irreducible GL_{n^2}(C)-representations occurring in the coordinate ring of Det_n form a finitely generated monoid S(Det_n). We prove that the saturation of S(Det_n) contains all partitions lambda with length at most n and size divisible by n. This implies that representation theoretic obstructions for the permanent versus determinant problem must be holes of the monoid S(Det_n).
