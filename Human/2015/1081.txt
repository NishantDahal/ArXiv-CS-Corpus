Boolean Functions, Quantum Gates, Hamilton Operators, Spin Systems and Computer Algebra

We describe the construction of quantum gates (unitary operators) from boolean functions and give a number of applications. Both non-reversible and reversible boolean functions are considered. The construction of the Hamilton operator for a quantum gate is also described with the Hamilton operator expressed as spin system. Computer algebra implementations are provided.
