Covariance-Based OFDM Spectrum Sensing with Sub-Nyquist Samples

In this paper, we propose a feature-based method for spectrum sensing of OFDM signals from sub-Nyquist samples over a single band. We exploit the structure of the covariance matrix of OFDM signals to convert an underdetermined set of covariance-based equations to an overdetermined one. The statistical properties of sample covariance matrix are analyzed and then based on that an approximate Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) for detection of OFDM signals from sub-Nyquist samples is derived. The method is also extended to the frequency-selective channels.
