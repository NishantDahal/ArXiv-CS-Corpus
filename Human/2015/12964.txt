Interface Between Market and Science

At the beginning, programming was inspired by the search of the best solutions. At that time some fundamental stones like famous languages and object oriented and structured programming were laid. It was found later that applications could generate huge profits; after it marketing departments started to decide what was right and wrong. Programs are ruled by developers but declared user-friendly; millions of users are going mad trying to get the needed results from these applications. Research goes on and new results can be opposite to business view. History shows that not science has to adjust to business, but eventually business will have to adapt to the results of the research work.
