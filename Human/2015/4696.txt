Device-Independent Relativistic Quantum Bit Commitment

We examine the possibility of device-independent relativistic quantum bit commitment. We note the potential threat of {\it location attacks}, in which the behaviour of untrusted devices used in relativistic quantum cryptography depends on their space-time location. We describe relativistic quantum bit commitment schemes that are immune to these attacks, and show that these schemes offer device-independent security against hypothetical post-quantum adversaries subject only to the no-signalling principle. We compare a relativistic classical bit commitment scheme with similar features, and note some possible advantages of the quantum schemes.
