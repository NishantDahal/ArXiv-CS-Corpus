Data Hiding using Graphical Code based Steganography Technique

Data hiding has received much attention due to rapid development of internet and multimedia technologies where security of information is a very important concern. This is achieved by Steganography, which is the art or science of hiding data into another data, so that human eyes cannot catch the hidden information easily. There are many ways to hide information-like inside an image, text, audio/ video etc. Among them image steganography is a very attractive research area. The goal is to transmit a data within a modified image (called stego-image)by minimizing the number of bit flips. In this paper, a new steganography technique has been proposed using Graphical codes and also comparison with steganography technique using BCH codes has been studied.
