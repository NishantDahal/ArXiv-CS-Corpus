Steganography and Broadcasting

Informally, steganography is the process of exchanging a secret message between two communicating entities so that an eavesdropper may not know that a message has been sent. After a review of some steganographic systems, we found that these systems have some defects. First, there are situations in which some concealment algorithms do not properly hide a secret message. Second, to conceal one bit of a secret message, some ask at least five documents and make at least two sampling operations, thus increasing their run-times. Considering the different ways to communicate with the receiver, we propose two steganographic systems adapted to the email communication whose algorithms are deterministic. To hide one bit of a secret message, our steganographic systems need only one document and performs one sampling operation and therefore significantly reduces the run-time.
