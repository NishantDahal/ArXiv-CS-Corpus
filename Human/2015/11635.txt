Second-Order Statistics of MIMO Rayleigh Interference Channels: Theory, Applications, and Analysis

While first-order channel statistics, such as bit-error rate (BER) and outage probability, play an important role in the design of wireless communication systems, they provide information only on the static behavior of fading channels. On the other hand, second-order statistics, such as level crossing rate (LCR) and average outage duration (AOD), capture the correlation properties of fading channels, hence, are used in system design notably in packet-based transmission systems. In this paper, exact closed-form expressions are derived for the LCR and AOD of the signal at a receiver where maximal-ratio combining (MRC) is deployed over flat Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and co-channel interferers with unequal transmitting powers and unequal speeds. Moreover, in order to gain insight on the LCR behavior, a simplified approximate expression for the LCR is presented. As an application of LCR in system designs, the packet error rate (PER) is evaluated through finite state Markov chain (FSMC) model. Finally, as another application again by using the FSMC model, the optimum packet length to maximize the throughput of the system with stop-and-wait automatic repeat request (SW-ARQ) protocol is derived. Simulation results validating the presented expressions are provided.
