Dynamic Causality in Event Structures (Technical Report)

In [1] we present an extension of Prime Event Structures by a mechanism to express dynamicity in the causal relation. More precisely we add the possibility that the occurrence of an event can add or remove causal dependencies between events and analyse the expressive power of the resulting Event Structures w.r.t. to some well-known Event Structures from the literature. This technical report contains some additional information and the missing proofs of [1].
