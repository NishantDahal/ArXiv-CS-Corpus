Information theoretic approach to robust multi-Bernoulli sensor control

A novel sensor control solution is presented, formulated within a Multi-Bernoulli-based multi-target tracking framework. The proposed method is especially designed for the general multi-target tracking case, where no prior knowledge of the clutter distribution or the probability of detection profile are available. In an information theoretic approach, our method makes use of RÃ¨nyi divergence as the reward function to be maximized for finding the optimal sensor control command at each step. We devise a Monte Carlo sampling method for computation of the reward. Simulation results demonstrate successful performance of the proposed method in a challenging scenario involving five targets maneuvering in a relatively uncertain space with unknown distance-dependent clutter rate and probability of detection.
