A review on memristor applications

This article presents a review on the main applications of the fourth fundamental circuit element, named "memristor", which had been proposed for the first time by Leon Chua and has recently been developed by a team at HP Laboratories led by Stanley Williams. In particular, after a brief analysis of memristor theory with a description of the first memristor, manufactured at HP Laboratories, we present its main applications in the circuit design and computer technology, together with future developments.
