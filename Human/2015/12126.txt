Simulating the Dynamic Behavior of Shear Thickening Fluids

While significant research has been dedicated to the simulation of fluids, not much attention has been given to exploring new interesting behavior that can be generated with the different types of non-Newtonian fluids with non-constant viscosity. Going in this direction, this paper introduces a computational model for simulating the interesting phenomena observed in non-Newtonian shear thickening fluids, which are fluids where the viscosity increases with increased stress. These fluids have unique and unconventional behavior, and they often appear in real world scenarios such as when sinking in quicksand or when experimenting with popular cornstarch and water mixtures. While interesting behavior of shear thickening fluids can be easily observed in the real world, the most interesting phenomena of these fluids have not been simulated before in computer graphics. The fluid exhibits unique phase changes between solid and liquid states, great impact resistance in its solid state and strong hysteresis effects. Our proposed approach builds on existing non-Newtonian fluid models in computer graphics and introduces an efficient history-based stiffness term that is essential to produce the most interesting shear thickening phenomena. The history-based stiffness is formulated through the use of fractional derivatives, leveraging the fractional calculus ability to depict both the viscoelastic behavior and the history effects of history-dependent systems. Simulations produced by our method are compared against real experiments and the results demonstrate that the proposed model successfully captures key phenomena observed in shear thickening fluids.
