A new result of the scaling law of weighted L1 minimization

This paper study recovery conditions of weighted L1 minimization for signal reconstruction from compressed sensing measurements. A sufficient condition for exact recovery by using the general weighted L1 minimization is derived, which builds a direct relationship between the weights and the recoverability. Simulation results indicates that this sufficient condition provides a precise prediction of the scaling law for the weighted L1 minimization.
