A Study on Optimized Resource Provisioning in Federated Cloud

Cloud computing changed the way of computing as utility services offered through public network. Selecting multiple providers for various computational requirements improves performance and minimizes cost of cloud services than choosing a single cloud provider. Federated cloud improves scalability, cost minimization, performance maximization, collaboration with other providers, multi-site deployment for fault tolerance and recovery, reliability and less energy consumption. Both providers and consumers could benefit from federated cloud where providers serve the consumers by satisfying Service Level Agreement, minimizing overall management and infrastructure cost; consumers get best services with less deployment cost and high availability. Efficient provisioning of resources to consumers in federated cloud is a challenging task. In this paper, the benefits of utilizing services from federated cloud, architecture with various coupling levels, different optimized resource provisioning methods and challenges associated with it are discussed and a comparative study is carried out over these aspects.
