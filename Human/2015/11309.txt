Improved State Estimation in Quadrotor MAVs: A Novel Drift-Free Velocity Estimator

This paper describes the synthesis and evaluation of a novel state estimator for a Quadrotor Micro Aerial Vehicle. Dynamic equations which relate acceleration, attitude and the aero-dynamic propeller drag are encapsulated in an extended Kalman filter framework for estimating the velocity and the attitude of the quadrotor. It is demonstrated that exploiting the relationship between the body frame accelerations and velocities, due to blade flapping, enables drift free estimation of lateral and longitudinal components of body frame translational velocity along with improvements to roll and pitch components of body attitude estimations. Real world data sets gathered using a commercial off-the-shelf quadrotor platform, together with ground truth data from a Vicon system, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
