Privacy and Data Protection by Design - from policy to engineering

Privacy and data protection constitute core values of individuals and of democratic societies. There have been decades of debate on how those values -and legal obligations- can be embedded into systems, preferably from the very beginning of the design process.
  One important element in this endeavour are technical mechanisms, known as privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Their effectiveness has been demonstrated by researchers and in pilot implementations. However, apart from a few exceptions, e.g., encryption became widely used, PETs have not become a standard and widely used component in system design. Furthermore, for unfolding their full benefit for privacy and data protection, PETs need to be rooted in a data governance strategy to be applied in practice.
  This report contributes to bridging the gap between the legal framework and the available technological implementation measures by providing an inventory of existing approaches, privacy design strategies, and technical building blocks of various degrees of maturity from research and development. Starting from the privacy principles of the legislation, important elements are presented as a first step towards a design process for privacy-friendly systems and services. The report sketches a method to map legal obligations to design strategies, which allow the system designer to select appropriate techniques for implementing the identified privacy requirements. Furthermore, the report reflects limitations of the approach. It concludes with recommendations on how to overcome and mitigate these limits.
