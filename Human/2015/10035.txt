Support for Non-conformal Meshes in PETSc's DMPlex Interface

PETSc's DMPlex interface for unstructured meshes has been extended to support non-conformal meshes. The topological construct that DMPlex implements---the CW-complex---is by definition conformal, so representing non- conformal meshes in a way that hides complexity requires careful attention to the interface between DMPlex and numerical methods such as the finite element method. Our approach---which combines a tree structure for subset- superset relationships and a "reference tree" describing the types of non-conformal interfaces---allows finite element code written for conformal meshes to extend automatically: in particular, all "hanging-node" constraint calculations are handled behind the scenes. We give example code demonstrating the use of this extension, and use it to convert forests of quadtrees and forests of octrees from the p4est library to DMPlex meshes.
