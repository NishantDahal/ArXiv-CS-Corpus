RandFile package for Mathematica for accessing file-based sources of randomness

We present a package for Mathematica computer algebra system which allows the exploitation of local files as sources of random data. We provide the description of the package and illustrate its usage by showing some examples. We also compare the provided functionality with alternative sources of randomness, namely a built-in pseudo-random generator and the package for accessing hardware true random number generators.
