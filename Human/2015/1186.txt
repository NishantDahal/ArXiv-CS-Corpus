A method for business process reengineering based on enterprise ontology

Business Process Reengineering increases enterprise's chance to survive in competition among organizations , but failure rate among reengineering efforts is high, so new methods that decrease failure, are needed, in this paper a business process reengineering method is presented that uses Enterprise Ontology for modelling the current system and its goal is to improve analysing current system and decreasing failure rate of BPR, and cost and time of performing processes, In this method instead of just modelling processes, processes with their : interactions and relations, environment, staffs and customers will be modelled in enterprise ontology. Also in choosing processes for reengineering step, after choosing them, processes which, according to the enterprise ontology, has the most connection with the chosen ones, will also be chosen to reengineer, finally this method is implemented on a company and As-Is and To-Be processes are simulated and compared by ARIS tools, Report and Simulation Experiment
