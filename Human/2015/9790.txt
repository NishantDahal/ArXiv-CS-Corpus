A note on the avoidability of binary patterns with variables and reversals

In this note we present a characterisation of all unary and binary patterns that do not only contain variables, but also reversals of their instances. These types of variables were studied recently in either more general or particular cases. We show that the results are not surprising at all in the general case, and extend the avoidability of these patterns to enforce aperiodic words.
