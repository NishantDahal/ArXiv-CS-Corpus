Self-Coordinated Corona Graphs: a model for complex networks

Recently, real world networks having constant/shrinking diameter along with power-law degree distribution are observed and investigated in literature. Taking an inspiration from these findings, we propose a deterministic complex network model, which we call Self-Coordinated Corona Graphs (SCCG), based on the corona product of graphs. As it has also been established that self coordination/organization of nodes gives rise to emergence of power law in degree distributions of several real networks, the networks in the proposed model are generated by the virtue of self coordination of nodes in corona graphs. Alike real networks, the SCCG inherit motifs which act as the seed graphs for the generation of SCCG. We also analytically prove that the power law exponent of SCCG is approximately $2$ and the diameter of SCCG produced by a class of motifs is constant. Finally, we compare different properties of the proposed model with that of the BA and Pseudofractal scale-free models for complex networks.
