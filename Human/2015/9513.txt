Unified System for Processing Real and Simulated Data in the ATLAS Experiment

The physics goals of the next Large Hadron Collider run include high precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for new physics. These goals require detailed comparison of data with computational models simulating the expected data behavior. To highlight the role which modeling and simulation plays in future scientific discovery, we report on use cases and experience with a unified system built to process both real and simulated data of growing volume and variety.
