A New Method for Triangular Mesh Generation

Computational mathematics plays an increasingly important role in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The aeronautics and aerospace re- search community is working on next generation of CFD capacity that is accurate, automatic, and fast. A key component of the next generation of CFD is a greatly enhanced capacity for mesh generation and adaptivity of the mesh according to solution and geometry. In this paper, we propose a new method that generates triangular meshes on domains of curved boundary. The method deforms a Cartesian mesh that covers the domain to generate a mesh with prescribed boundary nodes. The deformation fields are generated by a system of divergence and curl equations which are solved effectively by the least square finite element method.
