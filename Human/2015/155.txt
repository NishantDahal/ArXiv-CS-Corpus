Design of a Novel Network Architecture for Distributed Event-Based Systems Using Directional Random Walks in an Ubiquitous Sensing Scenario

Ubiquitous sensing devices frequently disseminate data among them. The use of a distributed event-based system that decouples publishers from subscribers arises as an ideal candidate to implement the dissemination process. In this paper, we present a network architecture that merges the network and overlay layers of typical structured event-based systems. Directional random walks are used for the construction of this merged layer. Our strategy avoids using a specific network protocol that provides point-to-point communication. This implies that the topology of the network is not maintained, so that nodes not involved in the system are able to save energy and computing resources. We evaluate the performance of the overlay layer using directional random walks and pure random walks for its construction. Our results show that directional random walks are more efficient because: (1) they use less nodes of the network for the establishment of the active path of the overlay layer and (2) they have a more reliable performance. Furthermore, as the number of nodes in the network increases, so do the number of nodes in the active path of the overlay layer for the same number of publishers and subscribers. Finally, we discard any correlation between the number of nodes that form the overlay layer and the maximum Euclidean distance traversed by the walkers.
