Index reduction of differential algebraic equations by differential algebraic elimination

High index differential algebraic equations (DAEs) are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with constraints and arise frequently from many mathematical models of physical phenomenons and engineering fields. In this paper, we generalize the idea of differential elimination with Dixon resultant to polynomially nonlinear DAEs. We propose a new algorithm for index reduction of DAEs and establish the notion of differential algebraic elimination, which can provide the differential algebraic resultant of the enlarged system of original equations. To make use of structure of DAEs, variable pencil technique is given to determine the termination of differentiation. Moreover, we also provide a heuristics method for removing the extraneous factors from differential algebraic resultant. The experimentation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones for many examples taken from the literature.
