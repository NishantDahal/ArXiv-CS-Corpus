Cooperative Energy Trading in CoMP Systems Powered by Smart Grids

This paper studies the energy management in the coordinated multi-point (CoMP) systems powered by smart grids, where each base station (BS) with local renewable energy generation is allowed to implement the two-way energy trading with the grid. Due to the uneven renewable energy supply and communication energy demand over distributed BSs as well as the difference in the prices for their buying/selling energy from/to the gird, it is beneficial for the cooperative BSs to jointly manage their energy trading with the grid and energy consumption in CoMP based communication for reducing the total energy cost. Specifically, we consider the downlink transmission in one CoMP cluster by jointly optimizing the BSs' purchased/sold energy units from/to the grid and their cooperative transmit precoding, so as to minimize the total energy cost subject to the given quality of service (QoS) constraints for the users. First, we obtain the optimal solution to this problem by developing an algorithm based on techniques from convex optimization and the uplink-downlink duality. Next, we propose a sub-optimal solution of lower complexity than the optimal solution, where zero-forcing (ZF) based precoding is implemented at the BSs. Finally, through extensive simulations, we show the performance gain achieved by our proposed joint energy trading and communication cooperation schemes in terms of energy cost reduction, as compared to conventional schemes that separately design communication cooperation and energy trading.
