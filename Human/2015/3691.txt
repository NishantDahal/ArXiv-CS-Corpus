An Algorithm to Compute the Topological Euler Characteristic, Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson Class and Segre Class of Projective Varieties

Let $V$ be a closed subscheme of a projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$. We give an algorithm to compute the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class, Euler characteristic and Segre class of $ V$. The algorithm can be implemented using either symbolic or numerical methods. The algorithm is based on a new method for calculating the projective degrees of a rational map defined by a homogeneous ideal. Using this result and known formulas for the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class of a projective hypersurface and the Segre class of a projective variety in terms of the projective degrees of certain rational maps we give algorithms to compute the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class and Segre class of a projective variety. Since the Euler characteristic of $V$ is the degree of the zero dimensional component of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class of $V$ our algorithm also computes the Euler characteristic $Ï‡(V)$. Relationships between the algorithm developed here and other existing algorithms are discussed. The algorithm is tested on several examples and performs favourably compared to current algorithms for computing Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes, Segre classes and Euler characteristics.
