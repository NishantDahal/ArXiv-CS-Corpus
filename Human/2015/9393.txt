Information-Geometric Equivalence of Transportation Polytopes

This paper deals with transportation polytopes in the probability simplex (that is, sets of categorical bivariate probability distributions with prescribed marginals). Information projections between such polytopes are studied, and a sufficient condition is described under which these mappings are homeomorphisms.
