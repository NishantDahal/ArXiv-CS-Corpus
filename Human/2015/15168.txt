Millimeter Wave Power Transfer and Information Transmission

Compared to the existing lower frequency wireless power transfer, millimeter wave (mmWave) power transfer takes advantage of the high-dimensional multi-antenna and narrow beam transmission. In this paper we introduce wireless power transfer for mmWave cellular networks. Here, we consider users with large energy storage that are recharged by the mmWave base stations prior to uplink information transmission, and analyze the average harvested energy and average achievable rate. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and show that the serving base station plays a dominant role in wireless power transfer, and the contribution of the interference power from the interfering base stations is negligible, even when the interfering base stations are dense. By examining the average achievable rate in the uplink, when increasing the base station density, a transition from a noise-limited regime to an interference-limited regime is observed.
