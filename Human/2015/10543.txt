Optimal Pricing and Load Sharing for Energy Saving in Communications Cooperation

In this paper, we propose a pricing mechanism for the uplink communication cooperation to save the energy of mobile terminals (MTs) in wireless cellular network. Under the uncertainties of the other MTs' channel and battery conditions, a source MT in low battery level or bad channel condition is allowed to select and pay another MT in proximity to help forward its data package to the base station (BS). We formulate the source MT's pricing and load sharing problem as an optimization problem to minimize its expected energy cost. When the source MT cannot split its data package for a certain multimedia application, we motivate the selected relay MT to forward the whole data package by obtaining the optimal pricing through a dichotomous search algorithm. When the source MT can split the data package, we jointly optimize the pricing and load sharing with the relay MT and propose an alternating optimization algorithm that achieves near-optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to show that our proposed pricing mechanism can significantly decrease the source MT's expected energy cost, and load sharing is more cost-efficient when the size of the data package is large and the average number of helping MTs is small.
