The Capacity Region of the One-Sided Gaussian Interference Channel

The capacity region of the one-sided Gaussian interference channel is established in the weak interference regime. To characterize this region, a new representation of the Han-Kobayashi inner bound for the one-sided Gaussian interference channel is first given. Next, a new outer bound on the capacity region of this channel is introduced which is tight in the weak interference regime. This is the first capacity region for any variant of the interference channel in the weak interference regime.
