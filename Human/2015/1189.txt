Security of Power Packet Dispatching Using Differential Chaos Shift Keying

This paper investigates and confirms one advantageous function of a power packet dispatching system, which has been proposed by authors' group with being apart from the conventional power distribution system. Here is focused on the function to establish the security of power packet dispatching for prohibiting not only information but also power of power packet from being stolen by attackers. For the purpose of protecting power packets, we introduce a simple encryption of power packets before sending them. Encryption scheme based on chaotic signal is one possibility for this purpose. This paper adopts the Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) scheme for the encryption, those are partial power packet encryption and whole power packet encryption.
