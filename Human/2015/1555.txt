Where's My Drink? Enabling Peripheral Real World Interactions While Using HMDs

Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) allow users to experience virtual reality with a great level of immersion. However, even simple physical tasks like drinking a beverage can be difficult and awkward while in a virtual reality experience. We explore mixed reality renderings that selectively incorporate the physical world into the virtual world for interactions with physical objects. We conducted a user study comparing four rendering techniques that balances immersion in a virtual world with ease of interaction with the physical world. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of each approach, suggesting guidelines for future rendering techniques that bring physical objects into virtual reality.
