Complete Weight Enumerator of a Family of Linear Codes from Cyclotomy

Linear codes have been an interesting topic in both theory and practice for many years. In this paper, for a prime $p$, we determine the explicit complete weight enumerators of a family of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_p$ with defining set related to cyclotomy. These codes may have applications in cryptography and secret sharing schemes.
