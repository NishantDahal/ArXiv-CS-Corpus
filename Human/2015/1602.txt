Geometric Spanning Cycles in Bichromatic Point Sets

Given a set of points in the plane each colored either red or blue, we find non-self-intersecting geometric spanning cycles of the red points and of the blue points such that each edge of the red spanning cycle is crossed at most three times by the blue spanning cycle and vice-versa.
