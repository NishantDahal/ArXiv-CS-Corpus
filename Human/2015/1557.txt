ICR: Iterative Convex Refinement for Sparse Signal Recovery Using Spike and Slab Priors

In this letter, we address sparse signal recovery using spike and slab priors. In particular, we focus on a Bayesian framework where sparsity is enforced on reconstruction coefficients via probabilistic priors. The optimization resulting from spike and slab prior maximization is known to be a hard non-convex problem, and existing solutions involve simplifying assumptions and/or relaxations. We propose an approach called Iterative Convex Refinement (ICR) that aims to solve the aforementioned optimization problem directly allowing for greater generality in the sparse structure. Essentially, ICR solves a sequence of convex optimization problems such that sequence of solutions converges to a sub-optimal solution of the original hard optimization problem. We propose two versions of our algorithm: a.) an unconstrained version, and b.) with a non-negativity constraint on sparse coefficients, which may be required in some real-world problems. Experimental validation is performed on both synthetic data and for a real-world image recovery problem, which illustrates merits of ICR over state of the art alternatives.
