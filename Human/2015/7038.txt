Best of both worlds? Simultaneous evaluation of researchers and their works

This paper explores a dual score system that simultaneously evaluates the relative importance of researchers and their works. It is a modification of the CITEX algorithm recently described in Pal and Ruj (2015). Using available publication data for $m$ author keywords (as a proxy for researchers) and $n$ papers it is possible to construct a $m \times n$ author-paper feature matrix. This is further combined with citation data to construct a HITS-like algorithm that iteratively satisfies two criteria: first, \emph{a good author is cited by good authors}, and second, \emph{a good paper is cited by good authors}. Following Pal and Ruj, the resulting algorithm produces an author eigenscore and a paper eigenscore. The algorithm is tested on 213,530 citable publications listed under Thomson ISI's "\emph{Information Science \& Library Science}" JCR category from 1980--2012.
