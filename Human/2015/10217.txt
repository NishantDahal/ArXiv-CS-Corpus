Quantum Codes from Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes and Matrix-Product Codes

One of the central tasks in quantum error-correction is to construct quantum codes that have good parameters. In this paper, we construct three new classes of quantum MDS codes from classical Hermitian self-orthogonal generalized Reed-Solomon codes. We also present some classes of quantum codes from matrix-product codes. It turns out that many of our quantum codes are new in the sense that the parameters of quantum codes cannot be obtained from all previous constructions.
