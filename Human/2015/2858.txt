A Rice-like theorem for primitive recursive functions

We provide an explicit characterization of the properties of primitive recursive functions that are decidable or semi-decidable, given a primitive recursive index for the function. The result is much more general as it applies to any c.e. class of total computable functions. This is an analog of Rice and Rice-Shapiro theorem, for restricted classes of total computable functions.
