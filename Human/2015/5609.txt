Advances in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology: Don't take them too seriously anyway

In the last few decades or so, we witness a paradigm shift in our nature studies - from a data-processing based computational approach to an information-processing based cognitive approach. The process is restricted and often misguided by the lack of a clear understanding about what information is and how it should be treated in research applications (in general) and in biological studies (in particular). The paper intend to provide some remedies for this bizarre situation.
