A logarithmically completely monotonic function involving the ratio of gamma functions

In the paper, the authors concisely survey and review some functions involving the gamma function and its various ratios, simply state their logarithmically complete monotonicity and related results, and find necessary and sufficient conditions for a new function involving the ratio of two gamma functions and originating from the coding gain to be logarithmically completely monotonic.
