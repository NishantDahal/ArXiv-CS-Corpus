Geometry of Resource Interaction - A Minimalist Approach

The Resource $位$-calculus is a variation of the $位$-calculus where arguments can be superposed and must be linearly used. Hence it is a model for linear and non-deterministic programming languages, and the target language of Ehrhard-Taylor expansion of $位$-terms. In a strictly typed restriction of the Resource $位$-calculus, we study the notion of path persistence, and we define a Geometry of Interaction that characterises it, is invariant under reduction, and counts addends in normal forms.
