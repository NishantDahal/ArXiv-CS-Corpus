Position Paper: Provenance Data Visualisation for Neuroimaging Analysis

Visualisation facilitates the understanding of scientific data both through exploration and explanation of visualised data. Provenance contributes to the understanding of data by containing the contributing factors behind a result. With the significant increase in data volumes and algorithm complexity, clinical researchers are struggling with information tracking, analysis reproducibility and the verification of scientific output. Data coming from various heterogeneous sources (multiple sources with varying level of trust) in a collaborative environment adds to the uncertainty of the scientific output. Systems are required that offer provenance data capture and visualisation support for analyses. We present an account for the need to visualise provenance information in order to aid the process of verification of scientific outputs, comparison of analyses,progression and evolution of results for neuroimaging analysis.
