Extended inequalities for weighted Renyi entropy involving generalized Gaussian densities

In this paper the author analyses the weighted Renyi entropy in order to derive several inequalities in weighted case. Furthermore, using the proposed notions $α$-th generalized derivation and ($α$; p)-th weighted Fisher information, extended versions of the moment-entropy, Fisher information and Cramer-Rao inequalities in terms of generalized Gaussian densities are given.
