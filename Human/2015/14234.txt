Parameterizing the Permanent: Genus, Apices, Minors, Evaluation mod 2^k

We identify and study relevant structural parameters for the problem PerfMatch of counting perfect matchings in a given input graph $G$. These generalize the well-known tractable planar case, and they include the genus of $G$, its apex number (the minimum number of vertices whose removal renders $G$ planar), and its Hadwiger number (the size of a largest clique minor).
  To study these parameters, we first introduce the notion of combined matchgates, a general technique that bridges parameterized counting problems and the theory of so-called Holants and matchgates: Using combined matchgates, we can simulate certain non-existing gadgets $F$ as linear combinations of $t=O(1)$ existing gadgets. If a graph $G$ features $k$ occurrences of $F$, we can then reduce $G$ to $t^k$ graphs that feature only existing gadgets, thus enabling parameterized reductions.
  As applications of this technique, we simplify known $4^g n^{O(1)}$ time algorithms for PerfMatch on graphs of genus $g$. Orthogonally to this, we show #W[1]-hardness of the permanent on $k$-apex graphs, implying its #W[1]-hardness under the Hadwiger number. Additionally, we rule out $n^{o(k/\log k)}$ time algorithms under the counting exponential-time hypothesis #ETH.
  Finally, we use combined matchgates to prove parity-W[1]-hardness of evaluating the permanent modulo $2^k$, complementing an $O(n^{4k-3})$ time algorithm by Valiant and answering an open question of Björklund. We also obtain a lower bound of $n^{Ω(k/\log k)}$ under the parity version of the exponential-time hypothesis.
