Quality of Experience (QoE) beyond Quality of Service (QoS) as its baseline: QoE at the Interface of Experience Domains

In this work, a new approach to the definition of the quality of experience is presented. By considering the quality of service as a baseline, that portion of the QoE that can be inferred from the QoS is excluded, and then the rest of the QoE is approached with the notion of QoE at a Boundary (QoEaaB). With the QoEaaB as the core of the proposed approach, various potential boundaries, and their associated unseen opportunities to improve the QoE are discussed. In particular, property, contract, SLA, and content are explored in terms of their boundaries and also their associated QoEaaB. With an interest in online video delivery, management of resource sharing and isolation associated with multi-tenant operations is considered. It is concluded that the proposed QoEaaB can bring a new perspective in QoE modeling and assessment toward a more enriched approach to improving the experience based on innovation and deep connectivity among actors.
