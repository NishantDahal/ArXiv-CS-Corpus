Oblivious Transfer Protocol with Verification

Although random sequences can be used to generate probability events, they come with the risk of cheating in an unsupervised situation. In such cases, the oblivious transfer protocol may be used and this paper presents a variation to the DH key-exchange to serve as this protocol. A method to verify the correctness of the procedure, without revealing the random numbers used by the two parties, is also proposed.
