Optimal Encoding Capacity of a Linear Optical Quantum Channel

Here, we study the capacity of a quantum channel, assuming linear optical encoding, as a function of available photons and optical modes. First, we observe that substantial improvement is made possible by not restricting ourselves to a rail-encoded qubit basis. Then, we derive an analytic formula for general channel capacity and show that this capacity is achieved without requiring the use of entangling operations typically required for scalable universal quantum computation, e.g. KLM measurement-assisted transformations. As an example, we provide an explicit encoding scheme using the resources required of standard dense coding using two dual-rail qubits (2 photons in 4 modes). In this case, our protocol encodes one additional bit of information. Greater gains are expected for larger systems.
