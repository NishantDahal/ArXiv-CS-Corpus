Enhance Robustness of Image-in-Image Watermarking through Data Partitioning

Vulnerability of watermarking schemes against intense signal processing attacks is generally a major concern, particularly when there are techniques to reproduce an acceptable copy of the original signal with no chance for detecting the watermark. In this paper, we propose a two-layer, data partitioning (DP) based, image in image watermarking method in the DCT domain to improve the watermark detection performance. Truncated singular value decomposition, binary wavelet decomposition and spatial scalability idea in H.264/SVC are analyzed and employed as partitioning methods. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms its two recent competitors in terms of both data payload and robustness to intense attacks.
