Real scenario and simulations on GLOSA traffic light system for reduced CO2 emissions, waiting time and travel time

Cooperative ITS is enabling vehicles to communicate with the infrastructure to provide improvements in traffic control. A promising approach consists in anticipating the road profile and the upcoming dynamic events like traffic lights. This topic has been addressed in the French public project Co-Drive through functions developed by Valeo named Green Light Optimal Speed Advisor (GLOSA). The system advises the optimal speed to pass the next traffic light without stopping. This paper presents results of its performance in different scenarios through simulations and real driving measurements. A scaling is done in an urban area, with different penetration rates in vehicle and infrastructure equipment for vehicular communication. Our simulation results indicate that GLOSA can reduce CO2 emissions, waiting time and travel time, both in experimental conditions and in real traffic conditions.
