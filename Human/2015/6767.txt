Performance Improvement for Papr Reduction in Lte Downlink System with Elliptic Filtering

This paper is concerned with the performance improvement of PAPR reduction of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal using amplitude clipping & filtering based design. Note that OFDM is one of the well adept multi-carrier multiplexing transmission scheme which has been implemented in long term evolution (LTE) downlink. Nonetheless peak to average power ratio (PAPR) is the more rattling problem with OFDM, consequently in this paper a reduction procedure of the PAPR by using amplitude clipping and filtering is proposed. Here we used IIR bandpass elliptic filter after amplitude clipping to reduce the PAPR. The performance of the system in terms of bit error rate (BER) is also canvased as a new filter based clipping method. Our results show that the proposed methodology of clipping method with the IIR elliptic band pass filter significantly reduces the PAPR value.
