Java Implementation of a Parameter-less Evolutionary Portfolio

The Java implementation of a portfolio of parameter-less evolutionary algorithms is presented. The Parameter-less Evolutionary Portfolio implements a heuristic that performs adaptive selection of parameter-less evolutionary algorithms in accordance with performance criteria that are measured during running time. At present time, the portfolio includes three parameter-less evolutionary algorithms: Parameter-less Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm, Parameter-less Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm, and Parameter-less Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization Algorithm. Initial experiments showed that the parameter-less portfolio can solve various classes of problems without the need for any prior parameter setting technique and with an increase in computational effort that can be considered acceptable.
