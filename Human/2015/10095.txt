Preprint Virtual Reality Based GIS Analysis Platform

This is the preprint version of our paper on ICONIP2015. The proposed platform supports the integrated VRGIS functions including 3D spatial analysis functions, 3D visualization for spatial process and serves for 3D globe and digital city. The 3D analysis and visualization of the concerned city massive information are conducted in the platform. The amount of information that can be visualized with this platform is overwhelming, and the GIS based navigational scheme allows to have great flexibility to access the different available data sources.
