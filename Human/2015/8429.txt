Tracking A Dynamic Sparse Channel Via Differential Orthogonal Matching Pursuit

This paper considers the problem of tracking a dynamic sparse channel in a broadband wireless communication system. A probabilistic signal model is firstly proposed to describe the special features of temporal correlations of dynamic sparse channels: path delays change slowly over time, while path gains evolve faster. Based on such temporal correlations, we then propose the differential orthogonal matching pursuit (D-OMP) algorithm to track a dynamic sparse channel in a sequential way by updating the small channel variation over time. Compared with other channel tracking algorithms, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed D-OMP algorithm can track dynamic sparse channels faster with improved accuracy.
