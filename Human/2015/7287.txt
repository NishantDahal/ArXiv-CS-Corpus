BoWFire: Detection of Fire in Still Images by Integrating Pixel Color and Texture Analysis

Emergency events involving fire are potentially harmful, demanding a fast and precise decision making. The use of crowdsourcing image and videos on crisis management systems can aid in these situations by providing more information than verbal/textual descriptions. Due to the usual high volume of data, automatic solutions need to discard non-relevant content without losing relevant information. There are several methods for fire detection on video using color-based models. However, they are not adequate for still image processing, because they can suffer on high false-positive results. These methods also suffer from parameters with little physical meaning, which makes fine tuning a difficult task. In this context, we propose a novel fire detection method for still images that uses classification based on color features combined with texture classification on superpixel regions. Our method uses a reduced number of parameters if compared to previous works, easing the process of fine tuning the method. Results show the effectiveness of our method of reducing false-positives while its precision remains compatible with the state-of-the-art methods.
