Product Construction of Affine Codes

Binary matrix codes with restricted row and column weights are a desirable method of coded modulation for power line communication. In this work, we construct such matrix codes that are obtained as products of affine codes - cosets of binary linear codes. Additionally, the constructions have the property that they are systematic. Subsequently, we generalize our construction to irregular product of affine codes, where the component codes are affine codes of different rates.
