Algorithm for estimating swirl angles in multi-intake hydraulic sumps

The paper has been withdrawn effective November 18, 2015.

Hydraulic Pump sumps are designed to provide a swirl free flow to the pump. The degree of swirl is measured in physical model tests using a swirl meter and a quantity known as swirl angle is generally measured. The present paper presents a novel method to compute the bulk swirl angle using the local velocity field obtained from computational fluid dynamics data. The basis for the present method is the conservation of angular momentum conservation. By carrying out both numerical and experimental studies the novel swirl angle calculation method is validated. Further the effect of vortex suppression devices in reducing the swirl angle is also demonstrated.
