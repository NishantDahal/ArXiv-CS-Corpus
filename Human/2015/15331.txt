A Survey on Security in Named Data Networking

Over the past three decades, since its invention, the Internet has evolved in both its sheer volume and usage. The Internet's core protocol, Internet Protocol (IP), has proven its usability and effectiveness to support a communication network. However, current Internet usage requires more than a communication network due to a shift in the nature of Internet applications from simple email application to large content producers such as NetFlix, Google, Amazon, etc. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the few initiatives/projects addressing the shortcomings of the current Internet architecture and intends to move the Internet toward a content distribution architecture. In this paper, we conduct a brief survey of security topics/problems inherent to the NDN architecture. Specifically, we describe current known problems and propose solutions to major security problems.
