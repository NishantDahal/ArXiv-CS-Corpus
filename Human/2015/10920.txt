Preprint: Intuitive Evaluation of Kinect2 based Balance Measurement Software

This is the preprint version of our paper on REHAB2015. A balance measurement software based on Kinect2 sensor is evaluated by comparing to golden standard balance measure platform intuitively. The software analysis the tracked body data from the user by Kinect2 sensor and get user's center of mass(CoM) as well as its motion route on a plane. The software is evaluated by several comparison tests, the evaluation results preliminarily prove the reliability of the software.
