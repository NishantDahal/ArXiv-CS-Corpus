Relay Divide & Rule Technique to Solve Energy Hole Problem for Wireless Sensor Network

In remote sensor system, sensor hubs have the restricted battery power, so to use the vitality in a more productive manner a few creator's created a few strategies, yet at the same time there is have to decrease the vitality utilization of hubs. In this paper, we presented another method called as 'Partition and Rule strategy' to unravel the scope dividing so as to open the system field into subfield and next maintain a strategic distance from the vitality gap issue with the assistance of static bunching. Essentially, in gap and run plan system range is isolated into three locales to be specific internal, center and external to conquer the issue of vitality utilization. We execute this work in NS-2 and our recreation results demonstrate that our system is far superior than old procedures.
