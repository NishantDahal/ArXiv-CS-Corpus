64-APSK Constellation and Mapping Optimization for Satellite Broadcasting Using Genetic Algorithms

DVB-S2 and DVB-SH satellite broadcasting standards currently deploy 16- and 32-amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) modulation using the consultative committee for space data systems (CCSDS) mapping. Such standards also include hierarchical modulation as a mean to provide unequal error protection in highly variable channels over satellite. Foreseeing the increasing need for higher data rates, this paper tackles the optimization of 64-APSK constellations to minimize the mean square error between the original and received symbol. Optimization is performed according to the sensitivity of the data to the channel errors, by means of genetic algorithms, a well-known technique currently used in a variety of application domains, when close form solutions are impractical. Test results show that through non-uniform constellation and asymmetric symbol mapping, it is possible to significantly reduce the distortion while preserving bandwidth efficiency. Tests performed on real signals based on perceptual quality measurements allow validating the proposed scheme against conventional 64-APSK constellations and CCSDS mapping.
