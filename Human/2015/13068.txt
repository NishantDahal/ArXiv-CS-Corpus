Optimal Concentration of Information Content For Log-Concave Densities

An elementary proof is provided of sharp bounds for the varentropy of random vectors with log-concave densities, as well as for deviations of the information content from its mean. These bounds significantly improve on the bounds obtained by Bobkov and Madiman ({\it Ann. Probab.}, 39(4):1528--1543, 2011).
