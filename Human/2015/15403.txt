Highly Dynamic Spectrum Management within Licensed Shared Access Regulatory Framework

Historical fragmentation in spectrum access models accentuates the need for novel concepts that allow for efficient sharing of already available but underutilized spectrum. The emerging Licensed Shared Access (LSA) regulatory framework is expected to enable more advanced spectrum sharing between a limited number of users while guaranteeing their much needed interference protection. However, the ultimate benefits of LSA may in practice be constrained by space-time availability of the LSA bands. Hence, more dynamic LSA spectrum management is required to leverage such real-time variability and sustain reliability when e.g., the original spectrum user suddenly revokes the previously granted frequency bands as they are required again. In this article, we maintain the vision of highly dynamic LSA architecture and rigorously study its future potential: from reviewing market opportunities and discussing available technology implementations to conducting performance evaluation of LSA dynamics and outlining the standardization landscape. Our investigations are based on a comprehensive system-level evaluation framework, which has been specifically designed to assess highly dynamic LSA deployments.
