Q-caching: an integrated reinforcement-learning approach for caching and routing in information-centric networks

Content delivery, such as video streaming, is one of the most prevalent Internet applications. Although very popular, the continuous growth of such applications poses novel performance and scalability challenges. Information-centric networks put content at the center, and propose novel solutions to such challenges but also pose new questions on the interface between caching and routing. In this paper, building on top of Q-routing we propose a caching strategy, namely Q-caching, which leverages information that is already collected by the routing algorithm. Q-caching promotes content diversity in the network, reducing the load at custodians and average download times for clients. In stylized topologies, we show that the gains of Q-caching against state-of-the-art algorithms are significant. We then consider the RNP topology, and show that Q-caching performance is more flexible while competitive when compared against existing algorithms.
