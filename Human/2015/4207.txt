Socializing Autonomous Units with the Reflexive Game Theory and Resonate-and-Fire neurons

In this study the concept of reflexia is applied to modeling behavior of autonomous units. The relationship between reflexia, on the one hand, and mirror neuron system and perception of emotions, on the other hand, is introduced. The main method of using reflexia in a group of autonomous units is Reflexive Game Theory (RGT). To embody RGT in a group of autonomous agents a communication system is employed. This communication system uses frequency domain multiplexing by means of Izhikevich's resonate-and-fire neural models. The result of socialization of autonomous units by means of RGT and communication system is illustrated in several examples.
