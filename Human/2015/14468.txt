Priori-Information Aided Iterative Hard Threshold: A Low-Complexity High-Accuracy Compressive Sensing Based Channel Estimation for TDS-OFDM

This paper develops a low-complexity channel estimation (CE) scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) for time-domain synchronous (TDS) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to overcome the performance loss under doubly selective fading channels. Specifically, an overlap-add method of the time-domain training sequence is first proposed to obtain the coarse estimates of the channel length, path delays and path gains of the wireless channel, by exploiting the channel's temporal correlation to improve the robustness of the coarse CE under the severe fading channel with long delay spread. We then propose the priori-information aided (PA) iterative hard threshold (IHT) algorithm, which utilizes the priori information of the acquired coarse estimate for the wireless channel and therefore is capable of obtaining an accurate channel estimate of the doubly selective fading channel. Compared with the classical IHT algorithm whose convergence requires the $l_2$ norm of the measurement matrix being less than 1, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm exploits the priori information acquired to remove such a limitation as well as to reduce the number of required iterations. Compared with the existing CS based CE method for TDS-OFDM, the proposed PA-IHT algorithm significantly reduces the computational complexity of CE as well as enhances the CE accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that, without sacrificing spectral efficiency and changing the current TDS-OFDM signal structure, the proposed scheme performs better than the existing CE schemes for TDS-OFDM in various scenarios, especially under severely doubly selective fading channels.
