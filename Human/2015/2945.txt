Designing and Building a Three-dimensional Projective Scanner for Smartphones

One of the frustrating things in the digital fabrication era is that its media are neither affordable nor easily accessible and usable. Three-dimensional (3D) fabrication media (DFM) such as 3D Printers and 3D Scanners have experienced an upsurge in popularity, while the latter remain expensive and hard to function. With this paper, we aim to present you the RhoScanner Project - a an affordable and efficient Three-dimensional Projective Scanner for Smart-phones, hence shedding light on the extended capabilities of digital fabrication media on popular use.
