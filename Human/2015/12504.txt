Evaluating the Competency of a First-Order Ontology

We report on the results of evaluating the competency of a first-order ontology for its use with automated theorem provers (ATPs). The evaluation follows the adaptation of the methodology based on competency questions (CQs) [Grüninger&Fox,1995] to the framework of first-order logic, which is presented in [Álvez&Lucio&Rigau,2015], and is applied to Adimen-SUMO [Álvez&Lucio&Rigau,2015]. The set of CQs used for this evaluation has been automatically generated from a small set of semantic patterns and the mapping of WordNet to SUMO. Analysing the results, we can conclude that it is feasible to use ATPs for working with Adimen-SUMO v2.4, enabling the resolution of goals by means of performing non-trivial inferences.
