Reliable Broadcast to A User Group with Limited Source Transmissions

In order to reduce the number of retransmissions and save power for the source node, we propose a two-phase coded scheme to achieve reliable broadcast from the source to a group of users with minimal source transmissions. In the first phase, the information packets are encoded with batched sparse (BATS) code, which are then broadcasted by the source node until the file can be cooperatively decoded by the user group. In the second phase, each user broadcasts the re-encoded packets to its peers based on their respective received packets from the first phase, so that the file can be decoded by each individual user. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed and the rank distribution at the moment of decoding is derived, which is used as input for designing the optimal BATS code. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the total number of retransmissions compared with the traditional single-phase broadcast with optimal erasure codes. Furthermore, since a large number of transmissions are shifted from the source node to the users, power consumptions at the source node is significantly reduced.
