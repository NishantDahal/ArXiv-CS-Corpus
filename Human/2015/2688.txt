Linear Codes from Some 2-Designs

A classical method of constructing a linear code over $\gf(q)$ with a $t$-design is to use the incidence matrix of the $t$-design as a generator matrix over $\gf(q)$ of the code. This approach has been extensively investigated in the literature. In this paper, a different method of constructing linear codes using specific classes of $2$-designs is studied, and linear codes with a few weights are obtained from almost difference sets, difference sets, and a type of $2$-designs associated to semibent functions. Two families of the codes obtained in this paper are optimal. The linear codes presented in this paper have applications in secret sharing and authentication schemes, in addition to their applications in consumer electronics, communication and data storage systems. A coding-theory approach to the characterisation of highly nonlinear Boolean functions is presented.
