Using Pi-calculus to Model Dynamic Web Services Composition Based on the Authority Model

There are lots of research works on web service, composition, modeling, verification and other problems. Theses research works are done on the basis of formal methods, such as petri-net, pi-calculus, automata theory, and so on. Pi-calculus is a natural vehicle to model mobility aspect in dynamic web services composition (DWSC). However, it has recently been shown that pi-calculus needs to be extended suitably to specify and verify DWSC. In this paper, we considers the authority model for DWSC, extends pi-calculus in order to model dynamic attributes of system, and proposes a automatic method for modeling DWSC based on extended pi-calculus.
