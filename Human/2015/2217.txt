Cognitive Learning of Statistical Primary Patterns via Bayesian Network

In cognitive radio (CR) technology, the trend of sensing is no longer to only detect the presence of active primary users. A large number of applications demand for more comprehensive knowledge on primary user behaviors in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the statistical relationship among primary users by introducing a Bayesian network (BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing issue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community. Besides, another key problem in this learning scenario is that the CR has to identify how many variables are in the BN, which is usually considered as prior knowledge in statistical learning applications. To solve such two issues simultaneously, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme consisting of an efficient structure learning algorithm and a blind variable identification scheme. The proposed approach incurs significantly lower computational complexity compared with previous ones, and is capable of determining the structure without assuming much prior knowledge about variables. With this result, cognitive users could efficiently understand the statistical pattern of primary networks, such that more efficient cognitive protocols could be designed across different network layers.
