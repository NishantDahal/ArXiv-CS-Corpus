Towards Security of Additive Layer Manufacturing

Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM), also broadly known as 3D printing, is a new technology to produce 3D objects. As an opposite approach to the conventional subtractive manufacturing process, 3D objects are created by adding thin material layers over layers. Until recently, they have been used, mainly, for plastic models. However, the technology has evolved making it possible to use high-quality printing with metal alloys. Agencies and companies like NASA, ESA, Boeing, Airbus, etc. are investigating various ALM technology application areas. Recently, SpaceX used additive manufacturing to produce engine chambers for the newest Dragon spacecraft. BAE System plans to print on-demand a complete Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), depending on the operational requirements. Companies expect the implementation of ALM technology will bring a broad variety of technological and economic benefits. This includes, but not limited to, the reduction of the time needed to produce complex parts, reduction of wasted material and thus control of production costs along with minimization of part storage space as companies implement just-in-time and on-demand production solutions. The broad variety of application areas and a high grade of computerization of the manufacturing process will inevitably make ALM an attractive target for various attacks.
