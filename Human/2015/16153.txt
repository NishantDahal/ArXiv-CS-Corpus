Robust frequency offset estimator for OFDM over fast varying multipath channel

This paper presents a robust carrier frequency offset(CFO) estimation algorithm suitable for fast varying multipath channels. The proposed algorithm estimates CFO both in time-domain and frequency-domain using two carefully designed sequences. This novel technique possesses high accuracy as well as large estimation range and works well in fast varying channels.
