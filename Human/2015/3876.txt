A New Secure Mobile Cloud Architecture

The demand and use of mobile phones, PDAs and smart phones are constantly on the rise as such, manufacturers of these devices are improving the technology and usability of these devices constantly. Due to the handy shape and size these devices come in, their processing capabilities and functionalities, they are preferred by many over the conventional desktop or laptop computers. Mobile devices are being used today to perform most tasks that a desktop or laptop computer could be used for. On this premise, mobile devices are also used to connect to the resources of cloud computing hence, mobile cloud computing (MCC). The seemingly ubiquitous and pervasive nature of most mobile devices has made it acceptable and adequate to match the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of cloud computing. Mobile cloud computing is said to have increased the challenges known to cloud computing due to the security loop holes that most mobile devices have.
