Mining Essential Relationships under Multiplex Networks

In big data times, massive datasets often carry different relationships among the same group of nodes, analyzing on these heterogeneous relationships may give us a window to peek the essential relationships among nodes. In this paper, first of all we propose a new metric "similarity rate" in order to capture the changing rate of similarities between node-pairs though all networks; secondly, we try to use this new metric to uncover essential relationships between node-pairs which essential relationships are often hidden and hard to get. From experiments study of Indonesian Terrorists dataset, this new metric similarity rate function well for giving us a way to uncover essential relationships from lots of appearances.
