A comparative study between proposed Hyper Kurtosis based Modified Duo-Histogram Equalization (HKMDHE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for Contrast Enhancement Purpose of Low Contrast Human Brain CT scan images

In this paper, a comparative study between proposed hyper kurtosis based modified duo-histogram equalization (HKMDHE) algorithm and contrast limited adaptive histogram enhancement (CLAHE) has been presented for the implementation of contrast enhancement and brightness preservation of low contrast human brain CT scan images. In HKMDHE algorithm, contrast enhancement is done on the hyper-kurtosis based application. The results are very promising of proposed HKMDHE technique with improved PSNR values and lesser AMMBE values than CLAHE technique.
