Proton Conducting Graphene Oxide Coupled Neuron Transistors for Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems

Neuron is the most important building block in our brain, and information processing in individual neuron involves the transformation of input synaptic spike trains into an appropriate output spike train. Hardware implementation of neuron by individual ionic/electronic hybrid device is of great significance for enhancing our understanding of the brain and solving sensory processing and complex recognition tasks. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle artificial neuron based on a proton conducting graphene oxide (GO) coupled oxide-based electric-double-layer (EDL) transistor with multiple driving inputs and one modulatory input terminal. Paired-pulse facilitation, dendritic integration and orientation tuning were successfully emulated. Additionally, neuronal gain control (arithmetic) in the scheme of rate coding is also experimentally demonstrated. Our results provide a new-concept approach for building brain-inspired cognitive systems.
