User Mobility Evaluation for 5G Small Cell Networks Based on Individual Mobility Model

With small cell networks becoming core parts of the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks, it is an important problem to evaluate the impact of user mobility on 5G small cell networks. However, the tendency and clustering habits in human activities have not been considered in traditional user mobility models. In this paper, human tendency and clustering behaviors are first considered to evaluate the user mobility performance for 5G small cell networks based on individual mobility model (IMM). As key contributions, user pause probability, user arrival and departure probabilities are derived in this paper for evaluat-ing the user mobility performance in a hotspot-type 5G small cell network. Furthermore, coverage probabilities of small cell and macro cell BSs are derived for all users in 5G small cell networks, respectively. Compared with the traditional random waypoint (RWP) model, IMM provides a different viewpoint to investigate the impact of human tendency and clustering behaviors on the performance of 5G small cell networks.
