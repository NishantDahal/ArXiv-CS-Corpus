Enabling Multiple QR Codes in Close Proximity

Quick response codes - 2D patterns that can be scanned to access online resources - are being used in a variety of industrial and consumer applications. However, it is problematic to use multiple QR codes in close proximity: scans can fail or result in access to the wrong resource. While this problem is, strictly speaking, due to the design of the scanning software, the very large number of extant scanning applications makes changing the software a difficult logistical challenge. Instead, we describe the design of a new type of QR code that not only enables the use of multiple QR codes in close proximity, but also is compatible with existing scanning solutions. In an evaluation with 20 users, it was found that the new QR codes were as usable as traditional ones, and that they were superior for selecting one code from many. Users did have initial difficulty in discovering how to use the new QR code, so further work is required on that front. We conclude with a discussion of the pros and cons of pQR codes.
