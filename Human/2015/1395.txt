Study of a Robust Algorithm Applied in the Optimal Position Tuning for the Camera Lens in Automated Visual Inspection Systems

This paper present the mathematical fundaments and experimental study of an algorithm used to find the optimal position for the camera lens to obtain a maximum of details. This information can be further applied to a appropriate system to automatically correct this position. The algorithm is based on the evaluation of a so called resolution function who calculates the maximum of gradient in a certain zone of the image. The paper also presents alternative forms of the function, results of measurements and set up a set of practical rules for the right application of the algorithm.
