Composition in the Function-Behaviour-Structure Framework

We introduce composition in the function-behaviour-structure framework for design, as described by John Gero, in order to deal with complexity. We do this by connecting the frameworks for the design of several models, in which one is constrained by the others. The result is a framework for the design of an object that supports modularity. This framework can easily be extended for the design of an object with more than one layer of modularity.
