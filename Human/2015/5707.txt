An Examination of the Effectiveness of Teaching Data Modelling Concepts

The effective teaching of data modelling concepts is very important; it constitutes the fundament of database planning methods and the handling of databases with the help of database management lan-guages, typically SQL. We examined three courses. The students of two courses prepared for the exam by solving tests, while the students of the third course prepared by solving tasks from a printed exercise book. The number of task for the second course was 2.5 times more than the number of task for the first course. The main purpose of our examination was to determine the effectiveness of the teaching of data modelling concepts, and to decide if there is a significant difference between the results of the three courses. According to our examination, with increasing the number of test tasks and with the use of exercise book, the results became significantly better.
