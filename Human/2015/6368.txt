Reflections on organization, emergence, and control in sociotechnical systems

Human and artificial organizations may be described as networks of interacting parts. Those parts exchange data and control information and, as a result of these interactions, organizations produce emergent behaviors and purposes -- traits the characterize "the whole" as "greater than the sum of its parts". In this chapter it is argued that, rather than a static and immutable property, emergence should be interpreted as the result of dynamic interactions between forces of opposite sign: centripetal (positive) forces strengthening emergence by consolidating the whole and centrifugal (negative) forces that weaken the social persona and as such are detrimental to emergence. The result of this interaction is called in this chapter as "quality of emergence". This problem is discussed in the context of a particular class of organizations: conventional hierarchies. We highlight how traditional designs produce behaviors that may severely impact the quality of emergence. Finally we discuss a particular class of organizations that do not suffer from the limitations typical of strict hierarchies and result in greater quality of emergence. In some case, however, these enhancements are counterweighted by a reduced degree of controllability and verifiability.
