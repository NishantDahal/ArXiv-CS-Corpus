Approximating the Integral Fréchet Distance

A pseudo-polynomial time $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm is presented for computing the integral and average Fréchet distance between two given polygonal curves $T_1$ and $T_2$. In particular, the running time is upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}( ζ^{4}n^4/\varepsilon^{2})$ where $n$ is the complexity of $T_1$ and $T_2$ and $ζ$ is the maximal ratio of the lengths of any pair of segments from $T_1$ and $T_2$. The Fréchet distance captures the minimal cost of a continuous deformation of $T_1$ into $T_2$ and vice versa and defines the cost of a deformation as the maximal distance between two points that are related. The integral Fréchet distance defines the cost of a deformation as the integral of the distances between points that are related. The average Fréchet distance is defined as the integral Fréchet distance divided by the lengths of $T_1$ and $T_2$.
  Furthermore, we give relations between weighted shortest paths inside a single parameter cell $C$ and the monotone free space axis of $C$. As a result we present a simple construction of weighted shortest paths inside a parameter cell. Additionally, such a shortest path provides an optimal solution for the partial Fréchet similarity of segments for all leash lengths. These two aspects are related to each other and are of independent interest.
