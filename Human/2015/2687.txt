A Class of Two-Weight and Three-Weight Codes and Their Applications in Secret Sharing

In this paper, a class of two-weight and three-weight linear codes over $\gf(p)$ is constructed, and their application in secret sharing is investigated. Some of the linear codes obtained are optimal in the sense that they meet certain bounds on linear codes. These codes have applications also in authentication codes, association schemes, and strongly regular graphs, in addition to their applications in consumer electronics, communication and data storage systems.
