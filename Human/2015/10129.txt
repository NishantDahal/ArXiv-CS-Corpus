A Reliable User Authentication and Data Protection Model in Cloud Computing Environments

Security issues are the most challenging problems in cloud computing environments as an emerging technology. Regarding to this importance, an efficient and reliable user authentication and data protection model has been presented in this paper to increase the rate of reliability cloud-based environments. Accordingly, two encryption procedures have been established in an independent middleware (Agent) to perform the process of user authentication, access control, and data protection in cloud servers. AES has been used as a symmetric cryptography algorithm in cloud servers and RSA has been used as an asymmetric cryptography algorithm in Agent servers. The theoretical evaluation of the proposed model shows that the ability of resistance in face with possible attacks and unpredictable events has been enhanced considerably in comparison with similar models because of using dual encryption and an independent middleware during user authentication and data protection procedures.
