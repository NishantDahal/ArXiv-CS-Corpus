Ultrarigid periodic frameworks

We give an algebraic characterization of when a $d$-dimensional periodic framework has no non-trivial, symmetry preserving, motion for any choice of periodicity lattice. Our condition is decidable, and we provide a simple algorithm that does not require complicated algebraic computations. In dimension $d = 2$, we give a combinatorial characterization in the special case when the the number of edge orbits is the minimum possible for ultrarigidity. All our results apply to a fully flexible, fixed area, or fixed periodicity lattice.
