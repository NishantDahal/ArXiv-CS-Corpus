LT Codes Combined with Network Coding for Multihop Powerline Smart Grid Networks

This paper describes a novel approach for combining Luby Transform (LT) codes and Network Coding (NC) in the context of PowerLine Communications (PLC) smart grid networks. Multihop transmissions of LT-encoded data on PLC networks are considered and algorithms to combine data at relay nodes are proposed. Without the need to decode and then re-encode the total received data stream, the relay nodes can forward the received data stream while adding at the same time their own data. Simulation results are provided confirming the good performance of the proposed algorithms.
