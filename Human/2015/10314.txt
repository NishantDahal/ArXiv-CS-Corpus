On the Expressive Power of Kleene Algebra with Domain

It is shown that antidomain semirings are more expressive than test semirings and that Kleene algebras with domain are more expressive than Kleene algebras with tests. It is also shown that Kleene algebras with domain are expressive for propositional Hoare logic whereas Kleene algebras with tests are not.
