Innovative Method for enhancing Key generation and management in the AES-algorithm

With the extraordinary maturity of data exchange in network environments and increasing the attackers capabilities, information security has become the most important process for data storage and communication. In order to provide such information security the confidentiality, data integrity, and data origin authentication must be verified based on cryptographic encryption algorithms. This paper presents a development of the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm, which is considered as the most eminent symmetric encryption algorithm. The development focuses on the generation of the integration between the developed AES based S-Boxes, and the specific selected secret key generated from the quantum key distribution.
