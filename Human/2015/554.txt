A Modified No Search Algorithm for Fractal Image Compression

Fractal image compression has some desirable properties like high quality at high compression ratio, fast decoding, and resolution independence. Therefore it can be used for many applications such as texture mapping and pattern recognition and image watermarking. But it suffers from long encoding time due to its need to find the best match between sub blocks. This time is related to the approach that is used. In this paper we present a fast encoding Algorithm based on no search method. Our goal is that more blocks are covered in initial step of quad tree algorithm. Experimental result has been compared with other new fast fractal coding methods, showing it is better in term of bit rate in same condition while the other parameters are fixed.
