Distributed Compressive Sensing Based Doubly Selective Channel Estimation for Large-Scale MIMO Systems

Doubly selective (DS) channel estimation in largescale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a challenging problem due to the requirement of unaffordable pilot overheads and prohibitive complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed compressive sensing (DCS) based channel estimation scheme to solve this problem. In the scheme, we introduce the basis expansion model (BEM) to reduce the required channel coefficients and pilot overheads. And due to the common sparsity of all the transmit-receive antenna pairs in delay domain, we estimate the BEM coefficients by considering the DCS framework, which has a simple linear structure with low complexity. Further more, a linear smoothing method is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, we conduct various simulations to verify the validity of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with conventional schemes.
