Next Generation M2M Cellular Networks: Challenges and Practical Considerations

In this article, we present the major challenges of future machine-to-machine (M2M) cellular networks such as spectrum scarcity problem, support for low-power, low-cost, and numerous number of devices. As being an integral part of the future Internet-of-Things (IoT), the true vision of M2M communications cannot be reached with conventional solutions that are typically cost inefficient. Cognitive radio concept has emerged to significantly tackle the spectrum under-utilization or scarcity problem. Heterogeneous network model is another alternative to relax the number of covered users. To this extent, we present a complete fundamental understanding and engineering knowledge of cognitive radios, heterogeneous network model, and power and cost challenges in the context of future M2M cellular networks.
