Analog Computing Using Graphene-based Metalines

We introduce the new concept of "metalines" for manipulating the amplitude and phase profile of an incident wave locally and independently. Thanks to the highly confined graphene plasmons, a transmit-array of graphene-based metalines is used to realize analog computing on an ultra-compact, integrable and planar platform. By employing the general concepts of spatial Fourier transformation, a well-designed structure of such meta-transmit-array combined with graded index lenses can perform two mathematical operations; i.e. differentiation and integration, with high efficiency. The presented configuration is about 60 times shorter than the recent structure proposed by Silva et al.(Science, 2014, 343, 160-163); moreover, our simulated output responses are in more agreement with the desired analytic results. These findings may lead to remarkable achievements in light-based plasmonic signal processors at nanoscale instead of their bulky conventional dielectric lens-based counterparts.
