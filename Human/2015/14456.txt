Close Communication and 2-Clubs in Corporate Networks: Europe 2010

Corporate networks, as induced by interlocking directorates between corporations, provide structures of personal communication at the level of their boards. This paper studies such networks from a perspective of close communication in sub-networks, where each pair of nodes (boards of a corporation) are either neighbours, or have a common neighbour. These correspond to subgraphs of diameter at most 2, designated by us earlier as 2-clubs, with three types (coteries, social circles and hamlets) as degrees of close communication in social networks, within the concept of boroughs of a network. Boroughs are maximal areas and containers of close communication between nodes of a network. This framework is applied in this paper to an analysis of corporate board interlocks between the top 300 European corporations 2010, as studied by Heemkerk (2013), with data provided by him for that purpose. The paper gives results for several perspectives of close communication in the European corporate network of 2010, a year close to the global crash of 2008, as a further elaboration of those given in Heemskerk (2013).
