Tractable Resource Management in Millimeter-Wave Overlaid Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks

What does millimeter-wave (mmW) seek assistance for from micro-wave (μW) in a mmW overlaid 5G cellular network? This paper raises the question of whether to complement downlink (DL) or uplink (UL) transmissions, and concludes that μW should aid UL more. Such dedication to UL results from the low mmW UL rate due to high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) at mobile users. The DL/UL allocations are tractably provided based on a novel closed-form mm-μW spectral efficiency (SE) derivation via stochastic geometry. The findings explicitly indicate: (i) both DL/UL mmW (or μW) SEs coincidentally converge on the same value in an ultra-dense cellular network (UDN) and (ii) such a mmW (or μW) UDN SE is a logarithmic function of BS-to-user density ratio. The corresponding mm-μW resource management is evaluated by utilizing a three dimensional (3D) blockage model with real geography in Seoul, Korea.
