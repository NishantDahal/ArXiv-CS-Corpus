Maintenance Support in Open Source Software Projects

Easy and mostly free access to the internet has resulted in the growing use of open source software (OSS). However, it is a common perception that closed proprietary software is still superior in areas such as software maintenance and management. The research model of this study establishes a relationship between maintenance issues (such as user requests and error handling) and support provided by open source software through project forums, mailing lists and trackers. To conduct this research, we have used a dataset consisting of 120 open source software projects, covering a wide range of categories. The results of the study show that project forums and mailing lists play a significant role in addressing user requests in open source software. However according to the empirical investigation, it has been explored that trackers are used as an effective medium for error reporting as well as user requests.
