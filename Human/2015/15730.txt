Discrete and Continuous Systems of Logic in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

We implement several non-binary logic systems using the spin dynamics of nuclear spins in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR system is a suitable test system because of its high degree of experimental control; findings from NMR implementations are relevant for other computational platforms exploiting particles with spin, such as electrons or photons. While we do not expect the NMR system to become a practical computational device, it is uniquely useful to explore strengths and weaknesses of unconventional computational approaches, such as non-binary logic.
