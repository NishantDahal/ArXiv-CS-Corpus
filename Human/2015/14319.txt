New constructions of quantum MDS convolutional codes derived from generalized Reed-Solomon codes

Quantum convolutional codes can be used to protect a sequence of qubits of arbitrary length against decoherence. In this paper, we give two new constructions of quantum MDS convolutional codes derived from generalized Reed-Solomon codes and obtain eighteen new classes of quantum MDS convolutional codes. Most of them are new in the sense that the parameters of the codes are different from all the previously known ones.
