Compositional Dictionaries for Domain Adaptive Face Recognition

We present a dictionary learning approach to compensate for the transformation of faces due to changes in view point, illumination, resolution, etc. The key idea of our approach is to force domain-invariant sparse coding, i.e., design a consistent sparse representation of the same face in different domains. In this way, classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source domain consisting of frontal faces for example can be applied to the target domain (consisting of faces in different poses, illumination conditions, etc) without much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a domain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity, pose, illumination) using a sparse representation over the base dictionary. The dictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as sparse linear combinations of the base dictionary. In the context of face recognition, with the proposed compositional dictionary approach, a face image can be decomposed into sparse representations for a given subject, pose and illumination respectively. This approach has three advantages: first, the extracted sparse representation for a subject is consistent across domains and enables pose and illumination insensitive face recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and illumination can subsequently be used to estimate the pose and illumination condition of a face image. Finally, by composing sparse representations for subject and the different domains, we can also perform pose alignment and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments using two public face datasets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for face recognition.
