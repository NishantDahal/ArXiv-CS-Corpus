Aqua Computing: Coupling Computing and Communications

The authors introduce a new vision for providing computing services for connected devices. It is based on the key concept that future computing resources will be coupled with communication resources, for enhancing user experience of the connected users, and also for optimising resources in the providers' infrastructures. Such coupling is achieved by Joint/Cooperative resource allocation algorithms, by integrating computing and communication services and by integrating hardware in networks. Such type of computing, by which computing services are not delivered independently but dependent of networking services, is named Aqua Computing. The authors see Aqua Computing as a novel approach for delivering computing resources to end devices, where computing power of the devices are enhanced automatically once they are connected to an Aqua Computing enabled network. The process of resource coupling is named computation dissolving. Then, an Aqua Computing architecture is proposed for mobile edge networks, in which computing and wireless networking resources are allocated jointly or cooperatively by a Mobile Cloud Controller, for the benefit of the end-users and/or for the benefit of the service providers. Finally, a working prototype of the system is shown and the gathered results show the performance of the Aqua Computing prototype.
