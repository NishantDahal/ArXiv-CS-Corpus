Asymptotic behavior of the node degrees in the ensemble average of adjacency matrix

Various important and useful quantities or measures that characterize the topological network structure are usually investigated for a network, then they are averaged over the samples. In this paper, we propose an explicit representation by the beforehand averaged adjacency matrix over samples of growing networks as a new general framework for investigating the characteristic quantities. It is applied to some network models, and shows a good approximation of degree distribution asymptotically. In particular, our approach will be applicable through the numerical calculations instead of intractable theoretical analysises, when the time-course of degree is a monotone increasing function like power-law or logarithm.
