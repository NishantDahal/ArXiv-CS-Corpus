Transaction Level Analysis for a Clustered and Hardware-Enhanced Task Manager on Homogeneous Many-Core Systems

The increasing parallelism of many-core systems demands for efficient strategies for the run-time system management. Due to the large number of cores the management overhead has a rising impact to the overall system performance. This work analyzes a clustered infrastructure of dedicated hardware nodes to manage a homogeneous many-core system. The hardware nodes implement a message passing protocol and perform the task mapping and synchronization at run-time. To make meaningful mapping decisions, the global management nodes employ a workload status communication mechanism.
  This paper discusses the design-space of the dedicated infrastructure by means of task mapping use-cases and a parallel benchmark including application-interference. We evaluate the architecture in terms of application speedup and analyze the mechanism for the status communication. A comparison versus centralized and fully-distributed configurations demonstrates the reduction of the computation and communication management overhead for our approach.
