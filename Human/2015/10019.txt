Experimental Demonstration of Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexed Transmission

We experimentally demonstrate an NFDM optical system with modulation over nonlinear discrete spectrum. Particularly, each symbol carries 4-bits from multiplexing two eigenvalues modulated by QPSK constellation. We show a low error performance using NFT detection with 4Gbps rate over 640km.
