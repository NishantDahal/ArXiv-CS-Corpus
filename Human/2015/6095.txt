Constacyclic Codes Over Finite Principal Ideal Rings

In this paper, we give an important isomorphism between contacyclic codes and cyclic codes over finite principal ideal rings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-trivial cyclic self-dual codes over finite principal ideal rings are given.
