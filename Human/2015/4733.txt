The Method of Constructing Models of Peer to Peer Protocols

The models of peer to peer protocols are presented with the help of one-step processes. On the basis of this presentation and the method of randomization of one-step processes described method for constructing models of peer to peer protocols. As specific implementations of proposed method the models of FastTrack and Bittorrent protocols are studied.
