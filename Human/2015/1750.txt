The NUbots are an interdisciplinary RoboCup team from The University of Newcastle, Australia. The team has a history of strong contributions in the areas of machine learning and computer vision. The NUbots have participated in RoboCup leagues since 2002, placing first several times in the past. In 2014 the NUbots also partnered with the University of Newcastle Mechatronics Laboratory to participate in the RobotX Marine Robotics Challenge, which resulted in several new ideas and improvements to the NUbots vision system for RoboCup. This paper summarizes the history of the NUbots team, describes the roles and research of the team members, gives an overview of the NUbots' robots, their software system, and several associated research projects.
