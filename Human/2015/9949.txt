Looking at Software Sustainability and Productivity Challenges from NSF

This paper is a contribution to the Computational Science & Engineering Software Sustainability and Productivity Challenges (CSESSP Challenges) Workshop (https://www.nitrd.gov/csessp/), sponsored by the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Software Design and Productivity (SDP) Coordinating Group, held October 15th-16th 2015 in Washington DC, USA. It introduces the role of software at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the NSF Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program, then describes challenges that the SI2 program has identified, including funding models, career paths, incentives, training, interdisciplinary work, portability, and dissemination, as well as lesson that have been learned.
