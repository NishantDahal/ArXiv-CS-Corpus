A new algorithm for multiplying two Dirac numbers

In this work a rationalized algorithm for Dirac numbers multiplication is presented. This algorithm has a low computational complexity feature and is well suited to FPGA implementation. The computation of two Dirac numbers product using the na√Øve method takes 256 real multiplications and 240 real additions, while the proposed algorithm can compute the same result in only 88 real multiplications and 256 real additions. During synthesis of the discussed algorithm we use the fact that Dirac numbers product may be represented as vector-matrix product. The matrix participating in the product has unique structural properties that allow performing its advantageous decomposition. Namely this decomposition leads to significant reducing of the computational complexity.
