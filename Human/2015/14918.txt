Security Metrics in Industrial Control Systems

Risk is the best known and perhaps the best studied example within a much broader class of cyber security metrics. However, risk is not the only possible cyber security metric. Other metrics such as resilience can exist and could be potentially very valuable to defenders of ICS systems. Often, metrics are defined as measurable properties of a system that quantify the degree to which objectives of the system are achieved. Metrics can provide cyber defenders of an ICS with critical insights regarding the system. Metrics are generally acquired by analyzing relevant attributes of that system. In terms of cyber security metrics, ICSs tend to have unique features: in many cases, these systems are older technologies that were designed for functionality rather than security. They are also extremely diverse systems that have different requirements and objectives. Therefore, metrics for ICSs must be tailored to a diverse group of systems with many features and perform many different functions. In this chapter, we first outline the general theory of performance metrics, and highlight examples from the cyber security domain and ICS in particular. We then focus on a particular example of a class of metrics that is different from the one we have considered in earlier chapters. Instead of risk, here we consider metrics of resilience. Resilience is defined by the National Academy of Sciences (2012) as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events. This chapter presents two approaches for the generation of metrics based on the concept of resilience using a matrix-based approach and a network-based approach. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of different methods is presented along with a process and tips intended to aid in devising effective metrics.
