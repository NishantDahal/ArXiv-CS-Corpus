siftservice.com - Turning a Computer Vision algorithm into a World Wide Web Service

Image features detection and description is a longstanding topic in computer vision and pattern recognition areas. The Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is probably the most popular and widely demanded feature descriptor which facilitates a variety of computer vision applications such as image registration, object tracking, image forgery detection, and 3D surface reconstruction. This work introduces a Software as a Service (SaaS) based implementation of the SIFT algorithm which is freely available at http://siftservice.com for any academic, educational and research purposes. The service provides application-to-application interaction and aims Rapid Application Development (RAD) and also fast prototyping for computer vision students and researchers all around the world. An Internet connection is all they need!
