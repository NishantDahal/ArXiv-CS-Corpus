Spectrum Sharing in RF-Powered Cognitive Radio Networks using Game Theory

We investigate the spectrum sharing problem of a radio frequency (RF)-powered cognitive radio network, where a multi-antenna secondary user (SU) harvests energy from RF signals radiated by a primary user (PU) to boost its available energy before information transmission. In this paper, we consider that both the PU and SU are rational and self-interested. Based on whether the SU helps forward the PU's information, we develop two different operation modes for the considered network, termed as non-cooperative and cooperative modes. In the non-cooperative mode, the SU harvests energy from the PU and then use its available energy to transmit its own information without generating any interference to the primary link. In the cooperative mode, the PU employs the SU to relay its information by providing monetary incentives and the SU splits its energy for forwarding the PU's information as well as transmitting its own information. Optimization problems are respectively formulated for both operation modes, which constitute a Stackelberg game with the PU as a leader and the SU as a follower. We analyze the Stackelberg game by deriving solutions to the optimization problems and the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) is subsequently obtained. Simulation results show that the performance of the Stackelberg game can approach that of the centralized optimization scheme when the distance between the SU and its receiver is large enough.
