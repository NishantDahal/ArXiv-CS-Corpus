Single Image Dehazing through Improved Atmospheric Light Estimation

Image contrast enhancement for outdoor vision is important for smart car auxiliary transport systems. The video frames captured in poor weather conditions are often characterized by poor visibility. Most image dehazing algorithms consider to use a hard threshold assumptions or user input to estimate atmospheric light. However, the brightest pixels sometimes are objects such as car lights or streetlights, especially for smart car auxiliary transport systems. Simply using a hard threshold may cause a wrong estimation. In this paper, we propose a single optimized image dehazing method that estimates atmospheric light efficiently and removes haze through the estimation of a semi-globally adaptive filter. The enhanced images are characterized with little noise and good exposure in dark regions. The textures and edges of the processed images are also enhanced significantly.
