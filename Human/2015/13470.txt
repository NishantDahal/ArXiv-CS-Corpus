A Novel Molecular Communication System Using Acids, Bases and Hydrogen Ions

Concentration modulation, whereby information is encoded in the concentration level of chemicals, is considered. One of the main challenges with such systems is the limited control the transmitter has on the concentration level at the receiver. For example, concentration cannot be directly decreased by the transmitter, and the decrease in concentration over time occurs solely due to transport mechanisms such as diffusion. This can result in inter-symbol interference (ISI), which can have degrading effects on performance. In this work, a new and novel scheme is proposed that uses the transmission of acids, bases, and the concentration of hydrogen ions for carrying information. By employing this technique, the concentration of hydrogen ions at the receiver can be both increased and decreased through the sender's transmissions. This enables novel ISI mitigation schemes as well as the possibility to form a wider array of signal patterns at the receiver.
