RFC 7800 - Money Over IP

This Request For Comment (RFC) is a proposal for a new protocol to use money over the Internet. Features like a distributed architecture, a published cryptographic algorithm, a minimal authority responsibility, the absence of fees will make this protocol a perfect tool for citizens in today's digital World. An implementation has validated the main principles and we entering now a testing phase (v0.1). Depending of the results, a released date for the 1.0 revision will to decided to allow anybody to send or to receive money to/from anyone, in any currency, with a regular and personal smart-phone. A distributed hash table (DHT) is used to store all transactions, public keys and certificates redundantly on several nodes. The all system may replace coins, banknotes and classical checks in the future. We also argue that the Bitcoin technology does not satisfy the requirements for a digital mean of payment. This proposal is expected to be reviewed and commented by the Internet Engineering Task Force.
