Real-time Monocular Object SLAM

We present a real-time object-based SLAM system that leverages the largest object database to date. Our approach comprises two main components: 1) a monocular SLAM algorithm that exploits object rigidity constraints to improve the map and find its real scale, and 2) a novel object recognition algorithm based on bags of binary words, which provides live detections with a database of 500 3D objects. The two components work together and benefit each other: the SLAM algorithm accumulates information from the observations of the objects, anchors object features to especial map landmarks and sets constrains on the optimization. At the same time, objects partially or fully located within the map are used as a prior to guide the recognition algorithm, achieving higher recall. We evaluate our proposal on five real environments showing improvements on the accuracy of the map and efficiency with respect to other state-of-the-art techniques.
