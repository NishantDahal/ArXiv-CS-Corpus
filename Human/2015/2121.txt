Sand transverse dune aerodynamics: 3D Coherent Flow Structures from a computational study

The engineering interest about dune fields is dictated by the their interaction with a number of human infrastructures in arid environments. Sand dunes dynamics is dictated by wind and its ability to induce sand erosion, transport and deposition. A deep understanding of dune aerodynamics serves then to ground effective strategies for the protection of human infrastructures from sand, the so-called sand mitigation. Because of their simple geometry and their frequent occurrence in desert area, transverse sand dunes are usually adopted in literature as a benchmark to investigate dune aerodynamics by means of both computational or experimental approaches, usually in nominally 2D setups. The present study aims at evaluating 3D flow features in the wake of a idealised transverse dune, if any, under different nominally 2D setup conditions by means of computational simulations and to compare the obtained results with experimental measurements available in literature.
