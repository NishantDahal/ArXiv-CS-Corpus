Low-Complexity SINR Feasibility Checking and Joint Power and Admission Control in Prioritized Multi-tier Cellular Networks

Next generation cellular networks will consist of multiple tiers of cells and users associated with different network tiers may have different priorities (e.g., macrocell-picocell-femtocell networks with macro tier prioritized over pico tier, which is again prioritized over femto tier). Designing efficient joint power and admission control (JPAC) algorithms for such networks under a co-channel deployment (i.e., underlay) scenario is of significant importance. Feasibility checking of a given target signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) vector is generally the most significant contributor to the complexity of JPAC algorithms in single/multi-tier underlay cellular networks. This is generally accomplished through iterative strategies whose complexity is either unpredictable or of O(M^3), when the well-known relationship between the SINR vector and the power vector is used, where $M$ is the number of users/links. In this paper, we derive a novel relationship between a given SINR vector and its corresponding uplink/downlink power vector based on which the feasibility checking can be performed with a complexity of O(B^3+M B), where B is the number of base stations. This is significantly less compared to O(M^3) in many cellular wireless networks since the number of base stations is generally much lower than the number of users/links in such networks. The developed novel relationship between the SINR and power vector not only substantially reduces the complexity of designing JPAC algorithms, but also provides insights into developing efficient but low-complexity power update strategies for prioritized multi-tier cellular networks. We propose two such algorithms and through simulations, we show that our proposed algorithms outperform the existing ones in prioritized cellular networks.
