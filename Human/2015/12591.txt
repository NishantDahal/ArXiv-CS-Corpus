Discrete uniformization of finite branched covers over the Riemann sphere via hyper-ideal circle patterns

With the help of hyper-ideal circle pattern theory, we have developed a discrete version of the classical uniformization theorems for surfaces represented as finite branched covers over the Riemann sphere as well as compact polyhedral surfaces with non-positive curvature. We show that in the case of such surfaces discrete uniformization via hyper-ideal circle patterns always exists and is unique. We also propose a numerical algorithm, utilizing convex optimization, that constructs the desired discrete uniformization.
