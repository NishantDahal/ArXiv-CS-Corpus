Enhancing Programming Interface to Effectively Meet Multiple Information Needs of Developers

In the past decades, integrated development environments (IDEs) have been largely advanced to facilitate common software engineering tasks. Yet, with growing information needs driven by increasing complexity in developing modern high-quality software, developers often need to switch among multiple user interfaces, even across different applications, in their development process, which breaks their mental workflow thus tends to adversely affect their working efficiency and productivity. This position paper discusses challenges faced by current IDE designs mainly from working context transitions of developers during the process of seeking multiple information needs for their development tasks. It remarks the primary blockades behind and initially explores some high-level design considerations for overcoming such challenges in the next-generation IDEs. Specifically, a few design enhancements on top of modern IDEs are envisioned, attempting to reduce the overheads of frequent context switching commonly seen in the multitasking of developers.
