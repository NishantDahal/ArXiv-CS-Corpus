Human Curation and Convnets: Powering Item-to-Item Recommendations on Pinterest

This paper presents Pinterest Related Pins, an item-to-item recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering with content-based ranking. We demonstrate that signals derived from user curation, the activity of users organizing content, are highly effective when used in conjunction with content-based ranking. This paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of visual features, such as image or object representations learned from convnets, in improving the user engagement rate of our item-to-item recommendation system.
