Privacy Constrained Information Processing

This paper studies communication scenarios where the transmitter and the receiver have different objectives due to privacy concerns, in the context of a variation of the strategic information transfer (SIT) model of Sobel and Crawford. We first formulate the problem as the minimization of a common distortion by the transmitter and the receiver subject to a privacy constrained transmitter. We show the equivalence of this formulation to a Stackelberg equilibrium of the SIT problem. Assuming an entropy based privacy measure, a quadratic distortion measure and jointly Gaussian variables, we characterize the Stackelberg equilibrium. Next, we consider asymptotically optimal compression at the transmitter which inherently provides some level of privacy, and study equilibrium conditions. We finally analyze the impact of the presence of an average power constrained Gaussian communication channel between the transmitter and the receiver on the equilibrium conditions.
