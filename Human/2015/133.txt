On Error Correction for Physical Unclonable Functions

Physical Unclonable Functions evaluate manufacturing variations to generate secure cryptographic keys for embedded systems without secure key storage. It is explained how methods from coding theory are applied in order to ensure reliable key reproduction. We show how better results can be obtained using code classes and decoding principles not used for this scenario before. These methods are exemplified by specific code constructions which improve existing codes with respect to error probability, decoding complexity and codeword length.
