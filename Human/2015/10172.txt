Vehicle to Vehicle Authentication

In recent future, vehicles will establish a spontaneous connection over a wireless radio channel, coordinating actions and information. Vehicles will exchange warning messages over the wireless radio channel through Dedicated Short Range Communication (IEEE 1609) over the Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (802.11p).

Therefore, the warning messages being exchanged must incorporate an authentic factor such that recipient is willing to verify and accept the message in a timely manner
