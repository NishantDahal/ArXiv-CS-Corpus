The Quicksort algorithm and related topics

Sorting algorithms have attracted a great deal of attention and study, as they have numerous applications to Mathematics, Computer Science and related fields. In this thesis, we first deal with the mathematical analysis of the Quicksort algorithm and its variants. Specifically, we study the time complexity of the algorithm and we provide a complete demonstration of the variance of the number of comparisons required, a known result but one whose detailed proof is not easy to read out of the literature. We also examine variants of Quicksort, where multiple pivots are chosen for the partitioning of the array.
  The rest of this work is dedicated to the analysis of finding the true order by further pairwise comparisons when a partial order compatible with the true order is given in advance. We discuss a number of cases where the partially ordered sets arise at random. To this end, we employ results from Graph and Information Theory. Finally, we obtain an alternative bound on the number of linear extensions when the partially ordered set arises from a random graph, and discuss the possible application of Shellsort in merging chains.
