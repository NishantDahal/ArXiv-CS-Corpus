5G Ultra-Reliable Vehicular Communication

Applications enabled by Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) represent a major step towards making the road transport system safer and more efficient (green), and thus suited for a sustainable future. Wireless communication between vehicles and road infrastructure is an enabler for high-performance C-ITS applications. State-of-the-art communication systems for supporting low-latency C-ITS applications are based on IEEE 802.11 medium access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers. In this paper, we argue that a well-designed 5G system can complement or even replace these systems. We will review the C-ITS application requirements and explain how these are well aligned with the foreseen generic 5G service of ultra-reliable machine-type communication (uMTC). Key technology components suitable for constructing the uMTC service are identified: reliable service composition (RSC) and device-to-device (D2D) links for all-to-all broadcast communication, operational at high mobility and with varying degree of network assistance. Important problems for future studies, including radio-resource management, medium access control, and physical layer challenges, are discussed.
