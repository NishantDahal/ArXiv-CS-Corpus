Nonlinear $q$-voter model with inflexible zealots

We study the dynamics of the nonlinear $q$-voter model with inflexible zealots in a finite well-mixed population. In this system, each individual supports one of two parties and is either a susceptible voter or an inflexible zealot. At each time step, a susceptible adopts the opinion of a neighbor if this belongs to a group of $q\geq 2$ neighbors all in the same state, whereas inflexible zealots never change their opinion. In the presence of zealots of both parties the model is characterized by a fluctuating stationary state and, below a zealotry density threshold, the distribution of opinions is bimodal. After a characteristic time, most susceptibles become supporters of the party having more zealots and the opinion distribution is asymmetric. When the number of zealots of both parties is the same, the opinion distribution is symmetric and, in the long run, susceptibles endlessly swing from the state where they all support one party to the opposite state. Above the zealotry density threshold, when there is an unequal number of zealots of each type, the probability distribution is single-peaked and non-Gaussian. These properties are investigated analytically and with stochastic simulations. We also study the mean time to reach a consensus when zealots support only one party.
