Server component installation and testing of the university information and educational environment on the Moodle LMS platform

The informational educational environment (IEE) of an institution is a complex multilevel system which, along with methodical, organizational and cultural resources, accumulates the intellectual and technical potential of a university, as well as the informative and activity components of the learners and teachers. In practice, the formation of IEE is actually based on the creation of information technologies and their integration into the existing educational environment of the institution. The management of this system is carried out using specialized equipment and software. For the successful formation and operation of IEE, in the present work we review software products that form the basis of the organization of interactive and web interactions between students, teachers and all participants of the educational process. We analyse the technical capabilities that have provided users with IEE services such as the Apache web server with connected modules PHP, MySQL, the Java virtual machine and the Red5 server. We demonstrate the possibility of obtaining results from the interaction of these products, and reports on users' work in webinars, video conferences and web conferences.
