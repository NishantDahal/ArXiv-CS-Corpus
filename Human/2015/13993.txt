A Systematic Literature Review of the Critical Factors for Success of Mobile Learning in Higher Education (University Students' Perspective)

The phenomenon of the use of a mobile learning (m-Learning) platform in educational institutions is slowly gaining momentum. While this can be taken as an encouraging sign, the perplexing part is that the fervor with which mobile phones have been welcomed into every aspect of our lives does not seem to be evident in the educational sector. In order to understand the reason, it is important to understand user expectations of the system. This paper documents a systematic review of various research studies seeking to find the success factors for effective m-Learning. A total of 30 studies were included in the research, which combined would give a true picture of user perceptions of the factors they consider important for effective m-Learning implementation. Our systematic review collates results from 30 studies conducted in 17 countries, where 13 critical success factors (CSFs) were found to strongly impact m-Learning.
