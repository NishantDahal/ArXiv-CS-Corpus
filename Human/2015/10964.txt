Convergence of the Generalized Alternating Projection Algorithm for Compressive Sensing

The convergence of the generalized alternating projection (GAP) algorithm is studied in this paper to solve the compressive sensing problem $\yv = \Amat \xv + \epsilonv$. By assuming that $\Amat\Amat\ts$ is invertible, we prove that GAP converges linearly within a certain range of step-size when the sensing matrix $\Amat$ satisfies restricted isometry property (RIP) condition of $δ_{2K}$, where $K$ is the sparsity of $\xv$. The theoretical analysis is extended to the adaptively iterative thresholding (AIT) algorithms, for which the convergence rate is also derived based on $δ_{2K}$ of the sensing matrix. We further prove that, under the same conditions, the convergence rate of GAP is faster than that of AIT. Extensive simulation results confirm the theoretical assertions.
