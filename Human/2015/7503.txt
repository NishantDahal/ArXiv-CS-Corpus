Survey Results on Threats To External Validity, Generalizability Concerns, Data Sharing and University-Industry Collaboration in Mining Software Repository (MSR) Research

Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is an applied and practise-oriented field aimed at solving real problems encountered by practitioners and bringing value to Industry. Replication of results and findings, generalizability and external validity, University-Industry collaboration, data sharing and creation dataset repositories are important issues in MSR research. Research consisting of bibliometric analysis of MSR paper shows lack of University-Industry collaboration, deficiency of studies on closed or propriety source dataset and lack of data as well as tool sharing by researchers. We conduct a survey of authors of past three years of MSR conference (2012, 2013 and 2014) to collect data on their views and suggestions to address the stated concerns. We asked 20 questions from more than 100 authors and received a response from 39 authors. Our results shows that about one-third of the respondents always make their dataset publicly available and about one-third believe that data sharing should be a mandatory condition for publication in MSR conferences. Our survey reveals that more than 50% authors used solely open-source software (OSS) dataset for their research. More than 50% of the respondents mentioned that difficulty in sharing Industrial dataset outside the company is one of the major impediments in University-Industry collaboration.
