Random Linear Network Coding for Wireless Layered Video Broadcast: General Design Methods for Adaptive Feedback-free Transmission

This paper studies the problem of broadcasting layered video streams over heterogeneous single-hop wireless networks using feedback-free random linear network coding (RLNC). We combine RLNC with unequal error protection (UEP) and our main purpose is twofold. First, to systematically investigate the benefits of UEP+RLNC layered approach in servicing users with different reception capabilities. Second, to study the effect of not using feedback, by comparing feedback-free schemes with idealistic full-feedback schemes. To these ends, we study `expected percentage of decoded frames' as a key content-independent performance metric and propose a general framework for calculation of this metric, which can highlight the effect of key system, video and channel parameters. We study the effect of number of layers and propose a scheme that selects the optimum number of layers adaptively to achieve the highest performance. Assessing the proposed schemes with real H.264 test streams, the trade-offs among the users' performances are discussed and the gain of adaptive selection of number of layers to improve the trade-offs is shown. Furthermore, it is observed that the performance gap between the proposed feedback-free scheme and the idealistic scheme is very small and the adaptive selection of number of video layers further closes the gap.
