Maximum lifetime broadcasting problem in sensor networks

We solve the maximum lifetime problem for the point-to-point and point-to-multipoint broadcast data transmission in one dimensional regular sensor network. Based on the analytical solution of the problem for one dimension we propose an algorithm solving the maximum lifetime broadcasting problem for point-to-point data transmission for any dimension.
