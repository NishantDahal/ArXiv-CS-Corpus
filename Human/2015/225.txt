CRDSA, CRDSA++ and IRSA: Stability and Performance Evaluation

In the recent past, new enhancements based on the well established Aloha technique (CRDSA, CRDSA++, IRSA) have demonstrated the capability to reach higher throughput than traditional SA, in bursty traffic conditions and without any need of coordination among terminals. In this paper, retransmissions and related stability for these new techniques are discussed. A model is also formulated in order to provide a basis for the analysis of the stability and the performance both for finite and infinite users population. This model can be used as a framework for the design of such a communication system.
