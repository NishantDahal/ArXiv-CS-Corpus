Iris Recognition Using Scattering Transform and Textural Features

Iris recognition has drawn a lot of attention since the mid-twentieth century. Among all biometric features, iris is known to possess a rich set of features. Different features have been used to perform iris recognition in the past. In this paper, two powerful sets of features are introduced to be used for iris recognition: scattering transform-based features and textural features. PCA is also applied on the extracted features to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector while preserving most of the information of its initial value. Minimum distance classifier is used to perform template matching for each new test sample. The proposed scheme is tested on a well-known iris database, and showed promising results with the best accuracy rate of 99.2%.
