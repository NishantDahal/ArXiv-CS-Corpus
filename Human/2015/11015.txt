On the Capacity of Point-to-Point and Multiple-Access Molecular Communications with Ligand-Receptors

In this paper, we consider the bacterial point-to-point and multiple-access molecular communications with ligand-receptors. For the point-to-point communication, we investigate common signaling methods, namely the Level Scenario (LS), which uses one type of a molecule with different concentration levels, and the Type Scenario (TS), which employs multiple types of molecules with a single concentration level. We investigate the trade-offs between the two scenarios from the capacity point of view. We derive an upper bound on the capacity using a Binomial Channel (BIC) model and the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. A lower bound is also derived when the environment noise is negligible. For the TS, we also consider the effect of blocking of a receptor by a different molecule type. Then, we consider multiple-access communications, for which we investigate three scenarios based on molecule and receptor types, i.e., same types of molecules with Different Labeling and Same types of Receptors (DLSR), Different types of Molecules and Receptors (DMDR), and Same types of Molecules and Receptors (SMSR). We investigate the trade-offs among the three scenarios from the total capacity point of view. We derive some inner bounds on the capacity region of these scenarios when the environment noise is negligible.
