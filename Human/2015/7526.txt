A Safe Regression Testing Technique for Web Services based on WSDL Specification

Specification-based regression testing of web services is an important activity which verifies the quality of web services. A major problem in web services is that only provider has the source code and both user and broker only have the XML based specification. So from the perspective of user and broker, specification based regression testing of web services is needed. The existing techniques are code based. Due to the dynamic behavior of web services, web services undergo maintenance and evolution process rapidly. Retesting of web services is required in order to verify the impact of changes. In this paper, we present an automated safe specification based regression testing approach that uses original and modified WSDL specifications for change identification. All the relevant test cases are selected as reusable hence our regression test selection approach is safe.
