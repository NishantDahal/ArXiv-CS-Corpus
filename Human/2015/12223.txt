Cells in the Internet of Things

The Internet of Things combines various earlier areas of research. As a result, research on the subject is still organized around these pre-existing areas: distributed computing with services and objects, networks (usually combining 6lowpan with Zigbee etc. for the last-hop), artificial intelligence and semantic web, and human-computer interaction. We are yet to create a unified model that covers all these perspectives - domain, device, service, agent, etc. In this paper, we propose the concept of cells as units of structure and context in the Internet of things. This allows us to have a unified vocabulary to refer to single entities (whether dumb motes, intelligent spimes, or virtual services), intranets of things, and finally the complete Internet of things. The question that naturally follows, is what criteria we choose to demarcate boundaries; we suggest various possible answers to this question. We also mention how this concept ties into the existing visions and protocols, and suggest how it may be used as the foundation of a formal model.
