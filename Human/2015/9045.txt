Using Fisher Information In Big Data

In this era of Big Data, proficient use of data mining is the key to capture useful information from any dataset. As numerous data mining techniques make use of information theory concepts, in this paper, we discuss how Fisher information (FI) can be applied to analyze patterns in Big Data. The main advantage of FI is its ability to combine multiple variables together to inform us on the overall trends and stability of a system. It can therefore detect whether a system is losing dynamic order and stability, which may serve as a signal of an impending regime shift. In this work, we first provide a brief overview of Fisher information theory, followed by a simple step-by-step numerical example on how to compute FI. Finally, as a numerical demonstration, we calculate the evolution of FI for GDP per capita (current US Dollar) and total population of the USA from 1960 to 2013.
