A Multicomponent Approach to Nonrigid Registration of Diffusion Tensor Images

We propose a nonrigid registration approach for diffusion tensor images using a multicomponent information-theoretic measure. Explicit orientation optimization is enabled by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary for wrapping diffusion tensor images. Experimental results on diffusion tensor images indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach and a much better performance compared to the affine registration method based on mutual information in terms of registration accuracy in the presence of geometric distortion.
