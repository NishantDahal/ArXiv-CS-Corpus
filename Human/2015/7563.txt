One-Bit Compressive Sensing with Partial Support

The Compressive Sensing framework maintains relevance even when the available measurements are subject to extreme quantization, as is exemplified by the so-called one-bit compressed sensing framework which aims to recover a signal from measurements reduced to only their sign-bit. In applications, it is often the case that we have some knowledge of the structure of the signal beforehand, and thus would like to leverage it to attain more accurate and efficient recovery. This work explores avenues for incorporating such partial-support information into the one-bit setting. Experimental results demonstrate that newly proposed methods of this work yield improved signal recovery even for varying levels of accuracy in the prior information. This work is thus the first to provide recovery mechanisms that efficiently use prior signal information in the one-bit reconstruction setting.
