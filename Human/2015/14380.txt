Sexual videos in Internet: a test of 11 hypotheses about intimate practices and gender interactions in Latin America

There is a marked lack of literature on user-submitted sexual videos from Latin America. To start filling that gap, we present a formal statistical testing of several hypotheses about the characteristics of 214 videos from Nereliatube.com posted from the inauguration of the site until December 2010. We found that in most cases the video was made consensually and the camera was operated by the man. The most frequent practice shown was fellatio, followed by vaginal penetration. The great majority of videos showed the sexual interactions of one woman with one man; group sex was rare. Violence and manifestations of power were rare and when there was violence it was mostly simulated. Latin American user-submitted sexual videos in Nereliatube generally reflect a society in which women and men have a variety of sexual practices that are mostly consensual and that do not differ from the biologically and anthropologically expected patterns.
