p-Adic Stability In Linear Algebra

Using the differential precision methods developed previously by the same authors, we study the p-adic stability of standard operations on matrices and vector spaces. We demonstrate that lattice-based methods surpass naive methods in many applications, such as matrix multiplication and sums and intersections of subspaces. We also analyze determinants , characteristic polynomials and LU factorization using these differential methods. We supplement our observations with numerical experiments.
