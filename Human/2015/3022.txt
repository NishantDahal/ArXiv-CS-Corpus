State of the art parallel approaches for RSA public key based cryptosystem

RSA is one of the most popular Public Key Cryptography based algorithm mainly used for digital signatures, encryption/decryption etc. It is based on the mathematical scheme of factorization of very large integers which is a compute-intensive process and takes very long time as well as power to perform. Several scientists are working throughout the world to increase the speedup and to decrease the power consumption of RSA algorithm while keeping the security of the algorithm intact. One popular technique which can be used to enhance the performance of RSA is parallel programming. In this paper we are presenting the survey of various parallel implementations of RSA algorithm involving variety of hardware and software implementations.
