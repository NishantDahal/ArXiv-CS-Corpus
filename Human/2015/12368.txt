Unveiling Architecture Documentation: Brazilian Stakeholders in Perspective

Over the years, software architecture has become a established discipline, both in academia and industry, and the interest on software architecture documentation has increased. In this context, the improvement of methods, tools, and techniques around architecture documentation is of paramount importance. We conducted a survey with 147 industrial participants (31 from Brazil), analyzing their current problems and future wishes. We identified that Brazilian stakeholders need updated architecture documents with the right information. Finally, the automation of some parts of the documentation will reduce the effort during the creation of the documents. But first, is necessary to change the culture of the stakeholders. They have to participate actively in the architecture documents creation.
