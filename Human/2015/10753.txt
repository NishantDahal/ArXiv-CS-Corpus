Transcoder Migration For Real Time Video Streaming Systems

The increase in real time ultra-high definition video services presents a challenging issue to current network infrastructures, because of its high bandwidth usage, which saturate network links. The required bandwidth is related to strict QoS requirements for digital media. There are systems in place currently to help reduce these problems, such as transcoders and application layer multicasting. However, these approaches are limited because they are usually implemented as static resources. In contrast, by using the OpenFlow based system presented in this paper, it is possible to provide a more effective approach using dynamic resources - by both optimally placing transcoders in the network, as well as by migrating them to different locations while the streaming is taking place. This migration mechanism provides a near seamless switchover with minimal interruption to the clients.
