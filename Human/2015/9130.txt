Complete Weight Enumerators of Some Linear Codes

Linear codes have been an interesting topic in both theory and practice for many years. In this paper, for an odd prime $p$, we determine the explicit complete weight enumerators of two classes of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and they may have applications in cryptography and secret sharing schemes. Moreover, some examples are included to illustrate our results.
