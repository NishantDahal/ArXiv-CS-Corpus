An improvement on fragmentation in Distribution Database Design Based on Knowledge-Oriented Clustering Techniques

The problem of optimizing distributed database includes: fragmentation and positioning data. Several different approaches and algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that builds the initial equivalence relation based on the distance threshold. This threshold is also based on knowledge- oriented clustering techniques for both of horizontal and vertical fragmentation. Similarity measures used in the algorithms are the measures developed from the classical measures. Experimental results carrying on the small data set match fragmented results based on the classical algorithm. Execution time and data fragmentation significantly reduced while the complexity of our algorithm in the general case is stable.
