Designing a Linked Data Migrational Framework for Singapore Government Datasets

The subject area of this report is Linked Data and its application to the Government domain. Linked Data is an alternative method of data representation that aims to interlink data from varied sources through relationships. Governments around the world have started publishing their data in this format to assist citizens in making better use of public services. This report provides an eight step migrational framework for converting Singapore Government data from legacy systems to Linked Data format. The framework formulation is based on a study of the Singapore data ecosystem with help from Infocomm Development Authority (iDA) of Singapore. Each step in the migrational framework has been constructed with objectives, recommendations, best practices and issues with entry and exit points. This work builds on the existing Linked Data literature, implementations in other countries and cookbooks provided by Linked Data researchers. iDA can use this report to gain an understanding of the effort and work involved in the implementation of Linked Data system on top of their legacy systems. The framework can be evaluated by building a Proof of Concept (POC) application.
