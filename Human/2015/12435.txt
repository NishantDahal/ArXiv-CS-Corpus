Region Based Energy Balanced Inter-cluster communication Protocol for Sensor networks

Wireless sensor networks faces unbalanced energy consumption problem over time. Clustering provides an energy efficient method to improve lifespan of the sensor network. Cluster head collects data from other nodes and transmits it towards the sink node. Cluster heads which are far-off from the sink, consumes more power in transmission of information towards the sink. We propose Region Based Energy Balanced Inter-cluster communication protocol (RBEBP) to improve lifespan of the sensor network. Monitored area has been divided into regions; cluster heads are selected from specific region based on the residual energy of nodes in that region. If energy of nodes of the specific region is low, nodes from another region are selected as cluster heads. Optimized selection of cluster heads helps in improving lifespan of the sensor network. In our scheme, cluster heads which are far-off from the sink use another cluster heads as the relay nodes to transmit their data to the sink node. So energy of cluster heads deplete in a uniform way and complete area remain covered by sensor nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that RBEBP can effectively reduce total energy depletion and considerably extend lifespan of the network as compared to LEACH protocol. RBEBP also minimize the problem of energy holes in monitored area and improve the throughput of the network
