Proceedings 14th International Workshop on Foundations of Coordination Languages and Self-Adaptive Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of FOCLASA 2015, the 14th International Workshop on the Foundations of Coordination Languages and Self-Adaptive Systems. FOCLASA 2015 was held in Madrid, Spain, on September 5, 2015 as a satellite event of CONCUR 2015, the 26th International Conference on Concurrency Theory.
  Modern software systems are distributed, concurrent, mobile, and often involve composition of heterogeneous components and stand-alone services. Service coordination and self-adaptation constitute the core characteristics of distributed and service-oriented systems. Coordination languages and formal approaches to modelling and reasoning about self-adaptive behaviour help to simplify the development of complex distributed service-based systems, enable functional correctness proofs, automated synthesis of correct-by-construction systems, and improve reusability and maintainability of such systems. The goal of the FOCLASA workshop is to put together researchers and practitioners of the aforementioned fields, to share and identify common problems, and to devise general solutions in the context of coordination languages and self-adaptive systems.
