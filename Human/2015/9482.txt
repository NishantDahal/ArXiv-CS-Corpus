Intersection-Link Representations of Graphs

We consider drawings of graphs that contain dense subgraphs. We introduce intersection-link representations for such graphs, in which each vertex $u$ is represented by a geometric object $R(u)$ and in which each edge $(u,v)$ is represented by the intersection between $R(u)$ and $R(v)$ if it belongs to a dense subgraph or by a curve connecting the boundaries of $R(u)$ and $R(v)$ otherwise. We study a notion of planarity, called Clique Planarity, for intersection-link representations of graphs in which the dense subgraphs are cliques.
