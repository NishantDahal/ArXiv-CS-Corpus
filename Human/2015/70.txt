Tejas Simulator : Validation against Hardware

In this report we show results that validate the Tejas architectural simulator against native hardware. We report mean error rates of 11.45% and 18.77% for the SPEC2006 and Splash2 benchmark suites respectively. These error rates are competitive and in most cases better than the numbers reported by other contemporary simulators.
