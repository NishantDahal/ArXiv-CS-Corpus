Type Targeted Testing

We present a new technique called type targeted testing, which translates precise refinement types into comprehensive test-suites. The key insight behind our approach is that through the lens of SMT solvers, refinement types can also be viewed as a high-level, declarative, test generation technique, wherein types are converted to SMT queries whose models can be decoded into concrete program inputs. Our approach enables the systematic and exhaustive testing of implementations from high-level declarative specifications, and furthermore, provides a gradual path from testing to full verification. We have implemented our approach as a Haskell testing tool called TARGET, and present an evaluation that shows how TARGET can be used to test a wide variety of properties and how it compares against state-of-the-art testing approaches.
