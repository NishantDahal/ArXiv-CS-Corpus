Cooperative spectrum sensing schemes with partial statistics knowledge

In this letter, we analyze the problem of detecting spectrum holes in cognitive radio systems. We consider that a group of unlicensed users can sense the radio signal energy, perform some simple processing and transmit the result to a central entity, where the decision about the presence or not of licensed users is made. We show that the proposed cooperative schemes present good performances even without any knowledge about the measurements statistics in the unlicensed users and with only partial knowledge of them in the central entity.
