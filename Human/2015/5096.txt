Robust analysis $\ell_1$-recovery from Gaussian measurements and total variation minimization

Analysis $\ell_1$-recovery refers to a technique of recovering a signal that is sparse in some transform domain from incomplete corrupted measurements. This includes total variation minimization as an important special case when the transform domain is generated by a difference operator. In the present paper we provide a bound on the number of Gaussian measurements required for successful recovery for total variation and for the case that the analysis operator is a frame. The bounds are particularly suitable when the sparsity of the analysis representation of the signal is not very small.
