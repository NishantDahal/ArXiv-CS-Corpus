Bibliothèques numériques et gamification : panorama et état de l'art

This article presents an overview of the main gamification projects for digital libraries, either for tagging or OCR correction. This overview is followed by a state of the art with functionalities, motivations, sociology of contributors and the scope of gamification compared to the serious games and explicit crowdsourcing. Finally a comparison of results between explicit crowdsourcing and gamification is proposed.
