Evaluation of Synchronous and Asynchronous Reactive Distributed Congestion Control Algorithms for the ITS G5 Vehicular Systems

The IEEE 802.11p is the technology dedicated to vehicular communications to support road safety, efficiency, and comfort applications. A large number of research activities have been carried out to study the characteristics of the IEEE 802.11p. The key weakness of the IEEE 802.11p is the channel congestion issue, where the wireless channel gets saturated when the road density increases. The European Telecommunications Standardization Institute (ETSI) is in the progress of studying the channel congestion problem and proposed so-called Reactive Distributed Congestion Control (DCC) algorithm as a solution to the congestion issue. In this report we investigate the impacts of the Reactive DCC mechanism in comparison to the conventional IEEE 802.11p with no congestion control. Our study shows that the Reactive DCC scheme creates oscillation on channel load that consequently degrades communication performance. The results reveal that the channel load oscillation is due to the fact that in the Reactive DCC, the individual CAM (Cooperative Awareness Message) controllers react to the channel congestion in a synchronized manner. To reduce the oscillation, in this report we propose a simple extension to Reactive DCC, Asynchronous Reactive DCC, in which the individual CAM controllers adopt randomized rate setting, which can significantly reduce the oscillation and improve the network performance.
