I,F-partitions of Sparse Graphs

A star $k$-coloring is a proper $k$-coloring where the union of two color classes induces a star forest. While every planar graph is 4-colorable, not every planar graph is star 4-colorable. One method to produce a star 4-coloring is to partition the vertex set into a 2-independent set and a forest; such a partition is called an I,F-partition. We use a combination of potential functions and discharging to prove that every graph with maximum average degree less than $\frac{5}{2}$ has an I,F-partition, which is sharp and answers a question of Cranston and West [A guide to the discharging method, arXiv:1306.4434]. This result implies that planar graphs of girth at least 10 are star 4-colorable, improving upon previous results of Bu, Cranston, Montassier, Raspaud, and Wang [Star coloring of sparse graphs, J. Graph Theory 62 (2009), 201-219].
