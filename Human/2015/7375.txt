Solving Polynomial Systems in the Cloud with Polynomial Homotopy Continuation

Polynomial systems occur in many fields of science and engineering. Polynomial homotopy continuation methods apply symbolic-numeric algorithms to solve polynomial systems. We describe the design and implementation of our web interface and reflect on the application of polynomial homotopy continuation methods to solve polynomial systems in the cloud. Via the graph isomorphism problem we organize and classify the polynomial systems we solved. The classification with the canonical form of a graph identifies newly submitted systems with systems that have already been solved.
