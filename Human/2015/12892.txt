Energy-Efficient Data Transmission with Non-FIFO Packets

This paper investigates the problem of energy-efficient packet transmission with arbitrary arrival instants and deadline constraints over a point-to-point Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. This is different from previous work where it is assumed that the packets follow a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order in that the packets that arrive earlier will have a deadline that is also earlier. We first investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions of the optimal transmission scheduler. We then propose an algorithm which finds the transmission schedule of each packet in the order of the packets with the largest transmission rate to the packets with the smallest transmission rate. Finally, we show that our algorithm satisfies the sufficient conditions of the optimal transmission scheduler and thus, is optimal.
