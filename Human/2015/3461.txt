A framework for trustworthiness assessment based on fidelity in cyber and physical domains

We introduce a method for the assessment of trust for n-open systems based on a measurement of fidelity and present a prototypic implementation of a complaint architecture. We construct a MAPE loop which monitors the compliance between corresponding figures of interest in cyber- and physical domains; derive measures of the system's trustworthiness; and use them to plan and execute actions aiming at guaranteeing system safety and resilience. We conclude with a view on our future work.
