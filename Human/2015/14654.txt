The History of Mobile Augmented Reality

This document summarizes the major milestones in mobile Augmented Reality between 1968 and 2014. Major parts of the list were compiled by the member of the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Handheld Augmented Reality in 2010 (author list in alphabetical order) for the ISMAR society. Later in 2013 it was updated, and more recent work was added during preparation of this report. Permission is granted to copy and modify.
