Function of Forgetfulness for the Tedium of Oblivion on Liquidity of Ontology Matching

The shallow and fragile knowledge on the Web does not examine in depth the things: it behaves lightly. The conditions created by the Web makes our attention labile and especially fickle, it's unable to concentrate for long as we are trained to "surf" without going though never in depth. The Web also brings with it the added advantage of a nearly availability infinite knowledge but leads to a loss of the ability to retain and evaluate that knowledge within us increasing forgetfulness of knowledge. In this paper we show how the "function of forgetfulness" appears linked to tedium and oblivion of knowledge through the liquidity of ontology matching.
