Graphs with no induced five-vertex path or antipath

We prove that a graph $G$ contains no induced $5$-vertex path and no induced complement of a $5$-vertex path if and only if $G$ is obtained from $5$-cycles and split graphs by repeatedly applying the following operations: substitution, split unification, and split unification in the complement, where split unification is a new class-preserving operation introduced here.
