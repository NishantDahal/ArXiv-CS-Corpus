Identification of stochastic operators

Based on the here developed functional analytic machinery we extend the theory of operator sampling and identification to apply to operators with stochastic spreading functions. We prove that identification with a delta train signal is possible for a large class of stochastic operators that have the property that the autocorrelation of the spreading function is supported on a set of 4D volume less than one and this support set does not have a defective structure. In fact, unlike in the case of deterministic operator identification, the geometry of the support set has a significant impact on the identifiability of the considered operator class. Also, we prove that, analogous to the deterministic case, the restriction of the 4D volume of a support set to be less or equal to one is necessary for identifiability of a stochastic operator class.
