Gender Issues & Information Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D): Prospects and Challenges for Women in Nigeria

Information and Communication Technology is a compendium of interrelated applications, products and services that can either deepen or alter gender equality. It has successfully transformed education, businesses, healthcare, entertainment, politics and good governance within the Global North; providing equitable access to developmental framework driven by ICTs. However, in drafting the core developmental objectives of sustainable development, there has been considerable gender digital divide limiting women access to resources based on their gender, ethnicity, socio-cultural bias and the rights to utilize such resources for development. In realization of the United Nation Millennium Development Goals within the Global South specifically Nigeria, women are often marginalized or excluded from ICT policy drafting and imbalance associated with ICT. This paper identifies and evaluates gender issues and information communication technology, with focus on the challenges and prospects for women empowerment in Nigeria. The study critically examined research literatures and conducted research survey on the prospects and challenges of promoting gender equality and women empowerment through ICTs; and identifies policy implication for Nigeria. The research survey used a random sampling technique with a target sample size of eighty respondents. Data gathered from the questionnaire was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 19, and the result was presented using ANOVA, and descriptive analysis. The study reveal gender inclusiveness in policy drafting as a key driver for socio-economic development, improved healthcare and women empowerment in Nigeria. We recommend a deliberate ICT policy that attract and encourages women participation in ICT developmental framework.
