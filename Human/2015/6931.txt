Trivergence of Probability Distributions, at glance

In this paper we introduce the intuitive notion of trivergence of probability distributions (TPD). This notion allow us to calculate the similarity among triplets of objects. For this computation, we can use the well known measures of probability divergences like Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon. Divergence measures may be used in Information Retrieval tasks as Automatic Text Summarization, Text Classification, among many others.
