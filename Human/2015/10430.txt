Approximate Joint MAP Detection of Co-Channel Signals

We consider joint detection of co-channel signals---specifically, signals which do not possess a natural separability due to, for example, the multiple access technique or the use of multiple antennas. Iterative joint detection and decoding is a well known approach for utilizing the error correction code to improve detection performance. However, the joint maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector may be prohibitively complex, especially in a multipath channel. In this paper, we present an approximation to the joint MAP detector motivated by a factor graph model of the received signal. The proposed algorithm is designed to approximate the joint MAP detector as closely as possible within the computational capability of the receiver.
