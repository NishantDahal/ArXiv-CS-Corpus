Sustainability and Reproducibility via Containerized Computing

Recent developments in the commercial open source community have catalysed the use of Linux containers for scalable deployment of web-based applications to the cloud. Scientific software can be containerized with dependencies, configuration files, post-processing tools and even simulation results, referred to as containerized computing. This new approach promises to significantly improve sustainability, productivity and reproducibility. We present our experiences, technology, and future plans for open source containerization of software used to model particle and radiation beams. Vagrant is central to our approach, using Docker for cloud deployment and VirtualBox virtual machines for deployment to Mac OS and Windows computers. Our technology enables seamless switching between the desktop and the cloud to simplify simulation development and execution.
