Logic Modelling

This is a reflection on the author's experience in teaching logic at the graduate level in a computer science department. The main lesson is that model building and the process of modelling must be placed at the centre stage of logic teaching. Furthermore, effective use must be supported with adequate tools. Finally, logic is the methodology underlying many applications, it is hence paramount to pass on its principles, methods and concepts to computer science audiences.
