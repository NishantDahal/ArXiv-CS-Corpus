Procedural Content Generation for GDL Descriptions of Simplified Boardgames

We present initial research towards procedural generation of Simplified Boardgames and translating them into an efficient GDL code. This is a step towards establishing Simplified Boardgames as a comparison class for General Game Playing agents. To generate playable, human readable, and balanced chess-like games we use an adaptive evolutionary algorithm with the fitness function based on simulated playouts. In future, we plan to use the proposed method to diversify and extend the set of GGP tournament games by those with fully automatically generated rules.
