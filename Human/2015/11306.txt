Receiver Algorithm based on Differential Signaling for SIMO Phase Noise Channels with Common and Separate Oscillator Configurations

In this paper, a receiver algorithm consisting of differential transmission and a two-stage detection for a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) phase-noise channels is studied. Specifically, the phases of the QAM modulated data symbols are manipulated before transmission in order to make them more immune to the random rotational effects of phase noise. At the receiver, a two-stage detector is implemented, which first detects the amplitude of the transmitted symbols from a nonlinear combination of the received signal amplitudes. Then in the second stage, the detector performs phase detection. The studied signaling method does not require transmission of any known symbols that act as pilots. Furthermore, no phase noise estimator (or a tracker) is needed at the receiver to compensate the effect of phase noise. This considerably reduces the complexity of the receiver structure. Moreover, it is observed that the studied algorithm can be used for the setups where a common local oscillator or separate independent oscillators drive the radio-frequency circuitries connected to each antenna. Due to the differential encoding/decoding of the phase, weighted averaging can be employed at a multi-antenna receiver, allowing for phase noise suppression to leverage the large number of antennas. Hence, we observe that the performance improves by increasing the number of antennas, especially in the separate oscillator case. Further increasing the number of receive antennas results in a performance error floor, which is a function of the quality of the oscillator at the transmitter.
