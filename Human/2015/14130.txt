BOAT: a cross-platform software for data analysis and numerical computing with arbitrary-precision

BOAT is a free cross-platform software for statistical data analysis and numerical computing. Thanks to its multiple-precision floating point engine, it allows arbitrary-precision calculations, whose digits of precision are only limited by the amount of memory of the host machine. At the core of the software is a simple and efficient expression language, whose use is facilitated by the assisted typing, the auto-complete engine and the built-in help for the syntax. In this paper a quick overview of the software is given. Detailed information, together with its applications to some case studies, is available at the BOAT web page.
