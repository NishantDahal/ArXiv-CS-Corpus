Distinct values of bilinear forms on algebraic curves

Let $B$ be a bilinear form on pairs of points in the complex plane, of the form $B(p,q) = p^TMq$, for an invertible $2\times2$ complex matrix $M$. We prove that any finite set $S$ contained in an irreducible algebraic curve $C$ of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{C}^2$ determines at least $c_d|S|^{4/3}$ distinct values of $B$, unless the curve $C$ has an exceptional form. This strengthens a result of Charalambides in several ways. The proof is based on that of Pach and De Zeeuw, who proved a similar statement for the Euclidean distance function in the real plane. Our main motivation for this paper is that for bilinear forms, this approach becomes more natural, and should better lend itself to understanding and generalization.
