Memristive fingerprints of electric arcs

We discuss the memristive fingerprints of the hybrid Cassie-Mayr model of electric arcs. In particular, it is shown that (i) the voltage-current characteristic of the model has the pinched hysteresis nature, (ii) the voltage and current zero crossings occur at the same instants, and, (iii) when the frequency $f$ of the power supply increases, the voltage-current pinched hysteresis characteristic tends closer to a single-valued one, meaning that the voltage-current graph becomes that of a resistor (with an increased linearity for $f\rightarrow \infty$). The conductance $g$ of the Cassie-Mayr model decreases when the frequency increases. The hybrid Cassie-Mayr model describes therefore an interesting case of a memristive phenomenon.
