A Note on "Efficient Algorithms for Secure Outsourcing of Bilinear Pairings"

We show that the verifying equations in the scheme [Theoretical Computer Science, 562 (2015), 112-121] cannot filter out some malformed values returned by the malicious servers. We also remark that the two untrusted programs model adopted in the scheme is somewhat artificial, and discuss some reasonable scenarios for outsourcing computations.
