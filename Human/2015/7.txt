Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile Display Brain-computer Interface -- A Small Robotic Arm Online Control Study

We report on an extended robot control application of a contact-less and airborne ultrasonic tactile display (AUTD) stimulus-based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, which received last year The Annual BCI Research Award 2014. In the award winning human communication augmentation paradigm the six palm positions are used to evoke somatosensory brain responses, in order to define a novel contactless tactile BCI. An example application of a small robot management is also presented in which the users control a small robot online.
