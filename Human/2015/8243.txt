C# Traceability System

Traceability information is a valuable asset that software development teams can leverage to minimise their risk during production and maintenance of software projects. When maintainers are added to a software project post-production, they have to learn the system from scratch and understand its dynamics before they can begin making appropriate modifications to the source code. The system outlined in this paper extracts traceability information directly from the source code of C# projects, and presents it in such a way that it can be easily used to understand the logic and validate changes to the system.
