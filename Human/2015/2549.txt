Mapping ceramics research and its evolution

We show here how a simple data mining of bibliographic records can be used to follow and help understand the evolution of a research domain, at a level that cannot be captured by reading individual papers in a field of this size. We illustrate the approach by investigating 43 years of research on ceramic materials, covered by 253k bibliographic records. The patterns of keywords used reveal the trends and the evolution of research ideas and priorities within the field. Simple, interactive tools based on co-word network analysis help us better appreciate the organization and relationships of ideas or individuals, and hopefully allow identification of unexplored concepts, connections, or approaches on a given topic.
