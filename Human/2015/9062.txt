Aspect OntoMaven - Aspect-Oriented Ontology Development and Configuration With OntoMaven

In agile ontology-based software engineering projects support for modular reuse of ontologies from large existing remote repositories, ontology project life cycle management, and transitive dependency management are important needs. The contribution of this paper is a new design artifact called OntoMaven combined with a unified approach to ontology modularization, aspect-oriented ontology development, which was inspired by aspect-oriented programming. OntoMaven adopts the Apache Maven-based development methodology and adapts its concepts to knowledge engineering for Maven-based ontology development and management of ontology artifacts in distributed ontology repositories. The combination with aspect-oriented ontology development allows for fine-grained, declarative configuration of ontology modules.
