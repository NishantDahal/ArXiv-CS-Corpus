Target localization in wireless sensor networks based on received signal strength

We consider the problem of localizing a target taking the help of a set of anchor beacon nodes.A small number of beacon nodes are deployed at known locations in the area.The target can detect a beacon provided it happens to lie within the beacons's transmission range.Thus, the target contains a measurement vector containing the readings of the beacons: '1' corresponding to a beacon if it is able to detect the target and '0' if the beacon is not able to detect the target.The goal is two fold: to determine the location of the target based on the binary measurement vector at the target and to study the behavior of the localization uncertainty as a function of the beacon transmission range and the number of beacons deployed.Beacon transmission range means signal strength of the beacon to transmit and receive the signals which is called as Received Signal Strength.To localize the target, we propose a grid mapping based approach, where the readings corresponding to locations on a grid overlaid on a region of interest are used to localize a target.To study the behavior of the localization uncertainty as a function of the sensing radius and number of beacons,extensive simulations and numerical experiments are carried out.The results provide insights into an importance of optimally setting the sensing radius and the improvement obtainable with increasing number of beacons.
