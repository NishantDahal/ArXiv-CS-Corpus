Refactoring Technical Support to Reduce Interrupts of Developers

In this paper an analysis of a technical support data with the goal of identifying process improvement actions for reducing interrupts is presented. A technical support chat is established and used to provide internal developer support to other development teams which use the software code developed by a core team. The paper shows how data analysis of a 6 months support time helped to identify gaps and action items for improving the technical support process to minimize interrupts from other developer teams. The paper also shows effects (advantages and drawbacks) of refactor actions taken based on this analysis.
