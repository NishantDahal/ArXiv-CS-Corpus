Convergence of T창tonnement in Fisher Markets

Analyzing simple and natural price-adjustment processes that converge to a market equilibrium is a fundamental question in economics. Such an analysis may have implications in economic theory, computational economics, and distributed systems. T창tonnement, proposed by Walras in 1874, is a process by which prices go up in response to excess demand, and down in response to excess supply. This paper analyzes the convergence of a time-discrete t창tonnement process, a problem that recently attracted considerable attention of computer scientists. We prove that the simple t창tonnement process that we consider converges (efficiently) to equilibrium prices and allocation in markets with nested CES-Leontief utilities, generalizing some of the previous convergence proofs for more restricted types of utility functions.
