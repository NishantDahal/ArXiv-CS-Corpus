Detection of Cyberbullying Incidents on the Instagram Social Network

Cyberbullying is a growing problem affecting more than half of all American teens. The main goal of this paper is to investigate fundamentally new approaches to understand and automatically detect incidents of cyberbullying over images in Instagram, a media-based mobile social network. To this end, we have collected a sample Instagram data set consisting of images and their associated comments, and designed a labeling study for cyberbullying as well as image content using human labelers at the crowd-sourced Crowdflower Web site. An analysis of the labeled data is then presented, including a study of correlations between different features and cyberbullying as well as cyberaggression. Using the labeled data, we further design and evaluate the accuracy of a classifier to automatically detect incidents of cyberbullying.
