The joint weight enumerator of an LCD code and its dual

A binary linear code is called {\em LCD} if it intersects its dual trivially. We show that the coefficients of the joint weight enumerator of such a code with its dual satisfy linear constraints, leading to a new linear programming bound on the size of an LCD code of given length and minimum distance. In addition, we show that this polynomial is, in general, an invariant of a matrix group of dimension $4$ and order $12$. Also, we sketch a Gleason formula for this weight enumerator.
