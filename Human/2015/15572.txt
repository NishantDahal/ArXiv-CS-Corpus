Stable Distributions as Noise Models for Molecular Communication

In this work, we consider diffusion-based molecular communication timing channels. Three different timing channels are presented based on three different modulation techniques, i.e., i) modulation of the release timing of the information particles, ii) modulation on the time between two consecutive information particles of the same type, and iii) modulation on the time between two consecutive information particles of different types. We show that each channel can be represented as an additive noise channel, where the noise follows one of the subclasses of stable distributions. We provide expressions for the probability density function of the noise terms, and numerical evaluations for the probability density function and cumulative density function. We also show that the tails are longer than Gaussian distribution, as expected.
