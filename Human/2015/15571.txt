There exists a theory of a single general-purpose learning algorithm which could explain the principles its operation. It assumes the initial rough architecture, a small library of simple innate circuits which are prewired at birth. and proposes that all significant mental algorithms are learned. Given current understanding and observations, this paper reviews and lists the ingredients of such an algorithm from architectural and functional perspectives.
