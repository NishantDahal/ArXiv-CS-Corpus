Barker sequences of odd length

A Barker sequence is a binary sequence for which all nontrivial aperiodic autocorrelations are at most 1 in magnitude. An old conjecture due to Turyn asserts that there is no Barker sequence of length greater than 13. In 1961, Turyn and Storer gave an elementary, though somewhat complicated, proof that this conjecture holds for odd lengths. We give a new and simpler proof of this result.
