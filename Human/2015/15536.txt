Securing Cloud - The Quantum Way

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are basic goals of security architecture. To ensure CIA, many authentication scheme has been introduced in several years. Currently deployment of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a most significant solution. PKI involving exchange key using certificates via a public channel to a authenticate users in the cloud infrastructure. It is exposed to widespread security threats such as eavesdropping, the man in the middle attack, masquerade et al. Quantum cryptography is of the most prominent fields in the modern world of information security. Quantum cryptography is considered to be a future replica of classical cryptography along with a vital stance to break existing classical cryptography. This paper aims to look into basic security architecture in place currently and further it tries to introduce a new proposed security architecture for cloud computing environment, which makes use of the knowledge of Quantum Mechanics and current advances in research in Quantum Computing, to provide a more secure architecture.
