Delayed Offloading using Cloud Cooperated Millimeter Wave Gates

Increasing wireless cellular networks capacity is one of the major challenges for the coming years, especially if we consider the annual doubling of mobile user traffic. Towards that and thanks to the fact that a significant amount of mobile data is indeed delay tolerable, in this paper, we suggest embedding the delayed offloading of some user traffic to be a part of future wireless cellular networks. To accomplish this, user delayed files will be offloaded using ultra-high speed Millimeter Wave (Mm-W) Gates. The Mm-W Gate, which will be distributed inside the Macro basestation (BS) area, consists of number of Mm-W Access Points (APs) controlled by a local coordinator installed inside the Gate. To effectively manage the delayed offloading mechanism, utilizing the concept of User/Control (U/C) data splitting, the Gates coordinators and the Macro BS are connected to the Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) through optical fiber links. Also, files offloading organizer software is used by the User Equipment (UE). A novel weighted proportional fairness (WPF) user scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the Gate Offloading Efficiency (GOFE) with maintaining long term fairness among the different mobility users pass through the Gate. If the Gate is properly designed and the files delay deadlines are properly set; near 100% GOFE with average reduction of 99.7% in UE energy consumption can be obtained, in time the user just passes through the Gate.
