A Method in Security of Wireless Sensor Network based on Optimized Artificial immune system in Multi-Agent Environments

Security in computer networks is one of the most interesting aspects of computer systems. It is typically represented by the initials CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and authentication or availability. Although, many access levels for data protection have been identified in computer networks, the intruders would still find lots of ways to harm sites and systems. The accommodation proceedings and the security supervision in the network systems, especially wireless sensor networks have been changed into a challenging point. One of the newest security algorithms for wireless sensor networks is Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithm. Human lymphocytes play the main role in recognizing and destroying the unknown elements. In this article, we focus on the inspiration of these defective systems to guarantee the complications security using two algorithms; the first algorithms proposed to distinguish self-nodes from non-self ones by the related factors and the second one is to eliminate the enemy node danger.The results showed a high rate success and good rate of detecting for unknown object; it could present the best nodes with high affinity and fitness to be selected to confront the unknown agents.
