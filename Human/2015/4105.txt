Key Rate of the B92 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Finite Qubits

The key rate of the B92 quantum key distribution protocol had not been reported before this research when the number of qubits is finite. We compute it by using the security analysis framework proposed by Scarani and Renner in 2008.
