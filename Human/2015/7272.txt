Binaural coherent-to-diffuse-ratio estimation for dereverberation using an ITD model

Most previously proposed dual-channel coherent-to-diffuse-ratio (CDR) estimators are based on a free-field model. When used for binaural signals, e.g., for dereverberation in binaural hearing aids, their performance may degrade due to the influence of the head, even when the direction-of-arrival of the desired speaker is exactly known. In this paper, the head shadowing effect is taken into account for CDR estimation by using a simplified model for the frequency-dependent interaural time difference and a model for the binaural coherence of the diffuse noise field. Evaluation of CDR-based dereverberation with measured binaural impulse responses indicates that the proposed binaural CDR estimators can improve PESQ scores.
