An uniform data replication algorithm in wireless micro-sensor network for communicating materials application

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have recently gained a great deal of attention as a topic of research, with a wide range of applications being explored such as communicating materials. Data dissemination and storage are very important issues for sensor networks. The problem of designing data dissemination protocols for communicating material needs different analyses related to storage density and uniformity which has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. This paper details storage protocol on the material by systematic dissemination through integrated wireless micro-sensors nodes. The performances of our solutions are evaluated through simulation using Castalia/OMNeT++. The results show that our algorithm provides uniform data storage in communicating material for different density level.
