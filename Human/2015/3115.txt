Quantum Algorithm for Monotonicity Testing on the Hypercube

In this note, we develop a bounded-error quantum algorithm that makes $\tilde O(n^{1/4}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ queries to a Boolean function $f$, accepts a monotone function, and rejects a function that is $\varepsilon$-far from being monotone. This gives a super-quadratic improvement compared to the best known randomized algorithm for all $\varepsilon = o(1)$. The improvement is cubic when $\varepsilon = 1/\sqrt{n}$.
