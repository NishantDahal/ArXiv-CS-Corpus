Numerical Methods for the Computation of the Confluent and Gauss Hypergeometric Functions

The two most commonly used hypergeometric functions are the confluent hypergeometric function and the Gauss hypergeometric function. We review the available techniques for accurate, fast, and reliable computation of these two hypergeometric functions in different parameter and variable regimes. The methods that we investigate include Taylor and asymptotic series computations, Gauss-Jacobi quadrature, numerical solution of differential equations, recurrence relations, and others. We discuss the results of numerical experiments used to determine the best methods, in practice, for each parameter and variable regime considered. We provide 'roadmaps' with our recommendation for which methods should be used in each situation.
