Interactive Logic Programming via Choice-Disjunctive Clauses

Adding interaction to logic programming is an essential task. Expressive logics such as linear logic provide a theoretical basis for such a mechanism. Unfortunately, none of the existing linear logic languages can model interactions with the user. This is because they uses provability as the sole basis for computation. We propose to use the game semantics instead of provability as the basis for computation to allow for more active participation from the user. We illustrate our idea via muprolog, an extension of Prolog with choice-disjunctive clauses.
