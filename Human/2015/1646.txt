On Projection Based Operators in Lp space for Exact Similarity Search

We investigate exact indexing for high dimensional Lp norms based on the 1-Lipschitz property and projection operators. The orthogonal projection that satisfies the 1-Lipschitz property for the Lp norm is described. The adaptive projection defined by the first principal component is introduced.
