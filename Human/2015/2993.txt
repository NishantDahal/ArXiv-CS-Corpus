An RFID-based Clinical Information System for Identification and Monitoring of Patients

Managing health-care records and information is an imperative necessity. Most patient health records are stored in separate systems and there are still huge paper trails of records that health-care providers must keep to comply with different regulations. This paper proposes an RFID-based system, named SIMOPAC, that integrate RFID technology in health care in order to make patient emergency care as efficient and risk-free as possible, by providing doctors with as much information about a patient as quickly as possible. Every hospital could use SIMOPAC with their existing system in order to promote patient safety and optimize hospital workflow. We will concentrate on the RFID technology and how it could be used in emergency care. We describe a general purpose architecture and data model that is designed for collecting ambulatory data from various existing devices and systems, as well as for storing and presenting clinically significant information to the emergency care physician.
