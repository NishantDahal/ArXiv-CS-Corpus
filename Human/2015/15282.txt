An Example for BeSpaceD and its Use for Decision Support in Industrial Automation

We describe our formal methods-based spatial reasoning framework BeSpaceD and its application in decision support for industrial automation. In particular we are supporting analysis and decisions based on formal models for industrial plant and mining operations. BeSpaceD is a framework for deciding geometric and topological properties of spatio-temporal models. We present an example and report on our ongoing experience with applications in different projects around software and cyber-physical systems engineering. The example features abstracted aspects of a production plant model. Using the example we motivate the use of our framework in the context of an existing software platform supporting monitoring, incident handling and maintenance of industrial automation facilities in remote locations.
