PDF Steganography based on Chinese Remainder Theorem

We propose different approaches of PDF files based steganography, essentially based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Here, after a cover PDF document has been released from unnecessary A0, a secret message is hidden in it using one of the proposed approaches, making it invisible to common PDF readers, and the file is then transmitted through a non-secure communication channel. Where each of our methods, ensure the condition that the number of inserted A0 is less than the number of characters of the secret message s.
