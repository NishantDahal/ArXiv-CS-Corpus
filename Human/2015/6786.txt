The Vector Space of Convex Curves: How to Mix Shapes

We present a novel, log-radius profile representation for convex curves and define a new operation for combining the shape features of curves. Unlike the standard, angle profile-based methods, this operation accurately combines the shape features in a visually intuitive manner. This method have implications in shape analysis as well as in investigating how the brain perceives and generates curved shapes and motions.
