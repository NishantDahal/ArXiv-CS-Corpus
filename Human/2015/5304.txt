Networking technologies for robotic applications

The ongoing progress in networking security, together with the growing range of robot applications in many fields of everyday life, makes robotics tangible reality in our near future. Accordingly, new advanced services, depends on the interplay between the robotics and cyber security, are being an important role in robotics world. This paper addresses technological implications of security enhancement to the Internet of Thing (IoT)-aided robotics domain, where networked robots are expected to work in complex environments. The security enhancement suggested by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) creates a security template for secure communications over the network are also discussed.
