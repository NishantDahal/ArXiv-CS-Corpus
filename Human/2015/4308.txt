A Feature-based Classification of Model Repair Approaches

Consistency management, the ability to detect, diagnose and handle inconsistencies, is crucial during the development process in Model-driven Engineering (MDE). As the popularity and application scenarios of MDE expanded, a variety of different techniques were proposed to address these tasks in specific contexts. Of the various stages of consistency management, this work focuses on inconsistency fixing in MDE, where such task is embodied by model repair techniques. This paper proposes a feature-based classification system for model repair techniques, based on an systematic review of previously proposed approaches. We expect this work to assist both the developers of novel techniques and the MDE practitioners looking for suitable solutions.
