Dynamic Topological Mapping with Biobotic Swarms

In this paper, we present an approach for dynamic exploration and mapping of unknown environments using a swarm of biobotic sensing agents, with a stochastic natural motion model and a leading agent (e.g., an unmanned aerial vehicle). The proposed robust mapping technique constructs a topological map of the environment using only encounter information from the swarm. A sliding window strategy is adopted in conjunction with a topological mapping strategy based on local interactions among the swarm in a coordinate-free fashion to obtain local maps of the environment. These maps are then merged into a global topological map which can be visualized using a graphical representation that integrates geometric as well as topological feature of the environment. Localized robust topological features are extracted using tools from topological data analysis. Simulation results have been presented to illustrate and verify the correctness of our dynamic mapping algorithm.
