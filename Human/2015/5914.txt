Representation of traces by vectors of words

We show that every trace monoid is isomorphic to a sub-monoid of a monoid of word vectors. It provides a concrete representation of the elements of a trace monoid as processes associated with a resource sharing mechanism. We illustrate this representation by obtaining some results on the ordering structure of the left divisibility relation on trace monoids.
