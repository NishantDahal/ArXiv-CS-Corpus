Scientometrics and Science Studies: From Words and Co-Words to Information and Probabilistic Entropy

The tension between qualitative theorizing and quantitative methods is pervasive in the social sciences, and poses a constant challenge to empirical research. But in science studies as an interdisciplinary specialty, there are additional reasons why a more reflexive consciousness of the differences among the relevant disciplines is necessary. How can qualitative insights from the history of ideas and the sociology of science be combined with the quantitative perspective? By using the example of the lexical and semantic value of word occurrences, the issue of qualitatively different meanings of the same phenomena is discussed as a methodological problem. Nine criteria for methods which are needed for the development of science studies as an integrated enterprise can then be specified. Information calculus is suggested as a method which can comply with these criteria.
