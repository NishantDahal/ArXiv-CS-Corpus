New Variational Method of Grid Generation with Prescribed Jacobian Determinant and Prescribed Curl

Adaptive grid generation is an active research topic for numer- ical solution of differential equations. In this paper, we propose a variational method which generates transformations with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl. Then we use this transformation to achieve adaptive grid generation task, and show the importance of curl in a transformation.
