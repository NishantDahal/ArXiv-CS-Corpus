On Temporal Regularity in Social Interactions: Predicting Mobile Phone Calls

In this paper we predict outgoing mobile phone calls using a machine learning approach. We analyze to which extent the activity of mobile phone users is predictable. The premise is that mobile phone users exhibit temporal regularity in their interactions with majority of their contacts. In the sociological context, most social interactions have fairly reliable temporal regularity. If we quantify the extension of this behavior to interactions on mobile phones we expect that caller-callee interaction is not merely a result of randomness, rather it exhibits a temporal pattern. To this end, we tested our approach on an anonymized mobile phone usage dataset collected specifically for analyzing temporal patterns in mobile phone communication. The data consists of 783 users and more than 12,000 caller-callee pairs. The results show that users' historic calling patterns can predict future calls with reasonable accuracy.
