Quantum Secret Sharing with error correction

We investigate in this work a quantum error correction on a five-qubits graph state used for secret sharing through five noisy channels. We describe the procedure for the five, seven and nine qubits codes. It is known that the three codes always allow error recovery if only one among the sents qubits is disturbed in the transmitting channel. However, if two qubits and more are disturbed, then the correction will depend on the used code.
