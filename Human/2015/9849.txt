Joint Source-Channel Coding for Broadcast Channel with Cooperating Receivers

It is known that, as opposed to point-to-point channel, separate source and channel coding is not optimal in general for sending correlated sources over multiuser channels. In some works joint source-channel coding has been investigated for some certain multiuser channels; i.g., multiple access channel (MAC) and broadcast channel (BC). In this paper, we obtain a sufficient condition for transmitting arbitrarily correlated sources over a discrete memoryless BC with cooperating receivers, where the receivers are allowed to exchange messages via a pair of noisy cooperative links. It is seen that our results is a general form of previous ones and includes them as its special cases.
