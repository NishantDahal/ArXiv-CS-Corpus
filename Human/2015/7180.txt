Series Representation of Modified Bessel Functions and Its Application in AF Cooperative systems

Using fractional-calculus mathematics, a novel approach is introduced to rewrite modified Bessel functions in series form using simple elementary functions. Then, a statistical characterization of the total receive-SNR at the destination, corresponding to the source-relay-destination and the source-destination link SNR, is provided for a general relaying scenario, in which the destination exploits a maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver. Using the novel statistical model for the total receive SNR at the destination, accurate and simple analytical expressions for the outage probability, the bit error probability and the ergodic capacity are obtained.
