A Comparison of Mechanisms for Integrating Handwritten and Generated Code for Object-Oriented Programming Languages

Code generation from models is a core activity in model-driven development (MDD). For complex systems it is usually impossible to generate the entire software system from models alone. Thus, MDD requires mechanisms for integrating generated and handwritten code. Applying such mechanisms without considering their effects can cause issues in projects with many model and code artifacts, where a sound integration for generated and handwritten code is necessary. We provide an overview of mechanisms for integrating generated and handwritten code for object-oriented languages. In addition to that, we define and apply criteria to compare these mechanisms. The results are intended to help MDD tool developers in choosing an appropriate integration mechanism.
