On the genetic optimization of APSK constellations for satellite broadcasting

Both satellite transmissions and DVB applications over satellite present peculiar characteristics that could be taken into consideration in order to further exploit the optimality of the transmission. In this paper, starting from the state-of-the-art, the optimization of the APSK constellation through asymmetric symbols arrangement is investigated for its use in satellite communications. In particular, the optimization problem is tackled by means of Genetic Algorithms that have already been demonstrated to work nicely with complex non-linear optimization problems like the one presented hereinafter. This work aims at studying the various parameters involved in the optimization routine in order to establish those that best fit this case, thus further enhancing the constellation.
