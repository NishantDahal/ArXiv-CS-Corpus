Architecture and Behavior Modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems with MontiArcAutomaton

This book presents MontiArcAutomaton, a modeling language for architecture and be- havior modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems as interactive Component & Connector mod- els. MontiArcAutomaton extends the Architecture Description Language MontiArc with automata to describe component behavior. The modeling language MontiArcAutomaton provides syntactical elements for defin- ing automata with states, variables, and transitions inside MontiArc components. These syntactical elements and a basic set of well-formedness rules provide the syntax for a fam- ily of modeling languages for state-based behavior modeling in Component & Connector architectures. We present two concrete language profiles with additional well-formedness rules to model time-synchronous component behavior and untimed, event-driven behav- ior of components. This book gives an overview of the MontiArcAutomaton language including examples, a language reference, and a context-free grammar for MontiArcAutomaton models. It also provides syntax definition, well-formedness rules, and semantics for two language profiles. We summarize projects and case studies applying MontiArcAutomaton. MontiArcAutomaton is implemented using the DSL framework MontiCore. Available tools include a textual editor with syntax highlighting and code completion as well as a graphical editor and a powerful and extensible code generation framework for target languages including EMF, Java, Mona, and Python.
