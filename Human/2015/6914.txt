A QoS Guarantee Strategy for Multimedia Conferencing based on Bayesian Networks

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is commonly employed in the design and implementation of web service systems. The key technology to enable media communications in the context of SOA is the Service Oriented Communication. To exploit the advantage of SOA, we design and implement a web-based multimedia conferencing system that provides users with a hybrid orchestration of web and communication services. As the current SOA lacks effective QoS guarantee solutions for multimedia services, the user satisfaction is greatly challenged with QoS violations, e.g., low video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and long playback delay. Motivated by addressing the critical problem, we firstly employ the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) service engine for the hybrid services orchestration and execution. Secondly, we propose a novel context-aware approach to quantify and leverage the causal relationships between QoS metrics and available contexts based on Bayesian networks (CABIN). This approach includes three phases: (1) information discretization, (2) causal relationship profiling, and (3) optimal context tuning. We implement CABIN in a real-life multimedia conferencing system and compare its performance with existing delay and throughput oriented schemes. Experimental results show that CABIN outperforms the competing approaches in improving the video quality in terms of PSNR. It also provides a one-stop shop controls both the web and communication services.
