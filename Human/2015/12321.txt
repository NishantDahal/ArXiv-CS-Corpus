Economics of Internet of Things (IoT): An Information Market Approach

Internet of things (IoT) has been proposed to be a new paradigm of connecting devices and providing services to various applications, e.g., transportation, energy, smart city, and healthcare. In this paper, we focus on an important issue, i.e., economics of IoT, that can have a great impact to the success of IoT applications. In particular, we adopt and present the information economics approach with its applications in IoT. We first review existing economic models developed for IoT services. Then, we outline two important topics of information economics which are pertinent to IoT, i.e., the value of information and information good pricing. Finally, we propose a game theoretic model to study the price competition of IoT sensing services. Some outlooks on future research directions of applying information economics to IoT are discussed.
