Design, Analysis, and Simulation of a Pipe-Welding Robot with Fixed Plinth

Industrial requirements concerning the increased efficiency and high rate of manufacturing result in the development of manufacturer robots, and a vast group of these types of robots is used for welding. This study presented the design, analysis, and simulation of a pipe-welding robot with fixed plinth for a constant circular welding around the pipes. Design of a welding robot capable of keeping the electrode orientation, welding speed, and distance between electrode and pipe surface constant can improve the quality of welding; thus, a five-linked articulated robot was designed for this purpose. Solving of direct and diverse kinematics and dynamics equations of the robot was done by means of Matlab software. The robot was also simulated using a program written in Matlab and the diagrams of angles, velocities, and accelerations of all the arms, and the applied force and torque of each arm required for drive the mechanism were obtained.
