A Multi-Agent System of Project Bidding Management Simulation

This paper presents a simulation model based on the general framework of Multi-Agent System (MAS) that can be used to investigate construction project bidding process. Specifically, it can be used to investigate different strategies in project bidding management from the general contractors' perspective. The effectiveness of the studied management strategies is evaluated by the quality, time and cost of bidding activities. As an implementation of MAS theory, this work is expected to test the suitability of MAS in studying construction management related problems.
