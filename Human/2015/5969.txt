An Algorithm for the Optimal Consistent Approximation to a Pairwise Comparisons Matrix by Orthogonal Projections

The algorithm for finding the optimal consistent approximation of an inconsistent pairwise comparisons matrix is based on a logarithmic transformation of a pairwise comparisons matrix into a vector space with the Euclidean metric. Orthogonal basis is introduced in the vector space. The orthogonal projection of the transformed matrix onto the space formed by the images of consistent matrices is the required consistent approximation.
