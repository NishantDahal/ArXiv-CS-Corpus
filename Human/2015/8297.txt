Two-point AG codes on the GK maximal curves

We determine de Weierstrass semigroup of a pair of certain rational points on the GK-curves. We use this semigroup to obtain two-point AG codes with better parameters than comparable one-point AG codes arising from these curves. These parameters are new records in the MinT's tables.
