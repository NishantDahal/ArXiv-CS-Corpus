Preprint Virtual Reality Assistant Technology for Learning Primary Geography

This is the preprint version of our paper on ICWL2015. A virtual reality based enhanced technology for learning primary geography is proposed, which synthesizes several latest information technologies including virtual reality(VR), 3D geographical information system(GIS), 3D visualization and multimodal human-computer-interaction (HCI). The main functions of the proposed system are introduced, i.e. Buffer analysis, Overlay analysis, Space convex hull calculation, Space convex decomposition, 3D topology analysis and 3D space intersection detection. The multimodal technologies are employed in the system to enhance the immersive perception of the users.
