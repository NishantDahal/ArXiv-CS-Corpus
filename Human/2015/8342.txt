On the Conservation of Number of Nodes and the Consumed Energy in Wireless Sensor Network: A Statistical Mechanics Approach

The dominant dynamics of sensor networks consist of using the energy of the sensor nodes to create the topology of hierarchical clustering using topology control protocols. The topology thus created will always have optimum number of nodes after using a certain amount of energy, vice versa optimum amount of energy expense to use a certain number of nodes. This paper attempts to find a relation between the number of nodes and the energy consumed using statistical mechanics. This relationship thus obtained validates considerably well with the simulation experiments with topology control protocols
