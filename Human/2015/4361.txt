Computational Modeling of an MRI Guided Drug Delivery System Based on Magnetic Nanoparticle Aggregations for the Navigation of Paramagnetic Nanocapsules

A computational method for magnetically guided drug delivery is presented and the results are compared for the aggregation process of magnetic particles within a fluid environment. The model is developed for the simulation of the aggregation patterns of magnetic nanoparticles under the influence of MRI magnetic coils. A novel approach for the calculation of the drag coefficient of aggregates is presented. The comparison against experimental and numerical results from the literature is showed that the proposed method predicts well the aggregations in respect to their size and pattern dependance, on the concentration and the strength of the magnetic field, as well as their velocity when particles are driven through the fluid by magnetic gradients.
