Model-based Hazard and Impact Analysis

Hazard and impact analysis is an indispensable task during the specification and development of safety-critical technical systems, and particularly of their software-intensive control parts. There is a lack of methods supporting an effective (reusable, automated) and integrated (cross-disciplinary) way to carry out such analyses.
  This report was motivated by an industrial project whose goal was to survey and propose methods and models for documentation and analysis of a system and its environment to support hazard and impact analysis as an important task of safety engineering and system development. We present and investigate three perspectives of how to properly encode safety-relevant domain knowledge for better reuse and automation, identify and assess all relevant hazards, as well as pre-process this information and make it easily accessible for reuse in other safety and systems engineering activities and, moreover, in similar engineering projects.
