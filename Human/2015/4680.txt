Stable Signal Recovery from Phaseless Measurements

The aim of this paper is to study the stability of the $\ell_1$ minimization for the compressive phase retrieval and to extend the instance-optimality in compressed sensing to the real phase retrieval setting. We first show that the $m={\mathcal O}(k\log(N/k))$ measurements is enough to guarantee the $\ell_1$ minimization to recover $k$-sparse signals stably provided the measurement matrix $A$ satisfies the strong RIP property. We second investigate the phaseless instance-optimality with presenting a null space property of the measurement matrix $A$ under which there exists a decoder $Î”$ so that the phaseless instance-optimality holds. We use the result to study the phaseless instance-optimality for the $\ell_1$ norm. The results build a parallel for compressive phase retrieval with the classical compressive sensing.
