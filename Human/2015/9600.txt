A solution for applying IEC 61499 function blocks in the development of substation automation systems

This paper presents a solution for applying IEC 61499 function blocks along with IEC 61850 specifications in modeling and implementing control applications for substations automation. The IEC 61499 artifacts are used for structuring the control logic, while the IEC 61850 concepts for communication and information exchange between the automation devices. The proposed control architecture was implemented and validated in a simple fault protection scenario with simulated power equipment.
