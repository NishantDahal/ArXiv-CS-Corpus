Multiple-Input Multiple-Output OFDM with Index Modulation

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM) is a novel multicarrier transmission technique which has been proposed as an alternative to classical OFDM. The main idea of OFDM-IM is the use of the indices of the active subcarriers in an OFDM system as an additional source of information. In this work, we propose multiple-input multiple-output OFDM-IM (MIMO-OFDM-IM) scheme by combining OFDM-IM and MIMO transmission techniques. The low complexity transceiver structure of the MIMO-OFDM-IM scheme is developed and it is shown via computer simulations that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-IM scheme achieves significantly better error performance than classical MIMO-OFDM for several different system configurations.
