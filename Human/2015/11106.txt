Models and Representations for Fractal Social Organizations

Our subject is oriented towards investigation of potential ways of societal organization, that allow for collective intelligent organization and management of resources. The main objective of such organizations is the exploration of the social energy from the existing societies. We conjecture that an organizational model that fulfills the mentioned requirements is the Fractal Social Organization (FSO). Our goal is to prove and verify the effectiveness of this model by performing various simulations using the NetLogo environment, a tool that allows agent-based rapid prototyping. We begin by simulating trivial real life activities that demonstrate the main properties of the core unit of the FSO, namely the SoC. Further, more complex scenarios involving various nested SoCs are simulated. Two main simulation models are presented, allowing us to obtain preliminary results using the FSO concepts as a potential solution. In the first simulation model we demonstrate that by the use of FSO properties the individuals may benefit by receiving more qualitative healthcare services, while in the second simulation model we show how it might be possible to improve the fall detection systems by the use of FSO mechanism.
