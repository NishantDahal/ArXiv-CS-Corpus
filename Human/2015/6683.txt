Second-Order Statistics of $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels

In this paper, novel closed-form expressions for the level crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of $κ-μ$ shadowed fading channels are derived. The new equations provide the capability of modeling the correlation between the time derivative of the shadowed dominant and multipath components of the $κ-μ$ shadowed fading envelope. Verification of the new equations is performed by reduction to a number of known special cases. It is shown that as the shadowing of the resultant dominant component decreases, the signal crosses lower threshold levels at a reduced rate. Furthermore, the impact of increasing correlation between the slope of the shadowed dominant and multipath components similarly acts to reduce crossings at lower signal levels. The new expressions for the second-order statistics are also compared with field measurements obtained for cellular device-to-device and body centric communications channels which are known to be susceptible to shadowed fading.
