New Invariants for the Graph Isomorphism Problem

In this paper we introduce a novel polynomial-time algorithm to compute graph invariants based on the modified random walk idea on graphs. However not proved to be a full graph invariant by now, our method gives the right answer for the graph instances other well-known methods could not compute (such as special Furer Gadgets and point-line incidence graphs of finite projective planes of higher degrees
