Framework for Version Control & Dependency Link of Components & Products in a Software Product Line

Software product line deals with the assembly of products from existing core assets commonly known as components and continuous growth in the core assets as we proceed with production. This idea has emerged as vital in terms of software development from component-based architecture. Since in software product line one has to deal with number of products and components simultaneous therefore there is a need to develop a strategy, which will help to store components and products information in such a way that they can be traced easily for further development. This storage strategy should reflect a relationship between products and components so that product history with reference to components can be traced and vise versa. In this paper we have presented a tree structure based storage strategy for components and products in software product line. This strategy will enable us to store the vital information about components and products with a relationship of their composition and utilization. We implemented this concept and simulated the software product line environment.
