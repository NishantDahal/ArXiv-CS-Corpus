A low-complexity 2D signal space diversity solution for future broadcasting systems

-DVB-T2 was the first industrial standard deploying rotated and cyclic Q delayed (RCQD)modulation to improve performance over fading channels. This enablesimportantgains compared toconventional quadrature amplitude modulations(QAM) under severe channel conditions.However, the corresponding demodulation complexitystill prevents its use forwider applications. This paper proposes several rotation angles for different QAM constellations anda corresponding low-complexity detection method. Results show that the proposed solution simplifies both the transmitter and the receiver with often betterperformancethan the proposed angles in DVB-T2. Compared with the lowest complexity demappers currently used in DVB-T2, the proposed solution achieves an additional reduction bymore than 60%.
