A Roofline Visualization Framework

The Roofline Model and its derivatives provide an intuitive representation of the best achievable performance on a given architecture. The Roofline Toolkit project is a collaboration among researchers at Argonne National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the University of Oregon and consists of three main parts: hardware characterization, software characterization, and data manipulation and visualization interface. These components address the different aspects of performance data acquisition and manipulation required for performance analysis, modeling and optimization of codes on existing and emerging architectures. In this paper we introduce an initial implementation of the third component, a system for visualizing roofline charts and managing roofline performance analysis data. We discuss the implementation and rationale for the integration of the roofline visualization system into the Eclipse IDE. An overview of our continuing efforts and goals in the development of this project is provided.
