A Novel Approach for Image Steganography in Spatial Domain

This paper presents a new approach for hiding information in digital image in spatial domain. In this approach three bits of message is embedded in a pixel using Lucas number system but only one bit plane is allowed for alternation. The experimental results show that the proposed method has the larger capacity of embedding data, high peak signal to noise ratio compared to existing methods and is hardly detectable for steganolysis algorithm.
