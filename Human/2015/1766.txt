Circuit Level Modeling of Extra Combinational Delays in SRAM FPGAs Due to Transient Ionizing Radiation

This paper presents a novel circuit level model that explains and confirms the extra combinational delays in a SRAM-FPGA (Virtex-5) due to radiation, which matches the experimental results by proton irradiation at TRIUMF.
