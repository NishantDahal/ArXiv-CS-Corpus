Robust High Quality Image Guided Depth Upsampling

Time-of-Flight (ToF) depth sensing camera is able to obtain depth maps at a high frame rate. However, its low resolution and sensitivity to the noise are always a concern. A popular solution is upsampling the obtained noisy low resolution depth map with the guidance of the companion high resolution color image. However, due to the constrains in the existing upsampling models, the high resolution depth map obtained in such way may suffer from either texture copy artifacts or blur of depth discontinuity. In this paper, a novel optimization framework is proposed with the brand new data term and smoothness term. The comprehensive experiments using both synthetic data and real data show that the proposed method well tackles the problem of texture copy artifacts and blur of depth discontinuity. It also demonstrates sufficient robustness to the noise. Moreover, a data driven scheme is proposed to adaptively estimate the parameter in the upsampling optimization framework. The encouraging performance is maintained even in the case of large upsampling e.g. $8\times$ and $16\times$.
