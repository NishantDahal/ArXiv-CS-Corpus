A System Structure for Adaptive Mobile Applications

A system structure for adaptive mobile applications is introduced and discussed, together with a compliant architecture and a prototypic implementation. A methodology is also introduced, which exploits our structure to decompose the behavior of non stable systems into a set of quasi-stable scenarios. Within each of these scenarios we can exploit the knowledge of the available QoS figures to express simpler and better adaptation strategies.
