Functional Programming is Free

A paper has recently been published in SIAM-JC. This paper is faulty: 1) The standard requirements about the definition of an algorithm are not respected, 2) The main point in the complexity study, namely the functional programming component, is absent. The Editorial Board of the SIAM JC had been warned a confirmed publication would be openly commented, it is the role of this text.
