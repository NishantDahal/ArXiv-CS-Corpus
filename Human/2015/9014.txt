SQL for SRL: Structure Learning Inside a Database System

The position we advocate in this paper is that relational algebra can provide a unified language for both representing and computing with statistical-relational objects, much as linear algebra does for traditional single-table machine learning. Relational algebra is implemented in the Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the basis of relational database management systems. To support our position, we have developed the FACTORBASE system, which uses SQL as a high-level scripting language for statistical-relational learning of a graphical model structure. The design philosophy of FACTORBASE is to manage statistical models as first-class citizens inside a database. Our implementation shows how our SQL constructs in FACTORBASE facilitate fast, modular, and reliable program development. Empirical evidence from six benchmark databases indicates that leveraging database system capabilities achieves scalable model structure learning.
