The Utility of Untangling

In this note we show how techniques developed for untangling planar graphs by Bose et al. [Discrete & Computational Geometry 42(4): 570-585 (2009)] and Goaoc et al. [Discrete & Com- putational Geometry 42(4): 542-569 (2009)] imply new results about some recent graph drawing models. These include column planarity, universal point subsets, and partial simultaneous geometric embeddings (with or without mappings). Some of these results answer open problems posed in previous papers.
