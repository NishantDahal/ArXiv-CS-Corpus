Study of Structured Root-LDPC Codes and PEG Techniques for Block-Fading Channels

In this work, we propose structured Root-Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and design techniques for block-fading channels. In particular, Quasi-Cyclic Root-LDPC codes, Irregular repeat-accumulate Root-LDPC codes and Controlled Doping Root-LDPC codes based on Progressive Edge Growth (PEG) techniques for block-fading channels are proposed. The proposed Root-LDPC codes are both suitable for channels under $F = 2, 3$ and $4$ independent fading per codeword. The performance of the proposed codes is investigated in terms of Frame Error Rate (FER). The proposed Root-LDPC codes are capable of achieving the channel diversity and outperform standard LDPC codes. For block-fading channel with $F = 2$ our proposed PEG-based Root-LDPC codes outperform PEG-based LDPC codes by $7.5$dB at a FER close to $10^{-3}$.
