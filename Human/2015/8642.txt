RAESON: A Tool for Reasoning Tasks Driven by Interactive Visualization of Logical Structure

The paper presents a software tool for analysis and interactive engagement in various logical reasoning tasks. A first feature of the program consists in providing an interface for working with logic-specific repositories of formal knowledge. A second feature provides the means to intuitively visualize and interactively generate the underlying logical structure that propels customary logical reasoning tasks. Starting from this we argue that both aspects have didactic potential and can be integrated in teaching activities to provide an engaging learning experience.
