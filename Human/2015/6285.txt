Strategies for High-Throughput FPGA-based QC-LDPC Decoder Architecture

We propose without loss of generality strategies to achieve a high-throughput FPGA-based architecture for a QC-LDPC code based on a circulant-1 identity matrix construction. We present a novel representation of the parity-check matrix (PCM) providing a multi-fold throughput gain. Splitting of the node processing algorithm enables us to achieve pipelining of blocks and hence layers. By partitioning the PCM into not only layers but superlayers we derive an upper bound on the pipelining depth for the compact representation. To validate the architecture, a decoder for the IEEE 802.11n (2012) QC-LDPC is implemented on the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA with the help of the FPGA IP compiler [2] available in the NI LabVIEW Communication System Design Suite (CSDS) which offers an automated and systematic compilation flow where an optimized hardware implementation from the LDPC algorithm was generated in approximately 3 minutes, achieving an overall throughput of 608Mb/s (at 260MHz). As per our knowledge this is the fastest implementation of the IEEE 802.11n QC-LDPC decoder using an algorithmic compiler.
