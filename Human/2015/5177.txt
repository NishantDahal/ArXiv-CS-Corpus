Quantum Noise Filtering via Cross-Correlations

Motivated by successful classical models for noise reduction, we suggest a quantum technique for filtering noise out of quantum states. The purpose of this paper is twofold: presenting a simple construction of quantum cross-correlations between two wave-functions, and presenting a scheme for a quantum noise filtering. We follow a well-known scheme in classical communication theory that attenuates random noise, and show that one can build a quantum analog by using non-trace-preserving operators. By this we introduce a classically motivated signal processing scheme to quantum information theory, which can help reducing quantum noise, and particularly, phase flip noise.
