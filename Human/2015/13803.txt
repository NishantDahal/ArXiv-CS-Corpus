Stateless multicast switching in software defined networks

Multicast data delivery can significantly reduce traffic in operators' networks, but has been limited in deployment due to concerns such as the scalability of state management. This paper shows how multicast can be implemented in contemporary software defined networking (SDN) switches, with less state than existing unicast switching strategies, by utilising a Bloom Filter (BF) based switching technique. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism uses only proactive rule insertion, and thus, is not limited by congestion or delay incurred by reactive controller-aided rule insertion. We compare our solution against common switching mechanisms such as layer-2 switching and MPLS in realistic network topologies by modelling the TCAM state sizes in SDN switches. The results demonstrate that our approach has significantly smaller state size compared to existing mechanisms and thus is a multicast switching solution for next generation networks.
