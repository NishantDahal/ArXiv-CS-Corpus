A Comparative Study of Polar Code Constructions for the AWGN Channel

We present a comparative study of the performance of various polar code constructions in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. A polar code construction is any algorithm that selects $K$ best among $N$ possible polar bit-channels at the design signal-to-noise-ratio (design-SNR) in terms of bit error rate (BER). Optimal polar code construction is hard and therefore many suboptimal polar code constructions have been proposed at different computational complexities. Polar codes are also non-universal meaning the code changes significantly with the design-SNR. However, it is not known which construction algorithm at what design-SNR constructs the best polar codes. We first present a comprehensive survey of all the well-known polar code constructions along with their full implementations. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to find the best design-SNR for constructing best possible polar codes from a given construction algorithm. The proposed algorithm involves a search among several possible design-SNRs. We finally use our algorithm to perform a comparison of different construction algorithms using extensive simulations. We find that all polar code construction algorithms generate equally good polar codes in an AWGN channel, if the design-SNR is optimized.
