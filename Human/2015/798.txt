A New Method for Signal and Image Analysis: The Square Wave Method

A brief review is provided of the use of the Square Wave Method (SWM) in the field of signal and image analysis and it is specified how results thus obtained are expressed using the Square Wave Transform (SWT), in the frequency domain. To illustrate the new approach introduced in this field, the results of two cases are analyzed: a) a sequence of samples (that is, measured values) of an electromyographic recording; and b) the classic image of Lenna.
