Application of Machine Learning Techniques in Human Activity Recognition

Human activity detection has seen a tremendous growth in the last decade playing a major role in the field of pervasive computing. This emerging popularity can be attributed to its myriad of real-life applications primarily dealing with human-centric problems like healthcare and elder care. Many research attempts with data mining and machine learning techniques have been undergoing to accurately detect human activities for e-health systems. This paper reviews some of the predictive data mining algorithms and compares the accuracy and performances of these models. A discussion on the future research directions is subsequently offered.
