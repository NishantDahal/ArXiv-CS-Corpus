A catalog of matchstick graphs

Classification of planar unit-distance graphs with up to 9 edges, by homeomorphism and isomorphism classes. With exactly nine edges, there are 633 nonisomorphic connected matchstick graphs, of which 196 are topologically distinct from each other. Increasing edges' number, their quantities rise more than exponentially, in a still unclear way.
