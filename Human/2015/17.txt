A Study of the Matter of SPH Application to Saturated Soil Problems

We present an application of SPH to saturated soilproblems. Herein, the standard SPH formulation was improved to model saturated soil. It is shown that the proposed formulation could yield several advantages such as: it takes into account the pore-water pressure in an accurate manner, it automatically satisfies the dynamics boundary conditions between submerged soil and water, and it reduced the computational cost. Discussions on the use of the standard and the new SPH formulations are also given through some numerical tests. Furthermore, some techniques to obtained correct SPH solution are also proposed and discussed. To the end, this paper suggests that the proposed SPH formulation should be considered as the basic formulation for further developments of SPH for soil-water couple problems
