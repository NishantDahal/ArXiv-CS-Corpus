Joint Ranging and Clock Parameter Estimation by Wireless Round Trip Time Measurements

In this paper we develop a new technique for estimating fine clock errors and range between two nodes simultaneously by two-way time-of-arrival measurements us- ing impulse-radio ultra-wideband signals. Estimators for clock parameters and the range are proposed that are robust with respect to outliers. They are analyzed numerically and by means of experimental measurement campaigns. The technique and derived estimators achieve accuracies below 1Hz for frequency estimation, below 1 ns for phase estimation and 20 cm for range estimation, at 4m distance using 100MHz clocks at both nodes. Therefore, we show that the proposed joint approach is practical and can simultaneously provide clock synchronization and positioning in an experimental system.
