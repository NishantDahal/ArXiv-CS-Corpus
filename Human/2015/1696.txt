Separation of sinusoidal and chirp components using Compressive sensing approach

In this paper we deal with the linear frequency modulated signals and radar signals that are affected by disturbance which is the inevitable phenomenon in everyday communications. The considered cases represent the cases when the signals of interest overlap with other signals or with noise. In order to successfully separate these signals we propose the compressive sensing method, which states that the useful signal part can be separated successfully from a small amount of measurements as long as the acquired signal can be presented as sparse in a certain transformation domain. The effectiveness of our approach is proven experimentally through examples.
