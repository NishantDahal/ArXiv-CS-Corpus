Towards a general framework for an observation and knowledge based model of occupant behaviour in office buildings

This paper proposes a new general approach based on Bayesian networks to model the human behaviour. This approach represents human behaviour withprobabilistic cause-effect relations based not only on previous works, but also with conditional probabilities coming either from expert knowledge or deduced from observations. The approach has been used in the co-simulation of building physics and human behaviour in order to assess the CO 2 concentration in an office.
