Probabilistic Output Analysis by Program Manipulation

The aim of a probabilistic output analysis is to derive a probability distribution of possible output values for a program from a probability distribution of its input.  We present a method for performing static output analysis, based on program transformation techniques.  It generates a probability function as a possibly uncomputable expression in an intermediate language. This program is then analyzed, transformed, and approximated.  The result is a closed form expression that computes an over approximation of the output probability distribution for the program.  We focus on programs where the possible input follows a known probability distribution.  Tests in programs are not assumed to satisfy the Markov property of having fixed branching probabilities independently of previous history.
