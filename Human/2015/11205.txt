Feasible methodology for optimization of a novel reversible binary compressor

Now a day reversible logic is an attractive research area due to its low power consumption in the area of VLSI circuit design. The reversible logic gate is utilized to optimize power consumption by a feature of retrieving input logic from an output logic because of bijective mapping between input and output. In this manuscript, we design 4 2 and 5 2 reversible compressor circuits using a new type of reversible gate. In addition, we propose new gate, named as inventive0 gate for optimizing a compressor circuit. The utility of the inventive0 gate is that it can be used as full adder and full subtraction with low value of garbage outputs and quantum cost. An algorithm is shown for designing a compressor structure. The comparative study shows that the proposed compressor structure outperforms the existing ones in terms of garbage outputs, number of gates and quantum cost. The compressor can reduce the effect of carry (Produce from full adder) of the arithmetic frame design. In addition, we implement a basic reversible gate of MOS transistor with less number of MOS transistor count.
