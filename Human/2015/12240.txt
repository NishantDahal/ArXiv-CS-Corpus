Blocking Methods Applied to Casualty Records from the Syrian Conflict

Estimation of death counts and associated standard errors is of great importance in armed conflict such as the ongoing violence in Syria, as well as historical conflicts in Guatemala, Perú, Colombia, Timor Leste, and Kosovo. For example, statistical estimates of death counts were cited as important evidence in the trial of General Efraín Ríos Montt for acts of genocide in Guatemala. Estimation relies on both record linkage and multiple systems estimation. A key first step in this process is identifying ways to partition the records such that they are computationally manageable. This step is referred to as blocking and is a major challenge for the Syrian database since it is sparse in the number of duplicate records and feature poor in its attributes. As a consequence, we propose locality sensitive hashing (LSH) methods to overcome these challenges. We demonstrate the computational superiority and error rates of these methods by comparing our proposed approach with others in the literature. We conclude with a discussion of many challenges of merging LSH with record linkage to achieve an estimate of the number of uniquely documented deaths in the Syrian conflict.
