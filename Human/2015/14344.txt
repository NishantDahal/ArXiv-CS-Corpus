An exploration of fetish social networks and communities

Online Social Networks (OSNs) provide a venue for virtual interactions and relationships between individuals. In some communities, OSNs also facilitate arranging online meetings and relationships. FetLife, the worlds largest anonymous social network for the BDSM, fetish and kink communities, provides a unique example of an OSN that serves as an interaction space, community organizing tool, and sexual market. In this paper, we present a first look at the characteristics of European members of Fetlife, comprising 504,416 individual nodes with 1,912,196 connections. We looked at user characteristics in terms of gender, sexual orientation, and preferred role. We further examined the topological and structural properties of groups, as well as the type of interactions and relations between their members. Our results suggest there are important differences between the FetLife community and conventional OSNs. The network can be characterised by complex gender based interactions both from a sexual market and platonic viewpoint which point to a truly fascinating social network.
