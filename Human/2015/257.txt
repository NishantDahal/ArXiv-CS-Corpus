Sketch and Validate for Big Data Clustering

In response to the need for learning tools tuned to big data analytics, the present paper introduces a framework for efficient clustering of huge sets of (possibly high-dimensional) data. Building on random sampling and consensus (RANSAC) ideas pursued earlier in a different (computer vision) context for robust regression, a suite of novel dimensionality and set-reduction algorithms is developed. The advocated sketch-and-validate (SkeVa) family includes two algorithms that rely on K-means clustering per iteration on reduced number of dimensions and/or feature vectors: The first operates in a batch fashion, while the second sequential one offers computational efficiency and suitability with streaming modes of operation. For clustering even nonlinearly separable vectors, the SkeVa family offers also a member based on user-selected kernel functions. Further trading off performance for reduced complexity, a fourth member of the SkeVa family is based on a divergence criterion for selecting proper minimal subsets of feature variables and vectors, thus bypassing the need for K-means clustering per iteration. Extensive numerical tests on synthetic and real data sets highlight the potential of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate their competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art random projection alternatives.
