Proceedings Third International Workshop on Linearity

This volume contains the papers presented at LINEARITY 2014, the Third International Workshop on Linearity, held on July 13, 2014 in Vienna, Austria.  The workshop was a one-day satellite event of FLoC 2014, the sixth Federated Logic Conference.  It was held as part of the 2014 Vienna Summer of Logic.
  The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers who are exploring theory and applications of linear calculi, to foster their interaction and provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Of interest were new results that made a central use of linearity, ranging from foundational work to applications in any field.  This included: sub-linear logics, linear term calculi, linear type systems, linear proof-theory, linear programming languages, applications to concurrency, interaction-based systems, verification of linear systems, quantum models of computation, and biological and chemical models of computation.
