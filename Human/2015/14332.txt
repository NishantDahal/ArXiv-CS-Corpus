Distributed Rate and Power Control in Vehicular Networks

The focus of this paper is on the rate and power control algorithms in Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) for vehicular networks. We first propose a utility maximization framework by leveraging the well-developed network congestion control, and formulate two subproblems, one on rate control with fixed transmit powers and the other on power control with fixed rates. Distributed rate control and power control algorithms are developed to solve these two subproblems, respectively, and are proved to be asymptotically optimal. Joint rate and power control can be done by using the two algorithms in an alternating fashion. The performance enhancement of our algorithms compared with a recent rate control algorithm, called EMBARC, is evaluated by using the network simulator ns2.
