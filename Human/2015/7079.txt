Depth Perception in Autostereograms: 1/f-Noise is Best

An autostereogram is a single image that encodes depth information that pops out when looking at it. The trick is achieved by replicating a vertical strip that sets a basic two-dimensional pattern with disparity shifts that encode a three-dimensional scene. It is of interest to explore the dependency between the ease of perceiving depth in autostereograms and the choice of the basic pattern used for generating them. In this work we confirm a theory proposed by Bruckstein et al. to explain the process of autostereographic depth perception, providing a measure for the ease of "locking into" the depth profile, based on the spectral properties of the basic pattern used. We report the results of three sets of psychophysical experiments using autostereograms generated from two-dimensional random noise patterns having power spectra of the form $1/f^Î²$. The experiments were designed to test the ability of human subjects to identify smooth, low resolution surfaces, as well as detail, in the form of higher resolution objects in the depth profile, and to determine limits in identifying small objects as a function of their size. In accordance with the theory, we discover a significant advantage of the $1/f$ noise pattern (pink noise) for fast depth lock-in and fine detail detection, showing that such patterns are optimal choices for autostereogram design. Validating the theoretical model predictions strengthens its underlying assumptions, and contributes to a better understanding of the visual system's binocular disparity mechanisms.
