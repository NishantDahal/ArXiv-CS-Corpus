An improved approximation algorithm for k-median problem using a new factor-revealing LP

The k-median problem is a well-known strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem of both theoretical and practical significance. The previous best approximation ratio for this problem is 2.611+ε(Bryka et al. 2014) based on an (1, 1.95238219) bi-factor approximation algorithm for the classical facility location problem (FLP). This work offers an improved algorithm with an approximation ratio 2.592 +εbased on a new (1, 1.93910094) bi-factor approximation algorithm for the FLP.
