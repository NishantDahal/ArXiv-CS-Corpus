Joint Representation Classification for Collective Face Recognition

Sparse representation based classification (SRC) is popularly used in many applications such as face recognition, and implemented in two steps: representation coding and classification. For a given set of testing images, SRC codes every image over the base images as a sparse representation then classifies it to the class with the least representation error. This scheme utilizes an individual representation rather than the collective one to classify such a set of images, doing so obviously ignores the correlation among the given images. In this paper, a joint representation classification (JRC) for collective face recognition is proposed. JRC takes the correlation of multiple images as well as a single representation into account. Under the assumption that the given face images are generally related to each other, JRC codes all the testing images over the base images simultaneously to facilitate recognition. To this end, the testing inputs are aligned into a matrix and the joint representation coding is formulated to a generalized $l_{2,q}-l_{2,p}$-minimization problem. To uniformly solve the induced optimization problems for any $q\in[1,2]$ and $p\in (0,2]$, an iterative quadratic method (IQM) is developed. IQM is proved to be a strict descent algorithm with convergence to the optimal solution. Moreover, a more practical IQM is proposed for large-scale case. Experimental results on three public databases show that the JRC with practical IQM no only saves much computational cost but also achieves better performance in collective face recognition than the state-of-the-arts.
