Presenting Finite Posets

We introduce a monoidal category whose morphisms are finite partial orders, with chosen minimal and maximal elements as source and target respectively. After recalling the notion of presentation of a monoidal category by the means of generators and relations, we construct a presentation of our category, which corresponds to a variant of the notion of bialgebra.
