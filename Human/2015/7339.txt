Reviewing Data Visualization: an Analytical Taxonomical Study

This paper presents an analytical taxonomy that can suitably describe, rather than simply classify, techniques for data presentation. Unlike previous works, we do not consider particular aspects of visualization techniques, but their mechanisms and foundational vision perception. Instead of just adjusting visualization research to a classification system, our aim is to better understand its process. For doing so, we depart from elementary concepts to reach a model that can describe how visualization techniques work and how they convey meaning.
