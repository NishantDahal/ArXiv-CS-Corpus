The key properties of inconsistency indicators for a triad in pairwise comparison matrices

Processing information, acquired by subjective assessments, involves inconsistency analysis in most (if not all) applications of which some are of considerable importance at a national level (see, Koczkodaj/Kulakowski/Ligenza, Scientometrics, 99(3): 911-926, 2014)A triad inconsistency axiomatization in pairwise comparisons was informally proposed in Koczkodaj/Szwarc, FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE, 132(4): 485-500, 2014. This study, rectifies it by the use of the distance and theoretical proofs. Three key properties of the indicator are presented in this study and illustrated by several examples.
