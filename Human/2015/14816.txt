Spectral and Energy Efficiency Trade-Offs in Cellular Networks

This paper presents a simple and effective method to study the spectral and energy efficiency (SE-EE) trade-off in cellular networks, an issue that has attracted significant recent interest in the wireless community. The proposed theoretical framework is based on an optimal radio resource allocation of transmit power and bandwidth for the downlink direction, applicable for an orthogonal cellular network. The analysis is initially focused on a single cell scenario, for which in addition to the solution of the main SE-EE optimization problem, it is proved that a traffic repartition scheme can also be adopted as a way to simplify this approach. By exploiting this interesting result along with properties of stochastic geometry, this work is extended to a more challenging multi-cell environment, where interference is shown to play an essential role and for this reason several interference reduction techniques are investigated. Special attention is also given to the case of low signal to noise ratio (SNR) and a way to evaluate the upper bound on EE in this regime is provided. This methodology leads to tractable analytical results under certain common channel properties, and thus allows the study of various models without the need for demanding system-level simulations.
