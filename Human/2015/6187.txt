Technical Analysis of Security Infrastructure in RFID Technology

The paper is a technical analysis of the security infrastructure in the field of RFID technology. The paper briefly discusses the architecture of the RFID technology. Then it analyses the various features and advantages RFID technology has over the existing technologies like bar codes. This is followed by a discussion of the various disadvantages and security drawbacks of RFID technology that prevents its widespread adoption in the mainstream market. The paper concludes with a brief analysis of some of the security measures that are implemented within the RFID technology for securing up the whole infrastructure. The main aim of the paper is to focus on the drawbacks of the pre-existing security measures in RFID technology as well as to discuss the direction in which further research has to be carried out without the compromise on its unique features.
