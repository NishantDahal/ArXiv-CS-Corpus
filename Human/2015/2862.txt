Dyck algebras, interval temporal logic and posets of intervals

We investigate a natural Heyting algebra structure on the set of Dyck paths of the same length. We provide a geometrical description of the operations of pseudocomplement and relative pseudocomplement, as well as of regular elements. We also find a logic-theoretic interpretation of such Heyting algebras, which we call Dyck algebras, by showing that they are the algebraic counterpart of a certain fragment of a classical interval temporal logic (also known as Halpern-Shoham logic). Finally, we propose a generalization of our approach, suggesting a similar study of the Heyting algebra arising from the poset of intervals of a finite poset using Birkh√∂ff duality. In order to illustrate this, we show how several combinatorial parameters of Dyck paths can be expressed in terms of the Heyting algebra structure of Dyck algebras together with a certain total order on the set of atoms of each Dyck algebra.
