Building pattern recognition applications with the SPARE library

This paper presents the SPARE C++ library, an open source software tool conceived to build pattern recognition and soft computing systems. The library follows the requirement of the generality: most of the implemented algorithms are able to process user-defined input data types transparently, such as labeled graphs and sequences of objects, as well as standard numeric vectors. Here we present a high-level picture of the SPARE library characteristics, focusing instead on the specific practical possibility of constructing pattern recognition systems for different input data types. In particular, as a proof of concept, we discuss two application instances involving clustering of real-valued multidimensional sequences and classification of labeled graphs.
