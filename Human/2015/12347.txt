Latency and Resource Utilization Analysis for V2X Communication over LTE MBSFN Transmission

In this paper, we investigate the performance of LTE Multicast-Broadcast Single-Frequency Networks (MBSFN). LTE-MBSFN is viewed as one of the most promising candidates for vehicular communications which can enhance reliability of vehicular application traffic. This is achieved due to the possibility to efficiently support message exchange in-between vehicles by multicasting information to several vehicles in parallel (point-to-multipoint transmission) employing an Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS). We investigate two metrics to gauge the performance of MBMS/MBSFN transmissions in comparison with standard unicast transmissions for vehicular communications: latency of packet delivery and overhead caused by vehicular traffic, i.e., network utilization. Additionally, we present technique of prediction of system behaviour and explore the influence of transmission bandwidth and transmission rate on mentioned metrics.
