Approximate nearest neighbor search for $\ell_p$-spaces ($2 < p < \infty$) via embeddings

While the problem of approximate nearest neighbor search has been well-studied for Euclidean space and $\ell_1$, few non-trivial algorithms are known for $\ell_p$ when ($2 < p < \infty$). In this paper, we revisit this fundamental problem and present approximate nearest-neighbor search algorithms which give the first non-trivial approximation factor guarantees in this setting.
