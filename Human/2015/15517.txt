On hybrid circuits exploiting thermistive properties of slime mould

Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye. Let the slime mould span two electrodes with a single protoplasmic tube: if the tube is heated to approximately 40°C, the electrical resistance of the protoplasmic tube increases from 3 MΩ to approximatively 10'000 MΩ. The organism's resistance is not proportional nor correlated to the temperature of its environment. Slime mould can therefore not be considered as a thermistor but rather as a thermic switch. We employ the P. polycephalum thermic switch to prototype hybrid electrical analog summator, NAND gates, and cascade the gates into Flip-Flop latch. Computing operations performed on this bio-hybrid computing circuitry feature high repeatability, reproducibility and comparably low propagation delays
