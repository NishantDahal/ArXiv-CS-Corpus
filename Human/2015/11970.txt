Remote sensing image classification exploiting multiple kernel learning

We propose a strategy for land use classification which exploits Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to automatically determine a suitable combination of a set of features without requiring any heuristic knowledge about the classification task. We present a novel procedure that allows MKL to achieve good performance in the case of small training sets. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
