Repeat-Accumulate Codes for Reconciliation in Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution

This paper investigates the design of low-complexity error correction codes for the verification step in continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems. We design new coding schemes based on quasi-cyclic repeat-accumulate codes which demonstrate good performances for CVQKD reconciliation.
