From the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to Kempe's Universality Theorem

This article provides a gentle introduction for a general mathematical audience to the factorization theory of motion polynomials and its application in mechanism science. This theory connects in a rather unexpected way a seemingly abstract mathematical topic, the non-unique factorization of certain polynomials over the ring of dual quaternions, with engineering applications. Four years after its introduction, it is already clear how beneficial it has been to both fields.
