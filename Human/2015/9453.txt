A straightforward method to assess motion blur for different types of displays

A simulation method based on the liquid crystal response and the human visual system is suitable to characterize motion blur for LCDs but not other display types. We propose a more straightforward and widely applicable method to quantify motion blur based on the width of the moving object. We thus compare various types of displays objectively. A perceptual experiment was conducted to validate the proposed method. We test varying motion velocities for nine commercial displays. We compare the three motion blur evaluation methods (simulation, human perception, and our method) using z-scores. Our comparisons indicate that our method accurately characterizes motion blur for various display types.
