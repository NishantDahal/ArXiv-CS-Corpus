Modeling and Analysis of Walking Pattern for a Biped Robot

This paper addresses the design and development of an autonomous biped robot using master and worker combination of controllers. In addition, the bot is wirelessly controllable. The work presented here explains the walking pattern, system control and actuator control techniques for 10 Degree of Freedom (DOF) biped humanoid. Bi-pedal robots have better mobility than conventional wheeled robots, but they tend to topple easily. In order to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary, that robot should adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, as well as maintain its stability with a torso motion. It is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. The work proposed a low cost solution using open source hardware-software and application. The work extends to develop and implement new algorithms by adding gyroscope and accelerometer to further the research in the field of biped robots.
