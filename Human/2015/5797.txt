Prefix-based Labeling Annotation for Effective XML Fragmentation

XML is gradually employed as a standard of data exchange in web environment since its inception in the 90s until present. It serves as a data exchange between systems and other applications. Meanwhile the data volume has grown substantially in the web and thus effective methods of storing and retrieving these data is essential. One recommended way is physically or virtually fragments the large chunk of data and distributes the fragments into different nodes. Fragmentation design of XML document contains of two parts: fragmentation operation and fragmentation method. The three fragmentation operations are Horizontal, Vertical and Hybrid. It determines how the XML should be fragmented. This paper aims to give an overview on the fragmentation design consideration and subsequently, propose a fragmentation technique using number addressing.
