Reed-Muller Realization of X (mod P)

This article provides a novel technique of X (mod P) realization. It is based on the Reed-Muller polynomial expansion. The advantage of the approach concludes in the capability to realize X (mod P) for an arbitrary P. The approach is competitive with the known realizations on the speed processing. Advantages and results of comparison with the known approaches for X [9:1] and P=7 is demonstrated.
