Optimal Binary Locally Repairable Codes via Anticodes

This paper presents a construction for several families of optimal binary locally repairable codes (LRCs) with small locality (2 and 3). This construction is based on various anticodes. It provides binary LRCs which attain the Cadambe-Mazumdar bound. Moreover, most of these codes are optimal with respect to the Griesmer bound.
