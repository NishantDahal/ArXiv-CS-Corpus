Codes over subsets of algebras obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process

In this paper, we define binary block codes over subsets of real algebras obtained by the Cayley-Dickson process and we provide an algorithm to obtain codes with a better rate. This algorithm offers more flexibility than other methods known until now, similar to Lenstra algorithm on elliptic curves compared with Pollard algorithm.
