A General Model for MAC Protocol Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being deployed for different applications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements. Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence should be tuned to the applications. However, there is no for selecting MAC protocols for different situations. Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is good for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on the other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols in the same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to introduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given requirements from the category that performs better for a given context. We define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance of different categories protocols for different contexts. Having the general model, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols, categories, requirements, and performance criteria. Considering energy consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we focus on deriving mathematical models for them. The results extracted from CPF are the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols that verifies our model. We validate our models with the help of simulation study. We also implemented the current CPF model in a web page to make the model online and useful.
