PC Guided Automatic Vehicle System

The main objective of this paper is to design and develop an automatic vehicle, fully controlled by a computer system. The vehicle designed in the present work can move in a pre-determined path and work automatically without the need of any human operator and it also controlled by human operator. Such a vehicle is capable of performing wide variety of difficult tasks in space research, domestic, scientific and industrial fields. For this purpose, an IBM compatible PC with Pentium microprocessor has been used which performed the function of the system controller. Its parallel printer port has been used as data communication port to interface the vehicle. A suitable software program has been developed for the system controller to send commands to the vehicle.
