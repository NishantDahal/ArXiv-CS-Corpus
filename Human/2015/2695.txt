Normalization: A Preprocessing Stage

As we know that the normalization is a pre-processing stage of any type problem statement. Especially normalization takes important role in the field of soft computing, cloud computing etc. for manipulation of data like scale down or scale up the range of data before it becomes used for further stage. There are so many normalization techniques are there namely Min-Max normalization, Z-score normalization and Decimal scaling normalization. So by referring these normalization techniques we are going to propose one new normalization technique namely, Integer Scaling Normalization. And we are going to show our proposed normalization technique using various data sets.
