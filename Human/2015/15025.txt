Complete weight enumerators of two classes of linear codes

Recently, linear codes with few weights have been constructed and extensively studied. In this paper, for an odd prime p, we determined the complete weight enumerator of two classes of p-ary linear codes constructed from defining set. Results show that the codes are at almost seven-weight linear codes and they may have applications in secret sharing schemes.
