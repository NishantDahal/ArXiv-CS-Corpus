A novel hash based least significant bit (2-3-3) image steganography in spatial domain

This paper presents a novel 2-3-3 LSB insertion method. The image steganography takes the advantage of human eye limitation. It uses color image as cover media for embedding secret message.The important quality of a steganographic system is to be less distortive while increasing the size of the secret message. In this paper a method is proposed to embed a color secret image into a color cover image. A 2-3-3 LSB insertion method has been used for image steganography. Experimental results show an improvement in the Mean squared error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) values of the proposed technique over the base technique of hash based 3-3-2 LSB insertion.
