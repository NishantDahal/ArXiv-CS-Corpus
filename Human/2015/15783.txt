An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

The field of machine learning has taken a dramatic twist in recent times, with the rise of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These biologically inspired computational models are able to far exceed the performance of previous forms of artificial intelligence in common machine learning tasks. One of the most impressive forms of ANN architecture is that of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are primarily used to solve difficult image-driven pattern recognition tasks and with their precise yet simple architecture, offers a simplified method of getting started with ANNs.
  This document provides a brief introduction to CNNs, discussing recently published papers and newly formed techniques in developing these brilliantly fantastic image recognition models. This introduction assumes you are familiar with the fundamentals of ANNs and machine learning.
