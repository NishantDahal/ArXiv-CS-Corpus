Relative generalized Hamming weights of q-ary Reed-Muller codes

Coset constructions of $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes can be used to store secrets on a distributed storage system in such a way that only parties with access to a large part of the system can obtain information while still allowing for local error-correction. In this paper we determine the relative generalized Hamming weights of these codes which can be translated into a detailed description of the information leakage [2, 24, 21, 11].
