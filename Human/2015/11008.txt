Migration from Copper to Fiber Access Network using Passive Optical Network for Green and Dry Field Areas of Pakistan

Passive Optical Networks (PON) technology brings an evolution in the industry of Telecommunication for the provisioning of High Speed Internet (HSI) and Triple Play bundled Services that includes Voice, Data, and Video Streaming throughout the world. In Pakistan most of the service providers are offering broadband services on traditional copper OSP (Outside Plant) network since 2000. Demand for the high speed internet and broadband is increasing rapidly, it is desired with great need to migrate from traditional copper based OSP network to PON _ FTTx (Fiber To The x) infrastructure. Considering the geographical requirements in Pakistan a scalable fiber network is required which can be optimized as per the users requirements and demands with high speed bandwidth efficiency, involving the minimum losses and with ideal capital expenditure (CAPEX). In this work a platform for migration from copper to fiber access network with a scalable and optimized PON _ FTTx infrastructure in green field and dry field areas of Pakistan have been proposed using Geographic Information system (GIS). In any developing country like Pakistan having the same cultural and geographical topology, this platform can be used to migrate from copper to fiber access network to provide the PON based telecom services. The developed platform for migration from copper to PON based fiber has been studied, planned, and then simulated on a selected geographical area of Pakistan with physical execution that showed better and efficient results with reduction in capital and operational expenditures. A factual plan without ambiguities assists the operators of Pakistan to analyze and forecast bandwidth requirements of an area, optimized network planning along with the in time and efficient deployment.
