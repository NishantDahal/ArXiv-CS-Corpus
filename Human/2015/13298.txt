Tiling rectangles with holey polyominoes

We present a new type of polyominoes that can have transparent squares (holes). We show how these polyominoes can tile rectangles and we categorise them according to their tiling ability. We were able to categorise all but 6 polyominoes with 5 or fewer visible squares.
