Strong Divergence for System Approximations

In this paper we analyze the approximation of stable linear time-invariant systems, like the Hilbert transform, by sampling series for bandlimited functions in the Paley-Wiener space $\mathcal{PW}_Ï€^{1}$. It is known that there exist systems and functions such that the approximation process is weakly divergent, i.e., divergent for certain subsequences. Here we strengthen this result by proving strong divergence, i.e., divergence for all subsequences. Further, in case of divergence, we give the divergence speed. We consider sampling at Nyquist rate as well as oversampling with adaptive choice of the kernel. Finally, connections between strong divergence and the Banach-Steinhaus theorem, which is not powerful enough to prove strong divergence, are discussed.
