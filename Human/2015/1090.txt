Transmission of a continuous signal via one-bit capacity channel

We study the problem of the transmission of currently observed time variable signals via a channel that is capable of sending a single binary signal only for each measurement of the underlying process. For encoding and decoding, we suggest a modification othe adaptive delta modulation algorithm. This modification ensures tracking of time variable signals. We obtained upper estimates for the error for the case of noiseless transmission.
