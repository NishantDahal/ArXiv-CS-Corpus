A Novel Approach for Clone Group Mapping by using Topic Modeling

Clone group mapping has a very important significance in the evolution of code clone. The topic modeling techniques were applied into code clone firstly and a new clone group mapping method was proposed. The method is very effective for not only Type-1 and Type-2 clone but also Type-3 clone .By making full use of the source text and structure information, topic modeling techniques transform the mapping problem of high-dimensional code space into a low-dimensional topic space, the goal of clone group mapping was indirectly reached by mapping clone group topics. Experiments on four open source software show that the recall and precision are up to 0.99, thus the method can effectively and accurately reach the goal of clone group mapping.
