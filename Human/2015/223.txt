Infinite Communication Complexity

Suppose that Alice and Bob are given each an infinite string, and they want to decide whether their two strings are in a given relation. How much communication do they need? How can communication be even defined and measured for infinite strings? In this article, we propose a formalism for a notion of infinite communication complexity, prove that it satisfies some natural properties and coincides, for relevant applications, with the classical notion of amortized communication complexity. More-over, an application is given for tackling some conjecture about tilings and multidimensional sofic shifts.
