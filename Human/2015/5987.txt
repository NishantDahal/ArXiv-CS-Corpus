Weighted Gaussian entropy and determinant inequalities

We produce a series of results extending information-theoretical inequalities (discussed by Dembo--Cover--Thomas in 1989-1991) to a weighted version of entropy. The resulting inequalities involve the Gaussian weighted entropy; they imply a number of new relations for determinants of positive-definite matrices.
