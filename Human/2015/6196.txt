Quality Control in Crowdsourced Object Segmentation

This paper explores processing techniques to deal with noisy data in crowdsourced object segmentation tasks. We use the data collected with "Click'n'Cut", an online interactive segmentation tool, and we perform several experiments towards improving the segmentation results. First, we introduce different superpixel-based techniques to filter users' traces, and assess their impact on the segmentation result. Second, we present different criteria to detect and discard the traces from potential bad users, resulting in a remarkable increase in performance. Finally, we show a novel superpixel-based segmentation algorithm which does not require any prior filtering and is based on weighting each user's contribution according to his/her level of expertise.
