Turing Computation with Recurrent Artificial Neural Networks

We improve the results by Siegelmann & Sontag (1995) by providing a novel and parsimonious constructive mapping between Turing Machines and Recurrent Artificial Neural Networks, based on recent developments of Nonlinear Dynamical Automata. The architecture of the resulting R-ANNs is simple and elegant, stemming from its transparent relation with the underlying NDAs. These characteristics yield promise for developments in machine learning methods and symbolic computation with continuous time dynamical systems. A framework is provided to directly program the R-ANNs from Turing Machine descriptions, in absence of network training. At the same time, the network can potentially be trained to perform algorithmic tasks, with exciting possibilities in the integration of approaches akin to Google DeepMind's Neural Turing Machines.
