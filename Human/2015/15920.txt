Watson-Crick Quantum Finite Automata

1-way quantum finite automata are deterministic and reversible in nature, which greatly reduces its accepting property. In fact the set of languages accepted by 1-way quantum finite automata is a proper subset of regular languages. In this paper we replace the tape head of 1-way quantum finite automata with DNA double strand and name the model Watson-Crick quantum finite automata. The non-injective complementarity relation of Watson-Crick automata introduces non-determinism in the quantum model. We show that this introduction of non-determinism increases the computational power of 1-way Quantum finite automata significantly. We establish that Watson-Crick quantum finite automata can accept all regular languages and that it also accepts some languages not accepted by any multihead deterministic finite automata. Exploiting the superposition property of quantum finite automata we show that Watson-Crick quantum finite automata accept the language L=ww where w belongs to {a,b}*.
