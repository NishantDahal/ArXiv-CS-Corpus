Proiectarea si implementarea unui portal HL7

This paper introduces some techniques used in developing and implementing an HL7 clinical data portal used in client-server architecture. The HL7 portal is used by nonHL7 applications that need medical data from HL7 servers. Also, the portal can translate a large number of HL7 terms between an indefinite number of languages.
