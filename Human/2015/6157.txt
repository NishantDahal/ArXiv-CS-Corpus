On Repeated-Root Constacyclic Codes of Length $2^amp^r$ over Finite Fields

In this paper we investigate the structure of repeated root constacyclic codes of length $2^amp^r$ over $\mathbb{F}_{p^s}$ with $a\geq1$ and $(m,p)=1$.
  We characterize the codes in terms of their generator polynomials. This provides simple conditions on the existence of self-dual negacyclic codes. Further, we gave cases where the constacyclic codes are equivalent to cyclic codes.
