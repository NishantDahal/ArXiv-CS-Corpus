A New Parameter Estimation Algorithm Based on Sub-band Dual Frequency Conjugate LVT

A new parameter estimation algorithm, known as Sub-band Dual Frequency Conjugate LVT (SDFC-LVT), is proposed for the ground moving targets. This algorithm first constructs two sub-band signals with different central frequencies. After that, the two signals are shifted by different values in frequency domain and a new signal is constructed by multiplying one with the conjugate of the other. Finally, Keystone transform and LVT operation are performed on the constructed signal to attain the estimates. The cross-term and the performance of the proposed method are analyzed in detail. Since the equivalent carrier frequency is reduced greatly, the proposed method is capable of obtaining the accurate parameter estimates and resolving the problem of ambiguity which invalidates Keystone transform. It is search-free and can compensate the range walk of multiple targets simultaneously, thereby reducing the computational burden. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both simulated and real data.
