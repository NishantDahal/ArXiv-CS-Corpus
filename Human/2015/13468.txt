Evolving Models for Meso-Scale Structures

Real world complex networks are scale free and possess meso-scale properties like core-periphery and community structure. We study evolution of the core over time in real world networks. This paper proposes evolving models for both unweighted and weighted scale free networks having local and global core-periphery as well as community structure. Network evolves using topological growth, self growth, and weight distribution function. To validate the correctness of proposed models, we use K-shell and S-shell decomposition methods. Simulation results show that the generated unweighted networks follow power law degree distribution with droop head and heavy tail. Similarly, generated weighted networks follow degree, strength, and edge-weight power law distributions. We further study other properties of complex networks, such as clustering coefficient, nearest neighbor degree, and strength degree correlation.
