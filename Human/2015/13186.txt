Area law for fixed points of rapidly mixing dissipative quantum systems

We prove an area law with a logarithmic correction for the mutual information for fixed points of local dissipative quantum system satisfying a rapid mixing condition, under either of the following assumptions: the fixed point is pure, or the system is frustration free.
