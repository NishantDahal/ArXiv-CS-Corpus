Toward Smart Power Grids: Communication Network Design for Power Grids Synchronization

In smart power grids, keeping the synchronicity of generators and the corresponding controls is of great importance. To do so, a simple model is employed in terms of swing equation to represent the interactions among dynamics of generators and feedback control. In case of having a communication network available, the control can be done based on the transmitted measurements by the communication network. The stability of system is denoted by the largest eigenvalue of the weighted sum of the Laplacian matrices of the communication infrastructure and power network. In this work, we use graph theory to model the communication network as a graph problem. Then, Ant Colony System (ACS) is employed for optimum design of above graph for synchronization of power grids. Performance evaluation of the proposed method for the 39-bus New England power system versus methods such as exhaustive search and Rayleigh quotient approximation indicates feasibility and effectiveness of our method for even large scale smart power grids.
