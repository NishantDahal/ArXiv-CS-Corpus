The Challenges of CASE Design Integration in the Telecommunication Application Domain

The magnitude of the problems facing the telecommunication software industry is presently at a point at which software engineers should become deeply involved. This paper presents a research project on advanced telecommunication technology carried out in Europe, called BOOST (Broadband Object-Oriented Service Technology). The project involved cooperative work among telecommunication companies, research centres and universities from several countries. The challenges to integrate CASE tools to support software development within the telecommunication application domain are discussed. A software process model that encourages component reusability, named the X model, is described as part of a software life cycle model for the telecommunication software industry.
