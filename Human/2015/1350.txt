A User Interface for Semantically Oriented Data Mining of Astronomy Repositories

We present a user-friendly, but powerful interface for the data mining of scientific repositories. We present the tool in use with actual astronomy data and show how it may be used to achieve many different types of powerful semantic queries. The tool itself hides the gory details of query formulation, and data retrieval from the user, and allows the user to create workflows which may be used to transform the data into a convenient form.
