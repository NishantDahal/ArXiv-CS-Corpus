Optimality of Large MIMO Detection via Approximate Message Passing

Optimal data detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with a large number of antennas at both ends of the wireless link entails prohibitive computational complexity. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a variety of sub-optimal detection algorithms have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the optimality of a novel data-detection method for large MIMO systems that relies on approximate message passing (AMP). We show that our algorithm, referred to as individually-optimal (IO) large-MIMO AMP (short IO-LAMA), is able to perform IO data detection given certain conditions on the MIMO system and the constellation set (e.g., QAM or PSK) are met.
