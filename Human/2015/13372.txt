Convexity in partial cubes: the hull number

We prove that the combinatorial optimization problem of determining the hull number of a partial cube is NP-complete. This makes partial cubes the minimal graph class for which NP-completeness of this problem is known and improves some earlier results in the literature.
  On the other hand we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to determine the hull number of planar partial cube quadrangulations.
  Instances of the hull number problem for partial cubes described include poset dimension and hitting sets for interiors of curves in the plane.
  To obtain the above results, we investigate convexity in partial cubes and characterize these graphs in terms of their lattice of convex subgraphs, improving a theorem of Handa. Furthermore we provide a topological representation theorem for planar partial cubes, generalizing a result of Fukuda and Handa about rank three oriented matroids.
