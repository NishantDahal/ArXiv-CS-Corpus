Applying CMM Towards an m-Learning Context

In the era of m-Learning, it is found that educational institutions have onus of incorporating the latest technological innovations that can be accepted and understood widely. While investigating the important theme of fast-paced development of emerging technologies in mobile communications, it is important to recognize the extent influence of these innovations using which society can communicate, learn, access information, and, additionally, interact. In addition, the usage of mobile technology in higher education needs not only the pervasive nature of the technology but also its disruptive nature that offers several challenges while incorporation in the area of teaching and learning. Therefore, recently, higher education institutions are looking at various ways of implementing m-Learning strategies, in order to offer solutions, which, in turn, can standardize the process of education and, additionally, replace those traditional didactic courses, focusing on m-Learning endless benefits. Some of the benefits are: the process of learning itself could be self-paced, whereas information could be easier accessed, adding to independent, discovery-oriented learning that becomes more engaging. Applying CMM successfully to design effective incorporation strategies of m-Learning, this research targets formulation of such a maturity model by which the process of m-Learning can be more effective and efficient.
