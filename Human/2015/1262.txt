An Improved E-voting scheme using Secret Sharing based Secure Multi-party Computation

E-voting systems (EVS)are having potential advantages over many existing voting schemes.Security, transparency, accuracy and reliability are the major concern in these systems.EVS continues to grow as the technology advances.It is inexpensive and efficient as the resources become reusable.Fast and accurate computation of results with voter privacy is the added advantage.In the proposed system we make use of secret sharing technique and secure multi party computation(SMC) to achieve security and reliability.Secret sharing is an important technique used for SMC. Multi-party computation is typically accomplished using secret sharing by making shares of the input and manipulating the shares to compute a typical function of the input.The proposed system make use of bitwise representation of votes and only the shares are used for transmission and computation of result.Secure sum evaluation can be done with shares distributed using Shamir's secret sharing scheme.The scheme is hence secure and reliable and does not make any number theoretic assumptions for security.We also propose a unique method which calculates the candidates individual votes keeping the anonymity.
