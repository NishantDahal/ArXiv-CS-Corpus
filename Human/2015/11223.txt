Color-Phase Analysis for Sinusoidal Structured Light in Rapid Range Imaging

Active range sensing using structured-light is the most accurate and reliable method for obtaining 3D information. However, most of the work has been limited to range sensing of static objects, and range sensing of dynamic (moving or deforming) objects has been investigated recently only by a few researchers. Sinusoidal structured-light is one of the well-known optical methods for 3D measurement. In this paper, we present a novel method for rapid high-resolution range imaging using color sinusoidal pattern. We consider the real-world problem of nonlinearity and color-band crosstalk in the color light projector and color camera, and present methods for accurate recovery of color-phase. For high-resolution ranging, we use high-frequency patterns and describe new unwrapping algorithms for reliable range recovery. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
