Multiparty Probability Computation and Verification

A multiparty computation protocol is described in which the parties can generate different probability events that is based on the sharing of a single anonymized random number, and also perform oblivious transfer. A method to verify the correctness of the procedure, without revealing the random numbers used by the parties, is proposed.
