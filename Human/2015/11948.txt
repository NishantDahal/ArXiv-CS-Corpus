A Robust Regression Approach for Background/Foreground Segmentation

Background/foreground segmentation has a lot of applications in image and video processing. In this paper, a segmentation algorithm is proposed which is mainly designed for text and line extraction in screen content. The proposed method makes use of the fact that the background in each block is usually smoothly varying and can be modeled well by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis functions, while the foreground text and graphics create sharp discontinuity. The algorithm separates the background and foreground pixels by trying to fit pixel values in the block into a smooth function using a robust regression method. The inlier pixels that can fit well will be considered as background, while remaining outlier pixels will be considered foreground. This algorithm has been extensively tested on several images from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding, and is shown to have superior performance over other methods, such as the k-means clustering based segmentation algorithm in DjVu. This background/foreground segmentation can be used in different applications such as: text extraction, separate coding of background and foreground for compression of screen content and mixed content documents, principle line extraction from palmprint and crease detection in fingerprint images.
