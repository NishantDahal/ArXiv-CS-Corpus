Radix-2 Fast Hartley Transform Revisited

A Fast algorithm for the Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT) is presented, which resembles radix-2 fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Although fast DHTs are already known, this new approach bring some light about the deep relationship between fast DHT algorithms and a multiplication-free fast algorithm for the Hadamard Transform.
