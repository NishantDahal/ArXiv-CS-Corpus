The Turing Test for Telepresence

The quality of high-end videoconferencing systems has improved significantly over the last few years enabling a class of applications known as "telepresence" wherein the users engaged in a communication session experience a feeling of mutual presence in a shared virtual space. Telepresence systems have reached a maturity level that seriously challenges the old familiar truism that a face-to-face meeting is always better than a technology-mediated alternative. To explore the state of the art in telepresence technology and outline future opportunities, this paper proposes an optimality condition, expressed as a "Turing Test," whereby the subjective experience of using a telepresence system is compared to the corresponding face-to-face situation. The requirements and challenges of designing a system passing such a Turing Test for telepresence are analyzed with respect to the limits of human perception, and the feasibility of achieving this goal with currently available or near future technology is discussed.
