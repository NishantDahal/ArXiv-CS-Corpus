Software Agents Interaction Algorithms in Virtual Learning Environment

This paper highlights the multi-agent learning virtual environment and agents communication algorithms. The researcher proposed three algorithms required software agents interaction in virtual learning information system environment. The first proposed algorithm is agents interaction localization algorithm, the second one is the dynamic agents distribution algorithm (load distribution algorithm), and the third model is Agent communication algorithm based on using agents intermediaries. The main objectives of these algorithms are to reduce the response time for any agents changes in virtual learning environment (VLE) by increasing the information exchange intensity between software agents and reduce the overall network load, and to improve the communication between mobile agents in distributed information system to support effectiveness. Finally the paper describe the algorithms of information exchange between mobile agents in VLE based on the expansion of the address structure and the use of an agent, intermediary agents, matchmaking agents, brokers and their entrepreneurial functions
