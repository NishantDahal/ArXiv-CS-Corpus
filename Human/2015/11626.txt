Overlap Frequency Domain Equalization for Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling

This letter proposes the Faster-than-Nyquist signaling (FTNS) using overlap frequency domain equalization (FDE), which compensates the inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to band limiting filters of the FTNS at the transmitter and the receiver as well as the frequency selective fading channel. Since overlap FDE does not require any guard interval (GI) at the transmitter such as cyclic prefix (CP), higher spectral efficiency can be achieved compared to FTNS scheme using the conventional FDE. In the proposed method, the equalizer weight is derived based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion taking the colored noise due to the receiving filter into consideration. Moreover, we also give an approximated FDE weight in order to reduce the computational complexity. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated via computer simulations.
