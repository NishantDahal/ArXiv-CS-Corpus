Some old and new problems in combinatorial geometry I: Around Borsuk's problem

Borsuk asked in 1933 if every set of diameter 1 in $R^d$ can be covered by $d+1$ sets of smaller diameter. In 1993, a negative solution, based on a theorem by Frankl and Wilson, was given by Kahn and Kalai. In this paper I will present questions related to Borsuk's problem.
