Another Asymptotic Notation : "Almost"

Asymptotic notations are heavily used while analysing runtimes of algorithms. Present paper argues that some of these usages are non trivial, therefore incurring errors in communication of ideas. After careful reconsidera- tion of the various existing notations a new notation is proposed. This notation has similarities with the other heavily used notations like Big-Oh, Big Theta, while being more accurate when describing the order relationship. It has been argued that this notation is more suitable for describing algorithm runtime than Big-Oh.
