NEMO5: Achieving High-end Internode Communication for Performance Projection Beyond Moore's Law

Electronic performance predictions of modern nanotransistors require nonequilibrium Green's functions including incoherent scattering on phonons as well as inclusion of random alloy disorder and surface roughness effects. The solution of all these effects is numerically extremely expensive and has to be done on the world's largest supercomputers due to the large memory requirement and the high performance demands on the communication network between the compute nodes. In this work, it is shown that NEMO5 covers all required physical effects and their combination. Furthermore, it is also shown that NEMO5's implementation of the algorithm scales very well up to about 178176CPUs with a sustained performance of about 857 TFLOPS. Therefore, NEMO5 is ready to simulate future nanotransistors.
