Arbitrarily long relativistic bit commitment

We consider the recent relativistic bit commitment protocol introduced by Lunghi et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2015] and present a new security analysis against classical attacks. In particular, while the initial complexity of the protocol scaled double-exponentially with the commitment time, our analysis shows that the correct dependence is only linear. This has dramatic implications in terms of implementation: in particular, the commitment time can easily be made arbitrarily long, by only requiring both parties to communicate classically and perform efficient classical computation.
