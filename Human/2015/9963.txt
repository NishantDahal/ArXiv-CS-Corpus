On the Design of a User-in-the-Loop Channel. With Application to Emergency Egress

The herein approach addresses the case when the user is part of the communication channel. A purpose of the abstraction is to provide a framework for the field of communications, with the user included in the system, reckoning the current 7 Layer model allows safeguards for data only. Solid grounds for application were identified as contribution to ensuring the need for safety which becomes tight during emergency events where timely evacuation is critical. One of the components of a communication system [1] as described in information theory, is the communication channel. It allows the transmitter signal representing the message, to reach the receiver. A hardware setup with two different communication systems in a user-in-the-loop (UIL) [2] configuration is described and assessed pertinent to the specific application.
