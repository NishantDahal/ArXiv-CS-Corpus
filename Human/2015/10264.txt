Noncommutative Valiant's Classes: Structure and Complete Problems

In this paper we explore the noncommutative analogues, $\mathrm{VP}_{nc}$ and $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$, of Valiant's algebraic complexity classes and show some striking connections to classical formal language theory. Our main results are the following: (1) We show that Dyck polynomials (defined from the Dyck languages of formal language theory) are complete for the class $\mathrm{VP}_{nc}$ under $\le_{abp}$ reductions. Likewise, it turns out that $\mathrm{PAL}$ (Palindrome polynomials defined from palindromes) are complete for the class $\mathrm{VSKEW}_{nc}$ (defined by polynomial-size skew circuits) under $\le_{abp}$ reductions. The proof of these results is by suitably adapting the classical Chomsky-Sch√ºtzenberger theorem showing that Dyck languages are the hardest CFLs. (2) Next, we consider the class $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$. It is known~\cite{HWY10a} that, assuming the sum-of-squares conjecture, the noncommutative polynomial $\sum_{w\in\{x_0,x_1\}^n}ww$ requires exponential size circuits. We unconditionally show that $\sum_{w\in\{x_0,x_1\}^n}ww$ is not $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$-complete under the projection reducibility. As a consequence, assuming the sum-of-squares conjecture, we exhibit a strictly infinite hierarchy of p-families under projections inside $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$ (analogous to Ladner's theorem~\cite{Ladner75}). In the final section we discuss some new $\mathrm{VNP}_{nc}$-complete problems under $\le_{abp}$-reductions. (3) Inside $\mathrm{VP}_{nc}$ too we show there is a strict hierarchy of p-families (based on the nesting depth of Dyck polynomials) under the $\le_{abp}$ reducibility.
