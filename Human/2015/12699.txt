On The Number of Optimal Linear Index Codes For Unicast Index Coding Problems

An index coding problem arises when there is a single source with a number of messages and multiple receivers each wanting a subset of messages and knowing a different set of messages a priori. The noiseless Index Coding Problem is to identify the minimum number of transmissions (optimal length) to be made by the source through noiseless channels so that all receivers can decode their wanted messages using the transmitted symbols and their respective prior information. Recently, it is shown that different optimal length codes perform differently in a noisy channel. Towards identifying the best optimal length index code one needs to know the number of optimal length index codes. In this paper we present results on the number of optimal length index codes making use of the representation of an index coding problem by an equivalent network code. Our formulation results in matrices of smaller sizes compared to the approach of Kotter and Medard. Our formulation leads to a lower bound on the minimum number of optimal length codes possible for all unicast index coding problems which is met with equality for several special cases of the unicast index coding problem. A method to identify the optimal length codes which lead to minimum-maximum probability of error is also presented.
