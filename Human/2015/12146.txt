Upper Bounds of Interference Alignment Degree of Freedom

Interference alignment allows multiple users to share the same frequency and time resource in a wireless communications system. At present, two performance bounds, in terms of degree of freedom, have been proposed. One is for infinite-dimension extension and the other is for MIMO systems. This paper provides an understanding of the MIMO bound by examining its proofs and shows that it does not apply to a more practical case: MIMO-OFDM. Several approaches are proposed in searching for DoF bounds for systems such as finite-dimension time extension and MIMO-OFDM systems.
