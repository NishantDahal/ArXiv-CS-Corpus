Sensor-Type Classification in Buildings

Many sensors/meters are deployed in commercial buildings to monitor and optimize their performance. However, because sensor metadata is inconsistent across buildings, software-based solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor metadata conventions (i.e. schemas and naming) for each building. Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort.
  Metadata normalization is critical for scaling the deployment process and allows us to decouple building-specific conventions from the code written for building applications. It also allows us to deal with missing metadata. One important aspect of normalization is to differentiate sensors by the typeof phenomena being observed. In this paper, we propose a general, simple, yet effective classification scheme to differentiate sensors in buildings by type. We perform ensemble learning on data collected from over 2000 sensor streams in two buildings. Our approach is able to achieve more than 92% accuracy for classification within buildings and more than 82% accuracy for across buildings. We also introduce a method for identifying potential misclassified streams. This is important because it allows us to identify opportunities to attain more input from experts -- input that could help improve classification accuracy when ground truth is unavailable. We show that by adjusting a threshold value we are able to identify at least 30% of the misclassified instances.
