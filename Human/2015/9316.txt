Full Duplex Networking: Mission Impossible?

Mobile traffic is projected to increase 1000 times from 2010 to 2020. This poses significant challenges on the 5th generation (5G) wireless communication system design, including network structure, air interface, key transmission schemes, multiple access, and duplexing schemes. In this paper, full duplex networking issues are discussed, aiming to provide some insights on the design and possible future deployment for 5G. Particularly, the interference scenarios in full duplex are analyzed, followed by discussions on several candidate interference mitigation approaches, interference proof frame structures, transceiver structures for channel reciprocity recovery, and super full duplex base station where each sector operates in time division duplex (TDD) mode. The extension of TDD and frequency division duplex (FDD) to full duplex is also examined. It is anticipated that with future standardization and deployment of full duplex systems, TDD and FDD will be harmoniously integrated, supporting all the existing half duplex mobile phones efficiently, and leading to a substantially enhanced 5G system performance.
