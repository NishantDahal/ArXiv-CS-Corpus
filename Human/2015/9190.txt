Preprint Traffic Management and Forecasting System Based on 3D GIS

This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid). This paper takes Shenzhen Futian comprehensive transportation junction as the case, and makes use of continuous multiple real-time dynamic traffic information to carry out monitoring and analysis on spatial and temporal distribution of passenger flow under different means of transportation and service capacity of junction from multi-dimensional space-time perspectives such as different period and special period. Virtual reality geographic information system is employed to present the forecasting result.
