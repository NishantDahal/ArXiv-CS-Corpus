Quantitative Analysis of Particles Segregation

Segregation is a popular phenomenon. It has considerable effects on material performance. To the author's knowledge, there is still no automated objective quantitative indicator for segregation. In order to full fill this task, segregation of particles is analyzed. Edges of the particles are extracted from the digital picture. Then, the whole picture of particles is splintered to small rectangles with the same shape. Statistical index of the edges in each rectangle is calculated. Accordingly, segregation between the indexes corresponding to the rectangles is evaluated. The results show coincident with subjective evaluated results. Further more, it can be implemented as an automated system, which would facilitate the materials quality control mechanism during production process.
