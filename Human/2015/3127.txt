A Universal Channel Model for Molecular Communication Systems with Metal-Oxide Detectors

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end channel model for molecular communication systems with metal-oxide sensors. In particular, we focus on the recently developed table top molecular communication platform. The system is separated into two parts: the propagation and the sensor detection. There is derived, based on this, a more realistic end-to-end channel model. However, since some of the coefficients in the derived models are unknown, we collect a great deal of experimental data to estimate these coefficients and evaluate how they change with respect to the different system parameters. Finally, a noise model is derived for the system to complete an end-to-end system model for the tabletop platform.
