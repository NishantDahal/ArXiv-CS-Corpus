Cyclic DNA codes over F2+uF2+vF2+uvF2

In this work, we study the structure of cyclic DNA codes of arbitrary lengths over the ring R=F2+uF2+vF2+uvF2 and establish relations to codes over R1=F2+uF2 by defining a Gray map between R and R1^2 where R1 is the ring with 4 elements. Cyclic codes of arbitrary lengths over R satisfied the reverse constraint and the reverse-complement constraint are studied in this paper. The GC content constraint is considered in the last.
