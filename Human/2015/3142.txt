Global 6DOF Pose Estimation from Untextured 2D City Models

We propose a method for estimating the 3D pose for the camera of a mobile device in outdoor conditions, using only an untextured 2D model. Previous methods compute only a relative pose using a SLAM algorithm, or require many registered images, which are cumbersome to acquire. By contrast, our method returns an accurate, absolute camera pose in an absolute referential using simple 2D+height maps, which are broadly available, to refine a first estimate of the pose provided by the device's sensors. We show how to first estimate the camera absolute orientation from straight line segments, and then how to estimate the translation by aligning the 2D map with a semantic segmentation of the input image. We demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach on a challenging dataset.
