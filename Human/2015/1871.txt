Mutual authenticated quantum no-key encryption scheme over private quantum channel

We realize shamir's no-key protocol via quantum computation of Boolean permutation and private quantum channel. The quantum no-key (QNK) protocol presented here is one with mutual authentications, and proved to be unconditionally secure. An important property of this protocol is that0 its authentication key can be reused permanently.
