Autonomic Resilient Internet-of-Things(IoT)Management

In Resilient IoT, the revenue of service provider is resilient to uncertain usage-contexts(e.g. emotion, environmental contexts) of Smart-device users. Hence, Autonomic Resilient IoT Management problem is decomposed into two subproblems, namely m-connectivity and k-dominance, such that m-alternations on revenue making process is resilient to users common interests, which might be depicted through k-1 alternations of usage-contexts. In this context, a greedy approximation scheme Bee is proposed, which resolves aforementioned sub-problems with five consecutive models, namely Maverick, Siren, Pigmy, Arkeo and Augeas, respectively. Theoretical analysis justifies the problem as NP-hard, combinatorial optimization problem, which is amenable to greedy approximation. Moreover, Bee lays out the theoretical foundation of Resilient Fact-finding, followed by theoretical and experimental(i.e synthetic) proof, which show how Bee-resilience resolves acute CDS measurement problem. Accordingly, experiments on real Social rumor dataset extract dominator and dominate to justify how Bee resilience improves CDS measurement. Finally, case-study and prototype development are performed on Android and Web platforms in a Resilient IoT scenario, where service provider recommends personalized services for Smart-device users.
