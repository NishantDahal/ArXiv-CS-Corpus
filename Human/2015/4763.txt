Comparative study of the two versions of the Microsoft Kinect$^{\rm TM}$ sensor in regard to the analysis of human motion

The present paper is part of a broader programme, exploring the possibility of involving the Microsoft Kinect$^{\rm TM}$ sensor in the analysis of human motion. In this study, the output obtained from the two available versions of this sensor is critically examined. We demonstrate that the two outputs differ in regard to the variation of the physical quantities involved in the modelling of the human motion. As the original sensor has been found unsuitable for applications requiring high precision, the observed differences in the output of the two sensors call for the validation of the upgraded sensor on the basis of a marker-based system.
