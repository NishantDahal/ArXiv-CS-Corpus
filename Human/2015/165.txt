Random Access in DVB-RCS2: Design and Dynamic Control for Congestion Avoidance

In the current DVB generation, satellite terminals are expected to be interactive and capable of transmission in the return channel with satisfying quality. Considering the bursty nature of their traffic and the long propagation delay, the use of a random access technique is a viable solution for such a Medium Access Control (MAC) scenario. In this paper, random access communication design in DVB-RCS2 is considered with particular regard to the recently introduced Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha (CRDSA) technique. This paper presents a model for design and tackles some issues on performance evaluation of the system by giving intuitive and effective tools. Moreover, dynamic control procedures that are able to avoid congestion at the gateway are introduced. Results show the advantages brought by CRDSA to DVB-RCS2 with regard to the previous state of the art.
