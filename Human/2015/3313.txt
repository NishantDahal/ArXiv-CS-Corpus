DoF Analysis of the K-user MISO Broadcast Channel with Hybrid CSIT

We consider a $K$-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) where the channel state information (CSI) of user $i(i=1,2,\ldots,K)$ may be either instantaneously perfect (P), delayed (D) or not known (N) at the transmitter with probabilities $λ_P^i$, $λ_D^i$ and $λ_N^i$, respectively. In this setting, according to the three possible CSIT for each user, knowledge of the joint CSIT of the $K$ users could have at most $3^K$ states. Although the results by Tandon et al. show that for the symmetric two user MISO BC (i.e., $λ_Q^i=λ_Q,\ \forall i\in \{1,2\}, Q\in \{P,D,N\}$), the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) region depends only on the marginal probabilities, we show that this interesting result does not hold in general when $K\geq3$. In other words, the DoF region is a function of all the joint probabilities. In this paper, given the marginal probabilities of CSIT, we derive an outer bound for the DoF region of the $K$-user MISO BC. Subsequently, we investigate the achievability of the outer bound in some scenarios. Finally, we show the dependence of the DoF region on the joint probabilities.
