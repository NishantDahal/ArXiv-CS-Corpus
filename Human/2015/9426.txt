Quantum Image Representation Through Two-Dimensional Quantum States and Normalized Amplitude

We propose a novel method for image representation in quantum computers, which uses the two-dimensional (2-D) quantum states to locate each pixel in an image through row-location and column-location vectors for identifying each pixel location. The quantum state of an image is the linear superposition of the tensor product of the m-qubits row-location vector and the n-qubits column-location vector of each pixel. It enables the natural quantum representation of rectangular images that other methods lack. The amplitude/intensity of each pixel is incorporated into the coefficient values of the pixel's quantum state, without using any qubits. Due to the fact that linear superposition, tensor product and qubits form the fundamental basis of quantum computing, the proposed method presents the machine level representation of images on quantum computers. Unlike other methods, this method is a pure quantum representation without any classical components.
