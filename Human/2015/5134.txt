On the Subadditivity of the Entropy on the Sphere

We present a refinement of a known entropic inequality on the sphere, finding suitable conditions under which the uniform probability measure on the sphere behaves asymptomatically like the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^N$ with respect to the entropy.
