Why teach an introductory course in Mathematical Logic in the Philosophy curriculum?

This paper tries to justify the relevance of an introductory course in Mathematical Logic in the Philosophy curriculum for analyzing philosophical arguments in natural language. It is argued that the representation of the structure of natural language arguments in Freeman's diagramming system can provide an intuitive foundation for the inferential processes involved in the use of First Order Logic natural deduction rules.
