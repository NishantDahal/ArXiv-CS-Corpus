QPACE 2 and Domain Decomposition on the Intel Xeon Phi

We give an overview of QPACE 2, which is a custom-designed supercomputer based on Intel Xeon Phi processors, developed in a collaboration of Regensburg University and Eurotech. We give some general recommendations for how to write high-performance code for the Xeon Phi and then discuss our implementation of a domain-decomposition-based solver and present a number of benchmarks.
