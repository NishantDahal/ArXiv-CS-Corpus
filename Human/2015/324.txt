Quantum McEliece public-key encryption scheme

This paper investigates a quantum version of McEliece public-key encryption (PKE) scheme, and analyzes its security. As is well known, the security of classical McEliece PKE is not stronger than the onewayness of related classical one-way function. We prove the security of quantum McEliece PKE ranks between them. Moreover, we propose the double-encryption technique to improve its security, and the security of the improved scheme is proved to be between the original scheme and the quantum one-time pad.
