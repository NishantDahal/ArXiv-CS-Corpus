Perceived Social Loafing in Undergraduate Software Engineering Teams

We surveyed 237 undergraduate students who are enrolled in various subjects and are members of software engineering teams. Their being a member in a team is part of the requirements of the course. We found that each of task visibility, distributive justice, and intrinsic task involvement were negatively associated with social loafing. We also found out that dominance, aggression and sucker effect each were positively correlated with social loafing. We further found out that perception of social loafing exists among members of software engineering teams.
