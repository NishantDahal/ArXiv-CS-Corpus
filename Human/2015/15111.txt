Geometry-covering Jammer Localization based on Distance Comprehension in Wireless Sensor Networks

Jamming attacks could cause severe damage to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Once jamming attack occurs, the most urgent work is to get the position information of the jammer. Then safety measures to eliminate the jamming effects can be devised. In this paper, the jammer localization is conducted by geometric covering method to achieve a low energy consumption. And utilizing the power of the jamming signal received by the boundary nodes, a compensating method is composed to reduce the estimating error of the jamming area. At last the localization is conducted by extracting the minimum covering circle of the compensated victim area. Simulations are conducted to test the localization accuracy with the impact of node density, jamming region and radius. Results show that this localization method achieves both good precision and low energy consumption.
