Bounds of distance Estrada index of graphs

Let $位_1,位_2,\cdots,位_n$ be the eigenvalues of the distance matrix of a connected graph $G$. The distance Estrada index of $G$ is defined as $DEE(G)=\sum_{i=1}^ne^{位_i}$. In this note, we present new lower and upper bounds for $DEE(G)$. In addition, a Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequality for $DEE(G)$ is given.
