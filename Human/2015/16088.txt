A New Approach to Customization of Collision Warning Systems to Individual Drivers

This paper discusses the need for individualizing safety systems and proposes an approach including the Real-Time estimation of the distribution of brake response times for an individual driver. While maintaining high level of safety, the collision warning system should send "tailored" responses to the driver. This method could be the first step to show that safety applications would potentially benefit from customizing to individual drivers' characteristics using VANET. Our simulation results show that, as one of the imminent and preliminary outcomes of the new improved system, the number of false alarms will be reduced by more than 40%. We think this tactic can reach to even beyond the safety applications for designing the future innovative systems.
