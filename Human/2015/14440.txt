Problem collection from the IML programme: Graphs, Hypergraphs, and Computing

This collection of problems and conjectures is based on a subset of the open problems from the seminar series and the problem sessions of the Institut Mitag-Leffler programme Graphs, Hypergraphs, and Computing. Each problem contributor has provided a write up of their proposed problem and the collection has been edited by Klas Markstr√∂m.
