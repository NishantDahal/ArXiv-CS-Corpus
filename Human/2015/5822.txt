Binary GH Sequences for Multiparty Communication

This paper investigates cross correlation properties of sequences derived from GH sequences modulo p, where p is a prime number and presents comparison with cross correlation properties of pseudo noise sequences. For GH sequences modulo prime, a binary random sequence B(n) is constructed, based on whether the period is p-1 (or a divisor) or 2p+2 (or a divisor). We show that B(n) sequences have much less peak cross correlation compared to PN sequence fragments obtained from the same generator. Potential applications of these sequences to cryptography are sketched.
