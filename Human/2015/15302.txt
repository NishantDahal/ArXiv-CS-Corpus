Secure message transmission in the presence of a fully generalised adversary

We investigate the problem of secure message transmission in the presence of a "fully generalised" adversary, who disrupts and listens to separate sets of communication wires. We extend previous results by considering the case when these sets may have arbitrary size, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for both one-way and two-way communication.
