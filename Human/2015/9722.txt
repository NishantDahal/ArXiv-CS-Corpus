The Mont-Blanc Project: First Phase Successfully Finished

Running from October 2011 to June 2015, the aim of the European project Mont-Blanc has been to develop an approach to Exascale computing based on embedded power-efficient technology. The main goals of the project were to i) build an HPC prototype using currently available energy-efficient embedded technology, ii) design a Next Generation system to overcome the limitations of the built prototype and iii) port a set of representative Exascale applications to the system. This article summarises the contributions from the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) and the Juelich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), Germany, to the Mont-Blanc project.
