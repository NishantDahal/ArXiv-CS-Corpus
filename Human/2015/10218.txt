Quantum Block and Synchronizable Codes Derived from Certain Classes of Polynomials

One central theme in quantum error-correction is to construct quantum codes that have a large minimum distance. In this paper, we first present a construction of classical codes based on certain class of polynomials. Through these classical codes, we are able to obtain some new quantum codes. It turns out that some of quantum codes exhibited here have better parameters than the ones available in the literature. Meanwhile, we give a new class of quantum synchronizable codes with highest possible tolerance against misalignment from duadic codes.
