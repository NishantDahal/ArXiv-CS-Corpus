On Symbolic Ultrametrics, Cotree Representations, and Cograph Edge Decompositions and Partitions

Symbolic ultrametrics define edge-colored complete graphs K_n and yield a simple tree representation of K_n. We discuss, under which conditions this idea can be generalized to find a symbolic ultrametric that, in addition, distinguishes between edges and non-edges of arbitrary graphs G=(V,E) and thus, yielding a simple tree representation of G. We prove that such a symbolic ultrametric can only be defined for G if and only if G is a so-called cograph. A cograph is uniquely determined by a so-called cotree. As not all graphs are cographs, we ask, furthermore, what is the minimum number of cotrees needed to represent the topology of G. The latter problem is equivalent to find an optimal cograph edge k-decomposition {E_1,...,E_k} of E so that each subgraph (V,E_i) of G is a cograph. An upper bound for the integer k is derived and it is shown that determining whether a graph has a cograph 2-decomposition, resp., 2-partition is NP-complete.
