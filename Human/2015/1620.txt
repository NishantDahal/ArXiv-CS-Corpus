Asymptotic Justification of Bandlimited Interpolation of Graph signals for Semi-Supervised Learning

Graph-based methods play an important role in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks by taking into account the underlying geometry of the data set. In this paper, we consider a statistical setting for semi-supervised learning and provide a formal justification of the recently introduced framework of bandlimited interpolation of graph signals. Our analysis leads to the interpretation that, given enough labeled data, this method is very closely related to a constrained low density separation problem as the number of data points tends to infinity. We demonstrate the practical utility of our results through simple experiments.
