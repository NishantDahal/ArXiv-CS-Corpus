SegSALSA-STR: A convex formulation to supervised hyperspectral image segmentation using hidden fields and structure tensor regularization

We present a supervised hyperspectral image segmentation algorithm based on a convex formulation of a marginal maximum a posteriori segmentation with hidden fields and structure tensor regularization: Segmentation via the Constraint Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage by Structure Tensor Regularization (SegSALSA-STR). This formulation avoids the generally discrete nature of segmentation problems and the inherent NP-hardness of the integer optimization associated.
  We extend the Segmentation via the Constraint Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage (SegSALSA) algorithm by generalizing the vectorial total variation prior using a structure tensor prior constructed from a patch-based Jacobian. The resulting algorithm is convex, time-efficient and highly parallelizable. This shows the potential of combining hidden fields with convex optimization through the inclusion of different regularizers. The SegSALSA-STR algorithm is validated in the segmentation of real hyperspectral images.
