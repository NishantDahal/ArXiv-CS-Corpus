Big Data Strategies for Data Center Infrastructure Management Using a 3D Gaming Platform

High Performance Computing (HPC) is intrinsically linked to effective Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM). Cloud services and HPC have become key components in Department of Defense and corporate Information Technology competitive strategies in the global and commercial spaces. As a result, the reliance on consistent, reliable Data Center space is more critical than ever. The costs and complexity of providing quality DCIM are constantly being tested and evaluated by the United States Government and companies such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook. This paper will demonstrate a system where Big Data strategies and 3D gaming technology is leveraged to successfully monitor and analyze multiple HPC systems and a lights-out modular HP EcoPOD 240a Data Center on a singular platform. Big Data technology and a 3D gaming platform enables the relative real time monitoring of 5000 environmental sensors, more than 3500 IT data points and display visual analytics of the overall operating condition of the Data Center from a command center over 100 miles away. In addition, the Big Data model allows for in depth analysis of historical trends and conditions to optimize operations achieving even greater efficiencies and reliability.
