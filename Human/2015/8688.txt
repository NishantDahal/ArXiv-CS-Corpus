Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning on Graphs: Complete Algorithms and Effective Heuristics

We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs MPP over four distinct minimization objectives: the makespan (last arrival time), the maximum (single-robot traveled) distance, the total arrival time, and the total distance. In a related paper, we show that these objectives are distinct and NP-hard to optimize. In this work, we focus on efficiently algorithmic solutions for solving these optimal MPP problems. Toward this goal, we first establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and network-flow. Based on this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a first such that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with robot-vertex ratio as high as 100%. Then, we further improve the computational performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled heuristics, at the expense of some optimality loss. The combination of ILP model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective, allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just seconds.
