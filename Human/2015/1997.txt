Authentication Systems in Internet of Things

This paper analyses the various authentication systems implemented for enhanced security and private re-position of an individual's log-in credentials. The first part of the paper describes the multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems, which, though not applicable to the field of Internet of Things, provides great security to a user's credentials. MFA is followed by a brief description of the working mechanism of interaction of third party clients with private resources over the OAuth protocol framework and a study of the delegation based authentication system in IP-based IoT.
