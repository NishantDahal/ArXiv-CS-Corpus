Node.DPWS: High performance and scalable Web Services for the IoT

Interconnected computing systems, in various forms, are expected to permeate our lives, realizing the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) and allowing us to enjoy novel, enhanced services that promise to improve our everyday lives. Nevertheless, this new reality also introduces significant challenges in terms of performance, scaling, usability and interoperability. Leveraging the benefits of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) can help alleviate many of the issues that developers, implementers and end-users have to face in the context of the IoT. This work presents Node.DPWS, a novel implementation of the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) based on the Node.js platform. Node.DPWS can be used to deploy lightweight, efficient and scalable Web Services over heterogeneous nodes, including devices with limited resources. The performance of the presented work is evaluated on typical embedded devices, including comparisons with implementations created using alternative DPWS toolkits.
