Analyzing Interference from Static Cellular Cooperation using the Nearest Neighbour Model

The problem of base station cooperation has recently been set within the framework of Stochastic Geometry. Existing works consider that a user dynamically chooses the set of stations that cooperate for his/her service. However, this assumption often does not hold. Cooperation groups could be predefined and static, with nodes connected by fixed infrastructure. To analyse such a potential network, in this work we propose a grouping method based on proximity. It is a variation of the so called Nearest Neighbour Model. We restrict ourselves to the simplest case where only singles and pairs of base stations are allowed to be formed. For this, two new point processes are defined from the dependent thinning of a Poisson Point Process, one for the singles and one for the pairs. Structural characteristics for the two are provided, including their density, Voronoi surface, nearest neighbour, empty space and J-function. We further make use of these results to analyse their interference fields and give explicit formulas to their expected value and their Laplace transform. The results constitute a novel toolbox towards the performance evaluation of networks with static cooperation.
