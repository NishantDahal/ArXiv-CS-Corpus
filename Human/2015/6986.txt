On the Uniqueness of Group Sparse Coding

In this technical document we present a proof on the uniqueness of group sparse coding through the block ACS theorem. Leveraging the original ACS theorem of Hillar and Sommer for sparse coding, we demonstrate a similar uniqueness property holds for the task of group sparse coding.
