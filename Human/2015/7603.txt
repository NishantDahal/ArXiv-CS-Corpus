Writing and Publishing Scientific Articles in Computer Science

Over 15 years of teaching, advising students and coordinating scientific research activities and projects in computer science, we have observed the difficulties of students to write scientific papers to present the results of their research practices. In addition, they repeatedly have doubts about the publishing process. In this article we propose a conceptual framework to support the writing and publishing of scientific papers in computer science, providing a kind of guide for computer science students to effectively present the results of their research practices, particularly for experimental research.
