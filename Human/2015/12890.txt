Out-of-Band Radiation Comparison of GFDM, WCP-COQAM and OFDM at Equal Spectral Efficiency

GFDM and WCP-COQAM are amongst the candidate physical layer modulation formats to be used in 5G, whose claimed lower out-of-band (OOB) emissions are important with respect to cognitive radio based dynamic spectrum access solutions. In this study, we compare OFDM, GFDM and WCP-COQAM in terms of OOB emissions in a fair manner such that their spectral efficiencies are the same and OOB emission reduction techniques are applied to all of the modulation types. Analytical PSD expressions are also correlated with the simulation based OOB emission results. Maintaining the same spectral efficiency, carrier frequency offset immunities will also be compared.
