Energy-Efficient Infrastructure Sensor Network for Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Network

We propose an energy-efficient network architecture that consists of ad hoc (mobile) cognitive radios (CRs) and infrastructure wireless sensor nodes. The sensor nodes within communications range of each CR are grouped into a cluster and the clusters of CRs are regularly updated according to the random mobility of the CRs. We reduce the energy consumption and the end-to-end delay of the sensor network by dividing each cluster into disjoint subsets with overlapped sensing coverage of primary user (PU) activity. Respective subset of a CR provides target detection and false alarm probabilities. Substantial energy efficiency is achieved by activating only one subset of the cluster, while putting the rest of the subsets in the cluster into sleep mode.
