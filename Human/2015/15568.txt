Real-Time scheduling: from hard to soft real-time systems

Real-time systems are traditionally classified into hard real-time and soft real-time: in the first category we have safety critical real-time systems where missing a deadline can have catastrophic consequences, whereas in the second class we find systems or which we need to optimise the Quality of service provided to the user. However, the frontier between these two classes is thinner than one may think, and many systems that were considered as hard real-time in the past should now be reconsidered under a different light. In this paper we shall first recall the fundamental notion of time-predictability and criticality, in order to understand where the real-time deadlines that we use in our theoretical models come from. We shall then introduce the model of a soft real-time system and present one popular method for scheduling hard and soft real-time tasks, the resource reservation framework. Finally, we shall show how resource reservation techniques can be successfully applied to the design of classical control systems, thus adding robustness to the system and increasing resource utilisation and performance.
