Non-dominating sequences of vectors using only resets and increments

We consider a variant of Dickson lemma, where each entry of a vector can be reseted or incremented by 1 in respect to the previous one. We give an example of non dominating sequence of length $2^{2^{Î¸(n)}}$. It perfectly match the previously known upperbound.
