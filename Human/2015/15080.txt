The Maximum Cardinality Cut Problem is Polynomial in Proper Interval Graphs

It is known that the maximum cardinality cut problem is NP-hard even in chordal graphs. In this paper, we consider the time complexity of the problem in proper interval graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs, and propose a dynamic programming algorithm which runs in polynomial-time.
