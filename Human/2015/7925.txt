Affect Sensing on Smartphone - Possibilities of Understanding Cognitive Decline in Aging Population

Due to increasing sensing capacity, smartphones offer unprecedented opportunity to monitor human health. Affect sensing is one such essential monitoring that can be achieved on smartphones. Information about affect can be useful for many modern applications. In particular, it can be potentially used for understanding cognitive decline in aging population. In this paper we present an overview of the existing literature that offer affect sensing on smartphone platform. Most importantly, we present the challenges that need to be addressed to make affect sensing on smartphone a reality.
