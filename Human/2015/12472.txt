Block Sparse Memory Improved Proportionate Affine Projection Sign Algorithm

A block sparse memory improved proportionate affine projection sign algorithm (BS-MIP-APSA) is proposed for block sparse system identification under impulsive noise. The new BS-MIP-APSA not only inherits the performance improvement for block-sparse system identification, but also achieves robustness to impulsive noise and the efficiency of the memory improved proportionate affine projection sign algorithm (MIP-APSA). Simulations indicate that it can provide both faster convergence rate and better tracking ability under impulsive interference for block sparse system identification as compared to APSA and MIP-APSA.
