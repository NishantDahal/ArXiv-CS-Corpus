On the Shift Value Set of Cyclic Shifted Sequences for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals have high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which causes distortion when OFDM signal passes through a nonlinear high power amplifier (HPA). A partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme is one of the typical PAPR reduction methods. A cyclic shifted sequences (CSS) scheme is evolved from the PTS scheme to improve the PAPR reduction performance, where OFDM signal subsequences are cyclically shifted and combined to generate alternative OFDM signal sequences. The shift value (SV) sets in the CSS scheme should be carefully selected because those are closely related to the PAPR reduction performance of the CSS scheme. In this letter, we propose some criteria to select the good SV sets and verify its validness through simulations.
