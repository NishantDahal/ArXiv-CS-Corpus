ScratchR: Sharing User-generated Programmable Media

In this paper, I describe a platform for sharing programmable media on the web called ScratchR. As the backbone of an on-line community of creative learners, ScratchR will give members access to an audience and inspirational ideas from each other. ScratchR seeks to support different states of participation: from passive consumption to active creation. This platform is being evaluated with a group of middle-school students and a larger community of beta testers.
