Experimental Characterization of a Bearing-only Sensor for Use With the PHD Filter

This report outlines the procedure and results of an experiment to characterize a bearing-only sensor for use with PHD filter. The resulting detection, measurement, and clutter models are used for hardware and simulated experiments with a team of mobile robots autonomously seeking an unknown number of objects of interest in an office environment.
