The 5th annual international conference on Collaborative Innovation Networks Conference (COINS) takes place at Keio University from March 12 to 14, 2015. COINS15 brings together practitioners, researchers and students of the emerging science of collaboration to share their work, learn from each other, and get inspired through creative new ideas.
  Where science, design, business and art meet, COINS15 looks at the emerging forces behind the phenomena of open-source, creative, entrepreneurial and social movements. Through interactive workshops, professional presentations, and fascinating keynotes, COINS15 combines a wide range of interdisciplinary fields such as social network analysis, group dynamics, design and visualization, information systems, collective action and the psychology and sociality of collaboration.
