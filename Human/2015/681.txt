Estimates for the growth of inverse determinant sums of quasi-orthogonal and number field lattices

Inverse determinant sums appear naturally as a tool for analyzing performance of space-time codes in Rayleigh fading channels. This work will analyze the growth of inverse determinant sums of a family of quasi-orthogonal codes and will show that the growths are in logarithmic class. This is considerably lower than that of comparable number field codes.
