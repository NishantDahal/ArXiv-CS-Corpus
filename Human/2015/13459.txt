Using Cloud-Aware Provenance to Reproduce Scientific Workflow Execution on Cloud

Provenance has been thought of a mechanism to verify a workflow and to provide workflow reproducibility. This provenance of scientific workflows has been effectively carried out in Grid based scientific workflow systems. However, recent adoption of Cloud-based scientific workflows present an opportunity to investigate the suitability of existing approaches or propose new approaches to collect provenance information from the Cloud and to utilize it for workflow repeatability in the Cloud infrastructure. This paper presents a novel approach that can assist in mitigating this challenge. This approach can collect Cloud infrastructure information from an outside Cloud client along with workflow provenance and can establish a mapping between them. This mapping is later used to re-provision resources on the Cloud for workflow execution. The reproducibility of the workflow execution is performed by: (a) capturing the Cloud infrastructure information (virtual machine configuration) along with the workflow provenance, (b) re-provisioning the similar resources on the Cloud and re-executing the workflow on them and (c) by comparing the outputs of workflows. The evaluation of the prototype suggests that the proposed approach is feasible and can be investigated further. Moreover, there is no reference reproducibility model exists in literature that can provide guidelines to achieve this goal in Cloud. This paper also attempts to present a model that is used in the proposed design to achieve workflow reproducibility in the Cloud environment.
