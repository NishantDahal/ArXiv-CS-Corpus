Regular Bipartite Graphs And Their Properties

We introduce a new notation for representing labeled regular bipartite graphs of arbitrary degree. Several enumeration problems for labeled and unlabeled regular bipartite graphs have been introduced. A general algorithm for enumerating all non-isomorphic 2-regular bipartite graphs for a specified number of vertices has been described and a mathematical proof has been provided for its completeness. An abstraction of m Symmetric Permutation Tree in order to visualize a labeled r-Regular Bipartite Graph with 2m vertices and enumerate its automorphism group has been introduced. An algorithm to generate the partition associated with two compatible permutations has been introduced. The relationship between Automorphism Group and permutation enumeration problem has been used to derive formulae for the number of compatible permutations corresponding to a specified partition.
