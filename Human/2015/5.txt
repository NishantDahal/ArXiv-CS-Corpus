RANSAC based three points algorithm for ellipse fitting of spherical object's projection

As the spherical object can be seen everywhere, we should extract the ellipse image accurately and fit it by implicit algebraic curve in order to finish the 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a new ellipse fitting algorithm which only needs three points to fit the projection of spherical object and is different from the traditional algorithms that need at least five point. The fitting procedure is just similar as the estimation of Fundamental Matrix estimation by seven points, and the RANSAC algorithm has also been used to exclude the interference of noise and scattered points.
