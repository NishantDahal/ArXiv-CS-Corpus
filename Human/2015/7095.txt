Logical Inference by DNA Strand Algebra

Based on the concept of DNA strand displacement and DNA strand algebra we have developed a method for logical inference which is not based on silicon based computing. Essentially, it is a paradigm shift from silicon to carbon. In this paper we have considered the inference mechanism, viz. modus ponens, to draw conclusion from any observed fact. Thus, the present approach to logical inference based on DNA strand algebra is basically an attempt to develop expert system design in the domain of DNA computing. We have illustrated our methodology with respect to worked out example. Our methodology is very flexible for implementation of different expert system applications.
