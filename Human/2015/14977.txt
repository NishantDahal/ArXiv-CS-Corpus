On the diameter of lattice polytopes

In this paper we show that the diameter of a d-dimensional lattice polytope in [0,k]^n is at most (k - 1/2) d. This result implies that the diameter of a d-dimensional half-integral polytope is at most 3/2 d. We also show that for half-integral polytopes the latter bound is tight for any d.
