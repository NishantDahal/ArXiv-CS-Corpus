Statistical Network Topology for Crisis Informetrics

Crisis informetrics is considered to be a relatively new and emerging area of research, which deals with the application of analytical approaches of network and information science combined with experimental learning approaches of statistical mechanics to explore communication and information flow, robustness as well as tolerance of complex crisis networks under threats. In this paper, we discuss the scale free network property of an organizational communication network and test both traditional (static) and dynamic topology of social networks during organizational crises Both types of topologies exhibit similar characteristics of prominent actors reinforcing the power law distribution nature of scale free networks. There are no significant fluctuations among the actor prominence in daily and aggregated networks. We found that email communication network display a high degree of scale free behavior described by power law.
