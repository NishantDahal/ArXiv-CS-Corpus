Demystifying Reachability in Vector Addition Systems

More than 30 years after their inception, the decidability proofs for reachability in vector addition systems (VAS) still retain much of their mystery. These proofs rely crucially on a decomposition of runs successively refined by Mayr, Kosaraju, and Lambert, which appears rather magical, and for which no complexity upper bound is known.
  We first offer a justification for this decomposition technique, by showing that it computes the ideal decomposition of the set of runs, using the natural embedding relation between runs as well quasi ordering. In a second part, we apply recent results on the complexity of termination thanks to well quasi orders and well orders to obtain a cubic Ackermann upper bound for the decomposition algorithms, thus providing the first known upper bounds for general VAS reachability.
