SQL Queries for Declarative Process Mining on Event Logs of Relational Databases

Flexible business processes can often be modelled more easily using a declarative rather than a procedural modelling approach. Process mining aims at automating the discovery of business process models. Existing declarative process mining approaches either suffer performance issues with real-life event logs or limit their expressiveness to a specific set of constaint types. Lately, with RelationalXES a relational database architecture for storing event log data has been introduced. In this technical report, we introduce a mining approach that directly works on relational event data by querying the log with conventional SQL. We provide a list of SQL queries for discovering a set of commonly used and mined process constraints.
