A pilot study of the use of LogEx, lessons learned

LogEx is a learning environment that supports students in rewriting propositional logical formulae, using standard equivalences. We organized a pilot study to prepare a large scale evaluation of the learning environment. In this paper we describe this study, together with the outcomes, which teach us valuable lessons for the large scale evaluation.
