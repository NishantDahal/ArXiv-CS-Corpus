Preprint Imagining In-Air Interaction for Hemiplegia Sufferer

This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR2015). In this paper, we described the imagination scenarios of a touch-less interaction technology for hemiplegia, which can support either hand or foot interaction with the smartphone or head mounted device (HMD). The computer vision interaction technology is implemented in our previous work, which provides a core support for gesture interaction by accurately detecting and tracking the hand or foot gesture. The patients interact with the application using hand/foot gesture motion in the camera view.
