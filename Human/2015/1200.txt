Transducer Descriptions of DNA Code Properties and Undecidability of Antimorphic Problems

This work concerns formal descriptions of DNA code properties, and builds on previous work on transducer descriptions of classic code properties and on trajectory descriptions of DNA code properties. This line of research allows us to give a property as input to an algorithm, in addition to any regular language, which can then answer questions about the language and the property. Here we define DNA code properties via transducers and show that this method is strictly more expressive than that of trajectories, without sacrificing the efficiency of deciding the satisfaction question. We also show that the maximality question can be undecidable. Our undecidability results hold not only for the fixed DNA involution but also for any fixed antimorphic permutation. Moreover, we also show the undecidability of the antimorphic version of the Post Corresponding Problem, for any fixed antimorphic permutation.
