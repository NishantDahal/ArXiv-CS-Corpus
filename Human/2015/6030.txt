Performance Analysis of Opportunistic Relaying Over Imperfect Non-identical Log-normal Fading Channels

Motivated by the fact that full diversity order is achieved using the "best-relay" selection technique, we consider opportunistic amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying systems. We focus on the outage probability of such a systems and then derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability of these systems over independent but non-identical imperfect Log-normal fading channels. We consider the error of channel estimation as a Gaussian random variable. As a result the estimated channels distribution are not Log-normal either as would be in the case of the Rayleigh fading channels. This is exactly the reason why our simulation results do not exactly matched with analytical results. However, this difference is negligible for a wide variety of situations.
