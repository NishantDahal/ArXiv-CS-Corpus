Designing Wireless Broadband Access for Energy Efficiency: Are Small Cells the Only Answer?

The main usage of cellular networks has changed from voice to data traffic, mostly requested by static users. In this paper, we analyze how a cellular network should be designed to provide such wireless broadband access with maximal energy efficiency (EE). Using stochastic geometry and a detailed power consumption model, we optimize the density of access points (APs), number of antennas and users per AP, and transmission power for maximal EE. Small cells are of course a key technology in this direction, but the analysis shows that the EE improvement of a small-cell network saturates quickly with the AP density and then "massive MIMO" techniques can further improve the EE.
