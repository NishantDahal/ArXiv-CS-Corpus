Extended Delivery Time Analysis for Cognitive Packet Transmission with Application to Secondary Queuing Analysis

Cognitive radio transceiver can opportunistically access the underutilized spectrum resource of primary systems for new wireless services. With interleave implementation, the secondary transmission may be interrupted by the primary user's transmission. To facilitate the delay analysis of such secondary transmission for a fixed-size secondary packet, we study the resulting extended delivery time that includes both transmission time and waiting time. In particular, we derive the exact distribution function of extended delivery time of secondary transmission for both continuous sensing and periodic sensing cases. Selected numerical and simulation results are presented for illustrating the mathematical formulation. Finally, we consider a generalized M/G/1 queue set-up at the secondary user and formulate the closed-form expressions for the expected delay with Poisson traffic. The analytical results will greatly facilitate the design of the secondary system for particular target application.
