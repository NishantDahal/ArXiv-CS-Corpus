Analysis of Massive MIMO With Hardware Impairments and Different Channel Models

Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is foreseen to be one of the main technology components in next generation cellular communications (5G). In this paper, fundamental limits on the performance of downlink massive MIMO systems are investigated by means of simulations and analytical analysis. Signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) and sum rate for a single-cell scenario multi-user MIMO are analyzed for different array sizes, channel models, and precoding schemes. The impact of hardware impairments on performance is also investigated. Simple approximations are derived that show explicitly how the number of antennas, number of served users, transmit power, and magnitude of hardware impairments affect performance.
