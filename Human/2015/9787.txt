Proceedings 8th Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE 2015, the 8th Interaction and Concurrency Experience, which was held in Grenoble, France on the 4th and 5th of June 2015 as a satellite event of DisCoTec 2015. The ICE procedure for paper selection allows PC members to interact, anonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a discussion forum with access restricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of interest. The PC members post comments and questions to which the authors reply. Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether 9 papers, including 1 short paper, were accepted for publication (the workshop also featured 4 brief announcements which are not part of this volume). We were proud to host three invited talks, by Leslie Lamport (shared with the FRIDA workshop), Joseph Sifakis and Steve Ross-Talbot. The abstracts of the last two talks are included in this volume together with the regular papers.
