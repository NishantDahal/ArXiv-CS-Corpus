Integration of Heterogeneous Modeling Languages via Extensible and Composable Language Components

Effective model-driven engineering of complex systems requires to appropriately describe different specific system aspects. To this end, efficient integration of different heterogeneous modeling languages is essential. Modeling language integaration is onerous and requires in-depth conceptual and technical knowledge and ef- fort. Traditional modeling lanugage integration approches require language engineers to compose monolithic language aggregates for a specific task or project. Adapting these aggregates cannot be to different contexts requires vast effort and makes these hardly reusable. This contribution presents a method for the engineering of grammar-based language components that can be independently developed, are syntactically composable, and ultimately reusable. To this end, it introduces the concepts of language aggregation, language embed- ding, and language inheritance, as well as their realization in the language workbench MontiCore. The result is a generalizable, systematic, and efficient syntax-oriented composition of languages that allows the agile employment of modeling languages efficiently tailored for individual software projects.
