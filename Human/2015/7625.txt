On the computational complexity of evolution

It is well-known that the problem of recognizing an ESS in a symmetric bimatrix game is coNP-complete. In this paper, we show that recognizing an ESS even in doubly symmetric bimatrix games is also coNP-complete. Our result further implies that recognizing asymptotically stable equilibria of the replicator dynamic in this class of games is also a coNP-complete problem.
