On the Impact of Antenna Topologies for Massive MIMO Systems

Approximate expressions for the spatial correlation of cylindrical and uniform rectangular arrays (URA) are derived using measured distributions of angles of departure (AOD) for both the azimuth and zenith domains. We examine massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) convergence properties of the correlated channels by considering a number of convergence metrics. The per-user matched filter (MF) signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) performance and convergence rate, to respective limiting values, of the two antenna topologies is also explored.
