Design of a visible-light-communication enhanced WiFi system

Visible light communication (VLC) has wide unlicensed bandwidth, enables communication in radio frequency (RF) sensitive environments, realizes energy-efficient data transmission, and has the potential to boost the capacity of wireless access networks through spatial reuse. On the other hand, WiFi provides more coverage than VLC and does not suffer from the likelihood of blockage due to the light of sight (LOS) requirement of VLC. In order to take the advantages of both WiFi and VLC, we propose and implement two heterogeneous systems with Internet access. One is the hybrid WiFi-VLC system, utilizing unidirectional VLC channel as downlink and reserving the WiFi back-channel as uplink. The asymmetric solution resolves the optical uplink challenges and benefits from the full-duplex communication based on VLC. To further enhance the robustness and increase throughput, the other system is presented, in which we aggregate WiFi and VLC in parallel by leveraging the bonding technique in Linux operating system. Online experiment results reveal that the hybrid system outperforms the conventional WiFi for the crowded environments in terms of throughput and web page loading time; and also demonstrate the further improved performance of the aggregated system when considering the blocking duration and the distance between access point and user device.
