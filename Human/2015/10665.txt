A Nonlinear HP-Type Complementary Resistive Switch

Resistive Switching (RS) is the change in resistance of a dielectric under the influence of an external current or electric field. This change is non-volatile, and the basis of both the memristor and resistive random access memory. In the latter, high integration densities favor the anti-serial combination of two RS-elements to a single cell, termed the complementary resistive switch (CRS). Motivated by the irregular shape of the filament protruding into the device, we suggest a nonlinearity in the resistance-interpolation function, and thereby expand the original HP-memristor. We numerically simulate and analytically solve this model. Further, the nonlinearity allows for its application to the CRS.
