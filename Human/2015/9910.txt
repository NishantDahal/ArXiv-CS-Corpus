Exploring Ancient Architectural Designs with Cellular Automata

The paper discusses the utilization of three-dimensional cellular automata employing the two-dimensional totalistic cellular automata to simulate how simple rules could emerge a highly complex architectural designs of some Indonesian heritages. A detailed discussion is brought to see the simple rules applied in Borobudur Temple, the largest ancient Buddhist temple in the country with very complex detailed designs within. The simulation confirms some previous findings related to measurement of the temple as well as some other ancient buildings in Indonesia. This happens to open further exploitation of the explanatory power presented by cellular automata for complex architectural designs built by civilization not having any supporting sophisticated tools, even standard measurement systems.
