Maximization Problems Parameterized Using Their Minimization Versions: The Case of Vertex Cover

The parameterized complexity of problems is often studied with respect to the size of their optimal solutions. However, for a maximization problem, the size of the optimal solution can be very large, rendering algorithms parameterized by it inefficient. Therefore, we suggest to study the parameterized complexity of maximization problems with respect to the size of the optimal solutions to their minimization versions. We examine this suggestion by considering the Maximal Minimal Vertex Cover (MMVC) problem, whose minimization version, Vertex Cover, is one of the most studied problems in the field of Parameterized Complexity. Our main contribution is a parameterized approximation algorithm for MMVC, including its weighted variant. We also give conditional lower bounds for the running times of algorithms for MMVC and its weighted variant.
