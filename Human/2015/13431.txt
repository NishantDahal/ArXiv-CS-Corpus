A Network-of-Networks Model for Electrical Infrastructure Networks

Modeling power transmission networks is an important area of research with applications such as vulnerability analysis, study of cascading failures, and location of measurement devices. Graph-theoretic approaches have been widely used to solve these problems, but are subject to several limitations. One of the limitations is the ability to model a heterogeneous system in a consistent manner using the standard graph-theoretic formulation. In this paper, we propose a {\em network-of-networks} approach for modeling power transmission networks in order to explicitly incorporate heterogeneity in the model. This model distinguishes between different components of the network that operate at different voltage ratings, and also captures the intra and inter-network connectivity patterns. By building the graph in this fashion we present a novel, and fundamentally different, perspective of power transmission networks. Consequently, this novel approach will have a significant impact on the graph-theoretic modeling of power grids that we believe will lead to a better understanding of transmission networks.
