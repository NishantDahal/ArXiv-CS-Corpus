Compressive sensing based differential channel feedback for massive MIMO

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is becoming a key technology for future 5G wireless communications. Channel feedback for massive MIMO is challenging due to the substantially increased dimension of MIMO channel matrix. In this letter, we propose a compressive sensing (CS) based differential channel feedback scheme to reduce the feedback overhead. Specifically, the temporal correlation of time-varying channels is exploited to generate the differential channel impulse response (CIR) between two CIRs in neighboring time slots, which enjoys a much stronger sparsity than the original sparse CIRs. Thus, the base station can recover the differential CIR from the highly compressed differential CIR under the framework of CS theory. Simulations show that the proposed scheme reduces the feedback overhead by about 20\% compared with the direct CS-based scheme.
