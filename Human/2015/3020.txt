Detection Algorithms for Molecular MIMO

In this paper, we propose a novel design for molecular communication in which both the transmitter and the receiver have, in a 3-dimensional environment, multiple bulges (in RF communication this corresponds to antenna). The proposed system consists of a fluid medium, information molecules, a transmitter, and a receiver. We simulate the system with a one-shot signal to obtain the channel's finite impulse response. We then incorporate this result within our mathematical analysis to determine interference. Molecular communication has a great need for low complexity, hence, the receiver may have incomplete information regarding the system and the channel state. Thus, for the cases of limited information set at the receiver, we propose three detection algorithms, namely adaptive thresholding, practical zero forcing, and Genie-aided zero forcing.
