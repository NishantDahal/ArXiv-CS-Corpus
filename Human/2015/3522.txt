Boson-Sampling with non-interacting fermions

We explore the conditions under which identical particles in unitary linear networks behave as the other species, i.e. bosons as fermions and fermions as bosons. It is found that the Boson-Sampling computer of Aaronson & Arkhipov can be implemented in an interference experiment with non-interacting fermions in an appropriately entangled state. Moreover, a scheme is proposed which simulates the scattershot version of the Boson-Sampling computer by preparing, on the fly, the required entangled state of fermions from an unentangled one.
