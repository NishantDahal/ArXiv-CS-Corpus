Quantum games of opinion formation based on the Marinatto-Weber quantum game scheme

Quantization becomes a new way to study classical game theory since quantum strategies and quantum games have been proposed. In previous studies, many typical game models, such as prisoner's dilemma, battle of the sexes, Hawk-Dove game, have been investigated by using quantization approaches. In this paper, several game models of opinion formations have been quantized based on the Marinatto-Weber quantum game scheme, a frequently used scheme to convert classical games to quantum versions. Our results show that the quantization can change fascinatingly the properties of some classical opinion formation game models so as to generate win-win outcomes.
