Link Prediction in Networks with Nodes Attributes by Similarity Propagation

The problem of link prediction has attracted considerable recent attention from various domains such as sociology, anthropology, information science, and computer sciences. A link prediction algorithm is proposed based on link similarity score propagation by a random walk in networks with nodes attributes. In the algorithm, each link in the network is assigned a transmission probability according to the similarity of the attributes on the nodes connected by the link. The link similarity score between the nodes are then propagated via the links according to their transmission probability. Our experimental results show that it can obtain higher quality results on the networks with node attributes than other algorithms.
