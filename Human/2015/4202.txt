Computing a consensus journal meta-ranking using paired comparisons and adaptive lasso estimators

In a "publish-or-perish culture", the ranking of scientific journals plays a central role in assessing performance in the current research environment. With a wide range of existing methods and approaches to deriving journal rankings, meta-rankings have gained popularity as a means of aggregating different information sources. In this paper, we propose a method to create a consensus meta-ranking using heterogeneous journal rankings. Using a parametric model for paired comparison data we estimate quality scores for 58 journals in the OR/MS community, which together with a shrinkage procedure allows for the identification of clusters of journals with similar quality. The use of paired comparisons provides a flexible framework for deriving a consensus score while eliminating the problem of data missingness.
