Optimal User-Cell Association for Massive MIMO Wireless Networks

The use of a very large number of antennas at each base station site (referred to as "Massive MIMO") is one of the most promising approaches to cope with the predicted wireless data traffic explosion. In combination with Time Division Duplex and with simple per-cell processing, it achieves large throughput per cell, low latency, and attractive power efficiency performance. Following the current wireless technology trend of moving to higher frequency bands and denser small cell deployments, a large number of antennas can be implemented within a small form factor even in small cell base stations. In a heterogeneous network formed by large (macro) and small cell BSs, a key system optimization problem consists of "load balancing", that is, associating users to BSs in order to avoid congested hot-spots and/or under-utilized infrastructure. In this paper, we consider the user-BS association problem for a massive MIMO heterogeneous network. We formulate the problem as a network utility maximization, and provide a centralized solution in terms of the fraction of transmission resources (time-frequency slots) over which each user is served by a given BS. Furthermore, we show that such a solution is physically realizable, i.e., there exists a sequence of integer scheduling configurations realizing (by time-sharing) the optimal fractions. While this solution is optimal, it requires centralized computation. Then, we also consider decentralized user-centric schemes, formulated as non-cooperative games where each user makes individual selfish association decisions based only on its local information. We identify a class of schemes such that their Nash equilibrium is very close to the global centralized optimum. Hence, these user-centric algorithms are attractive not only for their simplicity and fully decentralized implementation, but also because they operate near the system "social" optimum.
