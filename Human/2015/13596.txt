A Python Engine for Teaching Artificial Intelligence in Games

Computer games play an important role in our society and motivate people to learn computer science. Since artificial intelligence is integral to most games, they can also be used to teach artificial intelligence. We introduce the Game AI Game Engine (GAIGE), a Python game engine specifically designed to teach about how AI is used in computer games. A progression of seven assignments builds toward a complete, working Multi-User Battle Arena (MOBA) game. We describe the engine, the assignments, and our experiences using it in a class on Game Artificial Intelligence.
