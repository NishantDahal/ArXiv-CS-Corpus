User Centric Content Management System for Open IPTV Over SNS (ICTC2012)

Coupled schemes between service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web 2.0 have recently been researched. Web-based content providers and telecommunications company (Telecom) based Internet protocol television (IPTV) providers have struggled against each other to accommodate more three-screen service subscribers. Since the advent of Web 2.0, more abundant reproduced content can be circulated. However, because according to increasing device's resolution and content formats IPTV providers transcode content in advance, network bandwidth, storage and operation costs for content management systems (CMSs) are wasted. In this paper, we present a user centric CMS for open IPTV, which integrates SOA and Web 2.0. Considering content popularity based on a Zipf-like distribution to solve these problems, we analyze the performance between the user centric CMS and the conventional Web syndication system for normalized costs. Based on the user centric CMS, we implement a social Web TV with device-aware function, which can aggregate, transcode, and deploy content over social networking service (SNS) independently.
