Analysis of Lithography Based Approaches In development of Semi Conductors

The end of the 19th century brought about a change in the dynamics of computing by the development of the microprocessor. Huge bedroom size computers began being replaced by portable, smaller sized desktops. Today the world is dominated by silicon, which has circumscribed chip development for computers through microprocessors. Majority of the integrated circuits that are manufactured at present are developed using the concept of Lithography. This paper presents a detailed analysis of multiple Lithography methodologies as a means for advanced integrated circuit development. The study paper primarily restricts to examples in the context of Lithography, surveying the various existing techniques of Lithography in literature, examining feasible and efficient methods, highlighting the various pros and cons of each of them.
