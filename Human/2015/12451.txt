Asymptotic Scaling Laws of Wireless Adhoc Network with Physical Layer Caching

We propose a physical layer (PHY) caching scheme for wireless adhoc networks. The PHY caching exploits cache-assisted multihop gain and cache-induced dual-layer CoMP gain, which substantially improves the throughput of wireless adhoc networks. In particular, the PHY caching scheme contains a novel PHY transmission mode called the cache-induced dual-layer CoMP which can support homogeneous opportunistic CoMP in the wireless adhoc network. Compared with traditional per-node throughput scaling results of Î˜\left(1/\sqrt{N}\right), we can achieve O(1) per node throughput for a cached wireless adhoc network with N nodes. Moreover, we analyze the throughput of the PHY caching scheme for regular wireless adhoc networks and study the impact of various system parameters on the PHY caching gain.
