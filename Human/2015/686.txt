LDPC Coded Modulation with Probabilistic Shaping for Optical Fiber Systems

An LDPC coded modulation scheme with probabilistic shaping, optimized interleavers and noniterative demapping is proposed. Full-field simulations show an increase in transmission distance by 8% compared to uniformly distributed input.
