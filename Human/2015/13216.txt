On the stability of the PWP method

The PWP method was introduced by Diaz in 2009 as a technique for measuring indirect influences in complex networks. It depends on a matrix D, provided by the user, called the matrix of direct influences, and on a positive real parameter which is part of the method itself. We study changes in the method's predictions as D and the parameter vary.
