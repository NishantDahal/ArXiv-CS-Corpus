On the Minimum Cost Range Assignment Problem

We study the problem of assigning transmission ranges to radio stations placed arbitrarily in a $d$-dimensional ($d$-D) Euclidean space in order to achieve a strongly connected communication network with minimum total power consumption. The power required for transmitting in range $r$ is proportional to $r^α$, where $α$ is typically between $1$ and $6$, depending on various environmental factors. While this problem can be solved optimally in $1$D, in higher dimensions it is known to be $NP$-hard for any $α\geq 1$.
  For the $1$D version of the problem, i.e., radio stations located on a line and $α\geq 1$, we propose an optimal $O(n^2)$-time algorithm. This improves the running time of the best known algorithm by a factor of $n$. Moreover, we show a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the minimum cost range assignment in $1$D whose induced communication graph is a $t$-spanner, for any $t \geq 1$.
  In higher dimensions, finding the optimal range assignment is $NP$-hard; however, it can be approximated within a constant factor. The best known approximation ratio is for the case $α=1$, where the approximation ratio is $1.5$. We show a new approximation algorithm with improved approximation ratio of $1.5-ε$, where $ε>0$ is a small constant.
