Analytical Model for IEEE 802.15.4 Multi-Hop Networks with Improved Handling of Acknowledgements and Retransmissions

The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the deployment of cost-effective and energy-efficient multi-hop networks. This document features an in-depth presentation of an analytical model for assessing the performance of such networks. It considers a generic, static topology with Poisson distributed data-collection as well as data-dissemination traffic. The unslotted CSMA/CA MAC layer of IEEE 802.15.4 is closely modeled as well as an enhanced model of the neighborhood allows for consideration of collisions of packets including interferences with acknowledgements. The hidden node problem is taken into account as well as a formerly disregarded effect of repeated collisions of retransmissions. The model has been shown to be suitable to estimate the capacity of large-scale multi-hop networks.
