Broadcast Classical-Quantum Capacity Region of Two-Phase Bidirectional Relaying Channel

We study a three-node quantum network which enables bidirectional communication between two nodes with a half-duplex relay node. A decode-and-forward protocol is used to perform the communication in two phases. In the first phase, the messages of two nodes are transmitted to the relay node. In the second phase, the relay node broadcasts a re-encoded composition to the two nodes. We determine the capacity region of the broadcast phase.
