Preprint Serious Game Based Dysphonic Rehabilitation Tool

This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR2015). The purpose of this work is designing and implementing a rehabilitation software for dysphonic patients. Constant training is a key factor for this type of therapy. The patient can play the game as well as conduct the voice training simultaneously guided by therapists at clinic or exercise independently at home. The voice information can be recorded and extracted for evaluating the long-time rehabilitation progress.
