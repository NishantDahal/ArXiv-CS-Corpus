SuperGraph Visualization

Given a large social or computer network, how can we visualize it, find patterns, outliers, communities? Although several graph visualization tools exist, they cannot handle large graphs with hundred thousand nodes and possibly million edges. Such graphs bring two challenges: interactive visualization demands prohibitive processing power and, even if we could interactively update the visualization, the user would be overwhelmed by the excessive number of graphical items. To cope with this problem, we propose a formal innovation on the use of graph hierarchies that leads to GMine system. GMine promotes scalability using a hierarchy of graph partitions, promotes concomitant presentation for the graph hierarchy and for the original graph, and extends analytical possibilities with the integration of the graph partitions in an interactive environment.
