FendOff encryption software to secure personal information on computers and mobile devices

The paper describes several original cryptographic cipher modules (VSEM) that are based on using one time pseudorandom pad and pseudorandom transpositions. The VSEM includes 4 modules of encryption that can be applied in combinations. We studied ability of these modules to secure the private data against attacks and their speed of encryption. The VSEM encryption was implemented in Fendoff applications for mobile devices on iOS and Android platforms as well as in computer application running Window or Mac OS. We describe these applications designed to encrypt/decrypt various personal data such as passwords, credit card or bank information as well as to secure content of any text or image files.
