Factorizations of the Fibonacci Infinite Word

The aim of this note is to survey the factorizations of the Fibonacci infinite word that make use of the Fibonacci words and other related words, and to show that all these factorizations can be easily derived in sequence starting from elementary properties of the Fibonacci numbers.
