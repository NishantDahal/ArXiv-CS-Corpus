On the Connectedness of Clash-free Timetables

We investigate the connectedness of clash-free timetables with respect to the Kempe-exchange operation. This investigation is related to the connectedness of the search space of timetabling problem instances, which is a desirable property, for example for two-step algorithms using the Kempe-exchange during the optimization step. The theoretical framework for our investigations is based on the study of reconfiguration graphs, which model the search space of timetabling problems. We contribute to this framework by including timeslot availability requirements in the analysis and we derive improved conditions for the connectedness of clash-free timetables in this setting. We apply the theoretical insights to establish the connectedness of clash-free timetables for a number of benchmark instances.
