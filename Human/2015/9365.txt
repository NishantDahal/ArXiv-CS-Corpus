New Quantum Codes from Evaluation and Matrix-Product Codes

Stabilizer codes obtained via CSS code construction and Steane's enlargement of subfield-subcodes and matrix-product codes coming from generalized Reed-Muller, hyperbolic and affine variety codes are studied. Stabilizer codes with good quantum parameters are supplied, in particular, some binary codes of lengths 127 and 128 improve the parameters of the codes in http://www.codetables.de. Moreover, non-binary codes are presented either with parameters better than or equal to the quantum codes obtained from BCH codes by La Guardia or with lengths that can not be reached by them.
