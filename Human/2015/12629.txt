Trust as indicator of robot functional and social acceptance. An experimental study on user conformation to the iCub's answers

To investigate the functional and social acceptance of a humanoid robot, we carried out an experimental study with 56 adult participants and the iCub robot. Trust in the robot has been considered as a main indicator of acceptance in decision-making tasks characterized by perceptual uncertainty (e.g., evaluating the weight of two objects) and socio-cognitive uncertainty (e.g., evaluating which is the most suitable item in a specific context), and measured by the participants' conformation to the iCub's answers to specific questions. In particular, we were interested in understanding whether specific (i) user-related features (i.e. desire for control), (ii) robot-related features (i.e., attitude towards social influence of robots), and (iii) context-related features (i.e., collaborative vs. competitive scenario), may influence their trust towards the iCub robot. We found that participants conformed more to the iCub's answers when their decisions were about functional issues than when they were about social issues. Moreover, the few participants conforming to the iCub's answers for social issues also conformed less for functional issues. Trust in the robot's functional savvy does not thus seem to be a pre-requisite for trust in its social savvy. Finally, desire for control, attitude towards social influence of robots and type of interaction scenario did not influence the trust in iCub. Results are discussed with relation to methodology of HRI research.
