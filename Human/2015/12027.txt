Matrix-F5 algorithms over finite-precision complete discrete valuation fields

Let $(f\_1,\dots, f\_s) \in \mathbb{Q}\_p [X\_1,\dots, X\_n]^s$ be a sequence of homogeneous polynomials with $p$-adic coefficients. Such system may happen, for example, in arithmetic geometry. Yet, since $\mathbb{Q}\_p$ is not an effective field, classical algorithm does not apply.We provide a definition for an approximate Gr{รถ}bner basis with respect to a monomial order $w.$ We design a strategy to compute such a basis, when precision is enough and under the assumption that the input sequence is regular and the ideals $\langle f\_1,\dots,f\_i \rangle$ are weakly-$w$-ideals. The conjecture of Moreno-Socias states that for the grevlex ordering, such sequences are generic.Two variants of that strategy are available, depending on whether one lean more on precision or time-complexity. For the analysis of these algorithms, we study the loss of precision of the Gauss row-echelon algorithm, and apply it to an adapted Matrix-F5 algorithm. Numerical examples are provided.Moreover, the fact that under such hypotheses, Gr{รถ}bner bases can be computed stably has many applications. Firstly, the mapping sending $(f\_1,\dots,f\_s)$ to the reduced Gr{รถ}bner basis of the ideal they span is differentiable, and its differential can be given explicitly. Secondly, these hypotheses allows to perform lifting on the Grobner bases, from $\mathbb{Z}/p^k \mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z}/p^{k+k'} \mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}.$ Finally, asking for the same hypotheses on the highest-degree homogeneous components of the entry polynomials allows to extend our strategy to the affine case.
