Experimental evidence of chaos from memristors

Until now, most memristor-based chaotic circuits proposed in the literature are based on mathematical models which assume ideal characteristics such as piece-wise linear or cubic non-linearities. The idea, illustrated here and originating from the experimental approach for device characterization, is to realize a chaotic system exploiting the non-linearity of only one memristor with a very simple experimental set-up using feedback. In this way a simple circuit is obtained and chaos is experimentally observed and is confirmed by the calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent. Numerical results using the Strukov model support the existence of robust chaos in our circuit. This is the first experimental demonstration of chaos in a real memristor circuit and suggests that memristors are well placed for hardware encryption.
