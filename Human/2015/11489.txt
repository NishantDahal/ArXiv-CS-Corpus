Channel Detection in Coded Communication

We consider the problem of block-coded communication, where in each block, the channel law belongs to one of two disjoint sets. The decoder is aimed to decode only messages that have undergone a channel from one of the sets, and thus has to detect the set which contains the prevailing channel. We begin with the simplified case where each of the sets is a singleton. For any given code, we derive the optimum detection/decoding rule in the sense of the best trade-off among the probabilities of decoding error, false alarm, and misdetection, and also introduce sub-optimal detection/decoding rules which are simpler to implement. Then, various achievable bounds on the error exponents are derived, including the exact single-letter characterization of the random coding exponents for the optimal detector/decoder. We then extend the random coding analysis to general sets of channels, and show that there exists a universal detector/decoder which performs asymptotically as well as the optimal detector/decoder, when tuned to detect a channel from a specific pair of channels. The case of a pair of binary symmetric channels is discussed in detail.
