DSSI for pile supported asymmetrical buildings : a review

With the reference of the several documents in the field of soil structure interaction a document of present and past literature has been made with the including a main focus on interaction of pile supported frames. This study focuses on the complexity and excessive simplification of the model for foundation system and structures, and should be carried forward for its significance. The review is carried out including analytical, experimental and numerical approaches considered in the past study. The perusal of literature reveals that very few studies investigated on asymmetrical buildings supported on pile foundations. In this paper, an attempt is made to understand research carried out in pile soil structure interaction and research gap along with the scope of research has been identified to carry out the present research work.
