The proximal distance algorithm

The MM principle is a device for creating optimization algorithms satisfying the ascent or descent property. The current survey emphasizes the role of the MM principle in nonlinear programming. For smooth functions, one can construct an adaptive interior point method based on scaled Bregmann barriers. This algorithm does not follow the central path. For convex programming subject to nonsmooth constraints, one can combine an exact penalty method with distance majorization to create versatile algorithms that are effective even in discrete optimization. These proximal distance algorithms are highly modular and reduce to set projections and proximal mappings, both very well-understood techniques in optimization. We illustrate the possibilities in linear programming, binary piecewise-linear programming, nonnegative quadratic programming, $\ell_0$ regression, matrix completion, and inverse sparse covariance estimation.
