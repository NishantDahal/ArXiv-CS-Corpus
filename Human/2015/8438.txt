Multi-Lingual Ontology Server (MOS) for discovering Web services

Searching for appropriate web services on the internet is becoming more and more laborious, because it depends on human processing and evaluating of the available web services in UDDI repositories. Furthermore, if the requester language is different form available WSDL files then it would be more complicated. If this process could be done automatically, this will save effort and time. In order to make this factual, ontologies and semantic web technologies were used, ontology is needed to facilitate interoperability between agents and web services, to make them interoperate semantically, and to make processing of the data could be achieved automatically. In paper we propose an ontology server expected to help searching and selecting appropriate web service even if it is available in UDDI in different language.
