Model Driven Reactive Applications

Reactive applications (rapps) are of interest because of the explosion of mobile, tablet and web-based platforms. The complexity and proliferation of implementation technologies makes it attractive to use model-driven techniques to develop rapp systems. This article proposes a domain specific language for rapps consisting of stereotyped class models for the structure of the application and state machine models for the application behaviour. The models are given a semantics in terms of a transformation to a calculus called Widget. The languages are introduced using an example application for mobile phones.
