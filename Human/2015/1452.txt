How to Hunt an Invisible Rabbit on a Graph

We investigate Hunters & Rabbit game, where a set of hunters tries to catch an invisible rabbit that slides along the edges of a graph. We show that the minimum number of hunters required to win on an (n\times m)-grid is \lfloor min{n,m}/2\rfloor+1. We also show that the extremal value of this number on n-vertex trees is between Î©(log n/log log n) and O(log n).
