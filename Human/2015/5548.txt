Compressive Sensing of Large-Scale Images: An Assumption-Free Approach

Cost-efficient compressive sensing of big media data with fast reconstructed high-quality results is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale image compressive sensing method, composed of operator-based strategy in the context of fixed point continuation method and weighted LASSO with tree structure sparsity pattern. The main characteristic of our method is free from any assumptions and restrictions. The feasibility of our method is verified via simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms.
