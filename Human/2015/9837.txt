Contextually proximate approach to develop smart user interface

Researchers and experts are taking efforts in delivering an optimal user experience from a long time. Computer interfaces are being developed to keep user 'in the flow' as well as for making users more connected to the real world wile using virtual environment. Developing ubiquitous user interfaces for novices and experts at the same time is crucial work for interaction designers. This paper molds the designing approach of user interfaces in bit different parameters by reviewing the existing literature and proposing a different way to develop a smart user interface to make user more familiar with the design and to keep user 'in the flow'. Contextually proximate approach (CPA) will help users to minimize their feeling of insecurity as designing process includes local resources of users to develop the user interfaces. These various resources and parameters are explained further in the paper by giving different examples.
