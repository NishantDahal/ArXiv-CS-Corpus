Editorial for the Proceedings of the Workshop Knowledge Maps and Information Retrieval (KMIR2014) at Digital Libraries 2014

Knowledge maps are promising tools for visualizing the structure of large-scale information spaces, but still far away from being applicable for searching. The first international workshop on "Knowledge Maps and Information Retrieval (KMIR)", held as part of the International Conference on Digital Libraries 2014 in London, aimed at bringing together experts in Information Retrieval (IR) and knowledge mapping in order to discuss the potential of interactive knowledge maps for information seeking purposes.
