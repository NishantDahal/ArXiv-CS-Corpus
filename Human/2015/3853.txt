Improved Eigenvalue-based Spectrum Sensing via Sensor Signal Overlapping

Eigenvalue-based detectors are considered as an important method of spectrum sensing since they do not require the information about the primary user (PU) signal. In this paper we propose a method to improve the performance of the eigenvalue-based detector. The proposed method introduces a new test statistic based on combinatorial matrix with components which are overlapping subgroups extracted from the array of received signals. As a result, its covariance matrix has a larger maximum eigenvalue and trace value than the one without overlapping. Simulation results show that our proposed method can further improve the detection performance of the optimal eigenvalue-based detector. The paper also shows the effect of different overlapping methods on the receiver operating characteristic curve.
