Confidential Algorithm for Golden Cryptography Using Haar Wavelet

One of the most important consideration techniques when one want to solve the protecting of digital signal is the golden matrix. The golden matrices can be used for creation of a new kind of cryptography called the golden cryptography. Many research papers have proved that the method is very fast and simple for technical realization and can be used for cryptographic protection of digital signals. In this paper, we introduce a technique of encryption based on combination of haar wavelet and golden matrix. These combinations carry out after compression data by adaptive Huffman code to reduce data size and remove redundant data. This process will provide multisecurity services. In addition Message Authentication Code (MAC) technique can be used to provide authentication and the integrity of this scheme. The proposed scheme is accomplished through five stages, the compression data, key generation, encryption stage, the decryption stage and decompression at communication ends.
