Functorial Data Migration: From Theory to Practice

In this paper we describe a functorial data migration scenario about the manufacturing service capability of a distributed supply chain. The scenario is a category-theoretic analog of an OWL ontology-based semantic enrichment scenario developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The scenario is presented using, and is included with, the open-source FQL tool, available for download at categoricaldata.net/fql.html.
