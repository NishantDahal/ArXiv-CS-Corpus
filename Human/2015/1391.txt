Compressive sensing based velocity estimation in video data

This paper considers the use of compressive sensing based algorithms for velocity estimation of moving vehicles. The procedure is based on sparse reconstruction algorithms combined with time-frequency analysis applied to video data. This algorithm provides an accurate estimation of object's velocity even in the case of a very reduced number of available video frames. The influence of crucial parameters is analysed for different types of moving vehicles.
