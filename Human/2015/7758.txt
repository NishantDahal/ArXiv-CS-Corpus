Stabilizer quantum codes from $J$-affine variety codes and a new Steane-like enlargement

New stabilizer codes with parameters better than the ones available in the literature are provided in this work, in particular quantum codes with parameters $[[127,63, \geq 12]]_2$ and $[[63,45, \geq 6]]_4$ that are records. These codes are constructed with a new generalization of the Steane's enlargement procedure and by considering orthogonal subfield-subcodes --with respect to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner product-- of a new family of linear codes, the $J$-affine variety codes.
