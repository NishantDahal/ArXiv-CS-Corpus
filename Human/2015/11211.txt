Average Error Probability Analysis in mmWave Cellular Networks

In this paper, a mathematical framework for the analysis of average symbol error probability (ASEP) in millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks with Poisson Point Process (PPP) distributed base stations (BSs) is developed using tools from stochastic geometry. The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated in the average error probability analysis. First, average pairwise error probability (APEP) expression is obtained by averaging pairwise error probability (PEP) over fading and random shortest distance from mobile user (MU) to its serving BS. Subsequently, average symbol error probability is approximated from APEP using the nearest neighbor (NN) approximation. ASEP is analyzed for different antenna gains and base station densities. Finally, the effect of beamforming alignment errors on ASEP is investigated to get insight on more realistic cases.
