Electronic Health Records and Cloud based Generic Medical Equipment Interface

Now-a-days Health Care industry is well equipped with Medical Equipments to provide accurate and timely reports of investigation and examination results. Medical Equipments available in market are made for specific tests suited for a particular laboratory leading to a wide variety of devices. The result viewing experience on console of these devices is not only cumborsome for medical staff but inefficient. Therefore, Medical Equipment Interfaces act as backbone of any Hospital Management Information System assisting in better management and delivery of test results. It also acts as a mode to collect data for further research and analysis. These equipments communicate via a fixed data format but compatibility among these formats is a major issue being faced in modern and legacy medical equipments. In this paper, we present a case study of designing and implementing a cloud based Generic Medical Equipment Interface(GMEI) along with the state of the art in such systems. This solution removes the burden of reentry of patient details into the Electronic Health Record(EHR) and thrives for accelerating EMR initiative in the country
