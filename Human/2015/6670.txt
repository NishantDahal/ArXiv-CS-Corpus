Spectral Motion Synchronization in SE(3)

This paper addresses the problem of motion synchronization (or averaging) and describes a simple, closed-form solution based on a spectral decomposition, which does not consider rotation and translation separately but works straight in SE(3), the manifold of rigid motions. Besides its theoretical interest, being the first closed form solution in SE(3), experimental results show that it compares favourably with the state of the art both in terms of precision and speed.
