OMNeT++ and mosaik: Enabling Simulation of Smart Grid Communications

This paper presents a preliminary system architecture of integrating OMNeT++ into the mosaik co-simulation framework. This will enable realistic simulation of communication network protocols and services for smart grid scenarios and on the other side, further development of communication protocols for smart grid applications. Thus, by integrating OMNeT++ and mosaik, both communities will be able to leverage each others's sophisticated simulation models and expertise. The main challenges identified are the external management of the OMNeT++ simulation kernel and performance issues when federating various simulators, including OMNeT++ into the mosaik framework. The purpose of this paper is to bring these challenges up and to gather relevant experience and expertise from the OMNeT++ community. We especially encourage collaboration among all OMNeT++ developers and users.
