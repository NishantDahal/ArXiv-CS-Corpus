Predicting Neighbor Distribution in Heterogeneous Information Networks

Recently, considerable attention has been devoted to the prediction problems arising from heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we present a new prediction task, Neighbor Distribution Prediction (NDP), which aims at predicting the distribution of the labels on neighbors of a given node and is valuable for many different applications in heterogeneous information networks. The challenges of NDP mainly come from three aspects: the infinity of the state space of a neighbor distribution, the sparsity of available data, and how to fairly evaluate the predictions. To address these challenges, we first propose an Evolution Factor Model (EFM) for NDP, which utilizes two new structures proposed in this paper, i.e. Neighbor Distribution Vector (NDV) to represent the state of a given node's neighbors, and Neighbor Label Evolution Matrix (NLEM) to capture the dynamics of a neighbor distribution, respectively. We further propose a learning algorithm for Evolution Factor Model. To overcome the problem of data sparsity, the learning algorithm first clusters all the nodes and learns an NLEM for each cluster instead of for each node. For fairly evaluating the predicting results, we propose a new metric: Virtual Accuracy (VA), which takes into consideration both the absolute accuracy and the predictability of a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three real datasets from different domains validate the effectiveness of our proposed model EFM and metric VA.
