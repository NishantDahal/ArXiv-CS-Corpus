Simultaneous Embedding of Planar Graphs

Simultaneous embedding is concerned with simultaneously representing a series of graphs sharing some or all vertices. This forms the basis for the visualization of dynamic graphs and thus is an important field of research. Recently there has been a great deal of work investigating simultaneous embedding problems both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. We survey recent work on this topic.
