Parallel software implementation of recursive multidimensional digital filters for point-target detection in cluttered infrared scenes

A technique for the enhancement of point targets in clutter is described. The local 3-D spectrum at each pixel is estimated recursively. An optical flow-field for the textured background is then generated using the 3-D autocorrelation function and the local velocity estimates are used to apply high-pass velocity-selective spatiotemporal filters, with finite impulse responses (FIRs), to subtract the background clutter signal, leaving the foreground target signal, plus noise. Parallel software implementations using a multicore central processing unit (CPU) and a graphical processing unit (GPU) are investigated.
