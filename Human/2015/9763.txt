Orchestrated Session Compliance

We investigate the notion of orchestrated compliance for client/server interactions in the context of session contracts.  Devising the notion of orchestrator in such a context makes it possible to have  orchestrators with unbounded buffering capabilities and at the same time to guarantee any message from the client to be eventually delivered by the orchestrator to the server, while preventing the server from sending messages which are kept indefinitely inside the orchestrator. The compliance relation is shown to be decidable by means of 1) a procedure synthesising the orchestrators, if any, making a client compliant with a server, and 2) a procedure for deciding whether an orchestrator behaves in a proper way as mentioned before.
