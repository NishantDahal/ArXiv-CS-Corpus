On the Smooth Renyi Entropy and Variable-Length Source Coding Allowing Errors

In this paper, we consider the problem of variable-length source coding allowing errors. The exponential moment of the codeword length is analyzed in the non-asymptotic regime and in the asymptotic regime. Our results show that the smooth Renyi entropy characterizes the optimal exponential moment of the codeword length.
