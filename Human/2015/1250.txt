Factorization of Motion Polynomials

In this paper, we consider the existence of a factorization of a monic, bounded motion polynomial. We prove existence of factorizations, possibly after multiplication with a real polynomial and provide algorithms for computing polynomial factor and factorizations. The first algorithm is conceptually simpler but may require a high degree of the polynomial factor. The second algorithm gives an optimal degree.
