3D Reconstruction of Crime Scenes and Design Considerations for an Interactive Investigation Tool

Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) is a carefully planned systematic process with the purpose of acquiring physical evidences to shed light upon the physical reality of the crime and eventually detect the identity of the criminal. Capturing images and videos of the crime scene is an important part of this process in order to conduct a deeper analysis on the digital evidence for possible hints. This work brings this idea further to use the acquired footage for generating a 3D model of the crime scene. Results show that realistic reconstructions can be obtained using sophisticated computer vision techniques. The paper also discusses a number of important design considerations describing key features that should be present in a powerful interactive CSI analysis tool.
