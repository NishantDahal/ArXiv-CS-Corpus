Multicoding Schemes for Interference Channels

The best known inner bound for the 2-user discrete memoryless interference channel is the Han-Kobayashi rate region. The coding schemes that achieve this region are based on rate-splitting and superposition coding. In this paper, we develop a multicoding scheme to achieve the same rate region. A key advantage of the multicoding nature of the proposed coding scheme is that it can be naturally extended to more general settings, such as when encoders have state information or can overhear each other. In particular, we extend our coding scheme to characterize the capacity region of the state-dependent deterministic Z-interference channel when noncausal state information is available at the interfering transmitter. We specialize our results to the case of the linear deterministic model with on/off interference which models a wireless system where a cognitive transmitter is noncausally aware of the times it interferes with a primary transmission. For this special case, we provide an explicit expression for the capacity region and discuss some interesting properties of the optimal strategy. We also extend our multicoding scheme to find the capacity region of the deterministic Z-interference channel when the signal of the interfering transmitter can be overheard at the other transmitter (a.k.a. unidirectional partial cribbing).
