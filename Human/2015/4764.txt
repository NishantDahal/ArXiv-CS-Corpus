Controlled Remote State Preparation via General Pure Three-Qubit State

The protocols for controlled remote state preparation of a single qubit and a general two-qubit state are presented in this paper. The general pure three-qubit states are chosen as shared quantum channel, which are not LOCC equivalent to the mostly used GHZ-state. It is the first time to introduce general pure three-qubit states to complete remote state preparation. The probability of successful preparation is presented. Moreover, in some special cases, the successful probability could reach unit.
