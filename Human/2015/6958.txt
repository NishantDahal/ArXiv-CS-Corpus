A Nivat Theorem for Weighted Timed Automata and Weighted Relative Distance Logic

Weighted timed automata (WTA) model quantitative aspects of real-time systems like continuous consumption of memory, power or financial resources. They accept quantitative timed languages where every timed word is mapped to a value, e.g., a real number. In this paper, we prove a Nivat theorem for WTA which states that recognizable quantitative timed languages are exactly those which can be obtained from recognizable boolean timed languages with the help of several simple operations. We also introduce a weighted extension of relative distance logic developed by Wilke, and we show that our weighted relative distance logic and WTA are equally expressive. The proof of this result can be derived from our Nivat theorem and Wilke's theorem for relative distance logic. Since the proof of our Nivat theorem is constructive, the translation process from logic to automata and vice versa is also constructive. This leads to decidability results for weighted relative distance logic.
