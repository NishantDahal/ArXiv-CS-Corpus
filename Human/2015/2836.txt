Circuit diameter and Klee-Walkup constructions

Consider a variant of the graph diameter of a polyhedron where each step in a walk between two vertices travels maximally in a circuit direction instead of along incident edges. Here circuit directions are non-trivial solutions to minimally-dependent subsystems of the presentation of the polyhedron. These can be understood as the set of all possible edge directions, including edges that may arise from translation of the facets.
  It is appealing to consider a circuit analogue of the Hirsch conjecture for graph diameter, as suggested by Borgwardt et al. [BFH15]. They ask whether the known counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture give rise to counterexamples for this relaxed notion of circuit diameter. We show that the most basic counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch conjecture, the Klee-Walkup polyhedron, does have a circuit diameter that satisfies the Hirsch bound, regardless of representation. We also examine the circuit diameter of the bounded Klee-Walkup polytope.
