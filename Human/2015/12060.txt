Sofic-Dyck shifts

We define the class of sofic-Dyck shifts which extends the class of Markov-Dyck shifts introduced by Inoue, Krieger and Matsumoto. Sofic-Dyck shifts are shifts of sequences whose finite factors form unambiguous context-free languages. We show that they correspond exactly to the class of shifts of sequences whose sets of factors are visibly pushdown languages. We give an expression of the zeta function of a sofic-Dyck shift.
