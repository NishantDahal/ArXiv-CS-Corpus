Fewer runs than word length

The work takes another look at the number of runs that a string might contain and provides an alternative proof for the bound. We also propose another stronger conjecture that states that, for a fixed order on the alphabet, within every factor of a word there are at most as many occurrences of Lyndon roots corresponding to runs in a word as the length of the factor (only first such occurrences for each run are considered).
