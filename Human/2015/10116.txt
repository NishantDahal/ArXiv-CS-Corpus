Spectral Clustering and Block Models: A Review And A New Algorithm

We focus on spectral clustering of unlabeled graphs and review some results on clustering methods which achieve weak or strong consistent identification in data generated by such models. We also present a new algorithm which appears to perform optimally both theoretically using asymptotic theory and empirically.
