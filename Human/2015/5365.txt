Characterization of SINR Region for Multiple Interfering Multicast in Power-Controlled Systems

This paper considers a wireless communication network consisting of multiple interfering multicast sessions. Different from a unicast system where each transmitter has only one receiver, in a multicast system, each transmitter has multiple receivers. It is a well known result for wireless unicast systems that the feasibility of an signal-to-interference-plus-noise power ratio (SINR) without power constraint is decided by the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of a nonnegative matrix. We generalize this result and propose necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility of an SINR in a wireless multicast system with and without power constraint. The feasible SINR region as well as its geometric properties are studied. Besides, an iterative algorithm is proposed which can efficiently check the feasibility condition and compute the boundary points of the feasible SINR region.
