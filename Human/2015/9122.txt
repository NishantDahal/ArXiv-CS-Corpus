Ad hoc Cloud Computing: From Concept to Realization

This paper presents the first complete, integrated and end-to-end solution for ad hoc cloud computing environments. Ad hoc clouds harvest resources from existing sporadically available, non-exclusive (i.e. primarily used for some other purpose) and unreliable infrastructures. In this paper we discuss the problems ad hoc cloud computing solves and outline our architecture which is based on BOINC.
