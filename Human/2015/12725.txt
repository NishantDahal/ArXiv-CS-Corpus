Service Provider DevOps network capabilities and tools

This report provides an understanding of how the UNIFY Service Provider (SP)-DevOps concept can be applied and integrated with a combined cloud and transport network NFV architecture. Specifically, the report contains technical descriptions of a set of novel SP-DevOps tools and support functions that facilitate observability, troubleshooting, verification, and VNF development processes. The tools and support functions are described in detail together with their architectural mapping, giving a wider understanding of the SP-DevOps concept as a whole, and how SP-DevOps tools can be used for supporting orchestration and programmability in the UNIFY NFV framework. The concept is further exemplified in a case study for deployment and scaling of an Elastic Firewall.
