A heuristic approach for designing cyclic group codes

In this paper we propose a heuristic technique for distributing points on the surface of a unit n-dimensional Euclidean sphere, generated as the orbit of a finite cyclic subgroup of orthogonal matrices, the so called cyclic group codes. Massive numerical experiments were done and many new cyclic group codes have been obtained in several dimensions at various rate. The obtained results assure that the heuristic approach have performance comparable to a brute-force search technique with the advantage of having low complexity, allowing for designing codes with a large number of points in higher dimensions.
