A Study and Implementation of RSA Cryptosystem

This project involves an implementation of the Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) encryption algorithm in C. It consists of generation of two random prime numbers and a number co- prime to phi(n) also called euler toitent function. These three are used to generate a public key and private key. The user has to enter a message which is encrypted by the public key. The algorithm also decrypts the generated cipher text with the help of the private key and returns the plain text message which was encrypted earlier.
