Diversity and Intelligence in Multi-robot Teams

This research proposes new tools for investigation of behavioral diversity in multi-robot systems and a significant body of results using these tools in simulated and real mobile robot experiments. The experiments specifically describe a framework of defining behavior-based strategies for multi-robot tasks as robot foraging, robot soccer and robot formation. The research focuses specifically on motor schema-based multi-robot systems, which are an important example of behavior-based control.
