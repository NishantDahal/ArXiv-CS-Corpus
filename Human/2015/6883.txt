LAC: Introducing Latency-Aware Caching in Information-Centric Networks - Technical Report

Latency-minimization is recognized as one of the pillars of 5G network architecture design. Information-Centric Networking (ICN) appears a promising candidate technology for building an agile communication model that reduces latency through in-network caching. However, no proposal has developed so far latency-aware cache management mechanisms for ICN. In the paper, we investigate the role of latency awareness on data delivery performance in ICN and introduce LAC, a new simple, yet very effective, Latency-Aware Cache management policy. The designed mechanism leverages in a distributed fashion local latency observations to decide whether to store an object in a network cache. The farther the object, latency-wise, the more favorable the caching decision. By means of simulations, show that LAC outperforms state of the art proposals and results in a reduction of the content mean delivery time and standard deviation by up to 50%, along with a very fast convergence to these figures.
