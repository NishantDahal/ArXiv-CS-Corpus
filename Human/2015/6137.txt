Recent Developments in the Optimization of Space Robotics for Perception in Planetary Exploration

The following paper reviews recent developments in the field of optimization of space robotics. The extent of focus of this paper is on the perception (robotic sense of analyzing surroundings) in space robots in the exploration of extra-terrestrial planets. Robots play a crucial role in exploring extra-terrestrial and planetary bodies. Their advantages are far from being counted on finger tips. With the advent of autonomous robots in the field of robotics, the role for space exploration has further hustled up. Optimization of such autonomous robots has turned into a necessity of the hour. Optimized robots tend to have a superior role in space exploration. With so many considerations to monitor, an optimized solution will nevertheless help a planetary rover perform better under tight circumstances. Keeping in view the above mentioned area, the paper describes recent developments in the optimization of autonomous extra-terrestrial rovers.
