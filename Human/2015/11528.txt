Multi-Objective Optimization for Robust Power Efficient and Secure Full-Duplex Wireless Communication Systems

In this paper, we investigate the power efficient resource allocation algorithm design for secure multiuser wireless communication systems employing a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) for serving multiple half-duplex (HD) downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users simultaneously. We propose a multi-objective optimization framework to study two conflicting yet desirable design objectives, i.e., total DL transmit power minimization and total UL transmit power minimization. To this end, the weighed Tchebycheff method is adopted to formulate the resource allocation algorithm design as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). The considered MOOP takes into account the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of all legitimate users for guaranteeing secure DL and UL transmission in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. Thereby, secure UL transmission is enabled by the FD BS and would not be possible with an HD BS. The imperfectness of the channel state information of the eavesdropping channels and the inter-user interference channels is incorporated for robust resource allocation algorithm design. Although the considered MOOP is non-convex, we solve it optimally by semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Simulation results not only unveil the trade-off between the total DL transmit power and the total UL transmit power, but also confirm the robustness of the proposed algorithm against potential eavesdroppers.
