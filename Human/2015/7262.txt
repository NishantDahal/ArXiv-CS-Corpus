Design, Analysis and Evaluation of Control Algorithms for Applications in Smart Grids

In many countries, the currently observable transformation of the power supply system from a centrally controlled system towards a complex "system of systems", comprising lots of autonomously interacting components, leads to a significant amount of research regarding novel control concepts. To facilitate the structured development of such approaches regarding the criticality of the targeted system, the research and development of a distributed control concept is demonstrated by employing an integrated methodology comprising both the Smart Grids Architecture Model framework (SGAM) and the Smart Grid Algorithm Engineering process model (SGAE). Along the way, a taxonomy of evaluation criteria and evaluation methods for such approaches is presented. For the whole paper, the Dynamic Virtual Power Plants business case (DVPP) serves as motivating example.
