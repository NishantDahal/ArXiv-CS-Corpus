Comments on Bridging Service-Oriented Architecture and IEC 61499 for Flexibility and Interoperability

In the paper by W. Dai et al. (IEEE Trans. On Industrial Informatics, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 771-781, June 2015), a formal mapping between IEC 61499 and SOA is presented and a SOA-based execution environment architecture is described. In this letter, the proposed in the above paper mapping and the execution environment architecture are discussed and their potential for the exploitation is disputed.
