Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Verification and Program Transformation

This volume contains the papers selected among those which were presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Verification and Program Transformation (VPT 2015) held in London, UK, on April 11th, 2015. Previous editions of the Workshop were held at Saint-Petersburg (Russia) in 2013, and Vienna (Austria) in 2014. 
  Those papers show that methods and tools developed in the field of program transformation such as partial evaluation and fold/unfold transformations, and supercompilation, can be applied in the verification of software systems. They also show how some program verification methods, such as model checking techniques, abstract interpretation, SAT and SMT solving, and automated theorem proving, can be used to enhance program transformation techniques, thereby making these techniques more powerful and useful in practice.
