Downlink Power Control in Two-Tier Cellular Networks with Energy-Harvesting Small Cells as Stochastic Games

Energy harvesting in cellular networks is an emerging technique to enhance the sustainability of power-constrained wireless devices. This paper considers the co-channel deployment of a macrocell overlaid with small cells. The small cell base stations (SBSs) harvest energy from environmental sources whereas the macrocell base station (MBS) uses conventional power supply. Given a stochastic energy arrival process for the SBSs, we derive a power control policy for the downlink transmission of both MBS and SBSs such that they can achieve their objectives (e.g., maintain the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at an acceptable level) on a given transmission channel. We consider a centralized energy harvesting mechanism for SBSs, i.e., there is a central energy storage (CES) where energy is harvested and then distributed to the SBSs. When the number of SBSs is small, the game between the CES and the MBS is modeled as a single-controller stochastic game and the equilibrium policies are obtained as a solution of a quadratic programming problem. However, when the number of SBSs tends to infinity (i.e., a highly dense network), the centralized scheme becomes infeasible, and therefore, we use a mean field stochastic game to obtain a distributed power control policy for each SBS. By solving a system of partial differential equations, we derive the power control policy of SBSs given the knowledge of mean field distribution and the available harvested energy levels in the batteries of the SBSs.
