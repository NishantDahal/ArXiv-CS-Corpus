Model-based Hardware Design for FPGAs using Folding Transformations based on Subcircuits

We present a tool flow and results for a model-based hardware design for FPGAs from Simulink descriptions which nicely integrates into existing environments. While current commercial tools do not exploit some high-level optimizations, we investigate the promising approach of using reusable subcircuits for folding transformations to control embedded multiplier usage and to optimize logic block usage. We show that resource improvements of up to 70% compared to the original model are possible, but it is also shown that subcircuit selection is a critical task. While our tool flow provides good results already, the investigation and optimization of subcircuit selection is clearly identified as an additional keypoint to extend high-level control on low-level FPGA mapping properties.
