The projection method for continuous-time consensus seeking

For the case where the dependency digraph has no spanning in-tree, we characterize the region of convergence of the basic continuous-time distributed consensus algorithm and show that consensus can be achieved by employing the method of orthogonal projection, which has been proposed for the discrete-time coordination problem.
