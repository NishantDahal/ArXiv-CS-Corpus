High Sensitivity Biosensor using Injection Locked Spin Torque Nano-Oscillators

With ever increasing research on magnetic nano systems it is shown to have great potential in the areas of magnetic storage, biosensing, magnetoresistive insulation etc. In the field of biosensing specifically Spin Valve sensors coupled with Magnetic Nanolabels is showing great promise due to noise immunity and energy efficiency [1]. In this paper we present the application of injection locked based Spin Torque Nano Oscillator (STNO) suitable for high resolution energy efficient labeled DNA Detection. The proposed STNO microarray consists of 20 such devices oscillating at different frequencies making it possible to multiplex all the signals using capacitive coupling. Frequency Division Multiplexing can be aided with Time division multiplexing to increase the device integration and decrease the readout time while maintaining the same efficiency in presence of constant input referred noise.
