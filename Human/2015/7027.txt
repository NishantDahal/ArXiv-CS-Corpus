Conceptual evidence collection and analysis methodology for Android devices

Android devices continue to grow in popularity and capability meaning the need for a forensically sound evidence collection methodology for these devices also increases. This chapter proposes a methodology for evidence collection and analysis for Android devices that is, as far as practical, device agnostic. Android devices may contain a significant amount of evidential data that could be essential to a forensic practitioner in their investigations. However, the retrieval of this data requires that the practitioner understand and utilize techniques to analyze information collected from the device. The major contribution of this research is an in-depth evidence collection and analysis methodology for forensic practitioners.
