A Testbed of Magnetic Induction-based Communication System for Underground Applications

Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) can enable many important applications such as intelligent agriculture, pipeline fault diagnosis, mine disaster rescue, concealed border patrol, crude oil exploration, among others. The key challenge to realize WUSNs is the wireless communication in underground environments. Most existing wireless communication systems utilize the dipole antenna to transmit and receive propagating electromagnetic (EM) waves, which do not work well in underground environments due to the very high material absorption loss. The Magnetic Induction (MI) technique provides a promising alternative solution that could address the current problem in underground. Although the MI-based underground communication has been intensively investigated theoretically, to date, seldom effort has been made in developing a testbed for the MI-based underground communication that can validate the theoretical results. In this paper, a testbed of MI-based communication system is designed and implemented in an in-lab underground environment. The testbed realizes and tests not only the original MI mechanism that utilizes single coil but also recent developed techniques that use the MI waveguide and the 3-directional (3D) MI coils. The experiments are conducted in an in-lab underground environment with reconfigurable environmental parameters such as soil composition and water content. This paper provides the principles and guidelines for developing the MI underground communications testbed, which is very complicated and time-consuming due to the new communication mechanism and the new wireless transmission medium.
