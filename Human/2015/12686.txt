Congestion Control for P2P Live Streaming

In recent years, research efforts tried to exploit peer-to-peer (P2P) systems in order to provide Live Streaming (LS) and Video-on-Demand (VoD) services. Most of these research efforts focus on the development of distributed P2P block schedulers for content exchange among the participating peers and on the characteristics of the overlay graph (P2P overlay) that interconnects the set of these peers. Currently, researchers try to combine peer-to-peer systems with cloud infrastructures. They developed monitoring and control architectures that use resources from the cloud in order to enhance QoS and achieve an attractive trade-off between stability and low cost operation. However, there is a lack of research effort on the congestion control of these systems and the existing congestion control architectures are not suitable for P2P live streaming traffic (small sequential non persistent traffic towards multiple network locations). This paper proposes a P2P live streaming traffic aware congestion control protocol that: i) is capable to manage sequential traffic heading to multiple network destinations , ii) efficiently exploits the available bandwidth, iii) accurately measures the idle peer resources, iv) avoids network congestion, and v) is friendly to traditional TCP generated traffic. The proposed P2P congestion control has been implemented, tested and evaluated through a series of real experiments powered across the BonFIRE infrastructure.
