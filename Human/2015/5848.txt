Factors Influencing the Adoption of Cloud Incident Handling Strategy: A Preliminary Study in Malaysia

This study seeks to understand the factors influencing the adoption of an incident handling strategy by organisational cloud service users. We propose a conceptual model that draws upon the Situation Awareness (SA) model and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to guide this research. 40 organisational cloud service users in Malaysia were surveyed. We also conduct face-to-face interviews with participants from four of the organisations. Findings from the study indicate that four PMT factors (Perceived Vulnerability, Self-Efficacy, Response Efficacy, and Perceived Severity) have a significantly influence on the adoption of cloud incident handling strategy within the organisations. We, therefore, suggest a successful adoption cloud incident handling strategy by organisational cloud service users involves the nexus between these four PMT factors. We also outline future research required to validate the model.
