Data Hiding in Video using Triangularization LSB Technique

The importance of data hiding in the field of Information Technology is a widely accepted. The challenge is to be able to pass information in a manner that the very existence of the message is unknown in order to repel attention of the potential attacker. Steganography is a technique that has been widely used to achieve this objective. However Steganography is often found to be lacking when it comes to hiding bulk data. Attempting to hide data in a video overcomes this problem because of the large sized cover object (video) as compared to an image in the case of steganography. This paper attempts to propose a scheme using which data can be hidden in a video. We focus on the Triangularization method and make use of the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique in hiding messages in a video.
