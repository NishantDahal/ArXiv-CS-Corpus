Deterministic parallel communicating Watson-Crick automata systems

In this paper, we have introduced the deterministic variant of parallel communicating Watson-Crick automata systems. We show that similar to the non-deterministic version, the deterministic version can also recognise some non-regular uniletter languages. We further establish that strongly deterministic Watson-Crick automata systems and deterministic Watson-Crick automata system are incomparable in terms of their computational ability. We have also compared the computational ability of our system with multihead finite automata and parallel communicating finite automata systems.
