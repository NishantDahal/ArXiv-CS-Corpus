CBSE CASE Environment

With the need to produce ever larger and more complex software systems, the use of reusable components has become increasingly imperative. Of the many existing and proposed techniques for software development, it seems clear that components-based software engineering (CBSE) will be at the forefront of new approaches to the production of software systems, and holds the promise of substantially enhancing the software development and maintenance process. The required features of a CASE environment suitable for component reuse will be put forward in this paper.
