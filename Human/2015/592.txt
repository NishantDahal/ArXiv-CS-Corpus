A Systematic Scheme for Measuring the Performance of the Display-Camera Channel

Display-camera communication has become a promising direction in both computer vision and wireless communication communities. However, the consistency of the channel measurement is an open issue since precise calibration of the experimental setting has not been fully studied in the literatures. This paper focuses on establishing a scheme for precise calibration of the display-camera channel performance. To guarantee high consistency of the experiment, we propose an accurate measurement scheme for the geometric parameters, and identify some unstable channel factors, e.g., Moire effect, rolling shutter effect, blocking artifacts, inconsistency in auto-focus, trembling and vibration. In the experiment, we first define the consistency criteria according to the error-prone region in bit error rate (BER) plots of the channel measurements. It is demonstrated that the consistency of the experimental result can be improved by the proposed precise calibration scheme.
