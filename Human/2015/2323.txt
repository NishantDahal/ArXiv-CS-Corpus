A Note on Fixed Points in Justification Logics and the Surprise Test Paradox

In this note we study the effect of adding fixed points to justification logics. We introduce two extensions of justification logics: extensions by fixed point (or diagonal) operators, and extensions by least fixed points. The former is a justification version of Smorynski's Diagonalization Operator Logic, and the latter is a justification version of Kozen's modal $μ$-calculus. We also introduce fixed point extensions of Fitting's quantified logic of proofs, and formalize the Knower Paradox and the Surprise Test Paradox in these extensions. By interpreting a surprise statement as a statement for which there is no justification, we give a solution to the self-reference version of the Surprise Test Paradox in quantified logic of proofs. We also give formalizations of the Surprise Test Paradox in timed modal epistemic logics, and in Gödel-Löb provability logic.
