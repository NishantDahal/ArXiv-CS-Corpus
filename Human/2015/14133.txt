Virtual-MIMO-Boosted Information Propagation on Highways

In vehicular communications, traffic-related information should be spread over the network as quickly as possible to maintain a safer transportation system. This motivates us to develop more efficient information propagation schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual-MIMO-enabled information dissemination scheme, in which the vehicles opportunistically form virtual antenna arrays to boost the transmission range and therefore accelerate information propagation along the highway. We model the information propagation process as a renewal reward process and investigate in detail the \emph{Information Propagation Speed} (IPS) of the proposed scheme. The corresponding closed-form IPS is derived, which shows that the IPS increases cubically with the vehicle density but will ultimately converge to a constant upper bound. Moreover, increased mobility also facilitates the information spreading by offering more communication opportunities. However, the limited network density essentially determines the bottleneck in information spreading. Extensive simulations are carried out to verify our analysis. We also show that the proposed scheme exhibits a significant IPS gain over its conventional counterpart.
