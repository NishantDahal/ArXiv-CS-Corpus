LINOEP vectors, spiral of Theodorus, and nonlinear time-invariant system models of mode decomposition

In this paper, we propose a general method to obtain a set of Linearly Independent Non-Orthogonal yet Energy (square of the norm) Preserving (LINOEP) vectors using iterative filtering operation and we refer it as Filter Mode Decomposition (FDM). We show that the general energy preserving theorem (EPT), which is valid for both linearly independent (orthogonal and nonorthogonal) and linearly dependent set of vectors, proposed by Singh P. et al. is a generalization of the discrete spiral of Theodorus (or square root spiral or Einstein spiral or Pythagorean spiral). From the EPT, we obtain the (2D) discrete spiral of Theodorus and show that the multidimensional discrete spirals (e.g. a 3D spiral) can be easily generated using a set of multidimensional energy preserving unit vectors. We also establish that the recently proposed methods (e.g. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transforms (SSWT), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD), Fourier Decomposition Method (FDM), etc.), for nonlinear and nonstationary time series analysis, are nonlinear time-invariant (NTI) system models of filtering. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of LINOEP vectors.
