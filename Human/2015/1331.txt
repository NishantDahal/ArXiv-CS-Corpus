Minfer: Inferring Motif Statistics From Sampled Edges

Characterizing motif (i.e., locally connected subgraph patterns) statistics is important for understanding complex networks such as online social networks and communication networks. Previous work made the strong assumption that the graph topology of interest is known, and that the dataset either fits into main memory or stored on disks such that it is not expensive to obtain all neighbors of any given node. In practice, researchers have to deal with the situation where the graph topology is unknown, either because the graph is dynamic, or because it is expensive to collect and store all topological and meta information on disk. Hence, what is available to researchers is only a snapshot of the graph generated by sampling edges from the graph at random, which we called a "RESampled graph". Clearly, a RESampled graph's motif statistics may be quite different from the underlying original graph. To solve this challenge, we propose a framework and implement a system called Minfer, which can take the given RESampled graph and accurately infer the underlying graph's motif statistics. We also use Fisher information to bound the error of our estimates. Experiments using large scale datasets show that our method to be accurate.
