A Simple Yet Effective Improvement to the Bilateral Filter for Image Denoising

The bilateral filter has diverse applications in image processing, computer vision, and computational photography. In particular, this non-linear filter is quite effective in denoising images corrupted with additive Gaussian noise. The filter, however, is known to perform poorly at large noise levels. Several adaptations of the filter have been proposed in the literature to address this shortcoming, but often at an added computational cost. In this paper, we report a simple yet effective modification that improves the denoising performance of the bilateral filter at almost no additional cost. We provide visual and quantitative results on standard test images which show that this improvement is significant both visually and in terms of PSNR and SSIM (often as large as 5 dB). We also demonstrate how the proposed filtering can be implemented at reduced complexity by adapting a recent idea for fast bilateral filtering.
