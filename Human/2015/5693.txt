Scaffolding the Mitochondrial Disease Ontology from extant knowledge sources

Bio-medical ontologies can contain a large number of concepts. Often many of these concepts are very similar to each other, and similar or identical to concepts found in other bio-medical databases. This presents both a challenge and opportunity: maintaining many similar concepts is tedious and fastidious work, which could be substantially reduced if the data could be derived from pre-existing knowledge sources. In this paper, we describe how we have achieved this for an ontology of the mitochondria using our novel ontology development environment, the Tawny-OWL library.
