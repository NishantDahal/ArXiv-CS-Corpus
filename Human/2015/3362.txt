Recovering PCA from Hybrid-$(\ell_1,\ell_2)$ Sparse Sampling of Data Elements

This paper addresses how well we can recover a data matrix when only given a few of its elements. We present a randomized algorithm that element-wise sparsifies the data, retaining only a few its elements. Our new algorithm independently samples the data using sampling probabilities that depend on both the squares ($\ell_2$ sampling) and absolute values ($\ell_1$ sampling) of the entries. We prove that the hybrid algorithm recovers a near-PCA reconstruction of the data from a sublinear sample-size: hybrid-($\ell_1,\ell_2$) inherits the $\ell_2$-ability to sample the important elements as well as the regularization properties of $\ell_1$ sampling, and gives strictly better performance than either $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ on their own. We also give a one-pass version of our algorithm and show experiments to corroborate the theory.
