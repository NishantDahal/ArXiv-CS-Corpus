A Novel Semantics and Feature Preserving Perspective for Content Aware Image Retargeting

There is an increasing requirement for efficient image retargeting techniques to adapt the content to various forms of digital media. With rapid growth of mobile communications and dynamic web page layouts, one often needs to resize the media content to adapt to the desired display sizes. For various layouts of web pages and typically small sizes of handheld portable devices, the importance in the original image content gets obfuscated after resizing it with the approach of uniform scaling. Thus, there occurs a need for resizing the images in a content aware manner which can automatically discard irrelevant information from the image and present the salient features with more magnitude. There have been proposed some image retargeting techniques keeping in mind the content awareness of the input image. However, these techniques fail to prove globally effective for various kinds of images and desired sizes. The major problem is the inefficiency of these algorithms to process these images with minimal visual distortion while also retaining the meaning conveyed from the image. In this dissertation, we present a novel perspective for content aware image retargeting, which is well implementable in real time. We introduce a novel method of analysing semantic information within the input image while also maintaining the important and visually significant features. We present the various nuances of our algorithm mathematically and logically, and show that the results prove better than the state-of-the-art techniques.
