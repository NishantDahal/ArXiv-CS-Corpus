Workload-Driven Vertical Partitioning for Effective Query Processing over Raw Data

Traditional databases are not equipped with the adequate functionality to handle the volume and variety of "Big Data". Strict schema definition and data loading are prerequisites even for the most primitive query session. Raw data processing has been proposed as a schema-on-demand alternative that provides instant access to the data. When loading is an option, it is driven exclusively by the current-running query, resulting in sub-optimal performance across a query workload. In this paper, we investigate the problem of workload-driven raw data processing with partial loading. We model loading as fully-replicated binary vertical partitioning. We provide a linear mixed integer programming optimization formulation that we prove to be NP-hard. We design a two-stage heuristic that comes within close range of the optimal solution in a fraction of the time. We extend the optimization formulation and the heuristic to pipelined raw data processing, scenario in which data access and extraction are executed concurrently. We provide three case-studies over real data formats that confirm the accuracy of the model when implemented in a state-of-the-art pipelined operator for raw data processing.
