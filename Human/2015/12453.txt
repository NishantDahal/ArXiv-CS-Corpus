Source detection algorithms for dynamic contaminants based on the analysis of a hydrodynamic limit

In this work we propose and numerically analyze an algorithm for detection of a contaminant source using a dynamic sensor network. The algorithm is motivated using a global probabilistic optimization problem and is based on the analysis of the hydrodynamic limit of a discrete time evolution equation on the lattice under a suitable scaling of time and space. Numerical results illustrating the effectiveness of the algorithm are presented.
