Close Communities in Social Networks: Boroughs and 2-Clubs

The structure of close communication, contacts and association in social networks is studied in the form of maximal subgraphs of diameter 2 (2-clubs), corresponding to three types of close communities: hamlets, social circles and coteries. The concept of borough of a graph is defined and introduced. Each borough is a chained union of 2-clubs of the network and any 2-club of the network belongs to one borough. Thus the set of boroughs of a network, together with the 2-clubs held by them, are shown to contain the structure of close communication in a network. Applications are given with examples from real world network data.
