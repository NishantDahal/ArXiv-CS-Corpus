Deploying Multiple Antennas on High-speed Trains: Equidistant Strategy v.s. Fixed-Interval Strategy

Deploying multiple antennas on high speed trains is an effective way to enhance the information transmission performance for high speed railway (HSR) wireless communication systems. However, how to efficiently deploy multiple antennas on a train? This problem has not been studied yet. In this paper, we shall investigate efficient antenna deployment strategies for HSR communication systems where two multi-antenna deployment strategies, i.e., the equidistant strategy and the fixed-interval strategy, are considered. To evaluate the system performance, mobile service amount and outage time ratio are introduced. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that, when the length of the train is not very large, for two-antenna case, by increasing the distance of neighboring antennas in a reasonable region, the system performance can be enhanced. It is also shown that the two strategies have much difference performance behavior in terms of instantaneous channel capacity, and the fixed-interval strategy may achieve much better performance than the equidistant one in terms of service amount and outage time ratio when the antenna number is much large.
