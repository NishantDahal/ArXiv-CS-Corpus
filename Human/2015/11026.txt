Gray coding planar maps

The idea of (combinatorial) Gray codes is to list objects in question in such a way that two successive objects differ in some pre-specified small way. In this paper, we utilize beta-description trees to cyclicly Gray code three classes of cubic planar maps, namely, bicubic planar maps, 3-connected cubic planar maps, and cubic non-separable planar maps.
