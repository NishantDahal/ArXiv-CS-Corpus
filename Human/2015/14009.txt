A Survey on Reproducibility in Parallel Computing

We summarize the results of a survey on reproducibility in parallel computing, which was conducted during the Euro-Par conference in August 2015. The survey form was handed out to all participants of the conference and the workshops. The questionnaire, which specifically targeted the parallel computing community, contained questions in four different categories: general questions on reproducibility, the current state of reproducibility, the reproducibility of the participants' own papers, and questions about the participants' familiarity with tools, software, or open-source software licenses used for reproducible research.
