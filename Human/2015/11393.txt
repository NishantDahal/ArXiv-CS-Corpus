Simulations on Consumer Tests: Systematic Evaluation of Tolerance Ranges by Model-Based Generation of Simulation Scenarios

Context: Since 2014 several modern cars were rated regarding the performances of their active safety systems at the European New Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP). Nowadays, consumer tests play a significant role for the OEM's series development with worldwide perspective, because a top rating is needed to underline the worthiness of active safety features from the customers' point of view. Furthermore, EuroNCAP already published their roadmap 2020 in which they outline further extensions in today's testing and rating procedures that will aggravate the current requirements addressed to those systems. Especially Autonomous Emergency Braking/Forward Collision Warning systems (AEB/FCW) are going to face a broader field of application as pedestrian detection or two-way traffic scenarios. Objective: This work focuses on the systematic generation of test scenarios concentrating on specific parameters that can vary within certain tolerance ranges like the lateral position of the vehicle-under-test (VUT) and its test velocity for example. It is of high interest to examine the effect of the tolerance ranges on the braking points in different test cases representing different trajectories and velocities because they will influence significantly a later scoring during the assessments and thus the safety abilities of the regarding car. Method: We present a formal model using a graph to represent the allowed variances based on the relevant points in time. Now, varying velocities of the VUT will be added to the model while the vehicle is approaching a target vehicle. The derived trajectories were used as test cases for a simulation environment. Selecting interesting test cases and processing them with the simulation environment, the influence on the system's performance of different test parameters will be investigated.
