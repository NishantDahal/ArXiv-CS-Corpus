On the quantifier-free dynamic complexity of Reachability

The dynamic complexity of the reachability query is studied in the dynamic complexity framework of Patnaik and Immerman, restricted to quantifier-free update formulas.
  It is shown that, with this restriction, the reachability query cannot be dynamically maintained, neither with binary auxiliary relations nor with unary auxiliary functions, and that ternary auxiliary relations are more powerful with respect to graph queries than binary auxiliary relations.
  Further inexpressibility results are given for the reachability query in a different setting as well as for a syntactical restriction of quantifier-free update formulas. Moreover inexpressibility results for some other queries are presented.
