Structural Properties of an Open Problem in Preemptive Scheduling

Structural properties of optimal preemptive schedules have been studied in a number of recent papers with a primary focus on two structural parameters: the minimum number of preemptions necessary, and a tight lower bound on `shifts', i.e., the sizes of intervals bounded by the times created by preemptions, job starts, or completions. So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been derived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these structural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive scheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with release dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on two processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of scheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant generalization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant simplification leads to tractable problem.
  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for optimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order $Î©(\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be less than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of optimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for linear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers. The bounds immediately follow from a fundamental structural property called `normality', by which minimal shifts of a job are exponentially decreasing functions. In particular, the first interval between a preempted job's start and its preemption is a multiple of 1/2, the second such interval is a multiple of 1/4, and in general, the $i$-th preemption occurs at a multiple of $2^{-i}$. We expect the new structural properties to play a prominent role in finally settling a vexing, still-open question of complexity.
