A Class of Linear Codes With Three Weights

Linear codes have been an interesting subject of study for many years. Recently, linear codes with few weights have been constructed and extensively studied. In this paper, for an odd prime p, a class of three-weight linear codes over Fp are constructed. The weight distributions of the linear codes are settled. These codes have applications in authentication codes, association schemes and data storage systems.
