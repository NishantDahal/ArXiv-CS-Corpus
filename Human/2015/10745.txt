Robust video object tracking using particle filter with likelihood based feature fusion and adaptive template updating

A robust algorithm solution is proposed for tracking an object in complex video scenes. In this solution, the bootstrap particle filter (PF) is initialized by an object detector, which models the time-evolving background of the video signal by an adaptive Gaussian mixture. The motion of the object is expressed by a Markov model, which defines the state transition prior. The color and texture features are used to represent the object, and a marginal likelihood based feature fusion approach is proposed. A corresponding object template model updating procedure is developed to account for possible scale changes of the object in the tracking process. Experimental results show that our algorithm beats several existing alternatives in tackling challenging scenarios in video tracking tasks.
