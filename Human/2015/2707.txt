On the tradeoff of average delay, average service cost, and average utility for single server queues with monotone policies

In this thesis, we study the optimal tradeoff of average delay, average service cost, and average utility for single server queueing models, with and without admission control. The continuous time and discrete time queueing models that we consider are motivated by cross-layer models for noisy point-to-point links, with random packet arrivals. We study the above tradeoff problem for a class of admissible policies, which are monotone and stationary and obtain an asymptotic characterization of the minimum average delay as a function of the average service cost and average utility constraints.
