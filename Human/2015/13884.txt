Analysis of Performance of Linear Analog Codes

In this paper we carefully study the MSE performance of the linear analog codes. We have derived a lower bound of the MSE performance under Likelihood(ML) and Linear Minimal Mean Square Error(LMMSE) decoding criteria respectively. It is proved in this essay that a kind of linear analog codes called \emph {unitary codes} can simultaneously achieve both of these two bounds. At the same time, we compare the obtained linear analog codes' MSE bounds with the performance of some existing nonlinear codes. The results showed that linear analog codes are actually not very satisfying and convinced us that more concerns should be cast onto the nonlinear class in order to find powerful analog codes.
