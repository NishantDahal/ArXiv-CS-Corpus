Preprint: Comparing Kinect2 based Balance Measurement Software to Wii Balance Board

This is the preprint version of our paper on REHAB2015. A balance measurement software based on Kinect2 sensor is evaluated by comparing to Wii balance board in numerical analysis level, and further improved according to the consideration of BFP (Body fat percentage) values of the user. Several person with different body types are involved into the test. The algorithm is improved by comparing the body type of the user to the 'golden- standard' body type. The evaluation results of the optimized algorithm preliminarily prove the reliability of the software.
