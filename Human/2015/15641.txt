Proceedings ML Family/OCaml Users and Developers workshops

This volume collects the extended versions of selected papers originally presented at the two ACM SIGPLAN workshops: ML Family Workshop 2014 and OCaml 2014. Both were affiliated with ICFP 2014 and took place on two consecutive days, on September 4 and 5, 2014 in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
  The ML Family workshop aims to recognize the entire extended family of ML and ML-like languages: languages that are Higher-order, Typed, Inferred, and Strict. It provides the forum to discuss common issues, both practical (compilation techniques, implementations of concurrency and parallelism, programming for the Web) and theoretical (fancy types, module systems, metaprogramming). The scope of the workshop includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, application, implementation, and teaching of the members of the ML family.
  The OCaml workshop is more specifically targeted at the OCaml community, with an emphasis on new proposals and tools aiming to improve OCaml, its environment, and the functioning of the community. As such, it is interested in works on the type system, language extensions, compiler and optimizations, applications, tools, and experience reports of exciting uses.
