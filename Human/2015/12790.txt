A Scheme for Maximal Resource Utilization in Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming

Peer-to-Peer streaming technology has become one of the major Internet applications as it offers the opportunity of broadcasting high quality video content to a large number of peers with low costs. It is widely accepted that with the efficient utilization of peers and server's upload capacities, peers can enjoy watching a high bit rate video with minimal end-to-end delay. In this paper, we present a practical scheduling algorithm that works in the challenging condition where no spare capacity is available, i.e., it maximally utilizes the resources and broadcasts the maximum streaming rate. Each peer contacts with only a small number of neighbours in the overlay network and autonomously subscribes to sub-streams according to a budget-model in such a way that the number of peers forwarding exactly one sub-stream will be maximized. The hop-count delay is also taken into account to construct a short depth trees. Finally, we show through simulation that peers dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure with a short hop-count delay. Moreover, the proposed scheme gives nice features in the homogeneous case and overcomes SplitStream in all simulated scenarios.
