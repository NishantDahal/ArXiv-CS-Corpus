Towards Quality of Experience Determination for Video in Augmented Binocular Vision Scenarios

With the continuous growth in the consumer markets of mobile smartphones and increasingly in augmented reality wearable devices, several avenues of research investigate the relationships between the quality perceived by mobile users and the delivery mechanisms at play to support a high quality of experience for mobile users. In this paper, we present the first study that evaluates the relationships of mobile movie quality and the viewer-perceived quality thereof in an augmented reality setting with see-through devices. We find that participants tend to overestimate the video quality and exhibit a significant variation of accuracy that leans onto the movie content and its dynamics. Our findings, thus, can broadly impact future media adaptation and delivery mechanisms for this new display format of mobile multimedia.
