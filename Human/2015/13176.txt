A generalization of Kung's theorem

We give a generalization of Kung's theorem on critical exponents of linear codes over a finite field, in terms of sums of extended weight polynomials of linear codes. For all i=k+1,...,n, we give an upper bound on the smallest integer m such that there exist m codewords whose union of supports has cardinality at least i.
