Bridge the gap between network-based inference method and global ranking method in personal recommendation

In this paper, we study the relationship between the network-based inference method and global ranking method in personal recommendation. By some theoretical analysis, we prove that the recommendation result under the global ranking method is the limit of applying network-based inference method with infinity times.
