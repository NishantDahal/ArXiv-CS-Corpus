Well-quasi-ordering does not imply bounded clique-width

We present a hereditary class of graphs of unbounded clique-width which is well-quasi-ordered by the induced subgraph relation. This result provides a negative answer to the question asked by Daligault, Rao and Thomass√© in ("Well-quasi-order of relabel functions", Order, 27(3):301--315, 2010).
