Output-sensitive algorithms for sumset and sparse polynomial multiplication

We present randomized algorithms to compute the sumset (Minkowski sum) of two integer sets, and to multiply two univariate integer polynomials given by sparse representations. Our algorithm for sumset has cost softly linear in the combined size of the inputs and output. This is used as part of our sparse multiplication algorithm, whose cost is softly linear in the combined size of the inputs, output, and the sumset of the supports of the inputs. As a subroutine, we present a new method for computing the coefficients of a sparse polynomial, given a set containing its support. Our multiplication algorithm extends to multivariate Laurent polynomials over finite fields and rational numbers. Our techniques are based on sparse interpolation algorithms and results from analytic number theory.
