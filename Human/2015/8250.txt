A Neuro-Fuzzy Model for Function Point Calibration

The need to update the calibration of Function Point (FP) complexity weights is discussed, whose aims are to fit specific software application, to reflect software industry trend, and to improve cost estimation. Neuro-Fuzzy is a technique that incorporates the learning ability from neural network and the ability to capture human knowledge from fuzzy logic. The empirical validation using ISBSG data repository Release 8 shows a 22% improvement in software effort estimation after calibration using Neuro-Fuzzy technique.
