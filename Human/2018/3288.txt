Reasoning in a Hierarchical System with Missing Group Size Information

The paper analyzes the problem of judgments or preferences subsequent to initial analysis by autonomous agents in a hierarchical system where the higher level agents does not have access to group size information. We propose methods that reduce instances of preference reversal of the kind encountered in Simpson's paradox.
