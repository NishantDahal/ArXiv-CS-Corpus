Senior Project Management System: Requirements, Specification, and Design Issues

Senior project is a typical essential course in computing educational programs. The course involves the selection of a project problem, the submission of various documents, and intensive communication among the project team members and between them and the course instructors. To facilitate all these tasks, we introduce the senior project management system (SPMS) that organizes and manages previous, current, and proposed senior projects in all of their stages along with proper ways of communication between the students and course instructors. This paper explains the system requirements and specifications and discusses related design issues. The paper shows the importance of well documenting the specifications and requirements of software systems and paying considerable attention to system design, which has a positive impact on implementing high quality systems.
