Unified Scheduling for Predictable Communication Reliability in Cellular Networks with D2D Links

Cellular networks with D2D links are increasingly being explored for mission-critical applications (e.g., real-time control and AR/VR) which require predictable communication reliability. Thus it is critical to control interference among concurrent transmissions in a predictable manner to ensure the required communication reliability. To this end, we propose a Unified Cellular Scheduling (UCS) framework that, based on the Physical-Ratio-K (PRK) interference model, schedules uplink, downlink, and D2D transmissions in a unified manner to ensure predictable communication reliability while maximizing channel spatial reuse. UCS also provides a simple, effective approach to mode selection that maximizes the communication capacity for each involved communication pair. UCS effectively uses multiple channels for high throughput as well as resilience to channel fading and external interference. Leveraging the availability of base stations (BSes) as well as high-speed, out-of-band connectivity between BSes, UCS effectively orchestrates the functionalities of BSes and user equipment (UE) for light-weight control signaling and ease of incremental deployment and integration with existing cellular standards. We have implemented UCS using the open-source, standards-compliant cellular networking platform OpenAirInterface. We have validated the OpenAirInterface implementation using USRP B210 software-defined radios and lab deployment. We have also evaluated UCS through high-fidelity, at-scale simulation studies; we observe that UCS ensures predictable communication reliability while achieving a higher channel spatial reuse rate than existing mechanisms, and that the distributed UCS framework enables a channel spatial reuse rate statistically equal to that in the state-of-the-art centralized scheduling algorithm iOrder.
