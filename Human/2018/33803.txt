AME Blockchain: An Architecture Design for Closed-Loop Fluid Economy Token System

In this white paper, we propose a blockchain-based system, named AME, which is a decentralized infrastructure and application platform with enhanced security and self-management properties. The AME blockchain technology aims to increase the transaction throughput by adopting various optimizations in network transport and storage layers, and to enhance smart contracts with AI algorithm support. We introduce all major technologies adopted in our system, including blockchain, distributed storage, P2P network, service application framework, and data encryption. To properly provide a cohesive, concise, yet comprehensive introduction to the AME system, we mainly focus on describing the unique definitions and features that guide the system implementation.
