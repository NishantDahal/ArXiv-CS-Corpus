Exploring Wireless Sensor Network Technology In Sustainable Okra Garden: A Comparative Analysis Of Okra Grown In Different Fertilizer Treatments

The goal of this project was to explore commercial agricultural and irrigation sensor kits and to discern if the commercial wireless sensor network is viable tool for providing accurate real-time farm data at the nexus of food, energy and water. The smart garden consists of two different varieties of Abelmoschus esculentus planted in raised beds, each grown under two different fertilizer treatments. Soil watermark sensors were programmed to evaluate soil moisture and dictate irrigation events up to four times a day, while soil temperature and photosynthetic solar radiation sensors also recorded data every six hours. Solar panels harvested energy to power water pump and sensors. The objectives of the experiments were to evaluate and compare plant and soil parameters of the two okra varietes grown under two different fertilizer treatments. The plant parameters evaluated and compared were basal diameter, plant height, fruit production, and fruit size. Soil parameters measured were soil moisture, soil temperature, and soil nitrate concentration. The commercial sensors were evaluated on efficiency, accuracy, ease of use and overall practicality. Clemson spineless produced larger okra plants with the highest plant parameter values, followed by Emerald okra.
