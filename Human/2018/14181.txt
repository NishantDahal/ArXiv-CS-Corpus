Independence of Sources in Social Networks

Online social networks are more and more studied. The links between users of a social network are important and have to be well qualified in order to detect communities and find influencers for example. In this paper, we present an approach based on the theory of belief functions to estimate the degrees of cognitive independence between users in a social network. We experiment the proposed method on a large amount of data gathered from the Twitter social network.
