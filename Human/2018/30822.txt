Energy Efficient Precoder in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Imperfect Channel State Information

This article is on the energy efficient precoder design in multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems which is also robust with respect to the imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters. In other words, we design the precoder matrix associated with each transmitter to maximize the general energy efficiency of the network. We investigate the problem in two conventional cases. The first case considers the statistical characterization for the channel estimation error that leads to a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a semi-closed-form solution. Then, we turn our attention to the case which considers only the uncertainty region for the channel estimation error; this case eventually results in a semi-definite program (SDP).
