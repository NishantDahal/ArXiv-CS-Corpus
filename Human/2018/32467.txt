VFPred: A Fusion of Signal Processing and Machine Learning techniques in Detecting Ventricular Fibrillation from ECG Signals

Ventricular Fibrillation (VF), one of the most dangerous arrhythmias, is responsible for sudden cardiac arrests. Thus, various algorithms have been developed to predict VF from Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a binary classification problem. In the literature, we find a number of algorithms based on signal processing, where, after some robust mathematical operations the decision is given based on a predefined threshold over a single value. On the other hand, some machine learning based algorithms are also reported in the literature; however, these algorithms merely combine some parameters and make a prediction using those as features. Both the approaches have their perks and pitfalls; thus our motivation was to coalesce them to get the best out of the both worlds. Hence we have developed, VFPred that, in addition to employing a signal processing pipeline, namely, Empirical Mode Decomposition and Discrete Time Fourier Transform for useful feature extraction, uses a Support Vector Machine for efficient classification. VFPred turns out to be a robust algorithm as it is able to successfully segregate the two classes with equal confidence (Sensitivity = 99.99%, Specificity = 98.40%) even from a short signal of 5 seconds long, whereas existing works though requires longer signals, flourishes in one but fails in the other.
