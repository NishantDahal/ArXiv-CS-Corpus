Two Techniques That Enhance the Performance of Multi-robot Prioritized Path Planning

We introduce and empirically evaluate two techniques aimed at enhancing the performance of multi-robot prioritized path planning. The first technique is the deterministic procedure for re-scheduling (as opposed to well-known approach based on random restarts), the second one is the heuristic procedure that modifies the search-space of the individual planner involved in the prioritized path finding.
