On the Low-Complexity, Hardware-Friendly Tridiagonal Matrix Inversion for Correlated Massive MIMO Systems

In massive MIMO (M-MIMO) systems, one of the key challenges in the implementation is the large-scale matrix inversion operation, as widely used in channel estimation, equalization, detection, and decoding procedures. Traditionally, to handle this complexity issue, several low-complexity matrix inversion approximation methods have been proposed, including the classic Cholesky decomposition and the Neumann series expansion (NSE). However, the conventional approaches failed to exploit neither the special structure of channel matrices nor the critical issues in the hardware implementation, which results in poorer throughput performance and longer processing delay. In this paper, by targeting at the correlated M-MIMO systems, we propose a modified NSE based on tridiagonal matrix inversion approximation (TMA) to accommodate the complexity as well as the performance issue in the conventional hardware implementation, and analyze the corresponding approximation errors. Meanwhile, we investigate the VLSI implementation for the proposed detection algorithm based on a Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T FPGA platform. It is shown that for correlated massive MIMO systems, it can achieve near-MMSE performance and $630$ Mb/s throughput. Compared with other benchmark systems, the proposed pipelined TMA detector can get high throughput-to-hardware ratio. Finally, we also propose a fast iteration structure for further research.
