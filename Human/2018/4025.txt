Open source platform Digital Personal Assistant

Nowadays Digital Personal Assistants (DPA) become more and more popular. DPAs help to increase quality of life especially for elderly or disabled people. In this paper we develop an open source DPA and smart home system as a 3-rd party extension to show the functionality of the assistant. The system is designed to use the DPA as a learning platform for engineers to provide them with the opportunity to create and test their own hypothesis. The DPA is able to recognize users' commands in natural language and transform it to the set of machine commands that can be used to control different 3rd-party application. We use smart home system as an example of such 3rd-party. We demonstrate that the system is able to control home appliances, like lights, or to display information about the current state of the home, like temperature, through a dialogue between a user and the Digital Personal Assistant.
