Relay Assisted Device-to-Device Communication: Approaches and Issues

Enabling technologies for 5G and future wireless communication have attracted the interest of industry and research communities. One of such technologies is Device-to-Device (D2D) communication which exploits user proximity to offer spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and increased throughput. Data offloading, public safety communication, context aware communication and content sharing are some of the use cases for D2D communication. D2D communication can be direct or through a relay depending on the nature of the channel in between the D2D devices. Apart from the problem of interference, a key challenge of relay aided D2D communication is appropriately assigning relays to a D2D pair while maintaining the QoS requirement of the cellular users. In this article, relay assisted D2D communication is reviewed and research issues are highlighted. We also propose matching theory with incomplete information for relay allocation considering uncertainties which the mobility of the relay introduces to the set up.
