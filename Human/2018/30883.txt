Orthogonal Policy Gradient and Autonomous Driving Application

One less addressed issue of deep reinforcement learning is the lack of generalization capability based on new state and new target, for complex tasks, it is necessary to give the correct strategy and evaluate all possible actions for current state. Fortunately, deep reinforcement learning has enabled enormous progress in both subproblems: giving the correct strategy and evaluating all actions based on the state.
  In this paper we present an approach called orthogonal policy gradient descent(OPGD) that can make agent learn the policy gradient based on the current state and the actions set, by which the agent can learn a policy network with generalization capability. we evaluate the proposed method on the 3D autonomous driving enviroment TORCS compared with the baseline model, detailed analyses of experimental results and proofs are also given.
