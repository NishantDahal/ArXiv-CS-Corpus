CEVO: Comprehensive EVent Ontology Enhancing Cognitive Annotation

While the general analysis of named entities has received substantial research attention on unstructured as well as structured data, the analysis of relations among named entities has received limited focus. In fact, a review of the literature revealed a deficiency in research on the abstract conceptualization required to organize relations. We believe that such an abstract conceptualization can benefit various communities and applications such as natural language processing, information extraction, machine learning, and ontology engineering. In this paper, we present Comprehensive EVent Ontology (CEVO), built on Levin's conceptual hierarchy of English verbs that categorizes verbs with shared meaning, and syntactic behavior. We present the fundamental concepts and requirements for this ontology. Furthermore, we present three use cases employing the CEVO ontology on annotation tasks: (i) annotating relations in plain text, (ii) annotating ontological properties, and (iii) linking textual relations to ontological properties. These use-cases demonstrate the benefits of using CEVO for annotation: (i) annotating English verbs from an abstract conceptualization, (ii) playing the role of an upper ontology for organizing ontological properties, and (iii) facilitating the annotation of text relations using any underlying vocabulary.
