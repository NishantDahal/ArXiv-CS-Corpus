Algorithms, Bounds, and Strategies for Entangled XOR Games

We study the complexity of computing the commuting-operator value $ω^*$ of entangled XOR games with any number of players. We introduce necessary and sufficient criteria for an XOR game to have $ω^* = 1$, and use these criteria to derive the following results:
  1. An algorithm for symmetric games that decides in polynomial time whether $ω^* = 1$ or $ω^* < 1$, a task that was not previously known to be decidable, together with a simple tensor-product strategy that achieves value 1 in the former case. The only previous candidate algorithm for this problem was the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (also known as noncommutative Sum of Squares or ncSoS) hierarchy, but no convergence bounds were known.
  2. A family of games with three players and with $ω^* < 1$, where it takes doubly exponential time for the ncSoS algorithm to witness this (in contrast with our algorithm which runs in polynomial time).
  3. A family of games achieving a bias difference $2(ω^* - ω)$ arbitrarily close to the maximum possible value of $1$ (and as a consequence, achieving an unbounded bias ratio), answering an open question of Briët and Vidick.
  4. Existence of an unsatisfiable phase for random (non-symmetric) XOR games: that is, we show that there exists a constant $C_k^{\text{unsat}}$ depending only on the number $k$ of players, such that a random $k$-XOR game over an alphabet of size $n$ has $ω^* < 1$ with high probability when the number of clauses is above $C_k^{\text{unsat}} n$.
  5. A lower bound of $Ω(n \log(n)/\log\log(n))$ on the number of levels in the ncSoS hierarchy required to detect unsatisfiability for most random 3-XOR games. This is in contrast with the classical case where the $n$-th level of the sum-of-squares hierarchy is equivalent to brute-force enumeration of all possible solutions.
