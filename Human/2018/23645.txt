Oscillation Damping Control of Pendulum-like Manipulation Platform using Moving Masses

This paper presents an approach to damp out the oscillatory motion of the pendulum-like hanging platform on which a robotic manipulator is mounted. To this end, moving masses were installed on top of the platform. In this paper, asymptotic stability of the platform (which implies oscillation damping) is achieved by designing reference acceleration of the moving masses properly. A main feature of this work is that we can achieve asymptotic stability of not only the platform, but also the moving masses, which may be challenging due to the under-actuation nature. The proposed scheme is validated by the simulation studies.
