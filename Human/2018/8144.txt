A Coinductive Approach to Proving Reachability Properties in Logically Constrained Term Rewriting Systems

We introduce a sound and complete coinductive proof system for reachability properties in transition systems generated by logically constrained term rewriting rules over an order-sorted signature modulo builtins. A key feature of the calculus is a circularity proof rule, which allows to obtain finite representations of the infinite coinductive proofs.
