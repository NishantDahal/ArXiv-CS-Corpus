Software engineering and the SP Theory of Intelligence

This paper describes a novel approach to software engineering derived from the "SP Theory of Intelligence" and its realisation in the "SP Computer Model". Despite superficial appearances, it is shown that many of the key ideas in software engineering have counterparts in the structure and workings of the SP system. Potential benefits of this new approach to software engineering include: the automation or semi-automation of software development, with support for programming of the SP system where necessary; allowing programmers to concentrate on 'world-oriented' parallelism, without worries about parallelism to speed up processing; support for the long-term goal of programming the SP system via written or spoken natural language; reducing or eliminating the distinction between 'design' and 'implementation'; reducing or eliminating operations like compiling or interpretation; reducing or eliminating the need for verification of software; reducing the need for validation of software; no formal distinction between program and database; the potential for substantial reductions in the number of types of data file and the number of computer languages; benefits for version control; and reducing technical debt.
