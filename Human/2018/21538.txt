Constructing Non-isomorphic Signless Laplacian Cospectral Graphs

In this article, we generate large families of non-isomorphic and signless Lalacian cospectral graphs using partial transpose on graphs. Our constructions are significantly powerful. More than $70\%$ of non-isomorphic signless-Laplacian cospectral graphs can be generated with partial transpose when number of vertices is $\le 8$. We have also produced numerous examples of non-isomorphic signless Laplacian cospectral graphs.
