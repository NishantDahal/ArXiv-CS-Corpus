Metadata Enrichment of Multi-Disciplinary Digital Library: A Semantic-based Approach

In the scientific digital libraries, some papers from different research communities can be described by community-dependent keywords even if they share a semantically similar topic. Articles that are not tagged with enough keyword variations are poorly indexed in any information retrieval system which limits potentially fruitful exchanges between scientific disciplines. In this paper, we introduce a novel experimentally designed pipeline for multi-label semantic-based tagging developed for open-access metadata digital libraries. The approach starts by learning from a standard scientific categorization and a sample of topic tagged articles to find semantically relevant articles and enrich its metadata accordingly. Our proposed pipeline aims to enable researchers reaching articles from various disciplines that tend to use different terminologies. It allows retrieving semantically relevant articles given a limited known variation of search terms. In addition to achieving an accuracy that is higher than an expanded query based method using a topic synonym set extracted from a semantic network, our experiments also show a higher computational scalability versus other comparable techniques. We created a new benchmark extracted from the open-access metadata of a scientific digital library and published it along with the experiment code to allow further research in the topic.
