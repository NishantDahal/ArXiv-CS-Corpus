Inverse Problems in Topological Persistence

In this survey, we review the literature on inverse problems in topological persistence theory. The first half of the survey is concerned with the question of surjectivity, i.e. the existence of right inverses, and the second half focuses on injectivity, i.e. left inverses. Throughout, we highlight the tools and theorems that underlie these advances, and direct the reader's attention to open problems, both theoretical and applied.
