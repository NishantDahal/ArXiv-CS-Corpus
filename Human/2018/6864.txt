The Bibliotelemetry of Information and Environment: an Evaluation of IoT-Powered Recommender Systems

Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure within the physical library environment is the basis for an integrative, hybrid approach to digital resource recommenders. The IoT infrastructure provides mobile, dynamic wayfinding support for items in the collection, which includes features for location-based recommendations. A modular evaluation and analysis herein clarified the nature of users' requests for recommendations based on their location and describes subject areas of the library for which users request recommendations. The modular mobile design allowed for deep exploration of users' bibliographic identifiers throughout the global module system, serving to provide context to the browsing data that are the focus of this study. Bibliotelemetry is introduced as an evaluation method for IoT middleware within library collections.
