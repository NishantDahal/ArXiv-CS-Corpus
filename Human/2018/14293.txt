Outage Analysis of Relay-Assisted mmWave Cellular Systems Employing JSDM

In this paper, the outage performance of relay-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems employing joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) is investigated. It is assumed that the macro base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antennas serves the single antenna pico BS (as a relay) and users simultaneously, and that the pico BS is located at the edge of the macro cell. Theoretical analysis of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) outage probability of each user is first obtained. The cell SINR outage probability is then derived. Under the noise-limited assumption, simplified closed-form expressions of the outage probability are given as well. Simulation results demonstrating the performance improvement due to the relay introduced by the pico BS are provided. Overall, the impact of deploying pico BS as a relay in the mmWave cellular systems is characterized.
