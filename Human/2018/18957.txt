Shannon entropy for intuitionistic fuzzy information

The paper presents an extension of Shannon fuzzy entropy for intuitionistic fuzzy one. Firstly, we presented a new formula for calculating the distance and similarity of intuitionistic fuzzy information. Then, we constructed measures for information features like score, certainty and uncertainty. Also, a new concept was introduced, namely escort fuzzy information. Then, using the escort fuzzy information, Shannon's formula for intuitionistic fuzzy information was obtained. It should be underlined that Shannon's entropy for intuitionistic fuzzy information verifies the four defining conditions of intuitionistic fuzzy uncertainty. The measures of its two components were also identified: fuzziness (ambiguity) and incompleteness (ignorance).
