Methods of learning of computer simulation of physical processes and phenomena in university

To effectively prepare engineering students requires of formation of a system of fundamental physical knowledge together with the ability to apply them in specific productive activities, both on fundamental and on the profiled-oriented level. Accordingly the tasks of physics of high school is mastering the methodology of science knowledge and scientific way of thinking and generalize of experimental natural ability to conduct scientific research by methods of physical knowledge. In the process of teaching physics simulations simultaneously acts by scientific knowledge, is part of the content of educational material and effective means of experiment. It is possible to obtain special teaching methods of computer simulation, which include primarily computer experiment. The main methods of computer modeling learning in university are a multimedia lecture, telecommunications project and computer-oriented laboratory practice. The main tasks of teaching computer modeling in physics course are the overall development and formation of outlook of future engineers and development practical skills in computer simulation. The leading method of learning computer simulation in physics course is a project method. Those methods of learning are optimal in the context of developmental education. Computational experiment is a modeling methodology as a science, so it can be attributed to the principles of scientific methods of learning. Purposes of learning physics in university include the necessity of mastering a given set of scientific facts and methods of getting these facts. Computational experiment reflects the method of knowledge which applied in physics.
