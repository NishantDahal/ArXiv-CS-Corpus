Under the Underground: Predicting Private Interactions in Underground Forums

Underground forums where users discuss, buy, and sell illicit services and goods facilitate a better understanding of the economy and organization of cybercriminals. Prior work has shown that in particular private interactions provide a wealth of information about the cybercriminal ecosystem. Yet, those messages are seldom available to analysts, except when there is a leak. To address this problem we propose a supervised machine learning based method able to predict which public \threads will generate private messages, after a partial leak of such messages has occurred. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop a solution to overcome the barrier posed by limited to no information on private activity for underground forum analysis. Additionally, we propose an automate method for labeling posts, significantly reducing the cost of our approach in the presence of real unlabeled data. This method can be tuned to focus on the likelihood of users receiving private messages, or \threads triggering private interactions. We evaluate the performance of our methods using data from three real forum leaks. Our results show that public information can indeed be used to predict private activity, although prediction models do not transfer well between forums. We also find that neither the length of the leak period nor the time between the leak and the prediction have significant impact on our technique's performance, and that NLP features dominate the prediction power.
