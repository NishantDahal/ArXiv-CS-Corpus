Architecture of Distributed Data Storage for Astroparticle Physics

For the successful development of the astrophysics and, accordingly, for obtaining more complete knowledge of the Universe, it is extremely important to combine and comprehensively analyze information of various types (e.g., about charged cosmic particles, gamma rays, neutrinos, etc.) obtained by using divers large-scale experimental setups located throughout the world. It is obvious that all kinds of activities must be performed continually across all stages of the data life cycle to help support effective data management, in particular, the collection and storage of data, its processing and analysis, refining the physical model, making preparations for publication, and data reprocessing taking refinement into account. In this paper we present a general approach to construction and the architecture of a system to be able to collect, store, and provide users' access to astrophysical data. We also suggest a new approach to the construction of a metadata registry based on the blockchain technology.
