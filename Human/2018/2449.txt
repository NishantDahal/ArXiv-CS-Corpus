A Model for Innovation Diffusion with Intergroup Suppression

We present a new model for the diffusion of innovation. Here, the population is segmented into distinct groups. Adoption by a particular group of some cultural product may be inhibited both by large numbers of its own members already having adopted but also, in particular, by members of another group having adopted. Intergroup migration is also permitted. We determine the equilibrium points and carry out stability analysis for the model for a two-group population. We also simulate a discrete time version of the model. Lastly, we present data on tablet use in eight countries from 2012-2016 and show that the relationship between use in the "under 25" age group and "55+" age group conforms to the model.
