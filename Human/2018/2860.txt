Automatic supermartingales acting on sequences

This paper describes a construction of supermartingales realized as automatic functions. A capital of supermartingales is represented using automatic capital groups~(ACG). Properties of these automatic supermartingales are then studied. Automatic supermartingales induce a notion of random infinite binary sequence. We show that the class of random sequences coincide with that of disjunctive sequences.
