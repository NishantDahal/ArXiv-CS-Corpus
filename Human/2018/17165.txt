An Atemporal Model of Physical Complexity

We present the finite first-order theory (FFOT) machine, which provides an atemporal description of computation. We then develop a concept of complexity for the FFOT machine, and prove that the class of problems decidable by a FFOT machine with polynomial resources is NP intersect co-NP.
