3-Colorable Delaunay Triangulations

We propose an algorithm to create a 3-colorable Delaunay Triangulation. The input of the problem we are trying to solve is a set X of n twodimensional points. The output is a 3-colorable two-dimensional Delaunay triangulation T for X U Y , where Y is a set of m new points. We want to m be as few as possible.
