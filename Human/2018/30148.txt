Towards Blockchain-Driven, Secure and Transparent Audit Logs

Audit logs serve as a critical component in the enterprise business systems that are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks, which enable adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchains to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit, and outline its operational procedures. We implement our design on Hyperledger and evaluate its performance in terms of latency, network size, and payload size. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into BlockAudit to achieve higher security, integrity, and fault tolerance.
