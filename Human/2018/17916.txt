Fuzzy quantification for linguistic data analysis and data mining

Fuzzy quantification is a subtopic of fuzzy logic which deals with the modelling of the quantified expressions we can find in natural language. Fuzzy quantifiers have been successfully applied in several fields like fuzzy, control, fuzzy databases, information retrieval, natural language generation, etc. Their ability to model and evaluate linguistic expressions in a mathematical way, makes fuzzy quantifiers very powerful for data analytics and data mining applications. In this paper we will give a general overview of the main applications of fuzzy quantifiers in this field as well as some ideas to use them in new application contexts.
