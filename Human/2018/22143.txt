On the tails of the limiting QuickSort density

We give upper and lower asymptotic bounds for the left tail and for the right tail of the continuous limiting QuickSort density f that are nearly matching in each tail. The bounds strengthen results from a paper of Svante Janson (2015) concerning the corresponding distribution function F. Furthermore, we obtain similar bounds on absolute values of derivatives of f of each order.
