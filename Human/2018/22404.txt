Development of a Sliding Mode Control Based Adaptive Fuzzy Controller for a Flapping Flight

Controlling of a flapping flight is one of the recent research topics related to the field of Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicle (FW MAV). In this work, an adaptive control system for a four-wing FW MAV is proposed, inspired by its advanced features like quick flight, vertical take-off and landing, hovering, and fast turn, and enhanced manoeuvrability. Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory has been used to develop the adaptation laws for the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller. The SMC theory confirms the closed-loop stability of the controller. The controller is utilized to control the altitude of the FW MAV, that can adapt to environmental disturbances by tuning the antecedent and consequent parameters of the fuzzy system.
