Occlusions, Motion and Depth Boundaries with a Generic Network for Disparity, Optical Flow or Scene Flow Estimation

Occlusions play an important role in disparity and optical flow estimation, since matching costs are not available in occluded areas and occlusions indicate depth or motion boundaries. Moreover, occlusions are relevant for motion segmentation and scene flow estimation. In this paper, we present an efficient learning-based approach to estimate occlusion areas jointly with disparities or optical flow. The estimated occlusions and motion boundaries clearly improve over the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we present networks with state-of-the-art performance on the popular KITTI benchmark and good generic performance. Making use of the estimated occlusions, we also show improved results on motion segmentation and scene flow estimation.
