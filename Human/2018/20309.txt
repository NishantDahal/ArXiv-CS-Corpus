How to Fit a Tree in a Box

We study compact straight-line embeddings of trees. We show that perfect binary trees can be embedded optimally: a tree with $n$ nodes can be drawn on a $\sqrt n$ by $\sqrt n$ grid. We also show that testing whether a given binary tree has an upward embedding with a given combinatorial embedding in a given grid is NP-hard.
