Extending the D-Wave with support for Higher Precision Coefficients

D-Wave only guarantees to support coefficients with 4 to 5 bits of resolution or precision. This paper describes a method to extend the functionality of the D-Wave to solve problems that require the support of higher precision coefficients.
