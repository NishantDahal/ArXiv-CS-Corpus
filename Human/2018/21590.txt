The Boyer-Moore Waterfall Model Revisited

In this paper, we investigate the potential of the Boyer-Moore waterfall model for the automation of inductive proofs within a modern proof assistant. We analyze the basic concepts and methodology underlying this 30-year-old model and implement a new, fully integrated tool in the theorem prover HOL Light that can be invoked as a tactic. We also describe several extensions and enhancements to the model. These include the integration of existing HOL Light proof procedures and the addition of state-of-the-art generalization techniques into the waterfall. Various features, such as proof feedback and heuristics dealing with non-termination, that are needed to make this automated tool useful within our interactive setting are also discussed. Finally, we present a thorough evaluation of the approach using a set of 150 theorems, and discuss the effectiveness of our additions and relevance of the model in light of our results.
