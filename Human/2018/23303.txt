Strong Coordination over Noisy Channels with Strictly Causal Encoding

We consider a network of two nodes separated by a noisy channel, in which the input and output signals have to be coordinated with the source and its reconstruction. In the case of strictly causal encoding and non-causal decoding, we prove inner and outer bounds for the strong coordination region and show that the inner bound is achievable with polar codes.
