The TMB path loss model for 5 GHz indoor WiFi scenarios: On the empirical relationship between RSSI, MCS, and spatial streams

The WiFi landscape is rapidly changing over the last years, responding to the new needs of wireless communications. IEEE 802.11ax is the next fast-approaching standard, addressing some of today's biggest performance challenges specifically for high-density public environments. It is designed to operate at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, the latter being rapidly adopted worldwide after its inclusion in IEEE 802.11ac, and with expected growing demand in the next 10 years.
  This paper assesses empirically the suitability of the available IEEE 802.11ax path loss models at 5 GHz on some real testbeds and proposes a new model with higher abstraction level; i.e., without requiring from a previous in situ analysis of each considered receiver's location. The proposed TMB path loss model, used in combination with generated data sets, is able to obtain an estimation of RSSI, selected modulation and coding scheme (MCS), and number of spatial streams in function of the AP configuration and the AP-STA distance. We aim to use the model to compare IEEE 802.11ac/ax performance simulation results with experimental ones.
