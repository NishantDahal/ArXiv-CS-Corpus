Analysis of Nederlof's algorithm for subset sum

We show that Nederlof's algorithm [Information Processing Letters, 118 (2017), 15-16] for constructing a proof that the number of subsets summing to a particular integer equals a claimed quantity is flawed because: 1) its consistence is not kept; 2) the proposed recurrence formula is incorrect.
