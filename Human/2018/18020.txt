3D Global Convolutional Adversarial Network\\ for Prostate MR Volume Segmentation

Advanced deep learning methods have been developed to conduct prostate MR volume segmentation in either a 2D or 3D fully convolutional manner. However, 2D methods tend to have limited segmentation performance, since large amounts of spatial information of prostate volumes are discarded during the slice-by-slice segmentation process; and 3D methods also have room for improvement, since they use isotropic kernels to perform 3D convolutions whereas most prostate MR volumes have anisotropic spatial resolution. Besides, the fully convolutional structural methods achieve good performance for localization issues but neglect the per-voxel classification for segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose a 3D Global Convolutional Adversarial Network (3D GCA-Net) to address efficient prostate MR volume segmentation. We first design a 3D ResNet encoder to extract 3D features from prostate scans, and then develop the decoder, which is composed of a multi-scale 3D global convolutional block and a 3D boundary refinement block, to address the classification and localization issues simultaneously for volumetric segmentation. Additionally, we combine the encoder-decoder segmentation network with an adversarial network in the training phrase to enforce the contiguity of long-range spatial predictions. Throughout the proposed model, we use anisotropic convolutional processing for better feature learning on prostate MR scans. We evaluated our 3D GCA-Net model on two public prostate MR datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performances.
