Directional Modulation Design Based on Crossed-Dipole Arrays for Two Signals With Orthogonal Polarisations

Directional modulation (DM) is a physical layer security technique based on antenna arrays and so far the polarisation information has not been considered in its designs. To increase the channel capacity, we consider exploiting the polarisation information and send two different signals simultaneously at the same direction, same frequency, but with different polarisations. These two signals can also be considered as one composite signal using the four dimensional (4-D) modulation scheme across the two polarisation diversity channels. In this paper, based on cross-dipole arrays, we formulate the design to find a set of common weight coefficients to achieve directional modulation for such a composite signal and examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.
