A Secure and Efficient Direct Power Load Control Framework Based on Blockchain

Security and privacy in Direct Load Control (DLC) is a fundamental challenge in smart grids. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework to increase security and privacy of DLC. We propose a method whereby participating nodes share their data with the distribution company in an anonymous and secure manner. To reduce the associated overhead for data dissemination, we propose a hash-based transaction generation method. We also outline the DLC process for managing the load in consumer site. Qualitative analysis demonstrates the security and privacy of the proposed method.
