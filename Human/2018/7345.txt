Black-box Testing of First-Order Logic Ontologies Using WordNet

Artificial Intelligence aims to provide computer programs with commonsense knowledge to reason about our world. This paper offers a new practical approach towards automated commonsense reasoning with first-order logic (FOL) ontologies. We propose a new black-box testing methodology of FOL SUMO-based ontologies by exploiting WordNet and its mapping into SUMO. Our proposal includes a method for the (semi-)automatic creation of a very large benchmark of competency questions and a procedure for its automated evaluation by using automated theorem provers (ATPs). Applying different quality criteria, our testing proposal enables a successful evaluation of a) the competency of several translations of SUMO into FOL and b) the performance of various automated ATPs. Finally, we also provide a fine-grained and complete analysis of the commonsense reasoning competency of current FOL SUMO-based ontologies.
