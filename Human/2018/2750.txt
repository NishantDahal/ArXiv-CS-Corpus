A Social Network Analysis Framework for Modeling Health Insurance Claims Data

Health insurance companies in Brazil have their data about claims organized having the view only for providers. In this way, they loose the physician view and how they share patients. Partnership between physicians can view as a fruitful work in most of the cases but sometimes this could be a problem for health insurance companies and patients, for example a recommendation to visit another physician only because they work in same clinic. The focus of the work is to better understand physicians activities and how these activities are represented in the data. Our approach considers three aspects: the relationships among physicians, the relationships between physicians and patients, and the relationships between physicians and health providers. We present the results of an analysis of a claims database (detailing 18 months of activity) from a large health insurance company in Brazil. The main contribution presented in this paper is a set of models to represent: mutual referral between physicians, patient retention, and physician centrality in the health insurance network. Our results show the proposed models based on social network frameworks, extracted surprising insights about physicians from real health insurance claims data.
