SHAH: Hash Function based on Irregularly Decimated Chaotic Map

In this paper, we propose a novel hash function based on irregularly decimated chaotic map. The hash function called SHAH is based on two Tinkerbell maps filtered with irregular decimation rule. Exact study has been provided on the novel scheme using distribution analysis, sensitivity analysis, static analysis of diffusion and confusion, and collision analysis. The experimental data show that SHAH satisfied admirable level of security.
