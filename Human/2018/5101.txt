The Future of CISE Distributed Research Infrastructure

Shared research infrastructure that is globally distributed and widely accessible has been a hallmark of the networking community. This paper presents an initial snapshot of a vision for a possible future of mid-scale distributed research infrastructure aimed at enabling new types of research and discoveries. The paper is written from the perspective of "lessons learned" in constructing and operating the Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) infrastructure and attempts to project future concepts and solutions based on these lessons. The goal of this paper is to engage the community to contribute new ideas and to inform funding agencies about future research directions to realize this vision.
