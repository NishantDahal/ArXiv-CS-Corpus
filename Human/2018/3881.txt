Best Practices for a Future Open Code Policy: Experiences and Vision of the Astrophysics Source Code Library

We are members of the Astrophysics Source Code Library's Advisory Committee and its editor-in-chief. The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net) is a successful initiative that advocates for open research software and provides an infrastructure for registering, discovering, sharing, and citing this software. Started in 1999, the ASCL has been expanding in recent years, with an average of over 200 codes added each year, and now houses over 1,600 code entries.
