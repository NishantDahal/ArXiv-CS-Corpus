A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Method for Impression Allocation in Online Display Advertising

In online display advertising, guaranteed contracts and real-time bidding (RTB) are two major ways to sell impressions for a publisher. Despite the increasing popularity of RTB, there is still half of online display advertising revenue generated from guaranteed contracts. Therefore, simultaneously selling impressions through both guaranteed contracts and RTB is a straightforward choice for a publisher to maximize its yield. However, deriving the optimal strategy to allocate impressions is not a trivial task, especially when the environment is unstable in real-world applications. In this paper, we formulate the impression allocation problem as an auction problem where each contract can submit virtual bids for individual impressions. With this formulation, we derive the optimal impression allocation strategy by solving the optimal bidding functions for contracts. Since the bids from contracts are decided by the publisher, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to derive cooperative policies for the publisher to maximize its yield in an unstable environment. The proposed approach also resolves the common challenges in MARL such as input dimension explosion, reward credit assignment, and non-stationary environment. Experimental evaluations on large-scale real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
