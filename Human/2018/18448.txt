Interactive Discovery System for Direct Democracy

Decide Madrid is the civic technology of Madrid City Council which allows users to create and support online petitions. Despite the initial success, the platform is encountering problems with the growth of petition signing because petitions are far from the minimum number of supporting votes they must gather. Previous analyses have suggested that this problem is produced by the interface: a paginated list of petitions which applies a non-optimal ranking algorithm. For this reason, we present an interactive system for the discovery of topics and petitions. This approach leads us to reflect on the usefulness of data visualization techniques to address relevant societal challenges.
