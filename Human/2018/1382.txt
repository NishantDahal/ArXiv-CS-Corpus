Effective usage of random routing on networks of mobile agents

Most existing routing strategies to improve transport efficiency have little attention what order should the packets be delivered, just simply used first-in-first-out queue discipline. However, it is far from optimal. In this paper we apply priority queuing discipline to random routing strategy on networks of mobile agents, in which the packets have high priority to transfer directly to their destination despite their order in the queue if their destination are within a communication radius. Numerical experiments show that it not only remarkably improves network throughput and the packet arriving rate, but also reduces average travelling time and the rate of waiting time to travelling time. Our work may be helpful in routing strategy designing on networks of mobile agents.
