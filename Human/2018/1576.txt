Viral content propagation in Online Social Networks

Information flows are the result of a constant exchange in Online Social Networks (OSNs). OSN users create and share varying types of information in real-time throughout a day. Virality is introduced as a term to describe information that reaches a wide audience within a small time-frame. As a case, we measure propagation of information submitted in Reddit, identify different patterns and present a multi OSN diffusion analysis on Twitter, Facebook, and 2 hosting domains for images and multimedia, ImgUr and YouTube. Our results indicate that positive content is the most shared and presents the highest virality probability, and the overall virality probability of user created information is low. Finally, we underline the problems of limited access in OSN data. Keywords: Online Social Networks, Virality, Diffusion, Viral Content, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, ImgUr, YouTube
