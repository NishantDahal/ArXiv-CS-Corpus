A Brief History on the Theoretical Analysis of Dense Small Cell Wireless Networks

This article provides dives into the fundamentals of dense and ultra-dense small cell wireless networks, discussing the reasons why dense and ultra-dense small cell networks are fundamentally different from sparse ones, and why the well-known linear scaling law of capacity with the base station (BS) density in the latter does not apply to the former. In more detail, we review the impact of the following factors on ultradense networks (UDNs), (i) closed-access operations and line-of-sight conditions, (ii) the near-field effect, (iii) the antenna height difference between small cell BSs and user equipments (UEs), and (iv) the surplus of idle-mode-enabled small cell BSs with respect to UEs. Combining all these network characteristics and features, we present a more realistic capacity scaling law for UDNs, which indicates (i) the existence of an optimum BS density to maximise the area spectral efficiency (ASE) for a given finite UE density, and (ii) the existence of an optimum density of UEs that can be simultaneously scheduled across the network to maximise the ASE for a given finite BS density.
