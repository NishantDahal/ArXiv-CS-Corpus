Multiple Combined Constraints for Image Stitching

Several approaches to image stitching use different constraints to estimate the motion model between image pairs. These constraints can be roughly divided into two categories: geometric constraints and photometric constraints. In this paper, geometric and photometric constraints are combined to improve the alignment quality, which is based on the observation that these two kinds of constraints are complementary. On the one hand, geometric constraints (e.g., point and line correspondences) are usually spatially biased and are insufficient in some extreme scenes, while photometric constraints are always evenly and densely distributed. On the other hand, photometric constraints are sensitive to displacements and are not suitable for images with large parallaxes, while geometric constraints are usually imposed by feature matching and are more robust to handle parallaxes. The proposed method therefore combines them together in an efficient mesh-based image warping framework. It achieves better alignment quality than methods only with geometric constraints, and can handle larger parallax than photometric-constraint-based method. Experimental results on various images illustrate that the proposed method outperforms representative state-of-the-art image stitching methods reported in the literature.
