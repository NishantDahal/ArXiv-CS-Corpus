Improving Information Retrieval Results for Persian Documents using FarsNet

In this paper, we propose a new method for query expansion, which uses FarsNet (Persian WordNet) to find similar tokens related to the query and expand the semantic meaning of the query. For this purpose, we use synonymy relations in FarsNet and extract the related synonyms to query words. This algorithm is used to enhance information retrieval systems and improve search results. The overall evaluation of this system in comparison to the baseline method (without using query expansion) shows an improvement of about 9 percent in Mean Average Precision (MAP).
