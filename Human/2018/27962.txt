A categorisation and implementation of digital pen features for behaviour characterisation

In this paper we provide a categorisation and implementation of digital ink features for behaviour characterisation. Based on four feature sets taken from literature, we provide a categorisation in different classes of syntactic and semantic features. We implemented a publicly available framework to calculate these features and show its deployment in the use case of analysing cognitive assessments performed using a digital pen.
