Time Constrained Continuous Subgraph Search over Streaming Graphs

The growing popularity of dynamic applications such as social networks provides a promising way to detect valuable information in real time. Efficient analysis over high-speed data from dynamic applications is of great significance. Data from these dynamic applications can be easily modeled as streaming graph. In this paper, we study the subgraph (isomorphism) search over streaming graph data that obeys timing order constraints over the occurrence of edges in the stream. We propose a data structure and algorithm to efficiently answer subgraph search and introduce optimizations to greatly reduce the space cost, and propose concurrency management to improve system throughput. Extensive experiments on real network traffic data and synthetic social streaming data confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution.
