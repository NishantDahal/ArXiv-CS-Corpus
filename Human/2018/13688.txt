Proof of Correspondence between Keys and Encoding Maps in an Authentication Code

In a former paper the authors introduced two new systematic authentication codes based on the Gray map over a Galois ring. In this paper, it is proved the one-to-one onto correspondence between keys and encoding maps for the second introduced authentication code.
