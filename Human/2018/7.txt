Automatic Labeling of the Object-oriented Source Code: The Lotus Approach

Most of open-source software systems become available on the internet today. Thus, we need automatic methods to label software code. Software code can be labeled with a set of keywords. These keywords in this paper referred as software labels. The goal of this paper is to provide a quick view of the software code vocabulary. This paper proposes an automatic approach to document the object-oriented software by labeling its code. The approach exploits all software identifiers to label software code. The paper presents the results of study conducted on the ArgoUML and drawing shapes case studies. Results showed that all code labels were correctly identified.
