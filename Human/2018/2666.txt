Medical Volume Reconstruction Techniques

Medical visualization is the use of computers to create 3D images from medical imaging data sets, almost all surgery and cancer treatment in the developed world relies on it.Volume visualization techniques includes iso-surface visualization, mesh visualization and point cloud visualization techniques, these techniques have revolutionized medicine. Much of modern medicine relies on the 3D imaging that is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)scanners, positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, ultrasound imaging (US) scanners, X-Ray scanners, bio-marker microscopy imaging scanners and computed tomography (CT) scanners, which make 3D images out of 2D slices. The primary goal of this report is the application-oriented optimization of existing volume rendering methods providing interactive frame rates. Techniques are presented for traditional alpha-blending rendering, surface-shaded display, maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fast previewing with fully interactive parameter control. Different preprocessing strategies are proposed for interactive iso-surface rendering and fast previewing, such as the well-known marching cube algorithm.
