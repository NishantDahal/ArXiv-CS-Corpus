Service Aware Fuzzy Logic Based Handover Decision in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks

The ubiquitous services of wireless communication networks are growing rapidly by the development of wireless communication technologies. While a user is roaming from one cell to another cell, an intelligent decision mechanism and network selection is extremely crucial to maintain the quality of service (QoS) during handover. Handover decision must be made precisely to avoid any unnecessary phenomenon like ping-pong, corner effect, call blocking, and call dropping etc. This work considered service types like voice, video, and data and their QoS requirements for handover decision using fuzzy logic in heterogeneous network environment. Service is an important factor for the users and particular service requires respective QoS. This paper provides all the cases of handover decisions between macrocell and femtocell networks considering service type. The proposed system models regarding these handover decisions using fuzzy logic considering several input parameters e.g. received signal strength indicator (RSSI), data rate, user's velocity, and interference level (signal-to-noise plus interference ratio) to make handover from femtocell to macrocell, macrocell to femtocell or femtocell to femtocell. The performance of different parameters are shown based on service type are analyzed.
