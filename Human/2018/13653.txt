Caching with Partial Adaptive Matching

We study the caching problem when we are allowed to match each user to one of a subset of caches after its request is revealed. We focus on non-uniformly popular content, specifically when the file popularities obey a Zipf distribution. We study two extremal schemes, one focusing on coded server transmissions while ignoring matching capabilities, and the other focusing on adaptive matching while ignoring potential coding opportunities. We derive the rates achieved by these schemes and characterize the regimes in which one outperforms the other. We also compare them to information-theoretic outer bounds, and finally propose a hybrid scheme that generalizes ideas from the two schemes and performs at least as well as either of them in most memory regimes.
