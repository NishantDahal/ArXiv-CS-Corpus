Credibility of Automatic Appraisal of Domain Names

Both domain names and entire websites are increasingly frequently treated as assets, the value of which can be appraised. The objective of the present thesis was to verify the credibility of domain name appraisals obtained using generally available web applications in an automated, algorithmic way. In conclusions section, it was mentioned that the terms domain name appraisal and website appraisal are frequently equated. It was also shown that algorithms used in the tested applications consider parameters characterising websites. Thus, they cannot be used to verify the value of domain names themselves. Moreover, during the analysis of the pattern of operation of the appraisal websites it was noticed that they were not made available with domain name or website appraisals in mind. Their objective was to acquire and intercept online traffic. Such applications also left cookie files on recipients' devices, which were then used by advertising systems based on the re-marketing concept.
