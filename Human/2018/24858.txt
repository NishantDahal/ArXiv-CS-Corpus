Complexity of MLDP

We carry out an explicit examination of the NP-hardness of a bi- objective optimization problem to minimize distance and latency of a single-vehicle route designed to serve a set of client requests. In addition to being a Hamiltonian cycle the route is to minimize the traveled distance of the vehicle as well as the total waiting time of the clients along the route.
