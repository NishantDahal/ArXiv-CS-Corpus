Adaptive Blind Image Watermarking Using Fuzzy Inference System Based on Human Visual Perception

Development of digital content has increased the necessity of copyright protection by means of watermarking. Imperceptibility and robustness are two important features of watermarking algorithms. The goal of watermarking methods is to satisfy the tradeoff between these two contradicting characteristics. Recently watermarking methods in transform domains have displayed favorable results. In this paper, we present an adaptive blind watermarking method which has high transparency in areas that are important to human visual system. We propose a fuzzy system for adaptive control of the embedding strength factor. Features such as saliency, intensity, and edge-concentration, are used as fuzzy attributes. Redundant embedding in discrete cosine transform (DCT) of wavelet domain has increased the robustness of our method. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method and better results are obtained as compared to comparable methods with same size of watermark logo.
