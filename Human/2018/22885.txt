An Analog Neural Network Computing Engine using CMOS-Compatible Charge-Trap-Transistor (CTT)

An analog neural network computing engine based on CMOS-compatible charge-trap transistor (CTT) is proposed in this paper. CTT devices are used as analog multipliers. Compared to digital multipliers, CTT-based analog multiplier shows significant area and power reduction. The proposed computing engine is composed of a scalable CTT multiplier array and energy efficient analog-digital interfaces. Through implementing the sequential analog fabric (SAF), the engine mixed-signal interfaces are simplified and hardware overhead remains constant regardless of the size of the array. A proof-of-concept 784 by 784 CTT computing engine is implemented using TSMC 28nm CMOS technology and occupied 0.68mm2. The simulated performance achieves 76.8 TOPS (8-bit) with 500 MHz clock frequency and consumes 14.8 mW. As an example, we utilize this computing engine to address a classic pattern recognition problem -- classifying handwritten digits on MNIST database and obtained a performance comparable to state-of-the-art fully connected neural networks using 8-bit fixed-point resolution.
