Considerations on Quantum-Based Methods for Communication Security

In this paper we provide an intuitive-level discussion of the challenges and opportunities offered by quantum-based methods for supporting secure communications, e.g., over a network. The goal is to distill down to the most fundamental issues and concepts in order to provide a clear foundation for assessing the potential value of quantum-based technologies relative to classical alternatives. It is hoped that this form of exposition can provide greater clarity of perspective than is typically offered by mathematically-focused treatments of the topic. It is also hoped that this clarity extends to more general applications of quantum information science such as quantum computing and quantum sensing.
