Dense Small Cell Networks: From Noise-Limited to Dense Interference-Limited

Considering both non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and line-of-sight (LoS) transmissions, the transitional behaviors from noise-limited regime to dense interference-limited regime have been investigated for the fifth generation (5G) small cell networks (SCNs). Besides, we identify four performance regimes based on base station (BS) density, i.e., (i) the noise-limited regime, (ii) the signal-dominated regime, (iii) the interference-dominated regime, and (iv) the interference-limited regime. To characterize the performance regime, we propose a unified framework analyzing the future 5G wireless networks over generalized shadowing/fading channels, in which the user association schemes based on the strongest instantaneous received power (SIRP) and the strongest average received power (SARP) can be studied, while NLoS/LoS transmissions and multi-slop path loss model are considered. Simulation results indicate that different factors, i.e., noise, desired signal, and interference, successively and separately dominate the network performance with the increase of BS density. Hence, our results shed new light on the design and management of SCNs in urban and rural areas with different BS deployment densities.
