Design of Voltage Pulse Control Module for Free Space Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution

Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MDIQKD) protocol has been proved that it is unaffected by all hacking attacks, and ensures the security of information theory even when the performance of single-photon detectors is not ideal. Fiber channel has been used by the previous MDIQKD experimental device. However, the signal attenuation increases exponentially as the transmission distance increases. In order to overcome this, we regard free space as the channel of signal transmission, and the signal attenuation increases square as the transmission distance increases (regardless of the atmospheric scattering), which can effectively reduce the signal attenuation trend. In order to implement the free space MDIQKD experiments, a modulation module is needed to modulate the wide pulse chopping, decoy-state, normalization, phase encoding and time encoding. In this paper, we present the design of the Voltage Pulse Control Module for the free space MDIQKD.
