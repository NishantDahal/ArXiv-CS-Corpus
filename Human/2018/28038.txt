Bandwidth Adaptation for Scalable Videos over Wireless Networks

Multicast/broadcast services (MBS) are able to provide video services for many users simultaneously. Fixed amount of bandwidth allocation for all of the MBS videos is not effective in terms of bandwidth utilization, overall forced call termination probability, and handover call dropping probability. Therefore, variable bandwidth allocation for the MBS videos can efficiently improve the system performance. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth allocation scheme that efficiently allocates bandwidth among the MBS sessions and the non-MBS traffic calls (e.g., voice, unicast, internet, and other background traffic). The proposed scheme reduces the bandwidth allocation for the MBS sessions during the congested traffic condition only to accommodate more number of calls in the system. Our scheme allocates variable amount of bandwidths for the BMS sessions and the non-MBS traffic calls. The performance analyses show that the proposed bandwidth adaptation scheme maximizes the bandwidth utilization and significantly reduces the handover call dropping probability and overall forced call termination probability.
