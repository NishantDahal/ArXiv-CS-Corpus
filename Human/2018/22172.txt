Wavelet Sparse Regularization for Manifold-Valued Data

In this paper, we consider the sparse regularization of manifold-valued data with respect to an interpolatory wavelet/multiscale transform. We propose and study variational models for this task and provide results on their well-posedness. We present algorithms for a numerical realization of these models in the manifold setup. Further, we provide experimental results to show the potential of the proposed schemes for applications.
