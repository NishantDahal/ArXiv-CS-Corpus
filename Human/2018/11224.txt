EgoCoder: Intelligent Program Synthesis with Hierarchical Sequential Neural Network Model

Programming has been an important skill for researchers and practitioners in computer science and other related areas. To learn basic programing skills, a long-time systematic training is usually required for beginners. According to a recent market report, the computer software market is expected to continue expanding at an accelerating speed, but the market supply of qualified software developers can hardly meet such a huge demand. In recent years, the surge of text generation research works provides the opportunities to address such a dilemma through automatic program synthesis. In this paper, we propose to make our try to solve the program synthesis problem from a data mining perspective. To address the problem, a novel generative model, namely EgoCoder, will be introduced in this paper. EgoCoder effectively parses program code into abstract syntax trees (ASTs), where the tree nodes will contain the program code/comment content and the tree structure can capture the program logic flows. Based on a new unit model called Hsu, EgoCoder can effectively capture both the hierarchical and sequential patterns in the program ASTs. Extensive experiments will be done to compare EgoCoder with the state-of-the-art text generation methods, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of EgoCoder in addressing the program synthesis problem.
