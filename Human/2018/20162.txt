A Unified Framework for Community Detection and Network Representation Learning

Network representation learning (NRL) aims to learn low-dimensional vectors for vertices in a network. Most existing NRL methods focus on learning representations from local context of vertices (such as their neighbors). Nevertheless, vertices in many complex networks also exhibit significant global patterns widely known as communities. It's intuitive that vertices in the same community tend to connect densely and share common attributes. These patterns are expected to improve NRL and benefit relevant evaluation tasks, such as link prediction and vertex classification. Inspired by the analogy between network representation learning and text modeling, we propose a unified NRL framework by introducing community information of vertices, named as Community-enhanced Network Representation Learning (CNRL). CNRL simultaneously detects community distribution of each vertex and learns embeddings of both vertices and communities. Moreover, the proposed community enhancement mechanism can be applied to various existing NRL models. In experiments, we evaluate our model on vertex classification, link prediction, and community detection using several real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CNRL significantly and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while verifying our assumptions on the correlations between vertices and communities.
