Demand Shaping in Cellular Networks

Demand shaping is a promising way to mitigate the wireless cellular capacity shortfall in the presence of ever-increasing wireless data demand. In this paper, we formulate demand shaping as an optimization problem that minimizes the variation in aggregate traffic. We design a distributed and randomized offline demand shaping algorithm under complete traffic information and prove its almost surely convergence. We further consider a more realistic setting where the traffic information is incomplete but the future traffic can be predicted to a certain degree of accuracy. We design an online demand shaping algorithm that updates the schedules of deferrable applications (DAs) each time when new information is available, based on solving at each timeslot an optimization problem over a shrinking horizon from the current time to the end of the day. We compare the performance of the online algorithm against the optimal offline algorithm, and provide numerical examples to complement the theoretical analysis.
