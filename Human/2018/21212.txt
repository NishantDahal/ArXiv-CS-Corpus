Confidential Encrypted Data Hiding and Retrieval Using QR Authentication System

Now, security and authenticity of data is a big challenge. To solve this problem, we propose an innovative method to authenticate the digital documents. In this paper, we propose a new method, where the marks obtained by a candidate will also be encoded in QR CodeTM in encrypted form, so that if an intruder tries to change the marks in the mark sheet then he can not do that in the QR CodeTM, because the encryption key is unknown to him. In this method, we encrypt the mark sheet data using the TTJSA encryption algorithm. The encrypted marks are entered inside QR code and that QR code is also printed with the original data of the mark sheet. The marks can then be retrieved from the QR code and can be decrypted using TTJSA decryption algorithm and then it can be verified with marks already there in the mark sheet.
