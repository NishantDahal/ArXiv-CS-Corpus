Sentiment Analysis on Speaker Specific Speech Data

Sentiment analysis has evolved over past few decades, most of the work in it revolved around textual sentiment analysis with text mining techniques. But audio sentiment analysis is still in a nascent stage in the research community. In this proposed research, we perform sentiment analysis on speaker discriminated speech transcripts to detect the emotions of the individual speakers involved in the conversation. We analyzed different techniques to perform speaker discrimination and sentiment analysis to find efficient algorithms to perform this task.
