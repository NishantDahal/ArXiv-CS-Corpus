Prototype Discovery using Quality-Diversity

An iterative computer-aided ideation procedure is introduced, building on recent quality-diversity algorithms, which search for diverse as well as high-performing solutions. Dimensionality reduction is used to define a similarity space, in which solutions are clustered into classes. These classes are represented by prototypes, which are presented to the user for selection. In the next iteration, quality-diversity focuses on searching within the selected class. A quantitative analysis is performed on a 2D airfoil, and a more complex 3D side view mirror domain shows how computer-aided ideation can help to enhance engineers' intuition while allowing their design decisions to influence the design process.
