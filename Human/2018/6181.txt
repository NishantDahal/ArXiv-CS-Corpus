Cantor-Bendixson ranks of countable SFTs

We show that the possible Cantor-Bendixson ranks of countable SFTs are exactly the finite ordinals and ordinals of the form $λ+ 3$, where $λ$ is a computable ordinal. This result was claimed by the author in his PhD dissertation, but the proof contains an error, which is fixed in this note.
