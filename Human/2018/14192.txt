New extension constructions of optimal frequency hopping sequence sets

In this paper, a general framework of constructing optimal frequency hopping sequence (FHS) sets is presented based on the designated direct product. Under the framework, we obtain infinitely many new optimal FHS sets by combining a family of sequences that are newly constructed in this paper with some known optimal FHS sets. Our constructions of optimal FHS sets are also based on extension method. However, our constructions remove the constraint requiring that the extension factor is co-prime with the length of original FHSs and get new parameters. In literature, most of the extension constructions suffer from this constraint. As a result, our constructions allow a great flexibility of choosing parameters of FHS sets for a given frequency-hopping spread spectrum system.
