On the Spatial Performance of Users in Indoor VLC Networks with Multiple Reflections

In this paper, we present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the performance of downlink indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks at a typical receiver while considering reflections from the walls. A typical receiver is a arbitrarily located user in the room and may not necessarily be at the center and hence sees an asymmetric transmitter location process and interference at itself. We first derive the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability for a typical user. We then present a framework to model the impact of wall reflections and extend the analysis to study the performance of VLC network in the presence of wall reflections. We show that the impact of user's location and reflections is significant on the performance of the user.
