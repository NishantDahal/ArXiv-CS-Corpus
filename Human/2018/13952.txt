An Efficient Dispatcher for Large Scale GraphProcessing on OpenCL-based FPGAs

High parallel framework has been proved to be very suitable for graph processing. There are various work to optimize the implementation in FPGAs, a pipeline parallel device. The key to make use of the parallel performance of FPGAs is to process graph data in pipeline model and take advantage of on-chip memory to realize necessary locality process. This paper proposes a modularize graph processing framework, which focus on the whole executing procedure with the extremely different degree of parallelism. The framework has three contributions. First, the combination of vertex-centric and edge-centric processing framework can been adjusting in the executing procedure to accommodate top-down algorithm and bottom-up algorithm. Second, owing to the pipeline parallel and finite on-chip memory accelerator, the novel edge-block, a block consist of edges vertex, achieve optimizing the way to utilize the on-chip memory to group the edges and stream the edges in a block to realize the stream pattern to pipeline parallel processing. Third, depending to the analysis of the block structure of nature graph and the executing characteristics during graph processing, we design a novel conversion dispatcher to change processing module, to match the corresponding exchange point.
