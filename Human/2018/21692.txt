A note on limit results for the Penrose-Banzhaf index

It is well known that the Penrose-Banzhaf index of a weighted game can differ starkly from corresponding weights. Limit results are quite the opposite, i.e., under certain conditions the power distribution approaches the weight distribution. Here we provide parametric examples that give necessary conditions for the existence of limit results for the Penrose-Banzhaf index.
