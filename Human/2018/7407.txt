Layered black-box, behavioral interconnection perspective and applications to the problem of communication with fidelity criteria, Part II: stationary sources satisfying ψ-mixing criterion

Theorems from Part 1 of this paper are generalized to ψ-mixing sources in this paper. Application to Markoff chains and order m Markoff chains is presented. The main result is the generalization of Theorem 1 in Part 1.
