A Modular Design for Geo-Distributed Querying

Most distributed storage systems provide limited abilities for querying data by attributes other than their primary keys. Supporting efficient search on secondary attributes is challenging as applications pose varying requirements to query processing systems, and no single system design can be suitable for all needs. In this paper, we show how to overcome these challenges in order to extend distributed data stores to support queries on secondary attributes. We propose a modular architecture that is flexible and allows query processing systems to make trade-offs according to different use case requirements. We describe adap-tive mechanisms that make use of this flexibility to enable query processing systems to dynamically adjust to query and write operation workloads.
