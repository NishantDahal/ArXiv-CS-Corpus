Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and -2 Data Fusion for Optical Image Simulation

In this paper, we present the optical image simulation from a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data using deep learning based methods. Two models, i.e., optical image simulation directly from the SAR data and from multi-temporal SARoptical data, are proposed to testify the possibilities. The deep learning based methods that we chose to achieve the models are a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a residual architecture and a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We validate our models using the Sentinel-1 and -2 datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the model with multi-temporal SAR-optical data can successfully simulate the optical image, meanwhile, the model with simple SAR data as input failed. The optical image simulation results indicate the possibility of SARoptical information blending for the subsequent applications such as large-scale cloud removal, and optical data temporal superresolution. We also investigate the sensitivity of the proposed models against the training samples, and reveal possible future directions.
