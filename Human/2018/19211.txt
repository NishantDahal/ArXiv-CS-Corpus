Channel Agnostic End-to-End Learning based Communication Systems with Conditional GAN

In this article, we use deep neural networks (DNNs) to develop a wireless end-to-end communication system, in which DNNs are employed for all signal-related functionalities, such as encoding, decoding, modulation, and equalization. However, accurate instantaneous channel transfer function, \emph{i.e.}, the channel state information (CSI), is necessary to compute the gradient of the DNN representing. In many communication systems, the channel transfer function is hard to obtain in advance and varies with time and location. In this article, this constraint is released by developing a channel agnostic end-to-end system that does not rely on any prior information about the channel. We use a conditional generative adversarial net (GAN) to represent the channel effects, where the encoded signal of the transmitter will serve as the conditioning information. In addition, in order to deal with the time-varying channel, the received signal corresponding to the pilot data can also be added as a part of the conditioning information. From the simulation results, the proposed method is effective on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, which opens a new door for building data-driven communication systems.
