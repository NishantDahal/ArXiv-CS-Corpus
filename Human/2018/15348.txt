Complex network representation through multi-dimensional node projection

Complex network topology might get pretty complicated challenging many network analysis objectives, such as community detection for example. This however makes common emergent network phenomena such as scale-free topology or small-world property even more intriguing. In the present proof-of-concept paper we propose a simple model of network representation inspired by a signal transmission physical analogy, which is apparently capable of reproducing both of the above phenomena. The model appears to be general enough to represent and/or approximate arbitrary complex networks. We propose an approach constructing such a representation by projecting each node into a multi-dimensional space of signal spectrum vectors, where network topology is induced by their overlaps. As one of the implications this enables reducing community detection in complex networks to a straightforward clustering over the projection space, for which multiple efficient approaches are available. We believe such a network representation could turn out to be a useful tool for multiple network analysis objectives.
