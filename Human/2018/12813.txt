BUDAMAF: Data Management in Cloud Federations

Data management has always been a multi-domain problem even in the simplest cases. It involves, quality of service, security, resource management, cost management, incident identification, disaster avoidance and/or recovery, as well as many other concerns. In our case, this situation gets ever more complicated because of the divergent nature of a cloud federation like BASMATI. In this federation, the BASMATI Unified Data Management Framework (BUDaMaF), tries to create an automated uniform way of managing all the data transactions, as well as the data stores themselves, in a polyglot multi-cloud, consisting of a plethora of different machines and data store systems.
