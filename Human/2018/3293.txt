Performance Analysis of Low Latency Multiple Full-Duplex Selective Decode and Forward Relays

In order to follow up with mission-critical applications, new features need to be carried to satisfy a reliable communication with reduced latency. With this regard, this paper proposes a low latency cooperative transmission scheme, where multiple full-duplex relays, simultaneously, assist the communication between a source node and a destination node. First, we present the communication model of the proposed transmission scheme. Then, we derive the outage probability closed-form for two cases: asynchronous transmission (where all relays have different processing delay) and synchronous transmissions (where all relays have the same processing delay). Finally, using simulations, we confirm the theoretical results and compare the proposed multi-relays transmission scheme with relay selection schemes.
