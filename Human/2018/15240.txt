Let's do it "again": A First Computational Approach to Detecting Adverbial Presupposition Triggers

We introduce the task of predicting adverbial presupposition triggers such as also and again. Solving such a task requires detecting recurring or similar events in the discourse context, and has applications in natural language generation tasks such as summarization and dialogue systems. We create two new datasets for the task, derived from the Penn Treebank and the Annotated English Gigaword corpora, as well as a novel attention mechanism tailored to this task. Our attention mechanism augments a baseline recurrent neural network without the need for additional trainable parameters, minimizing the added computational cost of our mechanism. We demonstrate that our model statistically outperforms a number of baselines, including an LSTM-based language model.
