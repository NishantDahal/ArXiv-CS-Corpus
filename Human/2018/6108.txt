Reliable and Real-Time End-to-End Delivery Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networks

Many routing protocols have been proposed to handle reliability and real-time routing energy efficiency for wireless sensor networks. In this paper we propose a new routing protocol with QoS based capabilities for WSNs. We used priority queues for improve real-time and non-real-time packets forwarding according to deadline of them. The protocol finds a best-cost, time-sensitive packet forwarding mechanism for real-time data with minimum consumption of the energy. In order to avoid of congestion in network our protocol drops those packets who can't reach their destination in specified time. For service quality assurance in reliability domain we used packet reception rate as an important parameter (PRR) in selecting of neighbor nodes. Simulation results show that our new approach how can provide quality of service parameters.
