Fair and Square: Cake-Cutting in Two Dimensions

We consider the classic problem of fairly dividing a heterogeneous good ("cake") among several agents with different valuations. Classic cake-cutting procedures either allocate each agent a collection of disconnected pieces, or assume that the cake is a one-dimensional interval. In practice, however, the two-dimensional shape of the allotted pieces is important. In particular, when building a house or designing an advertisement in printed or electronic media, squares are more usable than long and narrow rectangles. We thus introduce and study the problem of fair two-dimensional division wherein the allotted pieces must be of some restricted two-dimensional geometric shape(s), particularly squares and fat rectangles. Adding such geometric constraints re-opens most questions and challenges related to cake-cutting. Indeed, even the most elementary fairness criterion --- proportionality --- can no longer be guaranteed. In this paper we thus examine the level of proportionality that can be guaranteed, providing both impossibility results and constructive division procedures.
