Joint User Association, Power Control and Scheduling in Multi-Cell 5G Networks

-The focus of this paper is targeted towards multi-cell 5G networks which are composed of HPNs (High Power Node) such as evolved NodeBs (HPNs) that control signaling and system broadcasting information and of simplified LPNs (Low Power Node) co-existing in the same operating area and sharing the scare radio resources. Consequently, greater emphasis is given to Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) based on multi-resource management techniques that take in particular user association into account. Beside user association to HPNs, this paper takes also power control and scheduling into consideration. This addressed problem is remained largely unsolved, mainly due to its non-convex nature that makes the global optimal solution difficult to obtain. We address the user association challenge according to the two broadly adopted approaches in wireless networks: the network-centric approach where user association is allocated efficiently in a centralized fashion; and the user-centric approach where distributed allocation prevails for reduced complexity. The scheduling and HPNs power allocation are solved in a centralized fashion, in order to reach an optimal solution of the joint optimization problem.
