Their reduction is based on expander graphs. We present an analogue of this result for the second level of the polynomial-time hierarchy based on superconcentrator graphs. This resolves an open question of Ko and Lin (1995) and should be useful in deriving inapproximability results in the polynomial-time hierarchy.
  More precisely, we show that given an instance of $\gapthreesat$ in which every variable occurs at most $\Bsat$ times (for some absolute constant $\Bsat$), it is $Π_2$-hard to distinguish between the following two cases: $\YES$ instances, in which for any assignment to the universal variables there exists an assignment to the existential variables that satisfies all the clauses, and $\NO$ instances in which there exists an assignment to the universal variables such that any assignment to the existential variables satisfies at most a $1-\eps$ fraction of the clauses. We also generalize this result to any level of the polynomial-time hierarchy.
