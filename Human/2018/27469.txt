Feedforward Neural Networks for Caching: Enough or Too Much?

We propose a caching policy that uses a feedforward neural network (FNN) to predict content popularity. Our scheme outperforms popular eviction policies like LRU or ARC, but also a new policy relying on the more complex recurrent neural networks. At the same time, replacing the FNN predictor with a naive linear estimator does not degrade caching performance significantly, questioning then the role of neural networks for these applications.
