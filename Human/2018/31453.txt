Applying Distributional Compositional Categorical Models of Meaning to Language Translation

The aim of this paper is twofold: first we will use vector space distributional compositional categorical models of meaning to compare the meaning of sentences in Irish and in English (and thus ascertain when a sentence is the translation of another sentence) using the cosine similarity score. Then we shall outline a procedure which translates nouns by understanding their context, using a conceptual space model of cognition. We shall use metrics on the category ConvexRel to determine the distance between concepts (and determine when a noun is the translation of another noun). This paper will focus on applications to Irish, a member of the Gaelic family of languages.
