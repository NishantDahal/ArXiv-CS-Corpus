A Unified Form of EVENODD and RDP Codes and Their Efficient Decoding

Array codes have been widely employed in storage systems, such as Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID). The row-diagonal parity (RDP) codes and EVENODD codes are two popular double-parity array codes. As the capacity of hard disks increases, better fault tolerance by using array codes with three or more parity disks is needed. Although many extensions of RDP codes and EVENODD codes have been proposed, the high decoding complexity is the main drawback of them. In this paper, we present a new construction for all families of EVENODD codes and RDP codes, and propose a unified form of them. Under this unified form, RDP codes can be treated as shortened codes of EVENODD codes. Moreover, an efficient decoding algorithm based on an LU factorization of Vandermonde matrix is proposed when the number of continuous surviving parity columns is no less than the number of erased information columns. The new decoding algorithm is faster than the existing algorithms when more than three information columns fail. The proposed efficient decoding algorithm is also applicable to other Vandermonde array codes. Thus the proposed MDS array code is practically very meaningful for storage systems that need higher reliability.
