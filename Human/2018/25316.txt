Congestion Control for RTP Media: a Comparison on Simulated Environment

To develop low latency congestion control algorithm for real time taffic has been gained attention recently. RTP Media Congestion Avoidance Techniques (RMCAT) working group was initiated for standard defination. There are three algorithms under this group, Network Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) proposed by Cisco, Google Congestion Control (GCC) proposed by Google and Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation for Multimedia(SCReAM) proposed by Ericsson. This paper compares and analyses the performance of these algorithms on simulation environment. Results show GCC has well fairness property and performs well in lossy link but slow convergence in dynamic link, NADA stabilizes its rate quickly but suffers "late-comer" effect, SCReAM has the lowest queue occupation but also lower link capacity utilization.
