Five Driving Forces of Multi-Access Edge Computing

The emergence of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) technology aims at extending cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the wireless access networks. MEC provides real-time, high-bandwidth, low-latency access to radio network resources, allowing operators to open their networks to a new ecosystem and value chain. Moreover, it will provide a new insight to the design of future 5th Generation (5G) wireless systems. This paper describes five key technologies, including Network Function Vitalization (NFV), Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Slicing, Information Centric Networking (ICN) and Internet of Things (IoT), that intensify the widespread of MEC and its adoption. Our goal is to provide the associativity between MEC and these five driving technologies in 5G context while identifying the open challenges, future directions, and tangible integration paths.
