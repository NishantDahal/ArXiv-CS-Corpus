Inferring Causality in Agent-Based Simulations - Literature Review

Complex systems have interested researchers across a broad range of fields for many years and as computing has become more accesible and feasible, it is now possible to simulate aspects of these systems. A major point of research is how emergent behaviour arises and the underlying causes of it. This paper aims to discuss and compare different methods of identifying causal links between agents in such systems in order to gain further understanding of the structure.
