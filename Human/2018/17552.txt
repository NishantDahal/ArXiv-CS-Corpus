CSIndexbr: Exploring the Brazilian Scientific Production in Computer Science

CSIndexbr is a web-based system that provides meaningful,open,and transparent data about Brazilian scientific production in Computer Science. Currently, the system collects full research papers published in the main track of selected conferences. The papers are retrieved from DBLP. In this article, we describe the main features and resources provided by CSIndexbr. We also comment on how other researchers can use the data provided by the system to analyze the Brazilian production in Computer Science.
