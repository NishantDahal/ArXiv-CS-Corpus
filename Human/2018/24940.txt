Future Directions for Optimizing Compilers

As software becomes larger, programming languages become higher-level, and processors continue to fail to be clocked faster, we'll increasingly require compilers to reduce code bloat, eliminate abstraction penalties, and exploit interesting instruction sets. At the same time, compiler execution time must not increase too much and also compilers should never produce the wrong output. This paper examines the problem of making optimizing compilers faster, less buggy, and more capable of generating high-quality output.
