The ShareGrid Portal: an easy way to submit jobs on computational Grids

Grid computing is a distributed computing paradigm which aims to aggregate several heterogeneous and distributed resources, belonging to different and independent organizations, in a dynamic, transparent and coordinated way. Since its introduction, Grid computing has been successfully applied to solve several scientific challenging applications. Despite of the consolidation of many of its aspects, there are some issues that are still open. One of them is the transparency: in many real Grid systems, users still need to be aware of Grid computing, either for adapting their applications to this paradigm or for wrapping them in a suitable software framework. In this paper we present the ShareGrid Portal, a Web portal and a portal framework, built on top of the ShareGrid project infrastructure. Its intent is both to ease the execution of user applications in a Grid system and to allow developers to flexibly add new portal functionalities. In this work, we compare it with other well-known Grid portals and we show its user interface and its architecture. Finally we discuss user experiences and future extensions.
