Attention-based Neural Text Segmentation

Text segmentation plays an important role in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like summarization, context understanding, document indexing and document noise removal. Previous methods for this task require manual feature engineering, huge memory requirements and large execution times. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to present a novel supervised neural approach for text segmentation. Specifically, we propose an attention-based bidirectional LSTM model where sentence embeddings are learned using CNNs and the segments are predicted based on contextual information. This model can automatically handle variable sized context information. Compared to the existing competitive baselines, the proposed model shows a performance improvement of ~7% in WinDiff score on three benchmark datasets.
