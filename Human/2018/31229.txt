Fashion and Apparel Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

We present an empirical study of applying deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to the task of fashion and apparel image classification to improve meta-data enrichment of e-commerce applications. Five different CNN architectures were analyzed using clean and pre-trained models. The models were evaluated in three different tasks person detection, product and gender classification, on two small and large scale datasets.
