Densely Connected Convolutional Networks for Speech Recognition

This paper presents our latest investigation on Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets) for acoustic modelling (AM) in automatic speech recognition. DenseN-ets are very deep, compact convolutional neural networks, which have demonstrated incredible improvements over the state-of-the-art results on several data sets in computer vision. Our experimental results show that DenseNet can be used for AM significantly outperforming other neural-based models such as DNNs, CNNs, VGGs. Furthermore, results on Wall Street Journal revealed that with only a half of the training data DenseNet was able to outperform other models trained with the full data set by a large margin.
