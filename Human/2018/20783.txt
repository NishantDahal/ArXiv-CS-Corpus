Proceedings Combined 25th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and 15th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics

This volume contains the proceedings of the Combined 25th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and the 15th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2018), which was held on September 3, 2018, in Beijing, China, as an affiliated workshop of CONCUR 2018, the 29th International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency. Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive power. The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS. Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have organized an annual combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop on the expressiveness of mathematical models of computation and the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts.
