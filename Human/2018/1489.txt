Block Diagonalization Type Precoding Algorithms for IEEE 802.11ac Systems

Block diagonalization (BD) based precoding schemes are well-known linear transmit strategies employed in the downlink of multi-user multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO) systems. BD type precoding algorithms employed at the transmit side effect the suppression of multi-user interference (MUI) by the decomposition of MU-MIMO broadcast channel into multiple single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) channels followed by parallelization of the SU-MIMO channels to obtain independent streams of each user. Given that the design of linear precoding algorithms has made significant progress, the implementation of these techniques in standards for wireless local area networks (WLAN) remains an open question. In this work, schemes for implementation of BD based precoding techniques in the framework of IEEE 802.11ac standard are proposed followed by performance evaluation of these techniques in the proposed framework. I analyze the sum-rate and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the techniques in my framework and obtain computational complexity-wise as well as performance-wise optimal algorithm for my system.
