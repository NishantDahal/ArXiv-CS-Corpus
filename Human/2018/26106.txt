Aspects of Chaitin's Omega

The halting probability of a Turing machine,also known as Chaitin's Omega, is an algorithmically random number with many interesting properties. Since Chaitin's seminal work, many popular expositions have appeared, mainly focusing on the metamathematical or philosophical significance of Omega (or debating against it). At the same time, a rich mathematical theory exploring the properties of Chaitin's Omega has been brewing in various technical papers, which quietly reveals the significance of this number to many aspects of contemporary algorithmic information theory. The purpose of this survey is to expose these developments and tell a story about Omega, which outlines its multifaceted mathematical properties and roles in algorithmic randomness.
