False Positive Reduction by Actively Mining Negative Samples for Pulmonary Nodule Detection in Chest Radiographs

Generating large quantities of quality labeled data in medical imaging is very time consuming and expensive. The performance of supervised algorithms for various tasks on imaging has improved drastically over the years, however the availability of data to train these algorithms have become one of the main bottlenecks for implementation. To address this, we propose a semi-supervised learning method where pseudo-negative labels from unlabeled data are used to further refine the performance of a pulmonary nodule detection network in chest radiographs. After training with the proposed network, the false positive rate was reduced to 0.1266 from 0.4864 while maintaining sensitivity at 0.89.
