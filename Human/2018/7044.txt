Learning and Visualizing Localized Geometric Features Using 3D-CNN: An Application to Manufacturability Analysis of Drilled Holes

3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN) have been used for object recognition based on the voxelized shape of an object. However, interpreting the decision making process of these 3D-CNNs is still an infeasible task. In this paper, we present a unique 3D-CNN based Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping method (3D-GradCAM) for visual explanations of the distinct local geometric features of interest within an object. To enable efficient learning of 3D geometries, we augment the voxel data with surface normals of the object boundary. We then train a 3D-CNN with this augmented data and identify the local features critical for decision-making using 3D GradCAM. An application of this feature identification framework is to recognize difficult-to-manufacture drilled hole features in a complex CAD geometry. The framework can be extended to identify difficult-to-manufacture features at multiple spatial scales leading to a real-time design for manufacturability decision support system.
