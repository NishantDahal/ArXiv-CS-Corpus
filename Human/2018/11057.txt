Progressive Transient Photon Beams

In this work we introduce a novel algorithm for transient rendering in participating media. Our method is consistent, robust, and is able to generate animations of time-resolved light transport featuring complex caustic light paths in media. We base our method on the observation that the spatial continuity provides an increased coverage of the temporal domain, and generalize photon beams to transient-state. We extend the beam steady-state radiance estimates to include the temporal domain. Then, we develop a progressive version of spatio-temporal density estimations, that converges to the correct solution with finite memory requirements by iteratively averaging several realizations of independent renders with a progressively reduced kernel bandwidth. We derive the optimal convergence rates accounting for space and time kernels, and demonstrate our method against previous consistent transient rendering methods for participating media.
