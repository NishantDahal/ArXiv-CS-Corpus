Amortized Analysis of Asynchronous Price Dynamics

We extend a recently developed framework for analyzing asynchronous coordinate descent algorithms to show that an asynchronous version of tatonnement, a fundamental price dynamic widely studied in general equilibrium theory, converges toward a market equilibrium for Fisher markets with CES utilities or Leontief utilities, for which tatonnement is equivalent to coordinate descent.
