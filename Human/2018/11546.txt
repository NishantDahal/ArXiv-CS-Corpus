Safety of human-robot interaction through tactile sensors and peripersonal space representations

Human-robot collaboration including close physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is a current trend in industry and also science. The safety guidelines prescribe two modes of safety: (i) power and force limitation and (ii) speed and separation monitoring. We examine the potential of robots equipped with artificial sensitive skin and a protective safety zone around it (peripersonal space) to safe pHRI.
