Double circulant self-dual and LCD codes over Galois rings

This paper investigates the existence, enumeration and asymptotic performance of self-dual and LCD double circulant codes over Galois rings of characteristic $p^2$ and order $p^4$ with $p$ and odd prime. When $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4},$ we give an algorithm to construct a duality preserving bijective Gray map from such a Galois ring to $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2.$ Using random coding, we obtain families of asymptotically good self-dual and LCD codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2},$ for the metric induced by the standard $\mathbb{F}_p$-valued Gray maps.
