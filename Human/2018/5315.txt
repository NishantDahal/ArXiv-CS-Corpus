Studio Ousia's Quiz Bowl Question Answering System

In this chapter, we describe our question answering system, which was the winning system at the Human-Computer Question Answering (HCQA) Competition at the Thirty-first Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS). The competition requires participants to address a factoid question answering task referred to as quiz bowl. To address this task, we use two novel neural network models and combine these models with conventional information retrieval models using a supervised machine learning model. Our system achieved the best performance among the systems submitted in the competition and won a match against six top human quiz experts by a wide margin.
