Expressway visibility estimation based on image entropy and piecewise stationary time series analysis

Vision-based methods for visibility estimation can play a critical role in reducing traffic accidents caused by fog and haze. To overcome the disadvantages of current visibility estimation methods, we present a novel data-driven approach based on Gaussian image entropy and piecewise stationary time series analysis (SPEV). This is the first time that Gaussian image entropy is used for estimating atmospheric visibility. To lessen the impact of landscape and sunshine illuminance on visibility estimation, we used region of interest (ROI) analysis and took into account relative ratios of image entropy, to improve estimation accuracy. We assume fog and haze cause blurred images and that fog and haze can be considered as a piecewise stationary signal. We used piecewise stationary time series analysis to construct the piecewise causal relationship between image entropy and visibility. To obtain a real-world visibility measure during fog and haze, a subjective assessment was established through a study with 36 subjects who performed visibility observations. Finally, a total of two million videos were used for training the SPEV model and validate its effectiveness. The videos were collected from the constantly foggy and hazy Tongqi expressway in Jiangsu, China. The contrast model of visibility estimation was used for algorithm performance comparison, and the validation results of the SPEV model were encouraging as 99.14% of the relative errors were less than 10%.
