Extension Complexity of the Correlation Polytope

We prove that for every $n$-vertex graph $G$, the extension complexity of the correlation polytope of $G$ is $2^{O(\mathrm{tw}(G) + \log n)}$, where $\mathrm{tw}(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$. Our main result is that this bound is tight for graphs contained in minor-closed classes.
