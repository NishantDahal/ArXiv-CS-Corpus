Evidential community detection based on density peaks

Credal partitions in the framework of belief functions can give us a better understanding of the analyzed data set. In order to find credal community structure in graph data sets, in this paper, we propose a novel evidential community detection algorithm based on density peaks (EDPC). Two new metrics, the local density $ρ$ and the minimum dissimi-larity $δ$, are first defined for each node in the graph. Then the nodes with both higher $ρ$ and $δ$ values are identified as community centers. Finally, the remaing nodes are assigned with corresponding community labels through a simple two-step evidential label propagation strategy. The membership of each node is described in the form of basic belief assignments , which can well express the uncertainty included in the community structure of the graph. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world networks.
