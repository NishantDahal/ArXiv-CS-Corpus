Joint Optimization of Application Specific Routing in an Anycast Network

Recent developments in the field of Networking have provided opportunities for networks to efficiently cater application specific needs of a user. In this context, a routing path is not only dependent upon the network states but also is calculated in the best interest of an application using the network. These advanced routing algorithms can exploit application state data to enhance advanced network services such as anycast, edge cloud computing and cyber physical systems (CPS). In this work, we aim to design such a routing algorithm where the router decisions are based upon convex optimization techniques.
