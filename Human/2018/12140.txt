An Adaptive Population Size Differential Evolution with Novel Mutation Strategy for Constrained Optimization

Differential evolution (DE) has competitive performance on constrained optimization problems (COPs), which targets at searching for global optimal solution without violating the constraints. Generally, researchers pay more attention on avoiding violating the constraints than better objective function value. To achieve the aim of searching the feasible solutions accurately, an adaptive population size method and an adaptive mutation strategy are proposed in the paper. The adaptive population method is similar to a state switch which controls the exploring state and exploiting state according to the situation of feasible solution search. The novel mutation strategy is designed to enhance the effect of status switch based on adaptive population size, which is useful to reduce the constraint violations. Moreover, a mechanism based on multipopulation competition and a more precise method of constraint control are adopted in the proposed algorithm. The proposed differential evolution algorithm, APDE-NS, is evaluated on the benchmark problems from CEC2017 constrained real parameter optimization. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method is competitive compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
