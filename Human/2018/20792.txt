Linear complexity of generalized cyclotomic sequences of period $2p^{m}$

In this paper, we construct two generalized cyclotomic binary sequences of period $2p^{m}$ based on the generalized cyclotomy and compute their linear complexity, showing that they are of high linear complexity when $m\geq 2$.
