Smart buildings as Cyber-Physical Systems: Data-driven predictive control strategies for energy efficiency

Due to its significant contribution to global energy usage and the associated greenhouse gas emissions, existing building stock's energy efficiency must improve. Predictive building control promises to contribute to that by increasing the efficiency of building operations. Predictive control complements other means to increase performance such as refurbishments as well as modernizations of systems. This survey reviews recent works and contextualizes these with the current state of the art of interrelated topics in data handling, building automation, distributed control, and semantics. The comprehensive overview leads to seven research questions guiding future research directions.
