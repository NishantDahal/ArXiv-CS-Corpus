A Web-based Large-scale Timelapse Editor for Creating and Sharing Guided Video Tours and Interactive Slideshows

Scientists, journalists, and photographers have used advanced camera technology to capture extremely high-resolution timelapse and developed information visualization tools for data exploration and analysis. However, it takes a great deal of effort for professionals to form and tell stories after exploring data, since these tools usually provide little aids in creating visual elements. We present a web-based timelapse editor to support the creation of guided video tours and interactive slideshows from a collection of large-scale spatial and temporal images. Professionals can embed these two visual elements into web pages in conjunction with various forms of digital media to tell multimodal and interactive stories.
