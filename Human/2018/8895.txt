On linear codes and distinct weights

We provide a combinatorial construction for linear codes attaining the maximum possible number of distinct weights. We then introduce the related problem of determining the existence of linear codes with an arbitrary number of distinct non-zero weights, and we completely determine a solution in the binary case.
