Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Submatrix and Editing Problems : Classical Complexity \& Fixed-Parameter Tractable Results

A binary matrix $M$ has the consecutive ones property ($C1P$) for rows (resp. columns) if there is a permutation of its columns (resp. rows) that arranges the ones consecutively in all the rows (resp. columns). If $M$ has the $C1P$ for rows and columns, then $M$ is said to have the simultaneous consecutive ones property ($SC1P$). In this article, we consider the classical complexity and fixed-parameter tractability of $(a)$ Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Submatrix ($SC1S$) and $(b)$ Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Editing ($SC1E$) [Oswald et al., Theoretical Comp. Sci. 410(21-23):1986-1992, \hyperref[references]{2009}] problems. We show that the decision versions of $SC1S$ and $SC1E$ problems are NP-complete. We consider the parameterized versions of $SC1S$ and $SC1E$ problems with $d$, being the solution size, as the parameter. Given a binary matrix $M$ and a positive integer $d$, $d$-$SC1S$-$R$, $d$-$SC1S$-$C$, and $d$-$SC1S$-$RC$ problems decide whether there exists a set of rows, columns, and rows as well as columns, respectively, of size at most $d$, whose deletion results in a matrix with the $SC1P$. The $d$-$SC1P$-$0E$, $d$-$SC1P$-$1E$, and $d$-$SC1P$-$01E$ problems decide whether there exists a set of $0$-entries, $1$-entries, and $0$-entries as well as $1$-entries, respectively, of size at most $d$, whose flipping results in a matrix with the \vspace{0.095 in} $SC1P$.
