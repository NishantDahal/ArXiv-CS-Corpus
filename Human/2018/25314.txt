A Datamining Approach for Emotions Extraction and Discovering Cricketers performance from Stadium to Sensex

Microblogging sites are the direct platform for the users to express their views. It has been observed from previous studies that people are viable to flaunt their emotions for events (eg. natural catastrophes, sports, academics etc.), for persons (actor/actress, sports person, scientist) and for the places they visit. In this study we focused on a sport event, particularly the cricket tournament and collected the emotions of the fans for their favorite players using their tweets. Further, we acquired the stock market performance of the brands which are either endorsing the players or sponsoring the match in the tournament. It has been observed that performance of the player triggers the users to flourish their emotions over social media therefore, we observed correlation between players performance and fans' emotions. Therefore, we found the direct connection between player's performance with brand's behavior on stock market.
