QoS and Coverage Aware Dynamic High Density Vehicle Platooning (HDVP)

In a self-driving environment, vehicles communicate with each other to create a closely spaced multiple vehicle strings on a highway, i.e., high-density vehicle platooning (HDVP). In this paper, we address the Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) quality of service (QoS) and radio coverage issues for HDVP and propose a dynamic platooning mechanism taking into account the change of coverage condition, the road capacity, medium access control (MAC) and spectrum reuse while at the same time guaranteeing the stringent QoS requirements in terms of latency and reliability.
