Learning Sampling Policies for Domain Adaptation

We address the problem of semi-supervised domain adaptation of classification algorithms through deep Q-learning. The core idea is to consider the predictions of a source domain network on target domain data as noisy labels, and learn a policy to sample from this data so as to maximize classification accuracy on a small annotated reward partition of the target domain. Our experiments show that learned sampling policies construct labeled sets that improve accuracies of visual classifiers over baselines.
