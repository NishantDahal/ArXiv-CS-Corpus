Modified Self-Organized Task Allocation in a Group of Robots

This paper introduces a modified self-organized task allocation algorithm, where robots are assigned to pick up one of the two types of object. This paper also demonstrates both algorithms by showing the simulation results of the conventional self-organized task allocation algorithm and the simulation results of its modification.
