A Simple Scheme for Distributed Passive Load Balancing in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks

Efficient routing is one of the key challenges for next generation vehicular networks in order to provide fast and reliable communication in a smart city context. Various routing protocols have been proposed for determining optimal routing paths in highly dynamic topologies. However, it is the dilemma of those kinds of networks that good paths are used intensively, resulting in congestion and path quality degradation. In this paper, we adopt ideas from multipath routing and propose a simple decentral scheme for Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) routing, which handles passive load balancing without requiring additional communication effort. It can easily be applied to existing routing protocols to achieve load balancing without changing the routing process itself. In comprehensive simulation studies, we apply the proposed load balancing technique to multiple example protocols and evaluate its effects on the network performance. The results show that all considered protocols can achieve significantly higher reliability and improved Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) values by applying the proposed load balancing scheme.
