Human Emotional Facial Expression Recognition

An automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) model with Adaboost face detector, feature selection based on manifold learning and synergetic prototype based classifier has been proposed. Improved feature selection method and proposed classifier can achieve favorable effectiveness to performance FER in reasonable processing time.
