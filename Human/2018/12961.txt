Entropy rates for Horton self-similar trees

In this paper we examine planted binary plane trees. First, we provide an exact formula for the number of planted binary trees with given Horton-Strahler orders. Then, using the notion of entropy, we examine the structural complexity of random planted binary trees with N vertices. Finally, we quantify the complexity of the tree's structural properties as tree grows in size, by evaluating the entropy rate for planted binary plane trees with N vertices and for planted binary plane trees that satisfy Horton Law with Horton exponent R.
