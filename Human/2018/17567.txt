A Hybrid of Deep Audio Feature and i-vector for Artist Recognition

Artist recognition is a task of modeling the artist's musical style. This problem is challenging because there is no clear standard. We propose a hybrid method of the generative model i-vector and the discriminative model deep convolutional neural network. We show that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance by complementing each other. In addition, we briefly explain the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
