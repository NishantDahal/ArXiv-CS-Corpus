A Study of Deep Feature Fusion based Methods for Classifying Multi-lead ECG

An automatic classification method has been studied to effectively detect and recognize Electrocardiogram (ECG). Based on the synchronizing and orthogonal relationships of multiple leads, we propose a Multi-branch Convolution and Residual Network (MBCRNet) with three kinds of feature fusion methods for automatic detection of normal and abnormal ECG signals. Experiments are conducted on the Chinese Cardiovascular Disease Database (CCDD). Through 10-fold cross-validation, we achieve an average accuracy of 87.04% and a sensitivity of 89.93%, which outperforms previous methods under the same database. It is also shown that the multi-lead feature fusion network can improve the classification accuracy over the network only with the single lead features.
