Dense Scene Flow from Stereo Disparity and Optical Flow

Scene flow describes 3D motion in a 3D scene. It can either be modeled as a single task, or it can be reconstructed from the auxiliary tasks of stereo depth and optical flow estimation. While the second method can achieve real-time performance by using real-time auxiliary methods, it will typically produce non-dense results. In this representation of a basic combination approach for scene flow estimation, we will tackle the problem of non-density by interpolation.
