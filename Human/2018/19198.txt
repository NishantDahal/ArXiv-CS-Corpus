Approximate Convex Intersection Detection with Applications to Width and Minkowski Sums

Approximation problems involving a single convex body in $d$-dimensional space have received a great deal of attention in the computational geometry community. In contrast, works involving multiple convex bodies are generally limited to dimensions $d \leq 3$ and/or do not consider approximation. In this paper, we consider approximations to two natural problems involving multiple convex bodies: detecting whether two polytopes intersect and computing their Minkowski sum. Given an approximation parameter $\varepsilon > 0$, we show how to independently preprocess two polytopes $A,B$ into data structures of size $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ such that we can answer in polylogarithmic time whether $A$ and $B$ intersect approximately. More generally, we can answer this for the images of $A$ and $B$ under affine transformations. Next, we show how to $\varepsilon$-approximate the Minkowski sum of two given polytopes defined as the intersection of $n$ halfspaces in $O(n \log(1/\varepsilon) + 1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + α})$ time, for any constant $α> 0$. Finally, we present a surprising impact of these results to a well studied problem that considers a single convex body. We show how to $\varepsilon$-approximate the width of a set of $n$ points in $O(n \log(1/\varepsilon) + 1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + α})$ time, for any constant $α> 0$, a major improvement over the previous bound of roughly $O(n + 1/\varepsilon^{d-1})$ time.
