Bandits with Side Observations: Bounded vs. Logarithmic Regret

We consider the classical stochastic multi-armed bandit but where, from time to time and roughly with frequency $ε$, an extra observation is gathered by the agent for free. We prove that, no matter how small $ε$ is the agent can ensure a regret uniformly bounded in time.
  More precisely, we construct an algorithm with a regret smaller than $\sum_i \frac{\log(1/ε)}{Δ_i}$, up to multiplicative constant and loglog terms. We also prove a matching lower-bound, stating that no reasonable algorithm can outperform this quantity.
