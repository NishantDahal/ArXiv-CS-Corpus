Dual Convolutional Neural Network for Graph of Graphs Link Prediction

Graphs are general and powerful data representations which can model complex real-world phenomena, ranging from chemical compounds to social networks; however, effective feature extraction from graphs is not a trivial task, and much work has been done in the field of machine learning and data mining. The recent advances in graph neural networks have made automatic and flexible feature extraction from graphs possible and have improved the predictive performance significantly. In this paper, we go further with this line of research and address a more general problem of learning with a graph of graphs (GoG) consisting of an external graph and internal graphs, where each node in the external graph has an internal graph structure. We propose a dual convolutional neural network that extracts node representations by combining the external and internal graph structures in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on link prediction tasks using several chemical network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
