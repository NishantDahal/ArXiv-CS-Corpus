YASENN: Explaining Neural Networks via Partitioning Activation Sequences

We introduce a novel approach to feed-forward neural network interpretation based on partitioning the space of sequences of neuron activations. In line with this approach, we propose a model-specific interpretation method, called YASENN. Our method inherits many advantages of model-agnostic distillation, such as an ability to focus on the particular input region and to express an explanation in terms of features different from those observed by a neural network. Moreover, examination of distillation error makes the method applicable to the problems with low tolerance to interpretation mistakes. Technically, YASENN distills the network with an ensemble of layer-wise gradient boosting decision trees and encodes the sequences of neuron activations with leaf indices. The finite number of unique codes induces a partitioning of the input space. Each partition may be described in a variety of ways, including examination of an interpretable model (e.g. a logistic regression or a decision tree) trained to discriminate between objects of those partitions. Our experiments provide an intuition behind the method and demonstrate revealed artifacts in neural network decision making.
