Latent Space Representation for Shape Analysis and Learning

We propose a novel shape representation useful for analyzing and processing shape collections, as well for a variety of learning and inference tasks. Unlike most approaches that capture variability in a collection by using a template model or a base shape, we show that it is possible to construct a full shape representation by using the latent space induced by a functional map net- work, allowing us to represent shapes in the context of a collection without the bias induced by selecting a template shape. Key to our construction is a novel analysis of latent functional spaces, which shows that after proper regularization they can be endowed with a natural geometric structure, giving rise to a well-defined, stable and fully informative shape representation. We demonstrate the utility of our representation in shape analysis tasks, such as highlighting the most distorted shape parts in a collection or separating variability modes between shape classes. We further exploit our representation in learning applications by showing how it can naturally be used within deep learning and convolutional neural networks for shape classi cation or reconstruction, signi cantly outperforming existing point-based techniques.
