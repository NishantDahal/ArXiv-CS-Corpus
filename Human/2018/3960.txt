D2.1 Models for energy consumption of data structures and algorithms

This deliverable reports our early energy models for data structures and algorithms based on both micro-benchmarks and concurrent algorithms. It reports the early results of Task 2.1 on investigating and modeling the trade-off between energy and performance in concurrent data structures and algorithms, which forms the basis for the whole work package 2 (WP2). The work has been conducted on the two main EXCESS platforms: (1) Intel platform with recent Intel multi-core CPUs and (2) Movidius embedded platform.
