Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications in 5G Downlink: Physical Layer Aspects

Ultra reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) is a new service category in 5G to accommodate emerging services and applications having stringent latency and reliability requirements. In order to support URLLC, there should be both evolutionary and revolutionary changes in the air interface named 5G new radio (NR). In this article, we provide an up-to-date overview of URLLC with an emphasis on the physical layer challenges and solutions in 5G NR downlink. We highlight key requirements of URLLC and then elaborate the physical layer issues and enabling technologies including packet and frame structure, scheduling schemes, and reliability improvement techniques, which have been discussed in the 3GPP Release 15 standardization.
