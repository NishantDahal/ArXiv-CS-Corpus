Distributed Event Localization via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers

This paper addresses the problem of distributed event localization using noisy range measurements with respect to sensors with known positions. Event localization is fundamental in many wireless sensor network applications such as homeland security, law enforcement, and environmental studies. However, most existing distributed algorithms require the target event to be within the convex hull of the deployed sensors. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we propose two scalable distributed algorithms named GS-ADMM and J-ADMM which do not require the target event to be within the convex hull of the deployed sensors. More specifically, the two algorithms can be implemented in a scenario in which the entire sensor network is divided into several clusters with cluster heads collecting measurements within each cluster and exchanging intermediate computation information to achieve localization consistency (consensus) across all clusters. This scenario is important in many applications such as homeland security and law enforcement. Simulation results confirm effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
