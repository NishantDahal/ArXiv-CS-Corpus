Annotation based automatic action processing

With a strong motivational background in search engine optimization the amount of structured data on the web is growing rapidly. The main search engine providers are promising great increase in visibility through annotation of the web page's content with the vocabulary of schema.org and thus providing it as structured data. But besides the usage by search engines the data can be used in various other ways, for example for automatic processing of annotated web services or actions. In this work we present an approach to consume and process schema.org annotated data on the web and give an idea how a best practice can look like.
