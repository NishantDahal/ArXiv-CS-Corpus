Bias Disparity in Recommendation Systems

Recommender systems have been applied successfully in a number of different domains, such as, entertainment, commerce, and employment. Their success lies in their ability to exploit the collective behavior of users in order to deliver highly targeted, personalized recommendations. Given that recommenders learn from user preferences, they incorporate different biases that users exhibit in the input data. More importantly, there are cases where recommenders may amplify such biases, leading to the phenomenon of bias disparity. In this short paper, we present a preliminary experimental study on synthetic data, where we investigate different conditions under which a recommender exhibits bias disparity, and the long-term effect of recommendations on data bias. We also consider a simple re-ranking algorithm for reducing bias disparity, and present some observations for data disparity on real data.
