Intelligent Physiotherapy Through Procedural Content Generation

This paper describes an avenue for artificial and computational intelligence techniques applied within games research to be deployed for purposes of physical therapy. We provide an overview of prototypical research focussed on the application of motion sensor input devices and virtual reality equipment for rehabilitation of motor impairment an issue typical of patient's of traumatic brain injuries. We highlight how advances in procedural content generation and player modelling can stimulate development in this area by improving quality of rehabilitation programmes and measuring patient performance.
