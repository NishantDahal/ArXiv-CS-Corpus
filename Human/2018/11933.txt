Iterative Bounded Distance Decoding of Product Codes with Scaled Reliability

We propose a modified iterative bounded distance decoding of product codes. The proposed algorithm is based on exchanging hard messages iteratively and exploiting channel reliabilities to make hard decisions at each iteration. Performance improvements up to 0.26 dB are achieved.
