Millimeter Wave Location-Based Beamforming using Compressive Sensing

This paper develops a location based analog beamforming (BF) technique using compressive sensing (CS) to be feasible for millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless communication systems. The proposed scheme is based on exploiting the benefits of CS and localization to reduce mmWave beamforming (BF) complexity and enhance its performance compared with conventional mmWave analog BF techniques. CS theory is used to exploit the sparse nature of the mmWave propagation channel to estimate both the angle of departures (AoDs) and the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the mmWave channel, and knowing the node location effectively reduces the number of BF vectors required for constructing the sensing matrix. Hence, a high accurate mmWave BF with a low set-up time can be obtained. Simulation analysis confirms the high effectiveness of the proposed mmWave BF technique compared to the conventional exhaustive search BF and the CS based BF without localization using random measurements
