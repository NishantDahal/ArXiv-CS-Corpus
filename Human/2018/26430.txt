Prosodic entrainment in dialog acts

We examined prosodic entrainment in spoken dialogs separately for several dialog acts in cooperative and competitive games. Entrainment was measured for intonation features derived from a superpositional intonation stylization as well as for rhythm features. The found differences can be related to the cooperative or competitive nature of the game, as well as to dialog act properties as its intrinsic authority, supportiveness and distributional characteristics. In cooperative games dialog acts with a high authority given by knowledge and with a high frequency showed the most entrainment. The results are discussed amongst others with respect to the degree of active entrainment control in cooperative behavior.
