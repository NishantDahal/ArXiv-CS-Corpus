Energy Harvesting Fairness in AN-aided Secure MU-MIMO SWIPT Systems with Cooperative Jammer

In this paper, we study a multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output secrecy simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) channel which consists of one transmitter, one cooperative jammer (CJ), multiple energy receivers (potential eavesdroppers, ERs), and multiple co-located receivers (CRs). We exploit the dual of artificial noise (AN) generation for facilitating efficient wireless energy transfer and secure transmission. Our aim is to maximize the minimum harvested energy among ERs and CRs subject to secrecy rate constraints for each CR and total transmit power constraint. By incorporating norm-bounded channel uncertainty model, we propose a iterative algorithm based on sequential parametric convex approximation to find a near-optimal solution. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms that of the conventional AN-aided scheme and CJ-aided scheme.
