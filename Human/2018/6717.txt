A Simple Method to improve Initialization Robustness for Active Contours driven by Local Region Fitting Energy

Active contour models based on local region fitting energy can segment images with intensity inhomogeneity effectively, but their segmentation results are easy to error if the initial contour is inappropriate. In this paper, we present a simple and universal method of improving the robustness of initial contour for these local fitting-based models. The core idea of proposed method is exchanging the fitting values on the two sides of contour, so that the fitting values inside the contour are always larger (or smaller) than the values outside the contour in the process of curve evolution. In this way, the whole curve will evolve along the inner (or outer) boundaries of object, and less likely to be stuck in the object or background. Experimental results have proved that using the proposed method can enhance the robustness of initial contour and meanwhile keep the original advantages in the local fitting-based models.
