Analysis of Political Party Twitter Accounts' Retweeters During Japan's 2017 Election

In modern election campaigns, political parties utilize social media to advertise their policies and candidates and to communicate to the electorate. In Japan's latest general election in 2017, the 48th general election for the Lower House, social media, especially Twitter, was actively used. In this paper, we analyze the users who retweeted tweets of political parties on Twitter during the election. Our aim is to clarify what kinds of users are diffusing (retweeting) tweets of political parties. The results indicate that the characteristics of retweeters of the largest ruling party (Liberal Democratic Party of Japan) and the largest opposition party (The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan) were similar, even though the retweeters did not overlap each other. We also found that a particular opposition party (Japanese Communist Party) had quite different characteristics from other political parties.
