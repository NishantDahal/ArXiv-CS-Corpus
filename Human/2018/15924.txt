Synthesis methods for reversible circuits consisting of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates (Ph.D. thesis)

In this paper, reversible circuits consisting of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates are studied. Several asymptotically optimal by the order of magnitude synthesis methods are described. Some circuit's complexity reduction approaches are considered. Implementation of discrete logarithm within a reversible circuit is discussed. The main conclusion in the paper is that the usage of additional inputs (additional memory) in reversible circuits almost always allow to reduce their complexity, depth and weight.
