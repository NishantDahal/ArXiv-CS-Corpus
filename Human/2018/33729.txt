User Authorization in a System with a Role-Based Access Control on the Basis of the Analytic Hierarchy Process

The problem of optimal authorization of a user in a system with a role-based access control policy is considered. The main criterion is to minimize the risks of permission leakage. The choice of the role for authorization is based on the analytic hierarchy process. The substantiation of a choice of criteria for formation of a hierarchy of the first level is given. An algorithm for calculating weight coefficients is presented, based on the quantitative characteristics of the role graph and not dependent on subjective expert evaluations. The complexity is estimated and the scalability of the proposed algorithm is discussed.
