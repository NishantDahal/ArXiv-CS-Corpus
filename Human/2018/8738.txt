Hybrid RF/VLC Systems under QoS Constraints

The coexistence of radio frequency (RF) and visible light communications (VLC) in typical indoor environments can be leveraged to support vast user quality-of-service (QoS) needs. In this paper, we target a hybrid RF/VLC network in which data transmission is provided via either an RF access point or a VLC luminary based on a selection process. We employ the concept of effective capacity, which defines the maximum constant arrival data rate at the transmitter buffer when the QoS needs are imposed as limits on the buffer overflow and delay violation probabilities, as the main selection criteria. We initially formulate the effective capacity of both channels with respect to channel gains and user distribution. Under the assumption of uniform user distribution within the VLC cell, we then provide a closed-form approximation for the effective capacity of the VLC channel. We further investigate the effects of illumination needs and line-of-sight blockage on the VLC performance. In addition, we explore the non-asymptotic bounds regarding the buffering delay by capitalizing on the effective capacity. Through simulation results, we show the impacts of different physical aspects and data-link QoS needs on the effective capacity and delay bounds.
