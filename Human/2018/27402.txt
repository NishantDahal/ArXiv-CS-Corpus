A Mobile Ad hoc Cloud Computing and Networking Infrastructure for Automated Video Surveillance System

Mobile automated video surveillance system involves application of real-time image and video processing algorithms which require a vast quantity of computing and storage resources. To support the execution of mobile automated video surveillance system, a mobile ad hoc cloud computing and networking infrastructure is proposed in which multiple mobile devices interconnected through a mobile ad hoc network are combined to create a virtual supercomputing node. An energy efficient resource allocation scheme has also been proposed for allocation of realtime automated video surveillance tasks. To enable communication between mobile devices, a Wi-Fi Direct based mobile ad hoc cloud networking infrastructure has been developed. More specifically, a routing layer has been developed to support communication between Wi-Fi Direct devices in a group and multi-hop communication between devices across the group. The proposed system has been implemented on a group of Wi-Fi Direct-enabled Samsung mobile devices.
