Dynamic Ordered Weighted Averaging Functions for Complete Lattices

In this paper we introduce a class of operators on complete lattices called Dynamic Ordered Weighted Averaging (DYOWA) functions. These functions provide a generalized form of an important class of aggregation functions: The Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) functions, whose applications can be found in several areas like: Image Processing and Decision Making. The wide range of applications of OWAs motivated many researchers to study their variations. One of them was proposed by Lizassoaim and Moreno in 2013, which extends those functions to complete lattices. Here, we propose a new generalization of OWAs that also generalizes the operators proposed by Lizassoaim and Moreno.
