Using NLP on news headlines to predict index trends

This paper attempts to provide a state of the art in trend prediction using news headlines. We present the research done on predicting DJIA trends using Natural Language Processing. We will explain the different algorithms we have used as well as the various embedding techniques attempted. We rely on statistical and deep learning models in order to extract information from the corpuses.
