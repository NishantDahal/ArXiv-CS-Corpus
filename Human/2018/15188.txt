Next generation portal for federated testbeds MySlice v2: from prototype to production

A number of projects in computer science around the world have contributed to build federated experimental facilities providing access to a large set of distributed compute, storage and network resources for the research community. Several tools have been developed to provide users an easy access to the federated testbeds. This paper presents the architecture of the new version of the MySlice web portal, that has evolved from a prototype to a production ready software.
