Gender differences in research productivity: a bibliometric analysis of the Italian academic system

The literature dedicated to analysis of the difference in research productivity between the sexes tends to agree in indicating better performance for men. This study enters in the vein of work on the subject. Through bibliometric examination of the entire population of research personnel working in the scientific-technological disciplines of Italian university system, it confirms the presence of significant differences in productivity between men and women. But such differences result as being smaller than reported in a large part of the literature, confirming an ongoing tendency towards decline, and are also seen as more noticeable for quantitative performance indicators than other indicators. The gap between the sexes presents important sectorial specificities. In spite of the generally better performance of men, it can not be ignored that there are a significant number of scientific sectors in which the performance of women does not result as inferior.
