Successive Wyner-Ziv Coding for the Binary CEO Problem under Log-Loss

An $l$-link binary CEO problem is considered in this paper. We present a practical encoding and decoding scheme for this problem employing the graph-based codes. A successive coding scheme is proposed for converting an $l$-link binary CEO problem to the $(2l-1)$ single binary Wyner-Ziv (WZ) problems. By using the compound LDGM-LDPC codes, the theoretical bound of each binary WZ is asymptotically achievable. Our proposed decoder successively decodes the received data by employing the well-known Sum-Product (SP) algorithm and leverages them to reconstruct the source. The sum-rate distortion performance of our proposed coding scheme is compared with the theoretical bounds under the logarithmic loss (log-loss) criterion.
