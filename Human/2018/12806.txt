Transmit Precoding and Receive Power Splitting for Harvested Power Maximization in MIMO SWIPT Systems

We consider the problem of maximizing the harvested power in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) systems with power splitting reception. Different from recently proposed designs, with our optimization problem formulation we target for the jointly optimal transmit precoding and receive uniform power splitting (UPS) ratio maximizing the harvested power, while ensuring that the quality-of-service requirement of the MIMO link is satisfied. We assume practical Radio-Frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) receive operation that results in a non-convex optimization problem for the design parameters, which we first formulate in an equivalent generalized convex problem that we then solve optimally. We also derive the globally optimal transmit precoding design for ideal reception. Furthermore, we present analytical bounds for the key variables of both considered problems along with tight high signal-to-noise ratio approximations for their optimal solutions. Two algorithms for the efficient computation of the globally optimal designs are outlined. The first requires solving a small number of non-linear equations, while the second is based on a two-dimensional search having linear complexity. Computer simulation results are presented validating the proposed analysis, providing key insights on various system parameters, and investigating the achievable EH gains over benchmark schemes.
