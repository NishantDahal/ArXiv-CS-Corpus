Decentralized Multi-Antenna Coded Caching with Cyclic Exchanges

This paper considers a single cell multi-antenna base station delivering content to multiple cache enabled single-antenna users. Coding strategies are developed that allow for decentralized placement in the wireless setting. Three different cases namely, max-min multicasting, linear combinations in the complex field, and linear combinations in the finite field, are considered and closed-form rate expressions are provided that hold with high probability. For the case of max-min fair multicasting delivery, we propose a new coding scheme that is capable of working with only two-user broadcasts. A cyclic-exchange protocol for efficient content delivery is proposed and shown to perform almost as well as the original multi-user broadcast scheme.
