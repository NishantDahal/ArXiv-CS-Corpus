Security Analysis of Big Data on Internet of Things

The volume of data exchange in this network is ascending, by expansing of internet of things and its increasing familiarity in recent years. By increasing of requests for joining to the network and taking advantage of its services, necessity to maintain the privacy and security is felt more than ever and the whole thing has changed into a challenge. Keeping the security of the users in small networks seems to be simpler and the threats more predictable. As the users of the network which are sensors, the volume of data increases as well. As a result the routers of the network and network servers has become a seriously challenging task to control and maintain the security for this volume of data. We analyze these challenges in this paper. This paper aims to maintain the security of the users and present procedures to dominate the problems and express the strategies to overcome them. Some methods such as using both encryption function and secure protocol are proposed. Other method to overcome over big data challenges is smart design of communication protocol. Finally, we point out some future challenges of big-data on the internet of thing network.
