Scalable Formal Concept Analysis algorithm for large datasets using Spark

In the process of knowledge discovery and representation in large datasets using formal concept analysis, complexity plays a major role in identifying all the formal concepts and constructing the concept lattice(digraph of the concepts). For identifying the formal concepts and constructing the digraph from the identified concepts in very large datasets, various distributed algorithms are available in the literature. However, the existing distributed algorithms are not very well suitable for concept generation because it is an iterative process. The existing algorithms are implemented using distributed frameworks like MapReduce and Open MP, these frameworks are not appropriate for iterative applications. Hence, in this paper we proposed efficient distributed algorithms for both formal concept generation and concept lattice digraph construction in large formal contexts using Apache Spark. Various performance metrics are considered for the evaluation of the proposed work, the results of the evaluation proves that the proposed algorithms are efficient for concept generation and lattice graph construction in comparison with the existing algorithms.
