X-Lap: A Systems Approach for Cross-Layer Profiling and Latency Analysis for Cyber-Physical Networks

Networked control applications for cyber-physical networks demand predictable and reliable real-time communication. Applications of this domain have to cooperate with network protocols, the operating system, and the hardware to improve safety properties and increase resource efficiency. In consequence, a cross-layer approach is necessary for the design and holistic optimisation of cyber-physical systems and networks. This paper presents X-Lap, a cross-layer, inter-host timing analysis tool tailored to the needs of real-time communication. We use X-Lap to evaluate the timing behaviour of a reliable real-time communication protocol. Our analysis identifies parts of the protocol which are responsible for unwanted jitter. To system designers, X-Lap provides useful support for the design and evaluation of networked real-time systems.
