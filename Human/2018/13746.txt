The second generalized Hamming weight of some evaluation codes arising from a projective torus

In this paper we find the second generalized Hamming weight of some evaluation codes arising from a projective torus, and it allows to compute the second generalized Hamming weight of the codes parameterized by the edges of any complete bipartite graph. Also, at the beginning, we obtain some results about the generalized Hamming weights of some evaluation codes arising from a complete intersection when the minimum distance is known and they are non--degenerate codes. Finally we give an example where we use these results to determine the complete weight hierarchy of some codes.
