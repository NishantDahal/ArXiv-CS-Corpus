Concept-Oriented Deep Learning: Generative Concept Representations

Generative concept representations have three major advantages over discriminative ones: they can represent uncertainty, they support integration of learning and reasoning, and they are good for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We discuss probabilistic and generative deep learning, which generative concept representations are based on, and the use of variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for learning generative concept representations, particularly for concepts whose data are sequences, structured data or graphs.
