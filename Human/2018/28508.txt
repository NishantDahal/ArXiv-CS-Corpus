Graph Isomorphism by Conversion to Chordal (6, 3) Graphs

Babel has shown that for an extended class of chordal (6, 3) graphs the coarsest regular simplicial partition is equivalent to the graph's automorphism partition. We give a reversible transformation for any graph to one of these graph by using Booth's reduction of a graph to a chordal graph and elimination of Babel's forbidden subgraphs for these graphs by adding edges to them.
