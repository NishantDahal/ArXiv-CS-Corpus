Spatial Filtering for Brain Computer Interfaces: A Comparison between the Common Spatial Pattern and Its Variant

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most popular form of input for brain computer interfaces (BCIs). However, it can be easily contaminated by various artifacts and noise, e.g., eye blink, muscle activities, powerline noise, etc. Therefore, the EEG signals are often filtered both spatially and temporally to increase the signal-to-noise ratio before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm for recognition. This paper considers spatial filtering, particularly, the common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG classification. In binary classification, CSP seeks a set of filters to maximize the variance for one class while minimizing it for the other. We first introduce the traditional solution, and then a new solution based on a slightly different objective function. We performed comprehensive experiments on motor imagery to compare the two approaches, and found that generally the traditional CSP solution still gives better results. We also showed that adding regularization to the covariance matrices can improve the final classification performance, no matter which objective function is used.
