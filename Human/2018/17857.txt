Dev-for-Operations and Multi-sided Platform for Next Generation Platform as a Service

This paper presents two new challenges for the Telco ecosystem transformation in the era of cloud-native microservice-based architectures. (1) Development-for-Operations (Dev-for-Operations) impacts not only the overall workflow for deploying a Platform as a Service (PaaS) in an open foundry environment, but also the Telco business as well as operational models to achieve an economy of scope and an economy of scale. (2) For that purpose, we construct an integrative platform business model in the form of a Multi-Sided Platform (MSP) for building Telco PaaSes. The proposed MSP based architecture enables a multi-organizational ecosystem with increased automation possibilities for Telco-grade service creation and operation. The paper describes how the Dev-for-Operations and MSP lift constraints and offers an effective way for next-generation PaaS building, while mutually reinforcing each other in the Next Generation Platform as a Service (NGPaaS) framework.
