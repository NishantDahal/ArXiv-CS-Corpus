XJTLUIndoorLoc: A New Fingerprinting Database for Indoor Localization and Trajectory Estimation Based on Wi-Fi RSS and Geomagnetic Field

In this paper, we present a new location fingerprinting database comprised of Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) and geomagnetic field intensity measured with multiple devices at a multi-floor building in Xi'an Jiatong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China. We also provide preliminary results of localization and trajectory estimation based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network with this database. For localization, we map RSS data for a reference point to an image-like, two-dimensional array and then apply CNN which is popular in image and video analysis and recognition. For trajectory estimation, we use a modified random way point model to efficiently generate continuous step traces imitating human walking and train a stacked two-layer LSTM network with the generated data to remember the changing pattern of geomagnetic field intensity against (x,y) coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our new database and the feasibility of the CNN and LSTM-based localization and trajectory estimation with the database.
