Transmission Capacity of Full-Duplex MIMO Ad-Hoc Network with Limited Self-Interference Cancellation

In this paper, we propose a joint transceiver beamforming design to simultaneously mitigate self-interference (SI) and partial inter-node interference for full-duplex multiple-input and multiple-output ad-hoc network, and then derive the transmission capacity upper bound (TC-UB) for the corresponding network. Condition on a specified transceiver antenna's configuration, we allow the SI effect to be cancelled at transmitter side, and offer an additional degree-of-freedom at receiver side for more inter-node interference cancellation. In addition, due to the proposed beamforming design and imperfect SI channel estimation, the conventional method to obtain the TC-UB is not applicable. This motivates us to exploit the dominating interferer region plus Newton-Raphson method to iteratively formulate the TC-UB. The results show that the derived TC-UB is quite close to the actual one especially when the number of receive-antenna is small. Moreover, our proposed beamforming design outperforms the existing beamforming strategies, and FD mode works better than HD mode in low signal-to-noise ratio region.
