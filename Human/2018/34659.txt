Uplinks Analysis and Optimization of Hybrid Vehicular Networks

5G vehicular communication is one of key enablers in next generation intelligent transportation system (ITS), that require ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC). To meet this requirement, a new hybrid vehicular network structure which supports both centralized network structure and distributed structure is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed network structure, a new vehicular network utility model considering the latency and reliability in vehicular networks is developed based on Euclidean norm theory. Building on the Pareto improvement theory in economics, a vehicular network uplink optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the uplink utility of vehicles on the roads. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the uplink vehicular network utility in vehicular networks to meet the URLLC requirements.
