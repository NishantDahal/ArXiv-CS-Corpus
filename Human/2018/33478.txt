The iEnvironment Platform: Developing an Open Science Software Platform for Integrated Environmental Monitoring and Modeling of Surface Water

This paper describes the development of iEnvironment, an open science software platform that supports monitoring and modeling of aspects of surface water. The platform supports science and engineering research, especially in the context of the creation, sharing, analysis and maintenance of big and open data. In this era of big data, iEnvironment facilitates access to open data resources and research collaboration among science and research disciplines supported by computer scientists and software developers.
