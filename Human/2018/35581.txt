Stability of Scattering Decoder For Nonlinear Diffractive Imaging

The problem of image reconstruction under multiple light scattering is usually formulated as a regularized non-convex optimization. A deep learning architecture, Scattering Decoder (ScaDec), was recently proposed to solve this problem in a purely data-driven fashion. The proposed method was shown to substantially outperform optimization-based baselines and achieve state-of-the-art results. In this paper, we thoroughly test the robustness of ScaDec to different permittivity contrasts, number of transmissions, and input signal-to-noise ratios. The results on high-fidelity simulated datasets show that the performance of ScaDec is stable in different settings.
