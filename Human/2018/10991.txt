Impact of Cooperation in Flow-Induced Diffusive Mobile Molecular Communication

Motivated by the numerous healthcare applications of molecular communication (MC) inside blood vessels, this work considers relay/cooperative nanomachine (CN)-assisted mobile MC between a source nanomachine (SN) and a destination nanomachine (DN) where each nanomachine is mobile in a flow-induced diffusive channel. Using the first hitting time model, the impact of an intermediate CN on the performance of the CN-assisted diffusive mobile MC system with fully absorbing receivers is analyzed in the presence of inter-symbol interference, multi-source interference, and counting errors. For this purpose, the likelihood ratio test based optimal symbol detection scheme is obtained at the DN considering the non-ideal nature of CN, i.e., CN can be in error with a finite probability. Further, to characterize the system performance, closed-form expressions for the end-to-end probabilities of detection and false alarm at the DN are derived between the SN-DN pair incorporating the detection performance of the intermediate CN. In addition, the channel capacity expression is also derived for the aforementioned scenario. Simulation results are presented to corroborate the theoretical results derived and also, to yield insights into system performance.
