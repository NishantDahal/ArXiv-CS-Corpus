Impulse Response of the Channel with a Spherical Absorbing Receiver and a Spherical Reflecting Boundary

In this letter, we derive the impulse response of the channel with a spherical absorbing receiver, a spherical reflecting boundary, and a point transmitter in molecular communication domain. By exploring the channel characteristics and drawing comparisons with the unbounded case, we show the consequences of having the boundary on channel properties such as peak time, peak amplitude, and total fraction of molecules to hit the receiver. Finally, we calculate the bit error rate for both bounded and unbounded channels and emphasize the significance of incorporating the boundary on understanding the realistic behavior of a channel.
