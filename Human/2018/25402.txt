Eye movement velocity and gaze data generator for evaluation, robustness testing and assess of eye tracking software and visualization tools

Eye movements hold information about human perception, intention, and cognitive state. We propose a novel eye movement simulator that i) probabilistically simulates saccade movements as gamma distributions considering different peak velocities and ii) models smooth pursuit onsets with the sigmoid function. Additionally, it is capable of producing velocity and two-dimensional gaze sequences for static and dynamic scenes using saliency maps or real fixation targets. Our approach is also capable of simulating any sampling rate, even with uctuations. The simulation is evaluated against publicly available annotated data. The simulator can be used in EyeTrace or downloaded at http://ti.unituebingen. de/Projekte.1801.0.html.
