Activity Self-Tracking with Smart Phones: How to Approach Odd Measurements?

Tracking physical activity reliably is becoming central to many research efforts. In the last years specialized hardware has been proposed to measure movement. However, asking study participants to carry additional devices has drawbacks. We focus on using mobile devices as motion sensors. In the paper we detail several issues that we found while using this technique in a longitudinal study involving hundreds of participants for several months. We hope to sparkle a lively discussion at the workshop and attract interest in this method from other researchers.
