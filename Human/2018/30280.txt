Uma técnica para a quantificação do esforço de merge

Developers that use version control systems can work in parallel with other developers and merge their versions afterwards. Sometimes these merges fail, demanding manual intervention to resolve conflicts. Some studies aim at analyzing the merges failures, however, there is a lack of tool support in the literature to measure the merge effort, jeopardizing such kind of analyses. In this article, we propose a technique and its companion tool for analyzing Git repositories and providing metrics related to the merge effort. We evaluated our tool over five projects, showing that rework and wasted work happens in, approximately, 10% to 30% of the projects. Moreover, the average of actions of these efforts is almost the same.
