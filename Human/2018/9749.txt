Dynamic Competition Networks: detecting alliances and leaders

We consider social networks of competing agents that evolve dynamically over time. Such dynamic competition networks are directed, where a directed edge from nodes $u$ to $v$ corresponds a negative social interaction. We present a novel hypothesis that serves as a predictive tool to uncover alliances and leaders within dynamic competition networks. Our focus is in the present study is to validate it on competitive networks arising from social game shows such as Survivor and Big Brother.
