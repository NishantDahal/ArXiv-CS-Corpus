Co Hijacking Monitor: Collaborative Detecting and Locating Mechanism for HTTP Spectral Hijacking

With the rapid growth of mobile internet, mobile application, like website navigation, searching, e-Shopping and app download, etc. are all popular in worldwide. Meanwhile, it become more and more popular that traditional HTTP protocol, which is also applying in not only web browsing but also communication between mobile application clients and servers. Besides, it has made HTTP Hijacking profitable. Furthermore, it has brought a lot of troubles for users, network operators and ISP. We analyze the principle of HTTP spectral Hijacking and present a mechanism of collaboratively detecting and locating called Co HijackingMonitor. Experimental result shows that, Co HijackingMonitor can solve the hijacking problem effectively.
