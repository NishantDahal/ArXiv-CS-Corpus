Creative Invention Benchmark

In this paper we present the Creative Invention Benchmark (CrIB), a 2000-problem benchmark for evaluating a particular facet of computational creativity. Specifically, we address combinational p-creativity, the creativity at play when someone combines existing knowledge to achieve a solution novel to that individual. We present generation strategies for the five problem categories of the benchmark and a set of initial baselines.
