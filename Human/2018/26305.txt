Reimplementation and Reinterpretation of the Copycat Project

We present the reinterpreted and reimplemented Copycat project, an architecture solving letter analogy domain problems. To support a flexible implementation change and rigor testing process, we propose a implementation method in DrRacket by using functional abstraction, naming system, initialization, and structural reference. Finally, benefits and limitations are analyzed for cognitive architectures along the lines of Copycat.
