This report discusses the issues of data quality in biobanks. It presents the state-of-the-art in data quality: the definition of data quality, the dimensions of data quality, and the quality management system for achieving or describing the aspired data quality characteristics and we present and discuss all elements for such a data quality management system. In depth, we discuss the requirements and the context of data quality for biobanks in particular, where we argue that biobanks can be seen as data brokers, where the indented use of the data is to support the search for suitable material and data in the preparation of medical studies. For such an intended use, the quality of the metadata is of high importance and biobanks have to emphasize to strive for adequate documentation of the quality of the data annotating the samples.
