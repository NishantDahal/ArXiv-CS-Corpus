Realizing Intelligence

Order exists in the world. The intelligence process enables us to realize that order, to some extent. We provide a high level description of intelligence using simple definitions, basic building blocks, a conceptual framework and general hierarchy. This perspective includes multiple levels of abstraction occurring in space and in time. The resulting model offers simple, useful ways to help realize the essence of intelligence.
