Initial Access Frameworks for 3GPP NR at mmWave Frequencies

The use of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for communication will be one of the innovations of the next generation of cellular mobile networks (5G). It will provide unprecedented data rates, but is highly susceptible to rapid channel variations and suffers from severe isotropic pathloss. Highly directional antennas at the transmitter and the receiver will be used to compensate for these shortcomings and achieve sufficient link budget in wide area networks. However, directionality demands precise alignment of the transmitter and the receiver beams, an operation which has important implications for control plane procedures, such as initial access, and may increase the delay of the data transmission. This paper provides a comparison of measurement frameworks for initial access in mmWave cellular networks in terms of detection accuracy, reactiveness and overhead, using parameters recently standardized by the 3GPP and a channel model based on real-world measurements. We show that the best strategy depends on the specific environment in which the nodes are deployed, and provide guidelines to characterize the optimal choice as a function of the system parameters.
