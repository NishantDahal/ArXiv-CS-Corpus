Hypergraph coloring up to condensation

Improving a result of Dyer, Frieze and Greenhill [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 2015], we determine the $q$-colorability threshold in random $k$-uniform hypergraphs up to an additive error of $\ln 2+\varepsilon_q$, where $\lim_{q\to\infty}\varepsilon_q=0$. The new lower bound on the threshold matches the "condensation phase transition" predicted by statistical physics considerations [Krzakala et al., PNAS 2007].
