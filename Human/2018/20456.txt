Fair Marketplace for Secure Outsourced Computations

The cloud computing paradigm offers clients ubiquitous and on demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, enabling the clients to provision scalable services with minimal management effort. Such a pool of resources, however, is typically owned and controlled by a single service provider, making it a single-point-of-failure. This paper presents Kosto - a framework that provisions a fair marketplace for secure outsourced computations, wherein the pool of computing resources aggregates resources offered by a large cohort of independent compute nodes. Kosto protects the confidentiality of clients' inputs as well as the integrity of the outsourced computations and their results using trusted hardware's enclave execution, in particular Intel SGX. Furthermore, Kosto warrants fair exchanges between the clients' payments for the execution of an outsourced computations and the compute nodes' work in servicing the clients' requests. Empirical evaluation on the prototype implementation of Kosto shows that performance overhead incurred by enclave execution is as small as 3% for computation-intensive operations, and 1.5x for IO-intensive operations.
