Resisting Selfish Mining Attacks in the Bicomp

Selfish mining, which is an attack on the integrity of the Bitcoin network, was first proposed by Cornell researchers Emin Gun Sirer and Ittay Eyal in 2013. Selfish mining attack also exists in most Nakamoto consensus protocols. Generally speaking, selfish mining strategy can comprise a Nakamoto consensus system with less than 25% mining power of the whole system. We have discussed how the Bicomp can resist selfish mining in our former paper "Bicomp: A Bilayer Scalable Nakamoto Consensus Protocol". In this technical report, we give a detailed derivation on the conditions a selfish attacker should meet to earn more revenues through selfish mining. And we also get a conclusion that through adjusting macroblock difficulties together with tenure lengths, the Bicomp protocol has high resistant towards selfish mining.
