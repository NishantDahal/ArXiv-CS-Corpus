Tree-Based Optimization: A Meta-Algorithm for Metaheuristic Optimization

Designing search algorithms for finding global optima is one of the most active research fields, recently. These algorithms consist of two main categories, i.e., classic mathematical and metaheuristic algorithms. This article proposes a meta-algorithm, Tree-Based Optimization (TBO), which uses other heuristic optimizers as its sub-algorithms in order to improve the performance of search. The proposed algorithm is based on mathematical tree subject and improves performance and speed of search by iteratively removing parts of the search space having low fitness, in order to minimize and purify the search space. The experimental results on several well-known benchmarks show the outperforming performance of TBO algorithm in finding the global solution. Experiments on high dimensional search spaces show significantly better performance when using the TBO algorithm. The proposed algorithm improves the search algorithms in both accuracy and speed aspects, especially for high dimensional searching such as in VLSI CAD tools for Integrated Circuit (IC) design.
