Optimizing the Number of Fog Nodes for Cloud-Fog-Thing Networks

Going from theory to practice in fog networking raises the question of the optimum number of fog nodes that will be upgraded from the existing nodes. This paper finds the optimum number of fog nodes for a given total number of ordinary nodes residing in the area of interest for different channel conditions. Determining the optimum number of fog nodes is quite beneficial, because it can strongly affect the SINR, and thus the average data rate and transmission delay. The numerical results indicate that the average data rate increases nearly an order of magnitude for an optimized number of fog nodes in case of shadowing and fading. It is further shown that the optimum number of fog nodes does not increase in direct proportion to the increase in the total number of nodes. Furthermore, the optimum number of fog nodes decreases when channels have high path loss exponents. These findings suggest that the fog nodes must be selected among those that have the highest computation capability for densely deployed networks and high path loss exponents channels.
