Optimal Multicast of Tiled 360 VR Video

In this letter, we study optimal multicast of tiled 360 virtual reality (VR) video from one server (base station or access point) to multiple users. We consider random viewing directions and random channel conditions, and adopt time division multiple access (TDMA). For given video quality, we optimize the transmission time and power allocation to minimize the average transmission energy. For given transmission energy budget, we optimize the transmission time and power allocation as well as the encoding rate of each tile to maximize the received video quality. These two optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems. We obtain globally optimal closed-form solutions of the two non-convex problems, which reveal important design insights for multicast of tiled 360 VR video. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed solutions.
