Physical-Layer Security: Does it Work in a Real Environment?

This paper applies channel sounding measurements to enable physical-layer security coding. The channel measurements were acquired in an indoor environment and used to assess the secrecy capacity as a function of physical location. A variety of Reed-Muller wiretap codes were applied to the channel measurements to determine the most effective code for the environment. The results suggest that deploying physical-layer security coding is a three-point design process, where channel sounding data guides 1) the physical placement of the antennas, 2) the power settings of the transmitter, and 3) the selection of wiretap coding.
