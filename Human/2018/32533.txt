Learning to Communicate in UAV-aided Wireless Networks: Map-based Approaches

We consider a scenario where an UAV-mounted flying base station is providing data communication services to a number of radio nodes spread over the ground. We focus on the problem of resource-constrained UAV trajectory design with (i) optimal channel parameters learning and (ii) optimal data throughput as key objectives, respectively. While the problem of throughput optimized trajectories has been addressed in prior works, the formulation of an optimized trajectory to efficiently discover the propagation parameters has not yet been addressed. When it comes to the communication phase, the advantage of this work comes from the exploitation of a 3D city map. Unfortunately, the communication trajectory design based on the raw map data leads to an intractable optimization problem. To solve this issue, we introduce a map compression method that allows us to tackle the problem with standard optimization tools. The trajectory optimization is then combined with a node scheduling algorithm. The advantages of the learning-optimized trajectory and of the map compression method are illustrated in the context of intelligent IoT data harvesting.
