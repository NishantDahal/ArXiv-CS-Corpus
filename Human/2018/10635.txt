Energy-Efficient Caching for Scalable Videos in Heterogeneous Networks

By suppressing repeated content deliveries, wireless caching has the potential to substantially improve the energy efficiency (EE) of the fifth generation (5G) communication networks. In this paper, we propose two novel energy-efficient caching schemes in heterogeneous networks, namely, scalable video coding (SVC)-based fractional caching and SVC-based random caching, which can provide on-demand video services with different perceptual qualities. We derive the expressions for successful transmission probabilities and ergodic service rates. Based on the derivations and the established power consumption models, the EE maximization problems are formulated for the two proposed caching schemes. By taking logarithmic approximations of the l0-norm, the problems are efficiently solved by the standard gradient projection method. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed caching schemes, compared to three benchmark strategies.
