A Dynamic Service-Migration Mechanism in Edge Cognitive Computing

Driven by the vision of edge computing and the success of rich cognitive services based on artificial intelligence, a new computing paradigm, edge cognitive computing (ECC), is a promising approach that applies cognitive computing at the edge of the network. ECC has the potential to provide the cognition of users and network environmental information, and further to provide elastic cognitive computing services to achieve a higher energy efficiency and a higher Quality of Experience (QoE) compared to edge computing. This paper firstly introduces our architecture of the ECC and then describes its design issues in detail. Moreover, we propose an ECC-based dynamic service migration mechanism to provide an insight into how cognitive computing is combined with edge computing. In order to evaluate the proposed mechanism, a practical platform for dynamic service migration is built up, where the services are migrated based on the behavioral cognition of a mobile user. The experimental results show that the proposed ECC architecture has ultra-low latency and a high user experience, while providing better service to the user, saving computing resources, and achieving a high energy efficiency.
