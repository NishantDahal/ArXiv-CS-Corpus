Energy Efficiency of an Unlicensed Wireless Network in the Presence of Retransmissions

This paper analysis the energy efficiency of an unlicensed wireless network in which retransmission is possible if the transmitted message is decoded in outage. A wireless sensor network is considered in which the sensor nodes are unlicensed users of a wireless network which transmit its data in the uplink channel used by the licensed users. Poisson point process is used to model the distributions of the nodes and the interference caused by the licensed users for the sensor nodes. After finding the optimal throughput in the presence of retransmissions, we focus on analyzing the total power consumption and energy efficiency of the network and how retransmissions, network density and outage threshold affects the energy efficiency of the network.
