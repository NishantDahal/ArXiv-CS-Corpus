Opportunity in Conflict: Understanding Tension Among Key Groups on the Trail

This paper examines the question of who technology users on the trail are, what their technological uses and needs are, and what conflicts exist between different trail users regarding technology use and experience, toward understanding how experiences of trail users contribute to designers. We argue that exploring these tensions provide opportunities for design that can be used to both mitigate conflicts and improve community on the trail.
