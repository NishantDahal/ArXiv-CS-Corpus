Classification of cyber-physical production systems applications: Proposition of an analysis framework

Cyber-physical systems have encountered a huge success in the past decade in several scientific communities, and specifically in production topics. The main attraction of the concept relies in the fact that it encompasses many scientific topics that were distinct before. The downside is the lack of readability of the current developments about cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). Indeed, the large scientific area of CPPS makes it difficult to identify clearly and rapidly, in the various applications that were made of CPPS, what are the choices, best practices and methodology that are suggested and that could be used for a new application. This work intends to introduce an analysis framework able to classify those developments. An extensive study of literature enabled to extract the major criteria that are to be used in the framework, namely: Development Extent; Research Axis; Instrumenting; Communication standards; Intelligence deposit; Cognition level; Human factor. Several recent examples of CPPS developments in literature are used to illustrate the use of the framework and brief conclusions are drawn from the comparative analysis of those examples.
