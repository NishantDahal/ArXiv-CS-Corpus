M-BEHZAD: Minimum distance Based Energy efficiency using Hemisphere Zoning with Advanced Divide-and-Rule Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks

Routing Protocols are engaged in a vigorous fashion to boost up energy efficiency in WSNs. In this paper, we propose a novel routing protocol; Minimum distance Based Energy efficiency using Hemisphere Zoning with Advanced Divide-and-Rule scheme (M-BEHZAD), to maximize network lifespan, throughput and stability period of the sensors deployed in an un-attended network zone. To accomplish these objectives, static clustering technique along with threshold conscious transmissions have been used. The robustness of our proposed scheme lies in its Cluster Heads (CHs) selection and network field division which we are introducing as 'Hemisphere Zoning (HZ)'. We have implemented 3-Tier architecture to minimize the communication distance which not only leads to a better network performance but also significantly reduces the energy and coverage holes, and results in a longer stability period. We have also utilized Uniform Random Model (URM) to compute packets dropped to make our scheme a more practical approach. Results from comprehensive simulations using MATLAB validate its applicability.
