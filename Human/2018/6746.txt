Adaptive Streaming in Interactive Multiview Video Systems

Multiview applications endow final users with the possibility to freely navigate within 3D scenes with minimum-delay. A real feeling of scene navigation is enabled by transmitting multiple high-quality camera views, which can be used to synthesize additional virtual views to offer a smooth navigation. However, when network resources are limited, not all camera views can be sent at high quality. It is therefore important, yet challenging, to find the right tradeoff between coding artifacts (reducing the quality of camera views) and virtual synthesis artifacts (reducing the number of camera views sent to users). To this aim, we propose an optimal transmission strategy for interactive multiview HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS). We propose a problem formulation to select the optimal set of camera views that the client requests for downloading, such that the navigation quality experienced by the user is optimized while the bandwidth constraints are satisfied. We show that our optimization problem is NP-hard, and we therefore develop an optimal solution based on the dynamic programming algorithm with polynomial time complexity. To further simplify the deployment, we present a suboptimal greedy algorithm with effective performance and lower complexity. The proposed controller is evaluated in theoretical and realistic settings characterized by realistic network statistics estimation, buffer management and server-side representation optimization. Simulation results show significant improvement in terms of navigation quality compared with alternative baseline multiview adaptation logic solutions.
