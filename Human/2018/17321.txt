Distributed leader election and computation of local identifiers for programmable matter

The context of this paper is programmable matter, which consists of a set of computational elements, called particles, in an infinite graph. The considered infinite graphs are the square, triangular and king grids. Each particle occupies one vertex, can communicate with the adjacent particles, has the same clockwise direction and knows the local positions of neighborhood particles. Under these assumptions, we describe a new leader election algorithm affecting a variable to the particles, called the k-local identifier, in such a way that particles at close distance have each a different k-local identifier. For all the presented algorithms, the particles only need a O(1)-memory space.
