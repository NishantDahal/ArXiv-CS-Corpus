Opinion Conflicts: An Effective Route to Detect Incivility in Twitter

In Twitter, there is a rising trend in abusive behavior which often leads to incivility. This trend is affecting users mentally and as a result they tend to leave Twitter and other such social networking sites thus depleting the active user base. In this paper, we study factors associated with incivility. We observe that the act of incivility is highly correlated with the opinion differences between the account holder (i.e., the user writing the incivil tweet) and the target (i.e., the user for whom the incivil tweet is meant for or targeted), toward a named entity. We introduce a character level CNN model and incorporate the entity-specific sentiment information for efficient incivility detection which significantly outperforms multiple baseline methods achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.3% (4.9% improvement over the best baseline). In a post-hoc analysis, we also study the behavioral aspects of the targets and account holders and try to understand the reasons behind the incivility incidents. Interestingly, we observe that there are strong signals of repetitions in incivil behavior. In particular, we find that there are a significant fraction of account holders who act as repeat offenders - attacking the targets even more than 10 times. Similarly, there are also targets who get targeted multiple times. In general, the targets are found to have higher reputation scores than the account holders.
