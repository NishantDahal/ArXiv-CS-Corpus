Detection of Light Sleep Periods Using an Accelerometer Based Alarm System

Light sleep is a sleeping period which occurs within each hour during the sleep. This is the period when people are closest to awakening. With this being the case people tend to move more frequently and aggressively during these periods. The characteristics of sleeping stages, detection of light sleep periods and analysis of light sleep periods were clarified. The sleeping patterns of different subjects were analyzed. In this paper the most suitable moment for waking a person up will be described. The detection of this moment and the development process of a system dedicated to this purpose will be explained, and also some experimental results that are acquired via different tests will be shared and analyzed.
