End-to-End Automatic Speech Translation of Audiobooks

We investigate end-to-end speech-to-text translation on a corpus of audiobooks specifically augmented for this task. Previous works investigated the extreme case where source language transcription is not available during learning nor decoding, but we also study a midway case where source language transcription is available at training time only. In this case, a single model is trained to decode source speech into target text in a single pass. Experimental results show that it is possible to train compact and efficient end-to-end speech translation models in this setup. We also distribute the corpus and hope that our speech translation baseline on this corpus will be challenged in the future.
