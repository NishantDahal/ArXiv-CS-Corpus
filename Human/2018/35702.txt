On capacities of the two-user union channel with complete feedback

The exact values of the optimal symmetric rate point in the Cover--Leung capacity region of the two-user union channel with complete feedback were determined by Willems when the size of the input alphabet is 2, and by Vinck, Hoeks and Post when the size is at least 6. We complete this line of research when the size of the input alphabet is 3, 4 or 5. The proof hinges on the technical lemma that concerns the maximal joint entropy of two independent random variables in terms of their probability of equality. For the zero-error capacity region, using superposition coding, we provide a practical near-optimal communication scheme which improves all the previous explicit constructions.
