Hierarchical Cloth Simulation using Deep Neural Networks

Fast and reliable physically-based simulation techniques are essential for providing flexible visual effects for computer graphics content. In this paper, we propose a fast and reliable hierarchical cloth simulation method, which combines conventional physically-based simulation with deep neural networks (DNN). Simulations of the coarsest level of the hierarchical model are calculated using conventional physically-based simulations, and more detailed levels are generated by inference using DNN models. We demonstrate that our method generates reliable and fast cloth simulation results through experiments under various conditions.
