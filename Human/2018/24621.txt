Evaluation of Preference of Multimedia Content using Deep Neural Networks for Electroencephalography

Evaluation of quality of experience (QoE) based on electroencephalography (EEG) has received great attention due to its capability of real-time QoE monitoring of users. However, it still suffers from rather low recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method using deep neural networks toward improved modeling of EEG and thereby improved recognition accuracy. In particular, we aim to model spatio-temporal characteristics relevant for QoE analysis within learning models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
