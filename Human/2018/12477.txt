GeneVis - An interactive visualization tool for combining cross-discipline datasets within genetics

GeneVis is a web-based tool to visualize complementary data sets of different disciplines within the field of genetics. It overlays gene-cluster information, gene-interaction data and gene-disease association data by means of web-based interactive graph visualizations. This allows an intuitive and quick assessment of possible relations between the different datasets. By starting from a high-level graph abstraction based on gene clusters, which can be selected for detailed inspection at the gene-interaction level in a separate window, GeneVis circumvents the common visual clutter problem when using gene datasets with a high number of gene entries.
