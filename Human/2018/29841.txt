Context-Aware Dialog Re-Ranking for Task-Oriented Dialog Systems

Dialog response ranking is used to rank response candidates by considering their relation to the dialog history. Although researchers have addressed this concept for open-domain dialogs, little attention has been focused on task-oriented dialogs. Furthermore, no previous studies have analyzed whether response ranking can improve the performance of existing dialog systems in real human-computer dialogs with speech recognition errors. In this paper, we propose a context-aware dialog response re-ranking system. Our system reranks responses in two steps: (1) it calculates matching scores for each candidate response and the current dialog context; (2) it combines the matching scores and a probability distribution of the candidates from an existing dialog system for response re-ranking. By using neural word embedding-based models and handcrafted or logistic regression-based ensemble models, we have improved the performance of a recently proposed end-to-end task-oriented dialog system on real dialogs with speech recognition errors.
