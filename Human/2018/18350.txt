Single Bitmap Block Truncation Coding of Color Images Using Hill Climbing Algorithm

Recently, the use of digital images in various fields is increasing rapidly. To increase the number of images stored and get faster transmission of them, it is necessary to reduce the size of these images. Single bitmap block truncation coding (SBBTC) schemes are compression techniques, which are used to generate a common bitmap to quantize the R, G and B planes in color image. As one of the traditional SBBTC schemes, weighted plane (W-plane) method is famous for its simplicity and low time consumption. However, the W-plane method also has poor performance in visual quality. This paper proposes an improved SBBTC scheme based on W-plane method using parallel computing and hill climbing algorithm. Compared with various schemes, the simulation results of the proposed scheme are better than that of the reference schemes in visual quality and time consumption.
