Game-Based Approach for QoS Provisioning and Interference Management in Heterogeneous Networks

For the current 5G era, the deployment of small cells in residential and commercial areas plays an imperious preamble in improving network coverage and the quality of service (QoS). Major technical problems associated with the mass deployment of small cells, such as femtocells are interference management and QoS provisioning. These are important for service-providing operators because the system capacity and achievable data rates mainly depend on interference. Future generation wireless networks will use autonomous and distributed architecture for ameliorating the efficacy and flexibility of communication systems. In this paper, we propose a game theory-based model along with dynamic channel allocation and self-optimizing power control scheme for resolving priority-based access exposure by applying the concept of primary and secondary users. It is expected that the consumers will experience better QoS with reduced interference levels, and the service-providing operators will be able to increase their revenue, while ensuring optimal price for the consumers. We assimilated extensive numerical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model.
