Uplink Spectral Efficiency of Massive MIMO with Spatially Correlated Rician Fading

This paper considers the uplink (UL) of a multi-cell Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system with spatially correlated Rician fading channels. The channel model is composed of a deterministic line-of-sight (LoS) path and a stochastic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component describing a spatially correlated multipath environment. We derive the statistical properties of the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and least-square (LS) channel estimates for this model. Using these estimates for maximum ratio (MR) combining, rigorous closed-form UL spectral efficiency (SE) expressions are derived. Numerical results show that the SE is higher when using the MMSE estimator than the LS estimator, and the performance gap increases with the number of antennas. Moreover, Rician fading provides higher achievable SEs than Rayleigh fading since the LoS path improves the sum SE.
