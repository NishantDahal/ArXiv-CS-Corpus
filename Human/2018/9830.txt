Minimizing Latency to Support VR Social Interactions over Wireless Cellular Systems via Bandwidth Allocation

Immersive social interactions of mobile users are soon to be enabled within a virtual space, by means of virtual reality (VR) technologies and wireless cellular systems. In a VR mobile social network, the states of all interacting users should be updated synchronously and with low latency via two-way communications with edge computing servers. The resulting end-to-end latency depends on the relationship between the virtual and physical locations of the wireless VR users and of the edge servers. In this work, the problem of analyzing and optimizing the end-to-end latency is investigated for a simple network topology, yielding important insights into the interplay between physical and virtual geometries.
