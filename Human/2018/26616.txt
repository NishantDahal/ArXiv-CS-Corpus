Hull Form Optimization with Principal Component Analysis and Deep Neural Network

Designing and modifying complex hull forms for optimal vessel performances have been a major challenge for naval architects. In the present study, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is introduced to compress the geometric representation of a group of existing vessels, and the resulting principal scores are manipulated to generate a large number of derived hull forms, which are evaluated computationally for their calm-water performances. The results are subsequently used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to accurately establish the relation between different hull forms and their associated performances. Then, based on the fast, parallel DNN-based hull-form evaluation, the large-scale search for optimal hull forms is performed.
