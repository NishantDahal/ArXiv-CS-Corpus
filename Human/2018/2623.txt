Actigraphy-based Sleep/Wake Pattern Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

Common medical conditions are often associated with sleep abnormalities. Patients with medical disorders often suffer from poor sleep quality compared to healthy individuals, which in turn may worsen the symptoms of the disorder. Accurate detection of sleep/wake patterns is important in developing personalized digital markers, which can be used for objective measurements and efficient disease management. Big Data technologies and advanced analytics methods hold the promise to revolutionize clinical research processes, enabling the effective blending of digital data into clinical trials. Actigraphy, a non-invasive activity monitoring method is heavily used to detect and evaluate activities and movement disorders, and assess sleep/wake behavior. In order to study the connection between sleep/wake patterns and a cluster headache disorder, activity data was collected using a wearable device in the course of a clinical trial. This study presents two novel modeling schemes that utilize Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify sleep/wake states. The proposed methods are a sequential CNN, reminiscent of the bi-directional CNN for slot filling, and a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based model. Furthermore, we expand standard "Sleep" and "Wake" activity states space by adding the "Falling asleep" and "Siesta" states. We show that the proposed methods provide promising results in accurate detection of the expanded sleep/wake states. Finally, we explore the relations between the detected sleep/wake patterns and onset of cluster headache attacks, and present preliminary observations.
