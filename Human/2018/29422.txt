The discrete yet ubiquitous theorems of Carathéodory, Helly, Sperner, Tucker, and Tverberg

We discuss five discrete results: the lemmas of Sperner and Tucker from combinatorial topology and the theorems of Carathéodory, Helly, and Tverberg from combinatorial geometry. We explore their connections and emphasize their broad impact in application areas such as game theory, graph theory, mathematical optimization, computational geometry, etc.
