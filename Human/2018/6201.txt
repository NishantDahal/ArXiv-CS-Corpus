Green LTE Broadcasting

LTE broadcast is a communication standard which is expected to revolutionize the multimedia service provision in the future. The distinctive features of this standard such as increased service capacity, high spectral efficiency, and spectral adjustability have encouraged many companies to select this standard for the future generation broadcasting. In this paper, after a complete introduction of this standard and its unique features, its application in the Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) is investigated. In this study, application of the LTE broadcast standard under a new scenario called Super cell is examined. Based on the results, the suggested scenario can be considered as one of the best LTE broadcast scenarios. The main aim of this scenario is to decrease the total energy consumption. Therefore, the study has demonstrated that this scenario can reduce the total energy consumption and offers a green servicing by taking advantage of the small cells capability and the D2D communication technology.
