Boredom-driven curious learning by Homeo-Heterostatic Value Gradients

This paper presents the Homeo-Heterostatic Value Gradients (HHVG) algorithm as a formal account on the constructive interplay between boredom and curiosity which gives rise to effective exploration and superior forward model learning. We envisaged actions as instrumental in agent's own epistemic disclosure. This motivated two central algorithmic ingredients: devaluation and devaluation progress, both underpin agent's cognition concerning intrinsically generated rewards. The two serve as an instantiation of homeostatic and heterostatic intrinsic motivation. A key insight from our algorithm is that the two seemingly opposite motivations can be reconciled---without which exploration and information-gathering cannot be effectively carried out. We supported this claim with empirical evidence, showing that boredom-enabled agents consistently outperformed other curious or explorative agent variants in model building benchmarks based on self-assisted experience accumulation.
