A Language Hierarchy of Binary Relations

Motivated by the study of word problems of monoids, we explore two ways of viewing binary relations on $A^*$ as languages. We exhibit a hierarchy of classes of binary relations on $A^*$, according to the class of languages the relation belongs to and the chosen viewpoint. We give examples of word problems of monoids distinguishing the various classes.
