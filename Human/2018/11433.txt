Reducing Cubic Metric of Circularly Pulse-Shaped OFDM Signals Through Constellation Shaping Optimization With Performance Constraints

Circularly pulse-shaped orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CPS-OFDM) is one of the most promising 5G waveforms that addresses two physical layer signal requirements of low out-of-subband emission (OSBE) and low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) with flexibility in parameter adaptation. In this paper, a constellation shaping optimization method is proposed to further reduce the cubic metric (CM) of CPS-OFDM signals for the case that demands rather high power amplifier (PA) efficiency at the transmitter. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in CM reduction, and the corresponding benefits of spectral regrowth mitigation and spectral efficiency improvement.
