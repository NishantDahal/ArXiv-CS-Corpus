Joint User Association and BS Switching Scheme for Green Heterogeneous Cellular Network

A dense deployment of on-grid small cell base stations (SBSs) in a heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) results in large power consumption which can be reduced by utilizing harvested energy from scavenge sources. Recently, a new layout for HCN with energy harvesting-SBSs (EH-SBSs) has been proposed to reduce inter-cell interference and power consumption; and increase system energy efficiency. In this paper, an energy efficient joint user association and BS on-off scheme for an HCN having diverse energy source(s) is proposed, which aims at utilizing the harvested energy efficiently in order to reduce the on-grid power consumption. The scheme operates in two phases. First, it decides which BS should be in off, sleep or active mode and iteratively updates its transmit power based on energy arrival and consumption, to minimize interference and on-grid power consumption. Secondly, for further reduction in on-grid power consumption, the user discovers and associates itself with the nearest available EH-SBS. The system energy consumption for the proposed scheme is numerically evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme shows significantly better results as compared to other schemes in the literature in terms of grid power consumption and energy efficiency.
