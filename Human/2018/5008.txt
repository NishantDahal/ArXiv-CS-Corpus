Handling Verb Phrase Anaphora with Dependent Types and Events

This paper studies how dependent typed events can be used to treat verb phrase anaphora. We introduce a framework that extends Dependent Type Semantics (DTS) with a new atomic type for neo-Davidsonian events and an extended @-operator that can return new events that share properties of events referenced by verb phrase anaphora. The proposed framework, along with illustrative examples of its use, are presented after a brief overview of the necessary background and of the major challenges posed by verb phrase anaphora.
