A Reinforcement Learning Hyper-Heuristic in Multi-Objective Single Point Search with Application to Structural Fault Identification

Multi-objective optimizations are frequently encountered in engineering practices. The solution techniques and parametric selections however are usually problem-specific. In this study we formulate a reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic scheme, and propose four low-level heuristics which can work coherently with the single point search algorithm MOSA/R (Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on Re-seed) towards multi-objective optimization problems of general applications. Making use of the domination amount, crowding distance and hypervolume calculations, the proposed hyper-heuristic scheme can meet various optimization requirements adaptively and autonomously. The approach developed not only exhibits improved and more robust performance compared to AMOSA, NSGA-II and MOEA/D when applied to benchmark test cases, but also shows promising results when applied to a generic structural fault identification problem. The outcome of this research can be extended to a variety of design and manufacturing optimization applications.
