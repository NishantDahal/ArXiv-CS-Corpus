Robust Secrecy Energy Efficient Beamforming in MISOME-SWIPT Systems With Proportional Fairness

The joint design of beamforming vector and artificial noise covariance matrix is investigated for multiple-input-single-output-multiple-eavesdropper simultaneous wireless information and power transferring (MISOME-SWIPT) systems. A secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem is formulated in the MISOME-SWIPT system with imperfect channel state information and proportional secrecy rate constraints. Since the formulated SEE maximization problem is non-convex, it is first recast into a series of convex problems in order to obtain the optimal solution with a reasonable computational complexity. Numerical results are used to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm and to reveal practical insights.
