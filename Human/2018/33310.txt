The Diagrammatic AI Language (DIAL): Version 0.1

Currently, there is no consistent model for visually or formally representing the architecture of AI systems. This lack of representation brings interpretability, correctness and completeness challenges in the description of existing models and systems. DIAL (The Diagrammatic AI Language) has been created with the aspiration of being an "engineering schematic" for AI Systems. It is presented here as a starting point for a community dialogue towards a common diagrammatic language for AI Systems.
