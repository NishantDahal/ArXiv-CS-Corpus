Digital Transformation in Airport Ground Operations

How has digital transformation changed airport ground operations? Although the relevant peer-reviewed literature emphasizes the role of cost savings as a key driver behind digitalization of airport ground operations, the focus is on data-driven, customer-centric innovations. This paper argues that ground handling agents are deploying new technologies mainly to boost process efficiency and to cut costs. Our research shows that ground handling agents are embracing current trends to craft new business models and develop new revenue streams. In this paper, we examine the ground handling agent's value chain and identify areas that are strongly affected by digital transformation and those that are not. We discuss different business scenarios for digital technology and link them with relevant research, such as automated service data capturing, new digital services for passengers, big data, indoor navigation, and wearables in airport ground operations. We assess the maturity level of discussed technologies using NASA technology readiness levels.
