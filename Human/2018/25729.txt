Text-Independent Speaker Verification Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks

In this paper, an architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks has been proposed for the text-independent scenario which is aimed to capture the temporal speaker-related information by operating over traditional speech features. For speaker verification, at first, a background model must be created for speaker representation. Then, in enrollment stage, the speaker models will be created based on the enrollment utterances. For this work, the model will be trained in an end-to-end fashion to combine the first two stages. The main goal of end-to-end training is the model being optimized to be consistent with the speaker verification protocol. The end- to-end training jointly learns the background and speaker models by creating the representation space. The LSTM architecture is trained to create a discrimination space for validating the match and non-match pairs for speaker verification. The proposed architecture demonstrate its superiority in the text-independent compared to other traditional methods.
