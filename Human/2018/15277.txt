Development of FEB Configuration Test Board for ATLAS NSW Upgrade

The FEB(front end board) configuration test board is developed aiming at meeting the requirement of testing the new generation ASIC(application-specific integrated circuit) chips and its configuration system for ATLAS NSW(New Small Wheel) upgrade, In this paper, some functions are developed in terms of the configurations of the key chips on the FEB, VMM3 and TDS2 using GBT-SCA. Additionally, a flexible communication protocol is designed, verifying the whole data link. It provides technical reference for prototype FEB key chip configuration and data readout, as well as the final system configuration.
