A Coarse-to-Fine Multiscale Mesh Representation and its Applications

We present a novel coarse-to-fine framework that derives a semi-regular multiscale mesh representation of an original input mesh via remeshing. Our approach differs from the conventional mesh wavelet transform strategy in two ways. First, based on a lazy wavelet framework, it can convert an input mesh into a multiresolution representation through a single remeshing procedure. By contrast, the conventional strategy requires two steps: remeshing and mesh wavelet transform. Second, the proposed method can conditionally convert input mesh models into ones sharing the same adjacency matrix, so it is able be invariant against the triangular tilings of the inputs. Our experiment results show that the proposed multiresolution representation method is efficient in various applications, such as 3D shape property analysis, mesh scalable coding and mesh morphing.
