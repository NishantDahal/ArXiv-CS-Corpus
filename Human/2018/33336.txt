Generalization of the Ball-Collision Algorithm

In this paper we generalize the Ball-Collision Algorithm by Bernstein, Lange, Peters from the binary field to a general finite field. We also provide a complexity analysis and compare the asymptotic complexity to other generalized information set decoding algorithms.
