A Correlation-Breaking Interleaving of Polar Codes in Concatenated Systems

It is known that the bit errors of polar codes with successive cancellation (SC) decoding are coupled. However, existing concatenation schemes of polar codes with other error correction codes rarely take this coupling effect into consideration. To achieve a better error performance of concatenated systems with polar codes as inner codes, one can divide all bits in an outer block into different polar blocks to completely de-correlate the possible coupled errors in the transmitter side. We call this interleaving a blind interleaving (BI) which serves as a benchmark. Two BI schemes, termed BI-DP and BI-CDP, are proposed in the paper. To better balance performance, memory size, and the decoding delay from the de-interleaving, a novel interleaving scheme, named the correlation-breaking interleaving (CBI), is proposed. The CBI breaks the correlated information bits based on the error correlation pattern proposed and proven in this paper. The proposed CBI scheme is general in the sense that any error correction code can serve as the outer code. In this paper, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes and BCH codes are used as two examples of the outer codes of the interleaving scheme. The CBI scheme 1) can keep the simple SC polar decoding while achieving a better error performance than the state-of-the-art (SOA) direct concatenation of polar codes with LDPC codes and BCH codes; 2) achieves a comparable error performance as the BI-DP scheme with a smaller memory size and a shorter decoding delay. Numerical results are provided to verify the performance of the BI schemes and the CBI scheme.
