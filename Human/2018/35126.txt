Report on the 3rd Joint Workshop on Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for Digital Libraries (BIRNDL 2018)

The $3^{rd}$ joint BIRNDL workshop was held at the 41st ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2018) in Ann Arbor, USA. BIRNDL 2018 intended to stimulate IR researchers and digital library professionals to elaborate on new approaches in natural language processing, information retrieval, scientometrics, and recommendation techniques that can advance the state-of-the-art in scholarly document understanding, analysis, and retrieval at scale. The workshop incorporated three paper sessions and the $4^{th}$ edition of the CL-SciSumm Shared Task.
