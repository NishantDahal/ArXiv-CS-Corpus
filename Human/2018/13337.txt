A time-efficient frame size adjustment based approach for RFID anti-collision

Fast and efficient identify a large number of RFID tags in the region of interest is a critical issue in various RFID applications. In this paper, a novel sub-frame-based algorithm with a time-efficient frame size adjustment strategy to reduce the time complexity for EPCglobal C1 Gen2 UHF RFID standard is proposed. By observing the slot statistics in a sub-frame, the tag quantity is estimated by the reader, which afterwards efficiently calculates an optimal frame size to fit the unread tags. Only when the expected time efficiency in the oncoming frame is higher than that in the previous frame, the reader starts the new identification round with the updated frame. Moreover, the estimation of the proposed algorithm is implemented by the look-up tables, which allows dramatically reduction in the computational complexity. Simulation results show noticeable throughput, time efficiency, and identification speed improvements of the proposed solution over the existing approaches.
