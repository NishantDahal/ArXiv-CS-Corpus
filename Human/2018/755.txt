Graph-indexed random walks on special classes of graphs

We investigate the paramater of the average range of $M$-Lipschitz mapping of a given graph. We focus on well-known classes such as paths, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and cycles and show closed formulas for computing this parameter and also we conclude asymptotics of this parameter on these aforementioned classes.
