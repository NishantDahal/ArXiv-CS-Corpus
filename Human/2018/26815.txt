Reasoning about Norms Revision

Norms with sanctions have been widely employed as a mechanism for controlling and coordinating the behavior of agents without limiting their autonomy. The norms enforced in a multi-agent system can be revised in order to increase the likelihood that desirable system properties are fulfilled or that system performance is sufficiently high. In this paper, we provide a preliminary analysis of some types of norm revision: relaxation and strengthening. Furthermore, with the help of some illustrative scenarios, we show the usefulness of norm revision for better satisfying the overall system objectives.
