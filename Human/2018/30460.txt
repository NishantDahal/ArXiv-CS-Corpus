DeepZip: Lossless Data Compression using Recurrent Neural Networks

Sequential data is being generated at an unprecedented pace in various forms, including text and genomic data. This creates the need for efficient compression mechanisms to enable better storage, transmission and processing of such data. To solve this problem, many of the existing compressors attempt to learn models for the data and perform prediction-based compression. Since neural networks are known as universal function approximators with the capability to learn arbitrarily complex mappings, and in practice show excellent performance in prediction tasks, we explore and devise methods to compress sequential data using neural network predictors. We combine recurrent neural network predictors with an arithmetic coder and losslessly compress a variety of synthetic, text and genomic datasets. The proposed compressor outperforms Gzip on the real datasets and achieves near-optimal compression for the synthetic datasets. The results also help understand why and where neural networks are good alternatives for traditional finite context models
