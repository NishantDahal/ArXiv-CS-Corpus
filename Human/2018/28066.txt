Survey of Consensus Protocols

Distributed ledger technology has gained wide popularity and adoption since the emergence of bitcoin in 2008 which is based on proof of work (PoW). It is a distributed, transparent and immutable database of records of all the transactions or events that have been shared and executed among the participants. All the transactions are verified and maintained by multiple nodes across a network without a central authority through a distributed cryptographic mechanism, a consensus protocol. It forms the core of this technology that not only validates the information appended to the ledger but also ensures the order in which it is appended across all the nodes. It is the foundation of its security, accountability and trust. While many researchers are working on improving the current protocol to be quantum resistant, fault-tolerant, and energy-efficient. Others are focused on developing different variants of the protocol, best suited for specific use cases. In this paper, we shall review different consensus protocols of distributed ledger technologies and their implementations. We shall also review their properties, concept and similar-work followed by a brief analysis.
