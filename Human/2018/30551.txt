An Empirical Assessment of the Complexity and Realism of Synthetic Social Contact Networks

We use multiple measures of graph complexity to evaluate the realism of synthetically-generated networks of human activity, in comparison with several stylized network models as well as a collection of empirical networks from the literature. The synthetic networks are generated by integrating data about human populations from several sources, including the Census, transportation surveys, and geographical data. The resulting networks represent an approximation of daily or weekly human interaction. Our results indicate that the synthetically generated graphs according to our methodology are closer to the real world graphs, as measured across multiple structural measures, than a range of stylized graphs generated using common network models from the literature.
