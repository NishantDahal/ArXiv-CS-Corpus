Adaptive Re-ranking of Deep Feature for Person Re-identification

Typical person re-identification (re-ID) methods train a deep CNN to extract deep features and combine them with a distance metric for the final evaluation. In this work, we focus on exploiting the full information encoded in the deep feature to boost the re-ID performance. First, we propose a Deep Feature Fusion (DFF) method to exploit the diverse information embedded in a deep feature. DFF treats each sub-feature as an information carrier and employs a diffusion process to exchange their information. Second, we propose an Adaptive Re-Ranking (ARR) method to exploit the contextual information encoded in the features of neighbors. ARR utilizes the contextual information to re-rank the retrieval results in an iterative manner. Particularly, it adds more contextual information after each iteration automatically to consider more matches. Third, we propose a strategy that combines DFF and ARR to enhance the performance. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods on three large benchmarks.
