A Brandom-ian view of Reinforcement Learning towards strong-AI

The analytic philosophy of Robert Brandom, based on the ideas of pragmatism, paints a picture of sapience, through inferentialism. In this paper, we present a theory, that utilizes essential elements of Brandom's philosophy, towards the objective of achieving strong-AI. We do this by connecting the constitutive elements of reinforcement learning and the Game Of Giving and Asking For Reasons. Further, following Brandom's prescriptive thoughts, we restructure the popular reinforcement learning algorithm A3C, and show that RL algorithms can be tuned towards the objective of strong-AI.
