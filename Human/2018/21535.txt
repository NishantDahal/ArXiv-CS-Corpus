Time Perception Machine: Temporal Point Processes for the When, Where and What of Activity Prediction

Numerous powerful point process models have been developed to understand temporal patterns in sequential data from fields such as health-care, electronic commerce, social networks, and natural disaster forecasting. In this paper, we develop novel models for learning the temporal distribution of human activities in streaming data (e.g., videos and person trajectories). We propose an integrated framework of neural networks and temporal point processes for predicting when the next activity will happen. Because point processes are limited to taking event frames as input, we propose a simple yet effective mechanism to extract features at frames of interest while also preserving the rich information in the remaining frames. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets. The results show that our model outperforms traditional statistical point process approaches significantly, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the underlying temporal dynamics as well as the correlation within sequential activities. Furthermore, we also extend our model to a joint estimation framework for predicting the timing, spatial location, and category of the activity simultaneously, to answer the when, where, and what of activity prediction.
