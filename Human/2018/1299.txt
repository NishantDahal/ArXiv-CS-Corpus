Using Malware Self-Defence Mechanism to Harden Defence and Remediation Tools

Malware are becoming a major problem to every individual and organization in the cyber world. They are advancing in sophistication in many ways. Besides their advanced abilities to penetrate and stay evasive against detection and remediation, they have strong resilience mechanisms that are defying all attempts to eradicate them. Malware are also attacking defence of the systems and making them defunct. When defences are brought down, the organisation or individual will lose control over the IT assets and defend against the Malware perpetuators. In order to gain the capability to defend, it is necessary to keep the defences or remediation tools active and not defunct. Given that Malware have proven to be resilient against deployed defences and remediation tools, the proposed research advocates to utilize the techniques used by Malware to harden the tools in a similar manner. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the proposition of using Malware resilient designs can be applied to harden the tools through experiments.
