Symplectic Isometries of Stabilizer Codes

In this paper we study the equivalence of quantum stabilizer codes via symplectic isometries of stabilizer codes. We define monomially and symplectically equivalent stabilizer codes and determine how different the two notions can be. Further, we show that to monomial maps correspond local Clifford operators. We relate the latter with the LU-LC Conjecture.
