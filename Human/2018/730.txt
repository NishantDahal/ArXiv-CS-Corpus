A Novel Protocol for Network-Controlled Metasurfaces

A recently proposed class of materials, called software-defined metamaterials, can change their electromagnetic behavior on demand, utilizing a nanonetwork embedded in their structure. The present work focuses on 2D metamaterials, known as metasurfaces, and their electromagnetically programmable counterparts, the HyperSurfaces. The particular focus of the study is to propose a nanonetworking protocol that can support the intended macroscopic functionality of a HyperSurface, such as sensing and reacting to impinging waves in a customizable manner. The novel protocol is derived analytically, using the Lyapunov drift minimization approach, taking into account nano-node energy, communication latency and complexity concerns. The proposed scheme is evaluated via simulations, covering both the macroscopic HyperSurface functionality and the microscopic, nanonetwork behavior.
