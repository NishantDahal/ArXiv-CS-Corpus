Analysis of Statistical Properties of Nonlinear Feedforward Generators Over Finite Fields

Due to their simple construction, LFSRs are commonly used as building blocks in various random number generators. Nonlinear feedforward logic is incorporated in LFSRs to increase the linear complexity of the generated sequence. In this work, we extend the idea of nonlinear feedforward logic to LFSRs over arbitrary finite fields and analyze the statistical properties of the generated sequences. Further, we propose a method of applying nonlinear feedforward logic to word-based Ïƒ-LFSRs and show that the proposed scheme generates vector sequences that are statistically more balanced than those generated by an existing scheme.
