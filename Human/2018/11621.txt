Cellular Network Multi-Access Measurements on the Roads of VÃ¤rmland, Sweden

Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) make road traffic safer and more efficient, but require the mobile networks to handle time-critical applications. While some applications may need new dedicated communications technologies such as IEEE 802.11p or 5G, other applications can use current cellular networks. This study evaluates the performance that connected vehicles can expect from existing networks, and estimates the potential gain of multi-access by simultaneously transmitting over several operators. We upload time-critical warning messages from buses in Sweden, and characterise transaction times and network availability. We conduct the experiments with different protocols: UDP, TCP, and HTTPS. Our results show that when using UDP, the median transaction time for sending a typical warning message is 135 ms. We also show that multi-access can bring this value down to 73 ms. For time-critical applications requiring transaction times under 200 ms, multi-access can increase availability of the network from to 57.4% to 92.0%.
