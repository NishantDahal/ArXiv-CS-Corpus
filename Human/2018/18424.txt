Immersion on the Edge: A Cooperative Framework for Mobile Immersive Computing

Immersive computing (IC) technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality are gaining tremendous popularity. In this poster, we present CoIC, a Cooperative framework for mobile Immersive Computing. The design of CoIC is based on a key insight that IC tasks among different applications or users might be similar or redundant. CoIC enhances the performance of mobile IC applications by caching and sharing computation-intensive IC results on the edge. Our preliminary evaluation results on an AR application show that CoIC can reduce the recognition and rendering latency by up to 52.28% and 75.86% respectively on current mobile devices.
