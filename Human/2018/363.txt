Adversarial Classification on Social Networks

The spread of unwanted or malicious content through social media has become a major challenge. Traditional examples of this include social network spam, but an important new concern is the propagation of fake news through social media. A common approach for mitigating this problem is by using standard statistical classification to distinguish malicious (e.g., fake news) instances from benign (e.g., actual news stories). However, such an approach ignores the fact that malicious instances propagate through the network, which is consequential both in quantifying consequences (e.g., fake news diffusing through the network), and capturing detection redundancy (bad content can be detected at different nodes). An additional concern is evasion attacks, whereby the generators of malicious instances modify the nature of these to escape detection. We model this problem as a Stackelberg game between the defender who is choosing parameters of the detection model, and an attacker, who is choosing both the node at which to initiate malicious spread, and the nature of malicious entities. We develop a novel bi-level programming approach for this problem, as well as a novel solution approach based on implicit function gradients, and experimentally demonstrate the advantage of our approach over alternatives which ignore network structure.
