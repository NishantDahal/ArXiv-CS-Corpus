An asymptotic equipartition property for measures on model spaces

Let $G$ be a sofic group, and let $Σ= (σ_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sofic approximation to it. For a probability-preserving $G$-system, a variant of the sofic entropy relative to $Σ$ has recently been defined in terms of sequences of measures on its model spaces that `converge' to the system in a certain sense. Here we prove that, in order to study this notion, one may restrict attention to those sequences that have the asymptotic equipartition property. This may be seen as a relative of the Shannon--McMillan theorem in the sofic setting.
  We also give some first applications of this result, including a new formula for the sofic entropy of a $(G\times H)$-system obtained by co-induction from a $G$-system, where $H$ is any other infinite sofic group.
