Detecting Levels of Depression in Text Based on Metrics

Depression is one of the most common and a major concern for society. Proper monitoring using devices that can aid in its detection could be helpful to prevent it all together. The Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) is used to build a metric-based depression detection. We have designed a metric to describe the level of depression using negative sentences and classify the participant accordingly. The score generated from the algorithm is then levelled up to denote the intensity of depression. The results show that measuring depression is very complex to using text alone as other factors are not taken into consideration. Further, In the paper, the limitations of measuring depression using text are described, and future suggestions are made.
