A Proposal for Outlier and Noise Detection in Public Officials' Affidavits

Outlier and noise detection processes are highly useful in the quality assessment of any kind of database. Such processes may have novel civic and public applications in the detection of anomalies in public data. The purpose of this work is to explore the possibilities of experimentation with, validation and application of hybrid outlier and noise detection procedures in public officials' affidavit systems currently available in Argentina.
