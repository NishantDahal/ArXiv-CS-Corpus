A characterization of the consistent Hoare powerdomains over dcpos

It has been shown that for a dcpo P, the Scott closure of Γ_c(P) in Γ(P) is a consistent Hoare powerdomain of P, where Γ_c(P) is the family of nonempty, consistent and Scott closed subsets of P, and Γ(P) is the collection of all nonempty Scott closed subsets of P. In this paper, by introducing the notion of a \vee-existing set, we present a direct characterization of the consistent Hoare powerdomain: the set of all \vee-existing Scott closed subsets of a dcpo P is exactly the consistent Hoare powerdomain of P. We also introduce the concept of an F-Scott closed set over each dcpo-\vee-semilattice. We prove that the Scott closed set lattice of a dcpo P is isomorphic to the family of all F-Scott closed sets of P's consistent Hoare powerdomain.
