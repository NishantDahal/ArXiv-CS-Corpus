Language Classes Associated With Automata Over Matrix Groups

We investigate the language classes recognized by group automata over matrix groups. For the case of $2 \times 2 $ matrices, we prove that the corresponding group automata for rational matrix groups are more powerful than the corresponding group automata for integer matrix groups. Finite automata over some special matrix groups, such as the discrete Heisenberg group and the Baumslag-Solitar group are also examined. We also introduce the notion of time complexity for group automata and demonstrate some separations among related classes. The case of linear-time bounds is examined in detail throughout our repertory of matrix group automata.
