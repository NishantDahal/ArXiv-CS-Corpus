Codes induced by alternative codes

Alternative codes, an extension of the notion of ordinary codes, have been first introduced and considered by P. T. Huy et al. in 2004. As seen below, every alternative code, in its turn, defines an ordinary code. Such codes are called codes induced by alternative codes or alt-induced codes, for short. In this paper we consider these alt-induced codes and subclasses of them. In particular, characteristic properties of such codes are established, and an algorithm to check whether a finite code is alt-induced or not is proposed.
