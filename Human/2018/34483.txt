A decidability result for the halting problem of cellular automata in the pentagrid

In this paper, we investigate the halting problem for deterministic cellula automata in the pentagrid. We prove that the problem is decidable when the cellular automaton starts its computation from a finite configuration and when it has at most two states, one of them being a quiescent state.
