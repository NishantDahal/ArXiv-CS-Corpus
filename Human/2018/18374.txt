A New Millimeter Wave MIMO System for 5G Networks

Millimeter Wave (mmWave) band provides a large spectrum to meet the high-demand capacity by the 5th generation (5G) wireless networks. However, to fully exploit the available spectrum, obstacles such as high path loss, channel sparsity, and hardware complexity should be overcome. To this end, the present paper aims to design a new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system using lens-based multi-beam reconfigurable antennas. The proposed MIMO system uses complete lens at the transmitter and incomplete lens at the receiver. To reduce hardware complexity, we utilize an optimal beam selection technique. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed MIMO system along with the optimal beam selection technique increases the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Also, simulations show that the system achieves full-diversity gain.
