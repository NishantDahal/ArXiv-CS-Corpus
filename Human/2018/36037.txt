Quantum-inspired secure wireless communication protocol under spatial and local Gaussian noise assumptions

Inspired from quantum key distribution, we consider wireless communication between Alice and Bob when the intermediate space between Alice and Bob is controlled by Eve. That is, our model divides the channel noise into two parts, the noise generated during the transmission and the noise generated in the detector. Eve is allowed to control the former, but is not allowed to do the latter. While the latter is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable, the former is not assumed to be a Gaussian random variable. In this situation, using backward reconciliation and the random sampling, we propose a protocol to generate secure keys between Alice and Bob under the assumption that Eve's detector has a Gaussian noise and Eve is out of Alice's neighborhood. In our protocol, the security criteria are quantitatively guaranteed even with finite block-length code based on the evaluation of error of the estimation of channel.
