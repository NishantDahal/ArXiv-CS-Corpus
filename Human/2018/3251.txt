A hypothesis in evolutionary biology

The classic Trivers-Willard hypothesis suggested the existence of means or conditions able to influence or control the sex of the offspring. Here I propose that mechanisms for the alteration of the gender of the offspring could possibly be formulated in terms of a distributed system of messages expressing a change in the environmental conditions. Such messages would provide the biological organization with global and local assessments of the benefits associated with the reproductive investments associated with either genres of the offspring.
