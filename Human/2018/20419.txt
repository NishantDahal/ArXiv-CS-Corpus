A Survey on Simulation Tools and Testbeds for Cognitive Radio Networks Study

Efficient utility of radio spectrum has been a hot topic as the wireless communication spectrum is a precious resource. The past decade has witnessed intensive research in spectrum sharing techniques. Most of the techniques are based on cognitive radio networks (CRNs) because cognitive capabilities are essential for optimizing spectrum efficiency and guaranteeing safe coexistence in the presence of the spectrum uncertainty. However, due to the high complexity of the problem, most research has been limited to theoretical analysis. It is non-trivial to build a simulator that is capable of carrying out a comprehensive experimental study. In this paper, a survey is conducted to provide a big picture of the available simulators in CRNs research. By illustrating their major functionalities, the insight enables researchers to select tools that match their needs. In addition, with a better understanding of the advantages and constraints, this survey aims at providing a guideline for simulator designers who have been trying to meet the requirements from the CRN research community.
