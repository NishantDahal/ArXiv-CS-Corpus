A Multi-channel DART Algorithm

Tomography deals with the reconstruction of objects from their projections, acquired along a range of angles. Discrete tomography is concerned with objects that consist of a small number of materials, which makes it possible to compute accurate reconstructions from highly limited projection data. For cases where the allowed intensity values in the reconstruction are known a priori, the discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) has shown to yield accurate reconstructions from few projections. However, a key limitation is that the benefit of DART diminishes as the number of different materials increases. Many tomographic imaging techniques can simultaneously record tomographic data at multiple channels, each corresponding to a different weighting of the materials in the object. Whenever projection data from more than one channel is available, this additional information can potentially be exploited by the reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we present Multi-Channel DART (MC-DART), which deals effectively with multi-channel data. This class of algorithms is a generalization of DART to multiple channels and combines the information for each separate channel-reconstruction in a multi-channel segmentation step. We demonstrate that in a range of simulation experiments, MC-DART is capable of producing more accurate reconstructions compared to single-channel DART.
