Statistical evaluation of the azimuth and elevation angles seen at the output of the receiving antenna

A method to evaluate the statistical properties of the reception angle seen at the input receiver that considers the receiving antenna pattern is presented. In particular, the impact of the direction and beamwidth of the antenna pattern on distribution of the reception angle is shown on the basis of 3D simulation studies. The obtained results show significant differences between distributions of angle of arrival and angle of reception. This means that the presented new method allows assessing the impact of the receiving antenna pattern on the correlation and spectral characteristics at the receiver input in simulation studies of wireless channel. The use of this method also provides an opportunity for analysis of a co-existence between small cells and wireless backhaul, what is currently a significant problem in designing 5G networks.
