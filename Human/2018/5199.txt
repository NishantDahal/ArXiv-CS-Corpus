LTE-advanced simulation framework based on OMNeT++

Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-Advanced) is the most recent mobile telecommunication technology proposed by 3GPP. LTE-Advanced is applied in some countries, but still in development and testing phase, because of that, a simulation model is needed to test this technology. This paper introduces a LTE-Advanced simulation framework based on OMNeT++ IDE (open source). The proposed framework test results showed that it is working properly and ready to be used. This framework can be considered as the beginning of the LTE-Advanced simulation model based on OMNeT++.
