Recognizing generating subgraphs revisited

A graph $G$ is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of the same cardinality. Assume that a weight function $w$ is defined on its vertices. Then $G$ is $w$-well-covered if all maximal independent sets are of the same weight. For every graph $G$, the set of weight functions $w$ such that $G$ is $w$-well-covered is a vector space, denoted as $WCW(G).$ Deciding whether an input graph $G$ is well-covered is co-NP-complete. Therefore, finding $WCW(G)$ is co-NP-hard. A generating subgraph of a graph $G$ is an induced complete bipartite subgraph $B$ of $G$ on vertex sets of bipartition $B_{X}$ and $B_{Y}$, such that each of $S \cup B_{X}$ and $S \cup B_{Y}$ is a maximal independent set of $G$, for some independent set $S$. If $B$ is generating, then $w(B_{X})=w(B_{Y})$ for every weight function $w \in WCW(G)$. Therefore, generating subgraphs play an important role in finding $WCW(G)$. The decision problem whether a subgraph of an input graph is generating is known to be NP-complete. In this article, we prove NP-completeness of the problem for graphs without cycles of length 3 and 5, and for bipartite graphs with girth at least 6. On the other and, we supply polynomial algorithms for recognizing generating subgraphs and finding $WCW(G)$, when the input graph is bipartite without cycles of length 6. We also present a polynomial algorithm which finds $WCW(G)$ when $G$ does not contain cycles of lengths 3, 4, 5, and 7.
