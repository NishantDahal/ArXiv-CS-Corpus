Correct by construction

Matrix code allows one to discover algorithms and to render them in code that is both compilable and is correct by construction. In this way the difficulty of verifying existing code is avoided. The method is especially important for logically dense code and when precision programming is called for. The paper explains both these concepts. Logically dense code is explained by means of the partition stage of the Quicksort algorithm. Precision programming is explained by means of fast exponentiation.
