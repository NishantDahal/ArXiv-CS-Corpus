Our Practice Of Using Machine Learning To Recognize Species By Voice

As the technology is advancing, audio recognition in machine learning is improved as well. Research in audio recognition has traditionally focused on speech. Living creatures (especially the small ones) are part of the whole ecosystem, monitoring as well as maintaining them are important tasks. Species such as animals and birds are tending to change their activities as well as their habitats due to the adverse effects on the environment or due to other natural or man-made calamities. For those in far deserted areas, we will not have any idea about their existence until we can continuously monitor them. Continuous monitoring will take a lot of hard work and labor. If there is no continuous monitoring, then there might be instances where endangered species may encounter dangerous situations. The best way to monitor those species are through audio recognition. Classifying sound can be a difficult task even for humans. Powerful audio signals and their processing techniques make it possible to detect audio of various species. There might be many ways wherein audio recognition can be done. We can train machines either by pre-recorded audio files or by recording them live and detecting them. The audio of species can be detected by removing all the background noise and echoes. Smallest sound is considered as a syllable. Extracting various syllables is the process we are focusing on which is known as audio recognition in terms of Machine Learning (ML).
