Group Handover Management in Mobile Femtocellular Network Deployment

The mobile femtocell is the new paradigm for the femtocellular network deployment. It can enhance the service quality for the users inside the vehicles. The deployment of mobile femtocells generates lot of handover calls. Also, number of group handover scenarios are found in mobile femtocellular network deployment. In this paper, we focus on the resource management for the group handover in mobile femtocellular network deployment. We discuss a number of group handover scenarios. We propose a resource management scheme that contains bandwidth adaptation policy and dynamic bandwidth reservation policy. The simulation results show that the proposed bandwidth management scheme significantly reduces the handover call dropping probability without reducing the bandwidth utilization.
