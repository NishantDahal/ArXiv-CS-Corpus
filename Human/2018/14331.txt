Decentralized Asynchronous Coded Caching in Fog-RAN

In this paper, we investigate asynchronous coded caching in fog radio access networks (F-RAN). To minimize the fronthaul load, the encoding set collapsing rule and encoding set partition method are proposed to establish the relationship between the coded-multicasting contents in asynchronous and synchronous coded caching. Furthermore, a decentralized asynchronous coded caching scheme is proposed, which provides asynchronous and synchronous transmission methods for different delay requirements. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme creates considerable coded-multicasting opportunities in asynchronous request scenarios.
