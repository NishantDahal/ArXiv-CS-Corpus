Robust Sequential Detection in Distributed Sensor Networks

We consider the problem of sequential binary hypothesis testing with a distributed sensor network in a non-Gaussian noise environment. To this end, we present a general formulation of the Consensus + Innovations Sequential Probability Ratio Test (CISPRT). Furthermore, we introduce two different concepts for robustifying the CISPRT and propose four different algorithms, namely, the Least-Favorable-Density-CISPRT, the Median-CISPRT, the M-CISPRT, and the Myriad-CISPRT. Subsequently, we analyze their suitability for different binary hypothesis tests before verifying and evaluating their performance in a shift-in-mean and a shift-in-variance scenario.
