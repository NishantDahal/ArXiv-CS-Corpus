Algorithms Inspired by Nature: A Survey

Nature is known to be the best optimizer. Natural processes most often than not reach an optimal equilibrium. Scientists have always strived to understand and model such processes.Thus, many algorithms exist today that are inspired by nature. Many of these algorithms and heuristics can be used to solve problems for which no polynomial time algorithms exist,such as Job Shop Scheduling and many other Combinatorial Optimization problems. We will discuss some of these algorithms and heuristics and how they help us solve complex problems of practical importance.
