An edge-fog-cloud platform for anticipatory learning process designed for Internet of Mobile Things

This paper presents a novel architecture for data analytics targeting an anticipatory learning process in the context of the Internet of Mobile Things. The architecture is geo-distributed and composed by edge, fog, and cloud resources that operate collectively to support such an anticipatory learning process. We designed the architecture to manage large volumes of data streams coming from the IoMT devices, analyze in successive phases climbing up in the hierarchy of resources from edge, fog and cloud. We discuss the characteristics of the analytical tasks at each layer. We notice that the amount of data being transported in the network decreases going from the edge, to the fog and finally to the cloud, while the complexity of the computation increases. Such design allows to support different kind of analytical needs, from real-time to historical according to the type of resource being utilized. We have implemented the proposed architecture as a proof-of-concept using the transit data feeds from the area of Greater Moncton, Canada.
