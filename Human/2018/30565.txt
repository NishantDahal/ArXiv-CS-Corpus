Visibility Extension via Reflective Edges to an Exact Quantity

We consider extending the visibility polygon of a given point $q$, inside a simple polygon $P$ by converting some edges of $P$ to mirrors. We will show that several variations of the problem of finding mirror-edges to add precisely $k$ units of area to $VP(q)$ are NP-complete. The optimal cases are NP-hard. We are unaware of any result on adding an exact number to a polygon, or covering an area with an exact surface. We deal with both single and multiple reflecting mirrors for both specular or diffuse types of reflections.
