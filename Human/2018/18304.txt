QR2: A Third-party Query Reranking Service Over Web Databases

The ranked retrieval model has rapidly become the de-facto way for search query processing in web databases. Despite the extensive efforts on designing better ranking mechanisms, in practice, many such databases fail to address the diverse and sometimes contradicting preferences of users. In this paper, we present QR2, a third-party service that uses nothing but the public search interface of a web database and enables the on-the-fly processing of queries with any user-specified ranking functions, no matter if the ranking function is supported by the database or not.
