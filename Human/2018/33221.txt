Choosability in bounded sequential list coloring

The list coloring problem is a variation of the classical vertex coloring problem, extensively studied in recent years, where each vertex has a restricted list of allowed colors, and having some variations as the $(γ,μ)$-coloring, where the color lists have sequential values with known lower and upper bounds. This work discusses the choosability property, that consists in determining the least number $k$ for which it has a proper list coloring no matter how one assigns a list of $k$ colors to each vertex. This is a $Π_2^P$-complete problem, however, we show that $k$-$(γ,μ)$-choosability is an $NP$-problem due to its relation with the $k$-coloring of a graph and application of methods of proof in choosability for some classes of graphs, such as complete bipartite graph, which is $ 3 $-choosable, but $ 2 $-$(γ,μ)$-choosable.
