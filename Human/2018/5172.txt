A Switch to the Concern of User: Importance Coefficient in Utility Distribution and Message Importance Measure

This paper mainly focuses on the utilization frequency in receiving end of communication systems, which shows the inclination of the user about different symbols. When the average number of use is limited, a specific utility distribution is proposed on the best effort in term of fairness, which is also the closest one to occurring probability in the relative entropy. Similar to a switch, its parameter can be selected to make it satisfy different users' requirements: negative parameter means the user focus on high-probability events and positive parameter means the user is interested in small-probability events. In fact, the utility distribution is a measure of message importance in essence. It illustrates the meaning of message importance measure (MIM), and extend it to the general case by selecting the parameter. Numerical results show that this utility distribution characterizes the message importance like MIM and its parameter determines the concern of users.
