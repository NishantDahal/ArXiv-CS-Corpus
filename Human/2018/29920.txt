Developing Mobility and Traffic Visualization Applications for Connected Vehicles

This technical report is a catalog of two applications that have been enhanced and developed to augment vehicular networking research. The first application is already described in our previous work [21], while the second one is a desktop application that was developed as a publicly-hosted web app which allows any Internet-connected device to remotely monitor a roadway intersection's state over HTTP. This collaborative work was completed under and for the utility of ETSU's Vehicular Networking Lab. It can serve as a basis for further development in the field of connected and autonomous vehicles.
