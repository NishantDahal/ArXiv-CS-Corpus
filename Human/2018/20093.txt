D2D User Selection For Simultaneous Spectrum Sharing And Energy Harvesting

This paper presents a device-to-device (D2D) user selection protocol wherein multiple D2D pairs coexist with a cellular network. In the developed framework, certain D2D users harvest energy and share the spectrum of the cellular users by adopting a hybrid time switching and power splitting protocol. The D2D user which harvests the maximum energy and achieves the desired target rate for the cellular communication is selected to serve as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay for the cellular user. The proposed work analyzes the impact of increase in the number of D2D users on the performance of cellular user as well as derives an upper bound on the time duration of energy harvesting within which best possible rate for cellular user can be obtained. The performance of the proposed protocol has been quantified by obtaining the closed form expressions of outage probability.
