Persistent Betti numbers of random Čech complexes

We study the persistent homology of random Čech complexes. Generalizing a method of Penrose for studying random geometric graphs, we first describe an appropriate theoretical framework in which we can state and address our main questions. Then we define the kth persistent Betti number of a random Čech complex and determine its asymptotic order in the subcritical regime. This extends a result of Kahle on the asymptotic order of the ordinary kth Betti number of such complexes to the persistent setting.
