Cross-modality deep learning brings bright-field microscopy contrast to holography

Deep learning brings bright-field microscopy contrast to holographic images of a sample volume, bridging the volumetric imaging capability of holography with the speckle- and artifact-free image contrast of bright-field incoherent microscopy.
