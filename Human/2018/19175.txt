Computational steering of complex flow simulations

Computational Steering, the combination of a simulation back-end with a visualisation front-end, offers great possibilities to exploit and optimise scenarios in engineering applications. Due to its interactivity, it requires fast grid generation, simulation, and visualisation and, therefore, mostly has to rely on coarse and inaccurate simulations typically performed on rather small interactive computing facilities and not on much more powerful high-performance computing architectures operated in batch-mode. This paper presents a steering environment that intends to bring these two worlds - the interactive and the classical HPC world - together in an integrated way. The environment consists of efficient fluid dynamics simulation codes and a steering and visualisation framework providing a user interface, communication methods for distributed steering, and parallel visualisation tools. The gap between steering and HPC is bridged by a hierarchical approach that performs fast interactive simulations for many scenario variants increasing the accuracy via hierarchical refinements in dependence of the time the user wants to wait. Finally, the user can trigger large simulations for selected setups on an HPC architecture exploiting the pre-computations already done on the interactive system.
