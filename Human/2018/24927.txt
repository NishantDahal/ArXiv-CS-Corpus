Slotted ALOHA Overlay on LoRaWAN: a Distributed Synchronization Approach

LoRaWAN is one of the most promising standards for IoT applications. Nevertheless, the high density of end-devices expected for each gateway, the absence of an effective synchronization scheme between gateway and end-devices, challenge the scalability of these networks. In this article, we propose to regulate the communication of LoRaWAN networks using a Slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA) instead of the classic ALOHA approach used by LoRa. The implementation is an overlay on top of the standard LoRaWAN; thus no modification in pre-existing LoRaWAN firmware and libraries is necessary. Our method is based on a novel distributed synchronization service that is suitable for low-cost IoT end-nodes. S-ALOHA supported by our synchronization service significantly improves the performance of traditional LoRaWAN networks regarding packet loss rate and network throughput.
