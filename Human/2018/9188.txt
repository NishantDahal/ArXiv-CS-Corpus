Bounds for Energy-Efficient Survivable IP Over WDM Networks With Network Coding

In this work, we establish analytic bounds for the energy efficiency of 1 + 1 survivable IP over WDM networks using network coding. The analytic bounds are shown to be in close agreement with our previously reported results. They provide verification of the MILP and heuristics proposed previously, in addition to an efficient, compact means to evaluate network results and allow the performance of large networks to be determined easily.
