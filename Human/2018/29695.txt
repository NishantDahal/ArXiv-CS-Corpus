Knowledge Management in Software Engineering: A Systematic Review of Studied Concepts, Findings and Research Methods Used

Software engineering is knowledge-intensive work, and how to manage software engineering knowledge has received much attention. This systematic review identifies empirical studies of knowledge management initiatives in software engineering, and discusses the concepts studied, the major findings, and the research methods used. Seven hundred and sixty-two articles were identified, of which 68 were studies in an industry context. Of these, 29 were empirical studies and 39 reports of lessons learned. More than half of the empirical studies were case studies. The majority of empirical studies relate to technocratic and behavioural aspects of knowledge management, while there are few studies relating to economic, spatial and cartographic approaches. A finding reported across multiple papers was the need to not focus exclusively on explicit knowledge, but also consider tacit knowledge. We also describe implications for research and for practice.
