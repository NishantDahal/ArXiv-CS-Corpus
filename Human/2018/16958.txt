Strong Secrecy on a Class of Degraded Broadcast Channels Using Polar Codes

Different polar coding schemes are proposed for the memoryless degraded broadcast channel under different reliability and secrecy requirements: layered decoding and/or layered secrecy. In this setting, the transmitter wishes to send multiple messages to a set of legitimate receivers keeping them masked from a set of eavesdroppers. The layered decoding structure requires receivers with better channel quality to reliably decode more messages, while the layered secrecy structure requires eavesdroppers with worse channel quality to be kept ignorant of more messages. The implementation of the proposed polar coding schemes is discussed and their performance is evaluated by simulations for the symmetric degraded broadcast channel.
