Taxi Demand-Supply Forecasting: Impact of Spatial Partitioning on the Performance of Neural Networks

In this paper, we investigate the significance of choosing an appropriate tessellation strategy for a spatio-temporal taxi demand-supply modeling framework. Our study compares (i) the variable-sized polygon based Voronoi tessellation, and (ii) the fixed-sized grid based Geohash tessellation, using taxi demand-supply GPS data for the cities of Bengaluru, India and New York, USA. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for modeling and incorporating information from spatial neighbors into the model. We find that the LSTM model based on input features extracted from a variable-sized polygon tessellation yields superior performance over the LSTM model based on fixed-sized grid tessellation. Our study highlights the need to explore multiple spatial partitioning techniques for improving the prediction performance in neural network models.
