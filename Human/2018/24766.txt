An iterative method for classification of binary data

In today's data driven world, storing, processing, and gleaning insights from large-scale data are major challenges. Data compression is often required in order to store large amounts of high-dimensional data, and thus, efficient inference methods for analyzing compressed data are necessary. Building on a recently designed simple framework for classification using binary data, we demonstrate that one can improve classification accuracy of this approach through iterative applications whose output serves as input to the next application. As a side consequence, we show that the original framework can be used as a data preprocessing step to improve the performance of other methods, such as support vector machines. For several simple settings, we showcase the ability to obtain theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of the iterative classification method. The simplicity of the underlying classification framework makes it amenable to theoretical analysis and studying this approach will hopefully serve as a step toward developing theory for more sophisticated deep learning technologies.
