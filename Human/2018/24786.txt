Well Quasiorders and Hierarchy Theory

We discuss some applications of WQOs to several fields were hierarchies and reducibilities are the principal classification tools, notably to Descriptive Set Theory, Computability theory and Automata Theory. While the classical hierarchies of sets usually degenerate to structures very close to ordinals, the extension of them to functions requires more complicated WQOs, and the same applies to reducibilities. We survey some results obtained so far and discuss open problems and possible research directions.
