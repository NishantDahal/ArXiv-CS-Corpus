AI in Game Playing: Sokoban Solver

Artificial Intelligence is becoming instrumental in a variety of applications. Games serve as a good breeding ground for trying and testing these algorithms in a sandbox with simpler constraints in comparison to real life. In this project, we aim to develop an AI agent that can solve the classical Japanese game of Sokoban using various algorithms and heuristics and compare their performances through standard metrics.
