Enumerating projections of integer points in unbounded polyhedra

We extend the Barvinok-Woods algorithm for enumerating projections of integer points in polytopes to unbounded polyhedra. For this, we obtain a new structural result on projections of semilinear subsets of the integer lattice. We extend the results to general formulas in Presburger Arithmetic. We also give an application to the k-Frobenius problem.
