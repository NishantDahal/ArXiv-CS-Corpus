Study of SIC and RLS Channel Estimation for Large-Scale Antenna Systems with 1-Bit ADCs

We propose a novel low-resolution-aware recursive least squares channel estimation algorithm for uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output systems. In order to reduce the energy consumption, 1-bit ADCs are used on each receive antenna. The loss of performance can be recovered by the large-scale antenna arrays at the receiver. The proposed adaptive channel estimator can mitigate the distortions due to the coarse quantization. Moreover, we propose a low-resolution-aware minimum mean square error based successive interference canceler to successively mitigate the multiuser interference. Simulation results show good performance of the system in terms of mean square error and bit error rate.
