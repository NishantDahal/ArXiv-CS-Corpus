Customizing an Adversarial Example Generator with Class-Conditional GANs

Adversarial examples are intentionally crafted data with the purpose of deceiving neural networks into misclassification. When we talk about strategies to create such examples, we usually refer to perturbation-based methods that fabricate adversarial examples by applying invisible perturbations onto normal data. The resulting data reserve their visual appearance to human observers, yet can be totally unrecognizable to DNN models, which in turn leads to completely misleading predictions. In this paper, however, we consider crafting adversarial examples from existing data as a limitation to example diversity. We propose a non-perturbation-based framework that generates native adversarial examples from class-conditional generative adversarial networks.As such, the generated data will not resemble any existing data and thus expand example diversity, raising the difficulty in adversarial defense. We then extend this framework to pre-trained conditional GANs, in which we turn an existing generator into an "adversarial-example generator". We conduct experiments on our approach for MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets and have satisfactory results, showing that this approach can be a potential alternative to previous attack strategies.
