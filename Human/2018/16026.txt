Geographic Centroid Routing for Vehicular Networks

A number of geolocation-based Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) routing protocols have been shown to perform well in selected simulation and mobility scenarios. However, the suitability of these mechanisms for vehicular networks utilizing widely-available inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) hardware has not been evaluated. We propose a novel geolocation-based routing primitive (Centroid Routing) that is resilient to the measurement errors commonly present in low-cost GPS devices. Using this notion of Centroids, we construct two novel routing protocols and evaluate their performance with respect to positional errors as well as traditional DTN routing metrics. We show that they outperform existing approaches by a significant margin.
