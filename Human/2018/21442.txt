Multicast Triangular Semilattice Network

We investigate the structure of the code graph of a multicast network that has a characteristic shape of an inverted equilateral triangle. We provide a criterion that determines the validity of a receiver placement within the code graph, present invariance properties of the determinants corresponding to receiver placements under symmetries, and provide a complete study of these networks' receivers and required field sizes up to a network of 4 sources. We also improve on various definitions related to code graphs.
