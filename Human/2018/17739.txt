On the Geodetic Hull Number of Complementary Prisms

Let $G$ be a finite, simple, and undirected graph and let $S$ be a set of vertices of $G$. In the geodetic convexity, a set of vertices $S$ of a graph $G$ is convex if all vertices belonging to any shortest path between two vertices of $S$ lie in $S$. The convex hull $H(S)$ of $S$ is the smallest convex set containing $S$. If $H(S) = V(G)$, then $S$ is a hull set. The cardinality $h(G)$ of a minimum hull set of $G$ is the hull number of $G$. The complementary prism $G\overline{G}$ of a graph $G$ arises from the disjoint union of the graph $G$ and $\overline{G}$ by adding the edges of a perfect matching between the corresponding vertices of $G$ and $\overline{G}$. Motivated by previous work, we determine and present lower and upper bounds on the hull number of complementary prisms of trees, disconnected graphs and cographs. We also show that the hull number on complementary prisms cannot be limited in the geodetic convexity, unlike the $P_3$-convexity.
