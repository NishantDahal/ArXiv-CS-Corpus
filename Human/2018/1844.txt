Automatic Cardiac Disease Assessment on cine-MRI via Time-Series Segmentation and Domain Specific Features

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging improves on diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases by providing images at high spatiotemporal resolution. Manual evaluation of these time-series, however, is expensive and prone to biased and non-reproducible outcomes. In this paper, we present a method that addresses named limitations by integrating segmentation and disease classification into a fully automatic processing pipeline. We use an ensemble of UNet inspired architectures for segmentation of cardiac structures such as the left and right ventricular cavity (LVC, RVC) and the left ventricular myocardium (LVM) on each time instance of the cardiac cycle. For the classification task, information is extracted from the segmented time-series in form of comprehensive features handcrafted to reflect diagnostic clinical procedures. Based on these features we train an ensemble of heavily regularized multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and a random forest classifier to predict the pathologic target class. We evaluated our method on the ACDC dataset (4 pathology groups, 1 healthy group) and achieve dice scores of 0.945 (LVC), 0.908 (RVC) and 0.905 (LVM) in a cross-validation over the training set (100 cases) and 0.950 (LVC), 0.923 (RVC) and 0.911 (LVM) on the test set (50 cases). We report a classification accuracy of 94% on a training set cross-validation and 92% on the test set. Our results underpin the potential of machine learning methods for accurate, fast and reproducible segmentation and computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD).
