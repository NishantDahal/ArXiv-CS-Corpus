Autoencoders, Kernels, and Multilayer Perceptrons for Electron Micrograph Restoration and Compression

We present 14 autoencoders, 15 kernels and 14 multilayer perceptrons for electron micrograph restoration and compression. These have been trained for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and for both (TEM+STEM). TEM autoencoders have been trained for 1$\times$, 4$\times$, 16$\times$ and 64$\times$ compression, STEM autoencoders for 1$\times$, 4$\times$ and 16$\times$ compression and TEM+STEM autoencoders for 1$\times$, 2$\times$, 4$\times$, 8$\times$, 16$\times$, 32$\times$ and 64$\times$ compression. Kernels and multilayer perceptrons have been trained to approximate the denoising effect of the 4$\times$ compression autoencoders. Kernels for input sizes of 3, 5, 7, 11 and 15 have been fitted for TEM, STEM and TEM+STEM. TEM multilayer perceptrons have been trained with 1 hidden layer for input sizes of 3, 5 and 7 and with 2 hidden layers for input sizes of 5 and 7. STEM multilayer perceptrons have been trained with 1 hidden layer for input sizes of 3, 5 and 7. TEM+STEM multilayer perceptrons have been trained with 1 hidden layer for input sizes of 3, 5, 7 and 11 and with 2 hidden layers for input sizes of 3 and 7.
