Verifiable Computations with RAM-like Running Times

Current and emerging trends such as cloud computing, fog computing, and more recently, multi-access edge computing (MEC) increase the interest in finding solutions to the verifiable computation problem. Furthermore, the number of computationally weak devices have increased drastically in recent years due to the ongoing realization of the Internet of Things. This work proposes a solution which enjoys the following two desirable properties: (1) cost of input preparation and verification is very low (low enough to allow verifiable outsourcing of computations by resource-constrained devices on constrained networks); (2) the running time of the verifiable computation is RAM-like.
