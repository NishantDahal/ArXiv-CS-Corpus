Scientific Relation Extraction with Selectively Incorporated Concept Embeddings

This paper describes our submission for the SemEval 2018 Task 7 shared task on semantic relation extraction and classification in scientific papers. We extend the end-to-end relation extraction model of (Miwa and Bansal) with enhancements such as a character-level encoding attention mechanism on selecting pretrained concept candidate embeddings. Our official submission ranked the second in relation classification task (Subtask 1.1 and Subtask 2 Senerio 2), and the first in the relation extraction task (Subtask 2 Scenario 1).
