A PTAS for vertex guarding weakly-visible polygons - An extended abstract

In this extended abstract, we present a PTAS for guarding the vertices of a weakly-visible polygon $P$ from a subset of its vertices, or in other words, a PTAS for computing a minimum dominating set of the visibility graph of the vertices of $P$. We then show how to obtain a PTAS for vertex guarding $P$'s boundary.
