Recent Advances in Mobile Grid and Cloud Computing

Grid and cloud computing systems have been extensively used to solve large and complex problems in science and engineering areas. These systems include powerful computing resources connected through high-speed networks. Due to recent advances in mobile computing and networking technologies, it has become feasible to integrate various mobile devices such as robots, aerial vehicles, sensors, and smartphones with grid and cloud computing systems. This integration enables design and development of next generation of applications through sharing of resources in mobile environments and also introduces several challenges due to dynamic and unpredictable network. This paper discusses applications, research challenges involved in design and development of mobile grid and cloud computing systems, and recent advances in the field.
