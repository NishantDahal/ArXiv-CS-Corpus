Energy-Efficient Downlink Power Control in mmWave Cell-Free and User-Centric Massive MIMO

This paper considers cell-free and user-centric approaches for coverage improvement in wireless cellular systems operating at millimeter wave frequencies, and proposes downlink power control algorithms aimed at maximizing the global energy efficiency. To tackle the non-convexity of the problems, an interaction between sequential and alternating optimization is considered. The use of hybrid analog/digital beamformers is also taken into account. The numerical results show the benefits obtained from the power control algorithm, as well as that the user-centric approach generally outperforms the cell-free one.
