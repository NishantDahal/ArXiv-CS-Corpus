Linguistic Legal Concept Extraction in Portuguese

This work investigates legal concepts and their expression in Portuguese, concentrating on the "Order of Attorneys of Brazil" Bar exam. Using a corpus formed by a collection of multiple-choice questions, three norms related to the Ethics part of the OAB exam, language resources (Princeton WordNet and OpenWordNet-PT) and tools (AntConc and Freeling), we began to investigate the concepts and words missing from our repertory of concepts and words in Portuguese, the knowledge base OpenWordNet-PT. We add these concepts and words to OpenWordNet-PT and hence obtain a representation of these texts that is "contained" in the lexical knowledge base.
