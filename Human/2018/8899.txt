A Survey of Fog Computing and Communication: Current Researches and Future Directions

In this survey, we discuss the evolution of distributed computing from the utility computing to the fog computing, various research challenges for the development of fog computing environments, the current status on fog computing research along with a taxonomy of various existing works in this direction. Then, we focus on the architectures of fog computing systems, technologies for enabling fog, fog computing features, security and privacy of fog, the QoS parameters, applications of fog, and give critical insights of various works done on this domain. Lastly, we briefly discuss about different fog computing associations that closely work on the development of fog based platforms and services, and give a summary of various types of overheads associated with fog computing platforms. Finally, we provide a thorough discussion on the future scopes and open research areas in fog computing as an enabler for the next generation computing paradigm.
