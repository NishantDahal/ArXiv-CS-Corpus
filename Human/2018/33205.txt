Transceiver Design for Ambient Backscatter Communication over Frequency-Selective Channels

Existing studies about ambient backscatter communication mostly assume flat-fading channels. However, frequency-selective channels widely exist in many practical scenarios. Therefore, this paper investigates ambient backscatter communication systems over frequency-selective channels. In particular, we propose an interference-free transceiver design to facilitate signal detection at the reader. Our design utilizes the cyclic prefix (CP) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) source symbols, which can cancel the signal interference and thus enhance the detection accuracy at the reader. Meanwhile, our design leads to no interference on the existing OFDM communication systems. Next we suggest a chi-square based detector for the reader and derive the optimal detection threshold. Simulations are then provided to corroborate our proposed studies.
