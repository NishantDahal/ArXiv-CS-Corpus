Computing the $k$-coverage of a wireless network

Coverage is one of the main quality of service of a wirelessnetwork. $k$-coverage, that is to be covered simultaneously by $k$network nodes,  is synonym of reliability and numerous applicationssuch as multiple site MIMO features, or handovers. We introduce here anew algorithm for computing the $k$-coverage of a wirelessnetwork. Our method is based on the observation that $k$-coverage canbe interpreted as $k$ layers of $1$-coverage, or simply coverage. Weuse simplicial homology to compute the network's topology and areduction algorithm to indentify the layers of $1$-coverage. Weprovide figures and simulation results to illustrate our algorithm.
