Construction D$^\prime$ Lattices from Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes

Recently, Branco da Silva and Silva described an efficient encoding and decoding algorithm for Construction D$^\prime$ lattices. Using their algorithm, we propose a Construction D$^\prime$ lattice based on binary quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LPDC) codes and single parity-check product codes. The underlying codes designed by the balanced-distances rule contribute in a balanced manner to the squared minimum distance of the constructed lattice, which results in a high lattice coding gain. The proposed lattice based on IEEE 802.16e QC-LDPC codes is shown to provide competitive error-rate performance on the power-unconstrained additive white Gaussian noise channel.
