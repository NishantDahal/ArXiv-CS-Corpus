A distinct approach to diagnose Dengue Fever with the help of Soft Set Theory

Mathematics has played a substantial role to revolutionize the medical science. Intelligent systems based on mathematical theories have proved to be efficient in diagnosing various diseases. In this paper, we used an expert system based on soft set theory and fuzzy set theory named as a soft expert system to diagnose tropical disease dengue. The objective to use soft expert system is to predict the risk level of a patient having dengue fever by using input variables like age, TLC, SGOT, platelets count and blood pressure. The proposed method explicitly demonstrates the exact percentage of the risk level of dengue fever automatically circumventing for all possible (medical) imprecisions.
