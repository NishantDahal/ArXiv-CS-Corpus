Vehicle Re-identification Using Quadruple Directional Deep Learning Features

In order to resist the adverse effect of viewpoint variations for improving vehicle re-identification performance, we design quadruple directional deep learning networks to extract quadruple directional deep learning features (QD-DLF) of vehicle images. The quadruple directional deep learning networks are with similar overall architecture, including the same basic deep learning architecture but different directional feature pooling layers. Specifically, the same basic deep learning architecture is a shortly and densely connected convolutional neural network to extract basic feature maps of an input square vehicle image in the first stage. Then, the quadruple directional deep learning networks utilize different directional pooling layers, i.e., horizontal average pooling (HAP) layer, vertical average pooling (VAP) layer, diagonal average pooling (DAP) layer and anti-diagonal average pooling (AAP) layer, to compress the basic feature maps into horizontal, vertical, diagonal and anti-diagonal directional feature maps, respectively.
  Finally, these directional feature maps are spatially normalized and concatenated together as a quadruple directional deep learning feature for vehicle re-identification. Extensive experiments on both VeRi and VehicleID databases show that the proposed QD-DLF approach outperforms multiple state-of-the-art vehicle re-identification methods.
