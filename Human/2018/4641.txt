Minimax Lower Bounds on Dictionary Learning for Tensor Data

This paper provides fundamental limits on the sample complexity of estimating dictionaries for tensor data. The specific focus of this work is on $K$th-order tensor data and the case where the underlying dictionary can be expressed in terms of $K$ smaller dictionaries. It is assumed the data are generated by linear combinations of these structured dictionary atoms and observed through white Gaussian noise. This work first provides a general lower bound on the minimax risk of dictionary learning for such tensor data and then adapts the proof techniques for specialized results in the case of sparse and sparse-Gaussian linear combinations. The results suggest the sample complexity of dictionary learning for tensor data can be significantly lower than that for unstructured data: for unstructured data it scales linearly with the product of the dictionary dimensions, whereas for tensor-structured data the bound scales linearly with the sum of the product of the dimensions of the (smaller) component dictionaries. A partial converse is provided for the case of 2nd-order tensor data to show that the bounds in this paper can be tight. This involves developing an algorithm for learning highly-structured dictionaries from noisy tensor data. Finally, numerical experiments highlight the advantages associated with explicitly accounting for tensor data structure during dictionary learning.
