Sonifying stochastic walks on biomolecular energy landscapes

Translating the complex, multi-dimensional data from simulations of biomolecules to intuitive knowledge is a major challenge in computational chemistry and biology. The so-called "free energy landscape" is amongst the most fundamental concepts used by scientists to understand both static and dynamic properties of biomolecular systems. In this paper we use Markov models to design a strategy for mapping features of this landscape to sonic parameters, for use in conjunction with visual display techniques such as structural animations and free energy diagrams.
