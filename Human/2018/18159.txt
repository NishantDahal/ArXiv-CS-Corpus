Towards a Circular Economy via Intelligent Metamaterials

The present study proposes the use of intelligent metasurfaces in the design of products, as enforcers of circular economy principles. Intelligent metasurfaces can tune their physical properties (electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical) by receiving software commands. When incorporated within products and spaces they can mitigate the resource waste caused by inefficient, partially optimized designs and security concerns. Thus, circular economy and fast-paced product design become compatible. The study begins by considering electromagnetic metamaterials, and proposes a complete methodology for their deployment. Finally, it is shown that the same principles can be extended to the control of mechanical properties of objects, exemplary enabling the micro-management of vibrations and heat, with unprecedented circular economy potential.
