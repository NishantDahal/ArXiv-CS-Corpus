Toward modern educational IT-ecosystems: from learning management systems to digital platforms

The development of a learning management system (LMS) as a key service seems to be very effective for creation of educational digital platforms. Such platforms for both higher education institutions and various companies can provide the opportunities for networked forms of educational communication, improve the quality of the perception of innovative technologies and support tools for progress of talented youth as well as knowledge transfer. An example of such LMS is presented. The paper focuses on the demand for further development of learning management systems, their integration with modern digital platforms and potential exploitation as key services of such platforms in the context of the current educational trends of Industry 4.0 and the global trend towards a transition to a digital economy. The implementation of artificial intelligence technologies into the educational process is mentioned as an innovative way to form IT-ecosystems of modern education.
