How game complexity affects the playing behavior of synthetic agents

Agent based simulation of social organizations, via the investigation of agents' training and learning tactics and strategies, has been inspired by the ability of humans to learn from social environments which are rich in agents, interactions and partial or hidden information. Such richness is a source of complexity that an effective learner has to be able to navigate. This paper focuses on the investigation of the impact of the environmental complexity on the game playing-and-learning behavior of synthetic agents. We demonstrate our approach using two independent turn-based zero-sum games as the basis of forming social events which are characterized both by competition and cooperation. The paper's key highlight is that as the complexity of a social environment changes, an effective player has to adapt its learning and playing profile to maintain a given performance profile
