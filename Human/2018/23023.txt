Ologisms

We introduce ologisms. They generate from ologs by extending their logical expressivity, from the possibility of considering constraints of equational nature only to the possibility of considering constraints of syllogistic nature, in addition. This is obtained by taking advantage of the peculiar features of an original diagrammatic logical calculus for the syllogistic, that make it well-behaved with respect to the design of ologs.
