Evaluation of Energy-efficient VM Consolidation for Cloud Based Data Center - Revisited

In this paper, a re-evaluation undertaken for dynamic VM consolidation problem and optimal online deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration in an experimental environment. We proceeded to focus on energy and performance trade-off by planet lab workload traces, which consists of a thousand Planetlab VMs with widespread simulation environments. All experiments are done in a simulated cloud environment by the CloudSim simulation tool. A new paradigm of utility-oriented IT services is cloud computing, which offers a pay-as-you-go model. In recent years, there has been increasing interest among many users from business, scientific, engineering and educational territories in cloud computing. There is increasing concern that high energy consumption issues are a disadvantage for various institutions. However, so far too little attention has been given to the various methods to reduce energy consumption in cloud environments while ensuring performance. Besides the evaluation of energy-efficient data center management algorithms in the cloud, we proposed a further research directed toward the development of energy efficient algorithms. By the experimental evaluation of the current proposal for the competitive analysis of dynamic VM consolidation and optimal online deterministic algorithms for the single VM migration, we found different results for different algorithm combinations. Cloud-based data centers` consume massive energy, which has a negative effect on the environment and operational cost, this work contributes to the energy consumption reduction in the cloud environment.
