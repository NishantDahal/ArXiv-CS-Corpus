Barqi Breed Sheep Weight Estimation based on Neural Network with Regression

Computer vision is a very powerful method for understanding the contents from the images. We tried to utilize this powerful technology to make the difficult task of estimating sheep weights quick and accurate. It has enabled us to minimize the human involvement in measuring weight of the sheep. We are using a novel approach for segmentation and neural network based regression model for achieving better results for the task of estimating sheep weight.
