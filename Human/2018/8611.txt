Automatic Detection of Indoor and Outdoor Scenarios using NMEA Message Data from GPS Receivers

Detection of indoor and outdoor scenarios is an important resource for many types of activities such as multisensor navigation and location-based services. This research presents the use of NMEA data provided by GPS receivers to characterize different types of scenarios automatically. A set of static tests was performed to evaluate metrics such as number of satellites, positioning solution geometry and carrier-to-receiver noise-density ratio values to detect possible patterns to determine indoor and outdoor scenarios. Subsequently, validation tests are applied to verify that parameters obtained are adequate.
