Intermediate Level Adversarial Attack for Enhanced Transferability

Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, malicious inputs crafted to fool trained models. Adversarial examples often exhibit black-box transfer, meaning that adversarial examples for one model can fool another model. However, adversarial examples may be overfit to exploit the particular architecture and feature representation of a source model, resulting in sub-optimal black-box transfer attacks to other target models. This leads us to introduce the Intermediate Level Attack (ILA), which attempts to fine-tune an existing adversarial example for greater black-box transferability by increasing its perturbation on a pre-specified layer of the source model. We show that our method can effectively achieve this goal and that we can decide a nearly-optimal layer of the source model to perturb without any knowledge of the target models.
