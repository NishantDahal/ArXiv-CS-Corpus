A Time- and Message-Optimal Distributed Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees

This paper presents a randomized Las Vegas distributed algorithm that constructs a minimum spanning tree (MST) in weighted networks with optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) time and message complexity. This algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(D + \sqrt{n})$ time and exchanges $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages (both with high probability), where $n$ is the number of nodes of the network, $D$ is the diameter, and $m$ is the number of edges. This is the first distributed MST algorithm that matches \emph{simultaneously} the time lower bound of $\tilde立(D + \sqrt{n})$ [Elkin, SIAM J. Comput. 2006] and the message lower bound of $立(m)$ [Kutten et al., J.ACM 2015] (which both apply to randomized algorithms).
  The prior time and message lower bounds are derived using two completely different graph constructions; the existing lower bound construction that shows one lower bound {\em does not} work for the other. To complement our algorithm, we present a new lower bound graph construction for which any distributed MST algorithm requires \emph{both} $\tilde立(D + \sqrt{n})$ rounds and $立(m)$ messages.
