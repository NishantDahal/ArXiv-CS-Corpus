Cyber Physical Systems: Prospects and Challenges

Cyber physical systems CPSs embodies the conception as well as the implementation of the integration of the state-of-art technologies in sensing, communication, computing, and control. Such systems incorporate new trends such as cloud computing, mobile computing, mobile sensing, new modes of communications, wearables, etc. In this article we give an exposition of the architecture of a typical CPS system and the prospects of such systems in the development of the modern world. We illustrate the three major challenges faced by a CPS system: the need for rigorous numerical computation, the limitation of the current wireless communication bandwidth, and the computation/storage limitation by mobility and energy consumption. We address each one of these exposing the current techniques devised to solve each one of them.
