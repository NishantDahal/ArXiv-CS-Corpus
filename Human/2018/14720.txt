5G-CORNET: Platform as a Service

Practical testing of the latest wireless communications standards requires the availability of flexible radio frequency hardware, networking and computing resources. We are providing a Cloud-based infrastructure which offers the necessary resources to carry out tests of the latest 5G standards. The testbed provides a Cloud-based Infrastructure as a Service. The research community can access hardware and software resources through a virtual plat-form that enables isolation and customization of experiments. In other words, researchers have control over the preferred experimental architecture and can run concurrent experiments on the same testbed. This paper introduces the resources that can be used to develop 5G testbeds and experiments.
