Consistency Checking of Functional Requirements

Requirements are informal and semi-formal descriptions of the expected behavior of a system. They are usually expressed in the form of natural language sentences and checked for errors manually, e.g., by peer reviews. Manual checks are error-prone, time-consuming and not scalable. With the increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems and the need of operating in safety- and security-critical environments, it became essential to automatize the consistency check of requirements and build artifacts to help system engineers in the design process.
