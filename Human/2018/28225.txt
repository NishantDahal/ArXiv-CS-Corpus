A New Guard-Band Call Admission Control Policy Based on Acceptance Factor for Wireless Cellular Networks

To ensure the maximum utilization of the limited bandwidth resources and improved quality of service (QoS) is the key issue for wireless communication networks. Excessive call blocking is a constraint to attain the desired QoS. In cellular network, as the traffic arrival rate increases, call blocking probability (CBP) increases considerably. Paying profound concern, we proposed a scheme that reduces the call blocking probability with approximately steady call dropping probability (CDP). Our proposed scheme also introduces the acceptance factor in specific guard channel where originating calls get access according to the acceptance factor. The analytical performance proves better performance than the conventional new-call bounding scheme in case of higher and lower traffic arrival rate.
