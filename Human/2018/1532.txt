Signed Graph Analysis for the Interpretation of Voting Behavior

In a signed graph, each link is labeled with either a positive or a negative sign. This is particularly appropriate to model polarized systems. Such a graph can be characterized through the notion of structural balance, which relies on the partitioning of the graph into internally solidary but mutually hostile subgroups. In this work, we show that signed graphs can be used to model and understand voting behavior. We take advantage of data from the European Parliament to confront two variants of structural balance, and illustrate how their use can help better understanding the studied system.
