On-line Remote EKG as a Web Service

A 3-leads, non-diagnostic EKG has a role in emergency rescue and homecare. In this paper we introduce the design and a prototype of a service, provided to a doctor and a patient, for the on-line remote visualization of patient's 3-leads EKG. The architecture is based on the HTTP protocol, using commercial off-the-shelf devices to implement the sensor on patient's side, a browser on a laptop PC on the doctor's side as viewer, and a cloud container to connect the two using Websockets. A prototype is built to evaluate signal latency, power consumption of the patient side device, and the quality of the rendering. After some experiments, latency is measured below $1sec$, and power consumption is estimated in the 2A*3.3V range; visualization is comparable to commercial, non-diagnostic products. The prototype patient device is portable, and can be operated using rechargeable battery packs. Its cost is below 100\$, and all the required equipment is commercially available. The architecture is ready for on field evaluation, and we indicate how to improve power consumption while reducing cost.
