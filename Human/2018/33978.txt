CiteScore metrics: Creating journal metrics from the Scopus citation index

In December 2016, after several years of development, Elsevier launched a set of transparent, comprehensive, current, and freely-available journal citation metrics called CiteScore metrics. Most of the CiteScore metrics are static, annual indicators calculated from the dynamic Scopus citation index. In the spirit of recent public statements on the responsible use of metrics, we outline the desirable characteristics of journal citation metrics, discuss how we decided on the cited and citing publications years and document types to be used for CiteScore metrics, and detail the precise method of calculation of each metric. We further discuss CiteScore metrics eligibility criteria and online display choices, as well as our approach to calculating static indicators from the dynamic citation index. Finally, we look at the feedback the metrics have so far received and how CiteScore is already developing in response.
