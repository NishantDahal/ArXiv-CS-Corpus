A conjecture on permutation trinomials over finite fields of characteristic two

In this paper, by analyzing the quadratic factors of an $11$-th degree polynomial over the finite field $\ftwon$, a conjecture on permutation trinomials over $\ftwon[x]$ proposed very recently by Deng and Zheng is settled, where $n=2m$ and $m$ is a positive integer with $\gcd(m,5)=1$.
