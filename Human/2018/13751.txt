Buffering Time Strategies for Wireless Full-duplex Systems under Poisson Traffic

Full-duplex wireless communication has the potential to double the capacity of wireless networks by reducing the band occupancy of transmissions. However, a full-duplex capability cannot always reduce the band occupancy because the real traffic is not fully buffered. Buffering time while waiting for a packet to arrive at an opposite node is expected to reduce the band occupancy. In this study, we provide the first theoretical analysis of band occupancy and the mean waiting time for full-duplex communication with and without buffering time under traffic that is not fully buffered based on queueing theory, as well as the closed-form results. We also present the results of simulations of band occupancy and the mean waiting time. The basic analysis provided in this study shows how the mean waiting time and band occupancy are affected by the buffering time. When the buffering time is half the packet length, the band occupancy is reduced by approximately 15 %. In addition, under asymmetrical traffic, the results suggest that the buffering time should not be set at the node who has a higher traffic intensity compared with another node. These results support the design of a full-duplex medium access control protocol and devices.
