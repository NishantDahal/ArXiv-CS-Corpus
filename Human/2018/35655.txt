Cost-Benefit Analysis of Data Intelligence -- Its Broader Interpretations

The core of data science is our fundamental understanding about data intelligence processes for transforming data to decisions. One aspect of this understanding is how to analyze the cost-benefit of data intelligence workflows. This work is built on the information-theoretic metric proposed by Chen and Golan for this purpose and several recent studies and applications of the metric. We present a set of extended interpretations of the metric by relating the metric to encryption, compression, model development, perception, cognition, languages, and news media.
