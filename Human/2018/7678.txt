A Memory Controller with Row Buffer Locality Awareness for Hybrid Memory Systems

Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a class of promising scalable memory technologies that can potentially offer higher capacity than DRAM at the same cost point. Unfortunately, the access latency and energy of NVM is often higher than those of DRAM, while the endurance of NVM is lower. Many DRAM-NVM hybrid memory systems use DRAM as a cache to NVM, to achieve the low access latency, low energy, and high endurance of DRAM, while taking advantage of the large capacity of NVM. A key question for a hybrid memory system is what data to cache in DRAM to best exploit the advantages of each technology while avoiding the disadvantages of each technology as much as possible.
  We propose a new memory controller design that improves hybrid memory performance and energy efficiency. We observe that both DRAM and NVM banks employ row buffers that act as a cache for the most recently accessed memory row. Accesses that are row buffer hits incur similar latencies (and energy consumption) in both DRAM and NVM, whereas accesses that are row buffer misses incur longer latencies (and higher energy consumption) in NVM than in DRAM. To exploit this, we devise a policy that caches heavily-reused data that frequently misses in the NVM row buffers into DRAM. Our policy tracks the row buffer miss counts of recently-used rows in NVM, and caches in DRAM the rows that are predicted to incur frequent row buffer misses. Our proposed policy also takes into account the high write latencies of NVM, in addition to row buffer locality and more likely places the write-intensive pages in DRAM instead of NVM.
