Antimatroids Induced by Matchings

We explore novel connections between antimatroids and matchings in bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that a combinatorial structure induced by stable matchings or maximum-weight matchings is an antimatroid. Moreover, we demonstrate that every antimatroid admits such a representation by stable matchings and maximum-weight matchings.
