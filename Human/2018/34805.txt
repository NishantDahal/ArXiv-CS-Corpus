An Efficient Nonlinear Fourier Transform Algorithm for Detection of Eigenvalues from Continuous Spectrum

We present an efficient, fast and robust Nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) algorithm to detect eigenvalues of the discrete spectrum. It outperforms other known NFT algorithms as it detects the eigenvalues from the continuous spectrum, the numerically more robust part of the nonlinear spectrum.
