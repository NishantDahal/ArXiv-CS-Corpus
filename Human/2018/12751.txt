Architecture for Analysis of Streaming Data

While several attempts have been made to construct a scalable and flexible architecture for analysis of streaming data, no general model to tackle this task exists. Thus, our goal is to build a scalable and maintainable architecture for performing analytics on streaming data.
  To reach this goal, we introduce a 7-layered architecture consisting of microservices and publish-subscribe software. Our study shows that this architecture yields a good balance between scalability and maintainability due to high cohesion and low coupling of the solution, as well as asynchronous communication between the layers.
  This architecture can help practitioners to improve their analytic solutions. It is also of interest to academics, as it is a building block for a general architecture for processing streaming data.
