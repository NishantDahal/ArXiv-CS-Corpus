Linear Coded Caching Scheme for Centralized Networks

Coded caching systems have been widely studied to reduce the data transmission during the peak traffic time. In practice, two important parameters of a coded caching system should be considered, i.e., the rate which is the maximum amount of the data transmission during the peak traffic time, and the subpacketization level, the number of divided packets of each file when we implement a coded caching scheme. We prefer to design a scheme with rate and packet number as small as possible since they reflect the transmission efficiency and complexity of the caching scheme, respectively.
  In this paper, we first characterize a coded caching scheme from the viewpoint of linear algebra and show that designing a linear coded caching scheme is equivalent to constructing three classes of matrices satisfying some rank conditions. Then based on the invariant linear subspaces and combinatorial design theory, several classes of new coded caching schemes over $\mathbb{F}_2$ are obtained by constructing these three classes of matrices. It turns out that the rate of our new rate is the same as the scheme construct by Yan et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63, 5821-5833, 2017), but the packet number is significantly reduced. A concatenating construction then is used for flexible number of users. Finally by means of these matrices, we show that the minimum storage regenerating codes can also be used to construct coded caching schemes.
