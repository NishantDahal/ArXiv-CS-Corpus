DATC RDF: An Open Design Flow from Logic Synthesis to Detailed Routing

In this paper, we present DATC Robust Design Flow (RDF) from logic synthesis to detailed routing. Our goals are 1) to provide an open-source academic design flow from logic synthesis to detailed routing based on existing contest results, 2) to construct a database for design benchmarks and point tool libraries, and 3) to interact with industrial designs by using industrial standard design input/output formats. We also demonstrate RDF in a scalable cloud infrastructure. Design methodology and cross-stage optimization research can be conducted via RDF.
