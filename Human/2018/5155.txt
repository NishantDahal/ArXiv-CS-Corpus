BoSy: An Experimentation Framework for Bounded Synthesis

We present BoSy, a reactive synthesis tool based on the bounded synthesis approach. Bounded synthesis ensures the minimality of the synthesized implementation by incrementally increasing a bound on the size of the solutions it considers. For each bound, the existence of a solution is encoded as a logical constraint solving problem that is solved by an appropriate solver. BoSy constructs bounded synthesis encodings into SAT, QBF, DQBF, EPR, and SMT, and interfaces to solvers of the corresponding type. When supported by the solver, BoSy extracts solutions as circuits, which can, if desired, be verified with standard hardware model checkers. BoSy won the LTL synthesis track at SYNTCOMP 2016. In addition to its use as a synthesis tool, BoSy can also be used as an experimentation and performance evaluation framework for various types of satisfiability solvers.
