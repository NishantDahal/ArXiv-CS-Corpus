A cognitive radio ad hoc networks based disaster management scheme with efficient spectrum management, collaboration and interoperability

In this work, a disaster management scheme based on cognitive radio ad hoc network (CRAHN) has been presented. Disaster management has been a big problem for mankind for years. However, still not much research work has been presented on this problem. Technology has been employed in past few years to address this problem. Cognitive radio ad hoc network presents a viable solution for disaster management. It can be deployed rapidly without infrastructure and it solves the spectrum scarcity and congestion issues that arise during disaster. This paper presents a novel solution for disaster management. It provides a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based disaster detection scheme based on WSN. To solve the spectrum scarcity problem, a MLP based spectrum management scheme has been proposed. In order to ensure collaboration among rescue workers during disaster, a novel service discovery scheme has been proposed. To ensure interoperability during communication, XML format has been recommended. A real-time GUI has been proposed to provide shared situation awareness to rescue workers and enabling better decision making. The proposed approach has been implemented in NS-2 simulator. The results show accurate disaster detection, efficient spectrum usage, and interoperability and collaboration among nodes with reduced latency.
