Towards Interpretable R-CNN by Unfolding Latent Structures

This paper first proposes a method of formulating model interpretability in visual understanding tasks based on the idea of unfolding latent structures. It then presents a case study in object detection using popular two-stage region-based convolutional network (i.e., R-CNN) detection systems. We focus on weakly-supervised extractive rationale generation, that is learning to unfold latent discriminative part configurations of object instances automatically and simultaneously in detection without using any supervision for part configurations. We utilize a top-down hierarchical and compositional grammar model embedded in a directed acyclic AND-OR Graph (AOG) to explore and unfold the space of latent part configurations of regions of interest (RoIs). We propose an AOGParsing operator to substitute the RoIPooling operator widely used in R-CNN. In detection, a bounding box is interpreted by the best parse tree derived from the AOG on-the-fly, which is treated as the qualitatively extractive rationale generated for interpreting detection. We propose a folding-unfolding method to train the AOG and convolutional networks end-to-end. In experiments, we build on R-FCN and test our method on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. We show that the method can unfold promising latent structures without hurting the performance.
