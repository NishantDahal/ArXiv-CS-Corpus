Radio Resource Management for Dynamic Channel Borrowing Scheme in Wireless Networks

Provisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) is the key concern for Radio Resource Management now-a-days. In this paper, an efficient dynamic channel borrowing architecture has been proposed that ensures better QoS. The proposed scheme lessens the problem of excessive overall call blocking probability without sacrificing bandwidth utilization. If a channel is borrowed from adjacent cells and causing interference, we also propose architecture that diminishes the interference problem. The numerical results show comparison between the proposed scheme and the conventional scheme before channel borrowing process. The results show a satisfactory performance that are in favor of the proposed scheme, in case of overall call blocking probability, bandwidth utilization and interference management.
