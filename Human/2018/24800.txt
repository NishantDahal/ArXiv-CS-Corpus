Directional Frame Timing Synchronization in Wideband Millimeter-Wave Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs

In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel beamforming strategy for directional frame timing synchronization in wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems operating with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In the employed system model, we assume multiple radio frequency chains equipped at the base station to simultaneously form multiple synchronization beams in the analog domain. We formulate the corresponding directional frame timing synchronization problem as a max-min multicast beamforming problem under low-resolution quantization. We first show that the formulated problem cannot be effectively solved by conventional single-stream beamforming based approaches due to large quantization loss and limited beam codebook resolution. We then develop a new multi-beam probing based directional synchronization strategy, targeting at maximizing the minimum received synchronization signal-to-quantization-plus-noise ratio (SQNR) among all users. Leveraging a common synchronization signal structure design, the proposed approach synthesizes an effective composite beam from the simultaneously probed beams to better trade off the beamforming gain and the quantization distortion. Numerical results reveal that for wideband mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs, the timing synchronization performance of our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches due to the improvement in the received synchronization SQNR.
