Color Constancy by GANs: An Experimental Survey

In this paper, we formulate the color constancy task as an image-to-image translation problem using GANs. By conducting a large set of experiments on different datasets, an experimental survey is provided on the use of different types of GANs to solve for color constancy i.e. CC-GANs (Color Constancy GANs). Based on the experimental review, recommendations are given for the design of CC-GAN architectures based on different criteria, circumstances and datasets.
