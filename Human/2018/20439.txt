Optimal Linear Broadcast Rates of the Two-Sender Unicast Index Coding Problem with Fully-Participated Interactions

The two-sender unicast index coding problem consists of finding optimal coded transmissions from the two senders which collectively know the messages demanded by all the receivers. Each receiver demands a unique message. One important class of this problem consists of the message sets at the senders and the side-information at the receivers satisfying \emph{fully-participated interactions}. This paper provides optimal linear broadcast rates and corresponding code constructions for all the possible cases of the two-sender unicast index coding problem with fully-participated interactions. The optimal linear broadcast rate and the corresponding code for the two-sender problem are given in terms of those of the three single-sender unicast problems associated with the two-sender problem. Optimal linear broadcast rates of two-sender problems with fully-participated interactions provide lower bounds for the optimal linear broadcast rates of many related two-sender problems with \emph{partially-participated interactions}. Proof techniques used to obtain the results for the two-sender problem are shown to be useful in obtaining the results for some cases of the multi-sender unicast index coding problem.
