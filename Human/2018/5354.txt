Dyloc: Dynamic and Collaborative User-controlled AOA based Localizing System with your laptops

Currently, accurate localization system based on commodity WiFi devices is not broadly available yet. In the literature, the solutions are based on either network infrastructure like WiFi router, which have at least three antennas, or sacrifice accuracy with coarse grained information like RSSI. In this work, we design a new localizing system which is accurate based on AOA estimation and instantly deployable on users' devices.
  Dyloc is designed to be dynamically constructed with user's devices as network nodes without any network infrastructure. On the platform of laptops, our system achieve comparable localization accuracy with state-of-the-art work despite of the limitation of less number and large separation of antennas. We design multi-stage signal processing to resolve the ambiguity issue arisen in this scenario. To enable dynamic and collaborative construction, our system can accurately conduct self-localization and also eliminate the need of infrastructure anchors, which is due to the dedicated two-layer algorithm design.
