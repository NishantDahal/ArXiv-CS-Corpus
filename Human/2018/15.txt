Simulation of the propagation of a cylindrical shear wave : non linear and dissipative modelling

The simulation of a wave propagation caused by seismic stimulation allows to study the behaviour of the environment and to evaluate the consequences. The model involves the wave equation with a hysteresis loop in the stress-strain relationship. This induces non-linearities and, at the vertices of the loop, non-differentiable mathematical operators. This paper offers a numerical process which works out this simulation.
