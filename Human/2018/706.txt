Device Caching for Network Offloading: Delay Minimization with Presence of User Mobility

A delay-optimal caching problem (DOCP) in deviceto- device (D2D) networks with moblity is modelled. The problem arises in the context of achieving offloading using device caching, and the offloading effect is represented by the expected network load ratio (NLR) which is the percentage of data that has to be downloaded from the network. Compared with the related studies, this work considers minimizing delay with NLR guarantee in mobility scenarios. A lower bound of global optimum is derived, thus enabling performance benchmarking of any sub-optimal algorithm. For problem-solving, an effective search algorithm (ESA) is proposed based on the bound. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the ESA algorithm.
