Performance Evaluation of Cryptographic Ciphers on IoT Devices

With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and the increasing use of application-based processors, security infrastructure needs to be examined on some widely-used IoT hardware architectures. Applications in today's world are moving towards IoT concepts as this makes them fast, efficient, modular and future-proof. However, this leads to a greater security risk as IoT devices thrive in an ecosystem of co-existence and interconnection. As a result of these security risks, it is of utmost importance to test the existing cryptographic ciphers on such devices and determine if they are viable in terms of swiftness of execution time and memory consumption efficiency. It is also important to determine if there is a requirement to develop new lightweight cryptographic ciphers for these devices. This paper hopes to accomplish the above-mentioned objective by testing various encryption-decryption techniques on different IoT based devices and creating a comparison of execution speeds between these devices for a variety of different data sizes.
