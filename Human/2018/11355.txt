On Universally Good Flower Codes

For a Distributed Storage System (DSS), the \textit{Fractional Repetition} (FR) code is a class in which replicas of encoded data packets are stored on distributed chunk servers, where the encoding is done using the Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code. The FR codes allow for exact uncoded repair with minimum repair bandwidth. In this paper, FR codes are constructed using finite binary sequences. The condition for universally good FR codes is calculated on such sequences. For some sequences, the universally good FR codes are explored.
