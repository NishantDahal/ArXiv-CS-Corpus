Hierarchical RNN for Information Extraction from Lawsuit Documents

Every lawsuit document contains the information about the party's claim, court's analysis, decision and others, and all of this information are helpful to understand the case better and predict the judge's decision on similar case in the future. However, the extraction of these information from the document is difficult because the language is too complicated and sentences varied at length. We treat this problem as a task of sequence labeling, and this paper presents the first research to extract relevant information from the civil lawsuit document in China with the hierarchical RNN framework.
