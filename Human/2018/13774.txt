On semiring complexity of Schur polynomials

Semiring complexity is the version of arithmetic circuit complexity that allows only two operations: addition and multiplication. We show that when the number of variables is fixed, the semiring complexity of a Schur polynomial $s_位$ is $O(log(位_1))$; here $位_1$ is the largest part of the partition $位$.
