ADNet: A Deep Network for Detecting Adverts

Online video advertising gives content providers the ability to deliver compelling content, reach a growing audience, and generate additional revenue from online media. Recently, advertising strategies are designed to look for original advert(s) in a video frame, and replacing them with new adverts. These strategies, popularly known as product placement or embedded marketing, greatly help the marketing agencies to reach out to a wider audience. However, in the existing literature, such detection of candidate frames in a video sequence for the purpose of advert integration, is done manually. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning architecture called ADNet, that automatically detects the presence of advertisements in video frames. Our approach is the first of its kind that automatically detects the presence of adverts in a video frame, and achieves state-of-the-art results on a public dataset.
