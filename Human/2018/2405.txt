Towards evaluating emergent behavior of the Internet of Things using large scale simulation techniques

With the increase in Internet of Things devices and more decentralized architectures we see a new type of application gain importance, a type where local interactions between individual entities lead to a global emergent behavior, Emergent-based IoT (EBI) Systems. In this position paper we explore techniques to evaluate this emergent behavior in IoT applications. Because of the required scale and diversity this is not an easy task. Therefore, we mainly focus on a distributed simulation approach and provide an overview of possible techniques that could optimize the overall simulation performance. Our focus is both on modeling and simulation technology.
