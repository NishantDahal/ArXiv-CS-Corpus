Semi-Finite Length Analysis for Information Theoretic Tasks

We focus on the optimal value for various information-theoretical tasks. There are several studies for the asymptotic expansion for these optimal values up to the order $\sqrt{n}$ or $\log n$. However, these expansions have errors of the order $o(\sqrt{n})$ or $o(\log n)$, which does not goes to zero asymptotically. To resolve this problem, we derive the asymptotic expansion up to the constant order for upper and lower bounds of these optimal values. While the expansions of upper and lower bonds do not match, they clarify the ranges of these optimal values, whose errors go to zero asymptotically.
