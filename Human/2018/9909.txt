Spatially Coupled Sparse Regression Codes: Design and State Evolution Analysis

We consider the design and analysis of spatially coupled sparse regression codes (SC-SPARCs), which were recently introduced by Barbier et al. for efficient communication over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. SC-SPARCs can be efficiently decoded using an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) decoder, whose performance in each iteration can be predicted via a set of equations called state evolution. In this paper, we give an asymptotic characterization of the state evolution equations for SC-SPARCs. For any given base matrix (that defines the coupling structure of the SC-SPARC) and rate, this characterization can be used to predict whether or not AMP decoding will succeed in the large system limit. We then consider a simple base matrix defined by two parameters $(ω, Λ)$, and show that AMP decoding succeeds in the large system limit for all rates $R < \mathcal{C}$. The asymptotic result also indicates how the parameters of the base matrix affect the decoding progression. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of SC-SPARCs defined with the proposed base matrix.
