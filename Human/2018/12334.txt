The Computational Complexity of Finding Hamiltonian Cycles in Grid Graphs of Semiregular Tessellations

Finding Hamitonian Cycles in square grid graphs is a well studied and important questions. More recent work has extended these results to triangular and hexagonal grids, as well as further restricted versions. In this paper, we examine a class of more complex grids, as well as looking at the problem with restricted types of paths. We investigate the hardness of Hamiltonian cycle problem in grid graphs of semiregular tessellations. We give NP-hardness reductions for finding Hamiltonian paths in grid graphs based on all eight of the semiregular tessilations. Next, we investigate variations on the problem of finding Hamiltonian Paths in grid graphs when the path is forced to turn at every vertex. We give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if a square grid graph admits a Hamiltonian cycle which turns at every vertex. We then show deciding if cubic grid graphs, even if the height is restricted to $2$, admit a Hamiltonian cycle is NP-complete.
