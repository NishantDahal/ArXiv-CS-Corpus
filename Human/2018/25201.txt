An Optimal $χ$-Bound for ($P_6$, diamond)-Free Graphs

Given two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, a graph $G$ is $(H_1,H_2)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H_1$ or $H_2$. Let $P_t$ be the path on $t$ vertices and $K_t$ be the complete graph on $t$ vertices. The diamond is the graph obtained from $K_4$ by removing an edge. In this paper we show that every ($P_6$, diamond)-free graph $G$ satisfies $χ(G)\le ω(G)+3$, where $χ(G)$ and $ω(G)$ are the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. Our bound is attained by the complement of the famous 27-vertex Schläfli graph. Our result unifies previously known results on the existence of linear $χ$-binding functions for several graph classes. Our proof is based on a reduction via the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem to imperfect ($P_6$, diamond)-free graphs, a careful analysis of the structure of those graphs, and a computer search that relies on a well-known characterization of 3-colourable $(P_6,K_3)$-free graphs.
