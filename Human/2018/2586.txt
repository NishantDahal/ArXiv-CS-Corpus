Connecting KOSs and the LOD Cloud

This paper describes a specific project, the current situation leading to it, its project design and first results. In particular, we will examine the terminology employed in the Linked Open Data cloud and compare this to the terminology employed in both the Universal Decimal Classification and the Basic Concepts Classification. We will explore whether these classifications can encourage greater consistency in LOD terminology. We thus hope to link the largely distinct scholarly literatures that address LOD and KOSs.
