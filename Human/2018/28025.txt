CHOPT : Automated Hyperparameter Optimization Framework for Cloud-Based Machine Learning Platforms

Many hyperparameter optimization (HyperOpt) methods assume restricted computing resources and mainly focus on enhancing performance. Here we propose a novel cloud-based HyperOpt (CHOPT) framework which can efficiently utilize shared computing resources while supporting various HyperOpt algorithms. We incorporate convenient web-based user interfaces, visualization, and analysis tools, enabling users to easily control optimization procedures and build up valuable insights with an iterative analysis procedure. Furthermore, our framework can be incorporated with any cloud platform, thus complementarily increasing the efficiency of conventional deep learning frameworks. We demonstrate applications of CHOPT with tasks such as image recognition and question-answering, showing that our framework can find hyperparameter configurations competitive with previous work. We also show CHOPT is capable of providing interesting observations through its analysing tools
