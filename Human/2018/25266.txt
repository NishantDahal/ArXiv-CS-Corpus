Delocalisation of one-dimensional marginals of product measures and the capacity of LTI discrete channels

We consider discrete linear time invariant (LTI) channels satisfying the phase independence (PI) assumption. We show that under the PI assumption the capacity of LTI channels is positive. The main technical tool that we use to establish the positivity of the capacity is the delocalisation theorem for one-dimensional marginals of the product measure due to Ball and Nazarov. We also prove two delocalisation results that can be seen as extensions of Ball-Nazarov Theorem.
