The IQ of Artificial Intelligence

All it takes to identify the computer programs which are Artificial Intelligence is to give them a test and award AI to those that pass the test. Let us say that the scores they earn at the test will be called IQ. We cannot pinpoint a minimum IQ threshold that a program has to cover in order to be AI, however, we will choose a certain value. Thus, our definition for AI will be any program the IQ of which is above the chosen value. While this idea has already been implemented in [3], here we will revisit this construct in order to introduce certain improvements.
