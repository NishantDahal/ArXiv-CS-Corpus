Framework for Discrete Rate Transmission in Buffer-Aided Underlay CRN With Direct Path

In this paper, a buffered decode and forward (DF) relay based three-node underlay cooperative cognitive relay network (CRN) is considered with a direct path to the destination. The source and the relay use multiple rates, and joint rate and link selection are performed to maximize throughput. Optimum link and rate selection rules are evolved that ensure buffer stability, and expressions are derived for the throughput assuming peak power and peak interference constraints on the transmit power of the secondary nodes. The expressions are written in a manner that yields useful insights on buffer stability and role of the direct link on performance. A scheme in which the direct link signal is combined with the relayed signal is also considered, and it is demonstrated that it offers additional improvement in performance only in some scenarios. Computer simulations have been presented to verify the accuracy of derived expressions.
