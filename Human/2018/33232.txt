Connected Vehicle Application Development Platform (CVDeP) for Edge-centric Cyber-Physical Systems

Connected vehicle (CV) application developers need a development platform to build, test and debug CV applications, such as safety, mobility, and environmental applications, in an edge-centric Cyber-Physical Systems. Our study objective is to develop and evaluate a scalable and secure CV application development platform (CVDeP) that enables the CV application developers to build, test and debug CV applications in real-time. CVDeP ensures that the functional requirements of the CV applications meet the latency requirements imposed by corresponding CV applications. We conducted a case study to evaluate the efficacy of CVDeP using two CV applications (one safety and one mobility application) and validated them through a field evaluation at the Clemson University Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Testbed (CU-CAVT). The analysis outcome proves the efficacy of CVDeP, which satisfies the functional requirements (e.g., latency, throughput) of a CV application while maintaining scalability, and security of the platform and applications.
