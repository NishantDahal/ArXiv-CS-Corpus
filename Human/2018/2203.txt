Privacy Things: Systematic Approach to Privacy and Personal Identifiable Information

Defining privacy and related notions such as Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is a central notion in computer science and other fields. The theoretical, technological, and application aspects of PII require a framework that provides an overview and systematic structure for the discipline's topics. This paper develops a foundation for representing information privacy. It introduces a coherent conceptualization of the privacy senses built upon diagrammatic representation. A new framework is presented based on a flow-based model that includes generic operations performed on PII.
