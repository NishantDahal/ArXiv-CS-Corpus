Generalizing multistain immunohistochemistry tissue segmentation using one-shot color deconvolution deep neural networks

A key challenge in cancer immunotherapy biomarker research is quantification of pattern changes in microscopic whole slide images of tumor biopsies. Different cell types tend to migrate into various tissue compartments and form variable distribution patterns. Drug development requires correlative analysis of various biomarkers in and between the tissue compartments. To enable that, tissue slides are manually annotated by expert pathologists. Manual annotation of tissue slides is a labor intensive, tedious and error-prone task. Automation of this annotation process can improve accuracy and consistency while reducing workload and cost in a way that will positively influence drug development efforts. In this paper we present a novel one-shot color deconvolution deep learning method to automatically segment and annotate digitized slide images with multiple stainings into compartments of tumor, healthy tissue, and necrosis. We address the task in the context of drug development where multiple stains, tissue and tumor types exist and look into solutions for generalizations over these image populations.
