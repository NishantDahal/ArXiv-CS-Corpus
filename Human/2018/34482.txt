Computing with Codio at Coventry University: Online virtual Linux boxes and automated formative feedback

We describe our experience using Codio at Coventry University in our undergraduate programming curriculum. Codio provides students with online virtual Linux boxes, and allows staff to equip these with guides written in markdown and supplemental tasks that provide automated feedback. The use of Codio has coincided with a steady increase in student performance and satisfaction as well as far greater data on student engagement and performance.
