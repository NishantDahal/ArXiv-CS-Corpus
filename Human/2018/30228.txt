About the k-Error Linear Complexity over $\mathbb{F}_p$ of sequences of length 2$p$ with optimal three-level autocorrelation

We investigate the $k$-error linear complexity over $\mathbb{F}_p$ of binary sequences of length $2p$ with optimal three-level autocorrelation. These balanced sequences are constructed by cyclotomic classes of order four using a method presented by Ding et al.
