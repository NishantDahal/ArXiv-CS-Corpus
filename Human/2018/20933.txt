Response Collector: A Video Learning System for Flipped Classrooms

The flipped classroom has become famous as an effective educational method that flips the purpose of classroom study and homework. In this paper, we propose a video learning system for flipped classrooms, called Response Collector, which enables students to record their responses to preparation videos. Our system provides response visualization for teachers and students to understand what they have acquired and questioned. We performed a practical user study of our system in a flipped classroom setup. The results show that students preferred to use the proposed method as the inputting method, rather than naive methods. Moreover, sharing responses among students was helpful for resolving individual students' questions, and students were satisfied with the use of our system.
