Locating the boundaries of Pareto fronts: A Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Corner Solution Search

In this paper, an evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm based on corner solution search (MaOEA-CS) was proposed. MaOEA-CS implicitly contains two phases: the exploitative search for the most important boundary optimal solutions - corner solutions, at the first phase, and the use of angle-based selection [1] with the explorative search for the extension of PF approximation at the second phase. Due to its high efficiency and robustness to the shapes of PFs, it has won the CEC'2017 Competition on Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization. In addition, MaOEA-CS has also been applied on two real-world engineering optimization problems with very irregular PFs. The experimental results show that MaOEA-CS outperforms other six state-of-the-art compared algorithms, which indicates it has the ability to handle real-world complex optimization problems with irregular PFs.
