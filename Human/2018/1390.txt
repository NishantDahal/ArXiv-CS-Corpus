ICFVR 2017: 3rd International Competition on Finger Vein Recognition

In recent years, finger vein recognition has become an important sub-field in biometrics and been applied to real-world applications. The development of finger vein recognition algorithms heavily depends on large-scale real-world data sets. In order to motivate research on finger vein recognition, we released the largest finger vein data set up to now and hold finger vein recognition competitions based on our data set every year. In 2017, International Competition on Finger Vein Recognition(ICFVR) is held jointly with IJCB 2017. 11 teams registered and 10 of them joined the final evaluation. The winner of this year dramatically improved the EER from 2.64% to 0.483% compared to the winner of last year. In this paper, we introduce the process and results of ICFVR 2017 and give insights on development of state-of-art finger vein recognition algorithms.
