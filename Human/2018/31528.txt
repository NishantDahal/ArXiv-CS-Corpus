User Fairness Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for 5G Millimeter-Wave Communications with Analog Beamforming

The integration of non-orthogonal multiple access in millimeter-Wave communications (mmWave-NOMA) can significantly improve the spectrum efficiency and increase the number of users in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication. In this paper we consider a downlink mmWave-NOMA cellular system, where the base station is mounted with an analog beamforming phased array, and multiple users are served in the same time-frequency resource block. To guarantee user fairness, we formulate a joint beamforming and power allocation problem to maximize the minimal achievable rate among the users, i.e., we adopt the max-min fairness. As the problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex formulation and high dimension of the optimization variables, we propose a sub-optimal solution, which makes use of the spatial sparsity in the angle domain of the mmWave channel. In the solution, the closed-form optimal power allocation is obtained first, which reduces the joint optimization problem into an equivalent beamforming problem. Then an appropriate beamforming vector is designed. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve a near-upper-bound performance in terms of achievable rate, which is significantly better than that of the conventional mmWave orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-OMA) system.
