Metabolize Neural Network

The metabolism of cells is the most basic and important part of human function. Neural networks in deep learning stem from neuronal activity. It is self-evident that the significance of metabolize neuronal network(MetaNet) in model construction. In this study, we explore neuronal metabolism for shallow network from proliferation and autophagy two aspects. First, we propose different neuron proliferate methods that constructive the selfgrowing network in metabolism cycle. Proliferate neurons alleviate resources wasting and insufficient model learning problem when network initializes more or less parameters. Then combined with autophagy mechanism in the process of model self construction to ablate under-expressed neurons. The MetaNet can automatically determine the number of neurons during training, further, save more resource consumption. We verify the performance of the proposed methods on datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10.
