Signal Recovery under Mutual Incoherence Property and Oracle Inequalities

This paper considers signal recovery through an unconstrained minimization in the framework of mutual incoherence property. A sufficient condition is provided to guarantee the stable recovery in the noisy case. And we give a lower bound for the $\ell_2$ norm of difference of reconstructed signals and the original signal, in the sense of expectation and probability. Furthermore, oracle inequalities of both sparse signals and non-sparse signals are derived under the mutual incoherence condition in the case of Gaussian noises. Finally, we investigate the relationship between mutual incoherence property and robust null space property and find that robust null space property can be deduced from the mutual incoherence property.
