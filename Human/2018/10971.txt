Effects of Social Bots in the Iran-Debate on Twitter

2018 started with massive protests in Iran, bringing back the impressions of the so called "Arab Spring" and it's revolutionary impact for the Maghreb states, Syria and Egypt. Many reports and scientific examinations considered online social networks (OSN's) such as Twitter or Facebook to play a critical role in the opinion making of people behind those protests. Beside that, there is also evidence for directed manipulation of opinion with the help of social bots and fake accounts. So, it is obvious to ask, if there is an attempt to manipulate the opinion-making process related to the Iranian protest in OSN by employing social bots, and how such manipulations will affect the discourse as a whole. Based on a sample of ca. 900,000 Tweets relating to the topic "Iran" we show, that there are Twitter profiles, that have to be considered as social bot accounts. By using text mining methods, we show that these social bots are responsible for negative sentiment in the debate. Thereby, we would like to illustrate a detectable effect of social bots on political discussions on Twitter.
