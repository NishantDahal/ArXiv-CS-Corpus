Unsupervised Document Embedding With CNNs

We propose a new model for unsupervised document embedding. Leading existing approaches either require complex inference or use recurrent neural networks (RNN) that are difficult to parallelize. We take a different route and develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) embedding model. Our CNN architecture is fully parallelizable resulting in over 10x speedup in inference time over RNN models. Parallelizable architecture enables to train deeper models where each successive layer has increasingly larger receptive field and models longer range semantic structure within the document. We additionally propose a fully unsupervised learning algorithm to train this model based on stochastic forward prediction. Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that our approach produces comparable to state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of computational cost.
