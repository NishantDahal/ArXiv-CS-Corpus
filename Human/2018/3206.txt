Sentence Boundary Detection for French with Subword-Level Information Vectors and Convolutional Neural Networks

In this work we tackle the problem of sentence boundary detection applied to French as a binary classification task ("sentence boundary" or "not sentence boundary"). We combine convolutional neural networks with subword-level information vectors, which are word embedding representations learned from Wikipedia that take advantage of the words morphology; so each word is represented as a bag of their character n-grams.
  We decide to use a big written dataset (French Gigaword) instead of standard size transcriptions to train and evaluate the proposed architectures with the intention of using the trained models in posterior real life ASR transcriptions.
  Three different architectures are tested showing similar results; general accuracy for all models overpasses 0.96. All three models have good F1 scores reaching values over 0.97 regarding the "not sentence boundary" class. However, the "sentence boundary" class reflects lower scores decreasing the F1 metric to 0.778 for one of the models.
  Using subword-level information vectors seem to be very effective leading to conclude that the morphology of words encoded in the embeddings representations behave like pixels in an image making feasible the use of convolutional neural network architectures.
