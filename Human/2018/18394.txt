Computational Complexity of Games and Puzzles

In this thesis, we survey techniques and results from the study of Complexity Theory and Games. We then apply these techniques to obtain new results for previously unstudied games. Our contributions in the games Hexiom, Cut the Rope, and Back to Bed may be helpful in further studies by exploiting structure common to several games. We also highlight some interesting paths for further study related to uncertainty that have yet to receive thorough study given their prevalence in today's games.
