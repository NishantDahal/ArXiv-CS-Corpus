Polar Codes with Integrated Probabilistic Shaping for 5G New Radio

A modification to 5G New Radio (NR) polar code is proposed, which improves the error correction performance with higher order modulation through probabilistic shaping. The presented scheme mainly re-uses existing hardware at the transmitter, and modifications at the receiver are small. Simulation results show that the presented approach can improve the performance by up to 1dB for 256-QAM on AWGN channels
