Frequent Item-set Mining without Ubiquitous Items

Frequent Item-set Mining (FIM), sometimes called Market Basket Analysis (MBA) or Association Rule Learning (ARL), are Machine Learning (ML) methods for creating rules from datasets of transactions of items. Most methods identify items likely to appear together in a transaction based on the support (i.e. a minimum number of relative co-occurrence of the items) for that hypothesis. Although this is a good indicator to measure the relevance of the assumption that these items are likely to appear together, the phenomenon of very frequent items, referred to as ubiquitous items, is not addressed in most algorithms. Ubiquitous items have the same entropy as infrequent items, and not contributing significantly to the knowledge. On the other hand, they have strong effect on the performance of the algorithms and sometimes preventing the convergence of the FIM algorithms and thus the provision of meaningful results. This paper discusses the phenomenon of ubiquitous items and demonstrates how ignoring these has a dramatic effect on the computation performances but with a low and controlled effect on the significance of the results.
