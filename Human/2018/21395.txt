DNA-based chemical compiler

Marcello, in 1997, formally proved that chemical kinetics can make a universal computer i.e they can replicate any digital circuit. Recently, Soloveichik et al. showed that chemical kinetics can perform fast and reliable Turing Universal computations. To simulate the behavior of chemical reactions, Sean et al. developed a software called CAIN which represents chemical reactions in XML format. In this work, we have made an attempt to create trans-compiler which can take python like code as input and gives CAIN supported chemical reactions file as output. This can be compared to generating assembly code from a high-level programming language. Additionally, Soloveichik et al. also showed DNA as a universal primer for implementing CRN's and Andrews Phillips developed Visual DSD programming language for simulating all the possible DSD reactions. CRN2DSD, a software developed by Manish Gupta's team, can, already, convert a CAIN file to Microsoft's Visual DSD code i.e assembly level to machine level. Hence, our attempt to convert high-level code to assembly code takes us one step closer to completing the dream of making a chemical compiler.
