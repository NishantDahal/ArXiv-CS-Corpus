Development of Energy Models for Design Space Exploration of Embedded Many-Core Systems

This paper introduces a methodology to develop energy models for the design space exploration of embedded many-core systems. The design process of such systems can benefit from sophisticated models. Software and hardware can be specifically optimized based on comprehensive knowledge about application scenario and hardware behavior. The contribution of our work is an automated framework to estimate the energy consumption at an arbitrary abstraction level without the need to provide further information about the system. We validated our framework with the configurable many-core system CoreVA-MPSoC. Compared to a simulation of the CoreVA-MPSoC on gate level in a 28nm FD-SOI standard cell technology, our framework shows an average estimation error of about 4%.
