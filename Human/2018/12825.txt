Placement Delivery Array Design via Attention-Based Deep Neural Network

A decentralized coded caching scheme has been proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, and has been shown to alleviate the load of networks. Recently, placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed to characterize the coded caching scheme. In this paper, a neural architecture is first proposed to learn the construction of PDAs. Our model solves the problem of variable size PDAs using mechanism of neural attention and reinforcement learning. It differs from the previous attempts in that, instead of using combined optimization algorithms to get PDAs, it uses sequence-to-sequence model to learn construct PDAs. Numerical results are given to demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively implement coded caching. We also show that the complexity of our method to construct PDAs is low.
