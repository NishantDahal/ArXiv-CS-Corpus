Dataset for the First Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension

Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has become enormously popular recently and has attracted a lot of attention. However, existing reading comprehension datasets are mostly in English. To add diversity in reading comprehension datasets, in this paper we propose a new Chinese reading comprehension dataset for accelerating related research in the community. The proposed dataset contains two different types: cloze-style reading comprehension and user query reading comprehension, associated with large-scale training data as well as human-annotated validation and hidden test set. Along with this dataset, we also hosted the first Evaluation on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC-2017) and successfully attracted tens of participants, which suggest the potential impact of this dataset.
