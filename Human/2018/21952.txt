On the Synchronization of Circular Semi-Flower Automata

Pin proved that every circular automaton with a prime number of states containing a non-permutation is synchronizing. In this paper, we investigate the synchronization of circular semi-flower automata. We first prove that every semi-flower automaton is a one-cluster automaton. Subsequently, we prove that every semi-flower automaton containing a 1-cycle is synchronizing. Further, we prove that every circular semi-flower automaton with an odd number of states containing a 2-cycle is synchronizing.
