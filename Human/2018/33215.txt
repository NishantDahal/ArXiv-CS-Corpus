UAV Base Station Location Optimization for Next Generation Wireless Networks: Overview and Future Research Directions

Unmanned aerial vehicles mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) are expected to become one of the significant components of the Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs). Rapid deployment, mobility, higher chances of unobstructed propagation path, and flexibility features of UAV-BSs have attracted significant attention. Despite, potentially, high gains brought by UAV-BSs in NGWNs, many challenges are also introduced by them. Optimal location assignment to UAV-BSs, arguably, is the most widely investigated problem in the literature on UAV-BSs in NGWNs. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the literature on the location optimization of UAV-BSs in NGWNs. A generic optimization framework through a universal Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) formulation is constructed and the specifications of its constituents are elaborated. The generic problem is classified into a novel taxonomy. Due to the highly challenging nature of the optimization problem a range of solutions are adopted in the literature which are also covered under the aforementioned classification. Furthermore, future research directions on UAV-BS location optimization in 5G and beyond non-terrestrial aerial communication systems are discussed.
