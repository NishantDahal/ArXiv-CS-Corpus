Asymptotically Good Convolutional Codes

In this paper, we construct new sequences of asymptotically good convolutional codes. These sequences are obtained from sequences of transitive, self-orthogonal and self-dual block codes that attain the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink bound. Furthermore, by applying the techniques of expanding, extending, puncturing, direct sum, the |u|u+v| construction and the product code construction to these block codes, we construct more new sequences of asymptotically good convolutional codes. Additionally, we show that the proposed construction method presented here also works when applied for all sequences of good block codes where lim kj/nj and lim dj/nj exist.
