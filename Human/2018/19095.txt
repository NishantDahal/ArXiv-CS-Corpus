Building a Controlled Vocabulary for Standardizing Precision Medicine Terms

Rapid advances of technology and development of research in precision medicine domain have led to the production of different types of biomedical data. Standard medical vocabularies were shown to be limited in dealing with such heterogeneous data and consequently, new controlled vocabulary for data integration and normalization has been proposed. In this study, the precision medicine vocabulary (PMV), which is a controlled vocabulary for terms used in precision medicine, is built based on the method of data integration in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). It now covers ten top semantic types of disease, drug, gene, gene variation and so on. In total of 1,372,967 concepts and 4,567,208 terms have been integrated from widely used databases related with precision medicine.
