Quantifying Human Behavior on the Block Design Test Through Automated Multi-Level Analysis of Overhead Video

The block design test is a standardized, widely used neuropsychological assessment of visuospatial reasoning that involves a person recreating a series of given designs out of a set of colored blocks. In current testing procedures, an expert neuropsychologist observes a person's accuracy and completion time as well as overall impressions of the person's problem-solving procedures, errors, etc., thus obtaining a holistic though subjective and often qualitative view of the person's cognitive processes. We propose a new framework that combines room sensors and AI techniques to augment the information available to neuropsychologists from block design and similar tabletop assessments. In particular, a ceiling-mounted camera captures an overhead view of the table surface. From this video, we demonstrate how automated classification using machine learning can produce a frame-level description of the state of the block task and the person's actions over the course of each test problem. We also show how a sequence-comparison algorithm can classify one individual's problem-solving strategy relative to a database of simulated strategies, and how these quantitative results can be visualized for use by neuropsychologists.
