PHI Scrubber: A Deep Learning Approach

Confidentiality of patient information is an essential part of Electronic Health Record System. Patient information, if exposed, can cause a serious damage to the privacy of individuals receiving healthcare. Hence it is important to remove such details from physician notes. A system is proposed which consists of a deep learning model where a de-convolutional neural network and bi-directional LSTM-CNN is used along with regular expressions to recognize and eliminate the individually identifiable information. This information is then removed from a medical practitioner's data which further allows the fair usage of such information among researchers and in clinical trials.
