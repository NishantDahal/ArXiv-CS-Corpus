Framing Matters: Predicting Framing Changes and Legislation from Topic News Patterns

News has traditionally been well researched, with studies ranging from sentiment analysis to event detection and topic tracking. We extend the focus to two surprisingly under-researched aspects of news: \emph{framing} and \emph{predictive utility}. We demonstrate that framing influences public opinion and behavior, and present a simple entropic algorithm to characterize and detect framing changes. We introduce a dataset of news topics with framing changes, harvested from manual surveys in previous research. Our approach achieves an F-measure of $F_1=0.96$ on our data, whereas dynamic topic modeling returns $F_1=0.1$. We also establish that news has \emph{predictive utility}, by showing that legislation in topics of current interest can be foreshadowed and predicted from news patterns.
