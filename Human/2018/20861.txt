Principles, Paradigms and the Future of UAV Drone Teams in Use for Engineering and Operation of Landscape-Scale Deployable Structures

Drone fleets, with counts on the order of O(100) to O(1000), will play important and significant roles in the automation of the deployment, operation, maintenance and repair of ubiquitous and pervasive landscape scale elongated structures, with the longest linear spatial dimensions of O(1 mile) to O(10 mile). The organization of the drone team to support the task is considered as a digital platform, (specifically, a digital multi-sided platform). A computational thinking approach is used to engineer the architecture of the platform.
