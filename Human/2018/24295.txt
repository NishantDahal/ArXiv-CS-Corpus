Efficient Rank Minimization via Solving Non-convexPenalties by Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm

Rank minimization (RM) is a wildly investigated task of finding solutions by exploiting low-rank structure of parameter matrices. Recently, solving RM problem by leveraging non-convex relaxations has received significant attention. It has been demonstrated by some theoretical and experimental work that non-convex relaxation, e.g. Truncated Nuclear Norm Regularization (TNNR) and Reweighted Nuclear Norm Regularization (RNNR), can provide a better approximation of original problems than convex relaxations. However, designing an efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantee remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a simple but efficient proximal-type method, namely Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm(ISTA), with concrete analysis to solve rank minimization problems with both non-convex weighted and reweighted nuclear norm as low-rank regularizers. Theoretically, the proposed method could converge to the critical point under very mild assumptions with the rate in the order of $O(1/T)$. Moreover, the experimental results on both synthetic data and real world data sets show that proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-arts in both efficiency and accuracy.
