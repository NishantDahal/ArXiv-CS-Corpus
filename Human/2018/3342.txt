Distributed Readability Analysis Of Turkish Elementary School Textbooks

The readability assessment deals with estimating the level of difficulty in reading texts.Many readability tests, which do not indicate execution efficiency, have been applied on specific texts to measure the reading grade level in science textbooks. In this paper, we analyze the content covered in elementary school Turkish textbooks by employing a distributed parallel processing framework based on popular MapReduce paradigm. We outline the architecture of a distributed Big Data processing system which uses Hadoop for full-text readability analysis. The readability scores of the textbooks and system performance measurements are also given in the paper.
