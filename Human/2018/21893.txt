Bionic Reflex Control Strategy for Robotic Finger with Kinematic Constraints

This paper presents a bionic reflex control strategy for a kinematically constrained robotic finger. Here, the bionic reflex is achieved through a force tracking impedance control strategy. The dynamic model of the finger is reduced subject to kinematic constraints. Thereafter, an impedance control strategy that allows exact tracking of forces is discussed. Simulation results for a single finger holding a rectangular object against a flat surface are presented. Bionic reflex response time is of the order of milliseconds.
