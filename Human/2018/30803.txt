Prediction of Preliminary Maximum Wing Bending Moments under Discrete Gust

Many methodologies have been proposed to quickly identify among a very large number of flight conditions and maneuvers (i.e., steady, quasi-steady and unsteady loads cases) the ones which give the worst values for structural sizing (e.g., bending moments, shear forces, torques,...). All of these methods use both the simulation model of the aircraft under development and efficient algorithms to find out the critical points of the flight envelope. At the preliminary structural design phases detailed models are not available and airframe's loads are estimated by empirical relationships or engineering judgments. These approximations can induce load uncertainties and may lead to expensive redesign activities through the upcoming detailed sizing process. In the context of preliminary design phase for a weight aircraft variant without geometric change, to overcome this likely drawback, we propose a method based on the huge and reliable database of an initial aircraft from which the weight variant belongs. More precisely, from the load cases of this initial database, response surfaces are identified as functions of preliminary parameters (flight conditions and structural parameters). Then, these response surfaces are used to predict quickly the weight aircraft variant quantities of interest for preliminary structural design studies. Although the proposed method can be readily extended to any structural quantity of interest and to any flight conditions and maneuvers, it is presented here for the prediction of the bending moments due to discrete gust at different locations along a wing span.
