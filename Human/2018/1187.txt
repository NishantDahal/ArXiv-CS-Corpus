Simulations to Analyze Cellular Voting Systems for Side Effects of Democratic Redistricting

Motivated by the problem of partisan gerrymandering, we introduce an electoral system for a representative democracy called democratic cellular voting, designed to make modern packing and cracking strategies irrelevant by allowing districts to be influenced directly by voters through elections. We introduce an example of a democratic cellular voting system, called CV0, that is suitable for dynamic modelling. We develop a modification of the theory of discrete Markov chains using the algebraic structure of the semiring $[0,\infty]$, which is used as a space of correlation coefficients. We use this to measure voter preferences and model representatives, voters, and districts in computationally feasible models with a guarantee of long-term stability.
