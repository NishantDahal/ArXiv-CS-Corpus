Using any Surface to Realize a New Paradigm for Wireless Communications

This article introduces an approach that could tame wireless channels, making their behavior deterministic and software-defined. We investigate the novel idea of HyperSurfaces, which are software-controlled metamaterials embedded in any surface in the environment. HyperSurfaces are materials that interact with electromagnetic waves in a fully software-defined fashion, even unnaturally. Coating walls, doors, furniture and other objects with HyperSurfaces constitutes the overall behavior of an indoor wireless environment programmable. Thus, the electromagnetic behavior of the environment as a whole can be controlled and tailored to the needs of mobile devices within it.
