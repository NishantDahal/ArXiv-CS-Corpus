Dynamic Monopolies in Reversible Bootstrap Percolation

We study an extremal question for the (reversible) $r-$bootstrap percolation processes. Given a graph and an initial configuration where each vertex is active or inactive, in the $r-$bootstrap percolation process the following rule is applied in discrete-time rounds: each vertex gets active if it has at least $r$ active neighbors, and an active vertex stays active forever. In the reversible $r$-bootstrap percolation, each vertex gets active if it has at least $r$ active neighbors, and inactive otherwise. We consider the following question on the $d$-dimensional torus: how many vertices should be initially active so that the whole graph becomes active? Our results settle an open problem by Balister, Bollob√°s, Johnson, and Walters and generalize the results by Flocchini, Lodi, Luccio, Pagli, and Santoro.
