Edge-based LBP description of surfaces with colorimetric patterns

In this paper we target the problem of the retrieval of colour patterns over surfaces. We generalize to surface tessellations the well known Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptor for images. The key concept of the LBP is to code the variability of the colour values around each pixel. In the case of a surface tessellation we adopt rings around vertices that are obtained with a sphere-mesh intersection driven by the edges of the mesh; for this reason, we name our method edgeLBP. Experimental results are provided to show how this description performs well for pattern retrieval, also when patterns come from degraded and corrupted archaeological fragments.
