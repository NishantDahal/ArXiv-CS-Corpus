Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for mmWave Drones with Multi-Antenna Transmission

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as aerial base stations (BSs) for rapid establishment of communication networks during temporary events and after disasters. Since UAV-BSs are low power nodes, achieving high spectral and energy efficiency are of paramount importance. In this paper, we introduce non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission for millimeter-wave (mmWave) drones serving as flying BSs at a large stadium potentially with several hundreds or thousands of mobile users. In particular, we make use of multi-antenna techniques specifically taking into consideration the physical constraints of the antenna array, to generate directional beams. Multiple users are then served within the same beam employing NOMA transmission. If the UAV beam can not cover entire region where users are distributed, we introduce beam scanning to maximize outage sum rates. The simulation results reveal that, with NOMA transmission the spectral efficiency of the UAV based communication can be greatly enhanced compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission. Further, the analysis shows that there is an optimum transmit power value for NOMA beyond which outage sum rates do not improve further.
