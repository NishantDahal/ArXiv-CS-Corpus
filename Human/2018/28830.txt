Parallel Gaussian Channels Corrupted by Independent States With a State-Cognitive Helper

We consider a state-dependent parallel Gaussian channel with independent states and a common cognitive helper, in which two transmitters wish to send independent information to their corresponding receivers over two parallel subchannels. Each channel is corrupted by independent additive Gaussian state. The states are not known to the transmitters nor to the receivers, but known to a helper in a noncausal manner. The helper's goal is to assist a reliable communication by mitigating the state. Outer and inner bounds are derived and segments of the capacity region is characterized for various channel parameters.
