Representing scenarios for process evolution management

In the following writing we discuss a conceptual framework for representing events and scenarios from the perspective of a novel form of causal analysis. This causal analysis is applied to the events and scenarios so as to determine measures that could be used to manage the development of the processes that they are a part of in real time. An overall terminological framework and entity-relationship model are suggested along with a specification of the functional sets involved in both reasoning and analytics. The model is considered to be a specific case of the generic problem of finding sequential series in disparate data. The specific inference and reasoning processes are identified for future implementation.
