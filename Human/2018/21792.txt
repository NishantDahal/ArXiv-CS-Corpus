A Tutorial on Network Embeddings

Network embedding methods aim at learning low-dimensional latent representation of nodes in a network. These representations can be used as features for a wide range of tasks on graphs such as classification, clustering, link prediction, and visualization. In this survey, we give an overview of network embeddings by summarizing and categorizing recent advancements in this research field. We first discuss the desirable properties of network embeddings and briefly introduce the history of network embedding algorithms. Then, we discuss network embedding methods under different scenarios, such as supervised versus unsupervised learning, learning embeddings for homogeneous networks versus for heterogeneous networks, etc. We further demonstrate the applications of network embeddings, and conclude the survey with future work in this area.
