A logic-algebraic tool for reasoning with Knowledge-Based Systems

A detailed exposition of foundations of a logic-algebraic model for reasoning with knowledge bases specified by propositional (Boolean) logic is presented. The model is conceived from the logical translation of usual derivatives on polynomials (on residue rings) which is used to design a new inference rule of algebro-geometric inspiration. Soundness and (refutational) completeness of the rule are proved. Some applications of the tools introduced in the paper are shown.
