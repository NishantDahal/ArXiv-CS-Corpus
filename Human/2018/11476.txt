Physical and Mechatronic Security, Technologies and Future Trends for Vehicular Environment

Cloning spare parts and entities of mass products is an old and serious unsolved problem for the automotive industry. The economic losses in addition to a loss of know-how and IP theft as well as security and safety threats are huge in all dimensions. This presentation gives an overview of the traditional state of the art on producing clone resistant electronic units in the last two decades. A survey is attempting to demonstrate the techniques so far known as Physically Unclonable Functions PUFs showing their advantages and drawbacks. The necessity for fabricating mechatronic-security in the vehicular environment is emerging to become a vital requirement for new automotive security regulations (legal regulations) in the near future. The automotive industry is facing a challenge to produce low-cost and highly safe and secure networked automotive systems. The emerging networked smart traffic environment is offering new safety services and creating at the same time new needs and threats in a highly networked world. There is a crying need for automotive security that approaches the level of the robust biological security for cars as dominating mobility actors in the modern smart life environment. Possible emerging technologies allowing embedding practical mechatronic-security modules as a low-cost digital alternative are presented. Such digital clone-resistant mechatronic-units (as Electronic Control Units ECUs) may serve as smart security anchors for the automotive environment in the near future. First promising initial results are also presented.
