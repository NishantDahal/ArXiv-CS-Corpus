Dimensional emotion recognition using visual and textual cues

This paper addresses the problem of automatic emotion recognition in the scope of the One-Minute Gradual-Emotional Behavior challenge (OMG-Emotion challenge). The underlying objective of the challenge is the automatic estimation of emotion expressions in the two-dimensional emotion representation space (i.e., arousal and valence). The adopted methodology is a weighted ensemble of several models from both video and text modalities. For video-based recognition, two different types of visual cues (i.e., face and facial landmarks) were considered to feed a multi-input deep neural network. Regarding the text modality, a sequential model based on a simple recurrent architecture was implemented. In addition, we also introduce a model based on high-level features in order to embed domain knowledge in the learning process. Experimental results on the OMG-Emotion validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented ensemble model as it clearly outperforms the current baseline methods.
