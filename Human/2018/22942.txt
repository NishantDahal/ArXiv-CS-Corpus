Common-Message Broadcast Channels with Feedback in the Nonasymptotic Regime: Full Feedback

We investigate the maximum coding rate achievable on a two-user broadcast channel for the case where a common message is transmitted with feedback using either fixed-blocklength codes or variable-length codes. For the fixed-blocklength-code setup, we establish nonasymptotic converse and achievability bounds. An asymptotic analysis of these bounds reveals that feedback improves the second-order term compared to the no-feedback case. In particular, for a certain class of antisymmetric broadcast channels, we show that the dispersion is halved. For the variable-length-code setup, we demonstrate that the channel dispersion is zero.
