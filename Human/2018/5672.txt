Distributed Scheduling Algorithms for Optimizing Information Freshness in Wireless Networks

Age of Information (AoI), measures the time elapsed since the last received information packet was generated at the source. We consider the problem of AoI minimization for single-hop flows in a wireless network, under pairwise interference constraints and time varying channel. We consider simple, yet broad, class of distributed scheduling policies, in which a transmission is attempted over each link with a certain attempt probability. We obtain an interesting relation between the optimal attempt probability and the optimal AoI of the link, and its neighboring links. We then show that the optimal attempt probabilities can be computed by solving a convex optimization problem, which can be done distributively.
