Spatial Modulation for Molecular Communication

In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient spatial modulation based molecular communication (SM-MC) scheme, in which a transmitted symbol is composed of two parts, i.e., a space derived symbol and a concentration derived symbol. The space symbol is transmitted by embedding the information into the index of a single activated transmitter nanomachine. The concentration symbol is drawn according to the conventional concentration shift keying (CSK) constellation. Befitting from a single active transmitter during each symbol transmission period, SM-MC can avoid the inter-link interference problem existing in the current multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) MC schemes, which hence enables low-complexity symbol detection and performance improvement. Specifically, in our low-complexity scheme, the space symbol is first detected by energy comparison, and then the concentration symbol is detected by the equal gain combining assisted CSK demodulation. In this paper, we analyze the symbol error rate (SER) of the SM-MC and its special case, namely the space shift keying based MC (SSK-MC), where only space symbol is transmitted and no CSK modulation is invoked. Finally, the analytical results are validated by computer simulations, and our studies demonstrate that both the SM-MC and SSK-MC are capable of achieving better SER performance than the conventional MIMO-MC and single-input single-output MC (SISO-MC) when the same symbol rate is assumed.
