Modified integral imaging reconstruction and encryption using an improved SR reconstruction algorithm

We propose a monospectral image encryption method in which the multispectral color image acquisition by using heterogeneous monospectral cameras. Because the captured monospectral elemental images (EIs) belongs to grayscale image, it is means that the captured EIs can be directly encrypted by the proposed encoding method. Subsequently, the linear cellular automata (CA) and hyperchaotic encoding algorithm are employed to encrypt the captured EIs. Different from previous methods, the proposed method can directly encrypt the multispectral color information rather than having to divide into three color channels (R, G and B), thereby, the proposed method can greatly reduce the encryption calculation.
