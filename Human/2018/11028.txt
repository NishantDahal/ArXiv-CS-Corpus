Johnson-Mehl Cell-based Analysis of UL Cellular Network with Coupled User and BS Locations

In this work, we analyze the performance of the uplink (UL) of a cellular network where the base station (BS) locations follow a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), and the locations of users and BSs are spatially coupled. In order to capture this coupling, we consider that users attached to a BS are located uniformly at random independently of each other in the Johnson-Mehl (JM) cell of that BS. For this system model, we derive analytical expressions for the UL signal to interference ratio (SIR) coverage probability and average spectral efficiency (SE) of a typical user in the network. One of the key intermediate steps in our analysis is the approximate, but accurate, characterization of the area distribution of a typical JM cell. Another key intermediate step is the accurate statistical characterization of the point process formed by the interfering users that subsequently enables the coverage probability analysis. We present coverage probability and SE results for a typical user and study the interplay between different system parameters.
