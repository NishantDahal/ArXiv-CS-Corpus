Polar Wavelets in Space

Recent work introduced a unified framework for steerable and directional wavelets in two and three dimensions that ensures many desirable properties, such as a multi-scale structure, fast transforms, and a flexible angular localization. We show that, for an appropriate choice for the radial window function, these wavelets also have closed form expressions for, among other things, the spatial representation, the filter taps for the fast transform, and the frame representation of the Laplace operator. The numerical practicality and benefits of our work are demonstrated using signal estimation from non-uniform, point-wise samples, as required for example in ray tracing, and for reconstructing a signal over a lower-dimensional sub-manifold, with applications for instance in medical imaging.
