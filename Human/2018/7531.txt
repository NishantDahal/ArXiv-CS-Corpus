Matched Metrics to the Binary Asymmetric Channels

In this paper we establish some criteria to decide when a discrete memoryless channel admits a metric in such a way that the maximum likelihood decoding coincides with the nearest neighbour decoding. In particular we prove a conjecture presented by M. Firer and J. L. Walker establishing that every binary asymmetric channel admits a matched metric.
