PanoRoom: From the Sphere to the 3D Layout

We propose a novel FCN able to work with omnidirectional images that outputs accurate probability maps representing the main structure of indoor scenes, which is able to generalize on different data. Our approach handles occlusions and recovers complex shaped rooms more faithful to the actual shape of the real scenes. We outperform the state of the art not only in accuracy of the 3D models but also in speed.
