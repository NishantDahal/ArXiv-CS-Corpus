Understanding Soft-Tissue Behavior for Application to Microlaparoscopic Surface Scan

This paper presents an approach for understanding the soft tissue behavior in surface contact with a probe scanning the tissue. The application domain is confocal microlaparoscopy, mostly used for imaging the outer surface of the organs in the abdominal cavity. The probe is swept over the tissue to collect sequential images to obtain a large field of view with mosaicking. The problem we address is that the tissue also moves with the probe due to its softness; therefore the resulting mosaic is not in the same shape and dimension as traversed by the probe. Our approach is inspired by the finger slip studies and adapts the idea of load-slip phenomenon that explains the movement of the soft part of the finger when dragged on a hard surface. We propose the concept of loading-distance and perform measurements on beef liver and chicken breast tissues. We propose a protocol to determine the loading-distance prior to an automated scan and introduce an approach to compensate the tissue movement in raster scans. Our implementation and experiments show that we can have an image-mosaic of the tissue surface in a desired rectangular shape with this approach.
