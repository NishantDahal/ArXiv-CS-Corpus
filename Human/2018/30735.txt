Smart Grid Co-Simulation with MOSAIK and HLA: A Comparison Study

Evaluating new technological developments for energy systems is becoming more and more complex. The overall application environment is a continuously growing and interconnected cyber-physical system so that analytical assessment is practically impossible to realize. Consequently, new solutions must be evaluated in simulation studies. Due to the interdisciplinarity of the simulation scenarios, various heterogeneous tools must be connected. This approach is known as co-simulation. During the last years, different approaches have been developed or adapted for applications in energy systems. In this paper, two co-simulation approaches are compared that follow generic, versatile concepts. The tool mosaik, which has been explicitly developed for the purpose of co-simulation in complex energy systems, is compared to the High Level Architecture (HLA), which possesses a domain-independent scope but is often employed in the energy domain. The comparison is twofold, considering the tools' conceptual architectures as well as results from the simulation of representative test cases. It suggests that mosaik may be the better choice for entry-level, prototypical co-simulation while HLA is more suited for complex and extensive studies.
