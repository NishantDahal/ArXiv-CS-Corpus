Accurate Building Detection in VHR Remote Sensing Images using Geometric Saliency

This paper aims to address the problem of detecting buildings from remote sensing images with very high resolution (VHR). Inspired by the observation that buildings are always more distinguishable in geometries than in texture or spectral, we propose a new geometric building index (GBI) for accurate building detection, which relies on the geometric saliency of building structures. The geometric saliency of buildings is derived from a mid-level geometric representations based on meaningful junctions that can locally describe anisotropic geometrical structures of images. The resulting GBI is measured by integrating the derived geometric saliency of buildings. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed GBI achieves very promising performance, and meanwhile shows impressive generalization capability.
