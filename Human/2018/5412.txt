A Novel Approach for Fast and Accurate Mean Error Distance Computation in Approximate Adders

In error-tolerant applications, approximate adders have been exploited extensively to achieve energy efficient system designs. Mean error distance is one of the important error metrics used as a performance measure of approximate adders. In this work, a fast and efficient methodology is proposed to determine the exact mean error distance in approximate lower significant bit adders. A detailed description of the proposed algorithm along with an example has been demonstrated in this paper. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed method performs better than existing Monte Carlo simulation approach both in terms of accuracy and execution time.
