Axially-shifted pattern illumination for macroscale turbidity suppression and virtual volumetric confocal imaging without axial scanning

Structured illumination has been widely used for optical sectioning and 3D surface recovery. In a typical implementation, multiple images under non-uniform pattern illumination are used to recover a single object section. Axial scanning of the sample or the objective lens is needed for acquiring the 3D volumetric data. Here we demonstrate the use of axially-shifted pattern illumination (asPI) for virtual volumetric confocal imaging without axial scanning. In the reported approach, we project illumination patterns at a tilted angle with respect to the detection optics. As such, the illumination patterns shift laterally at different z sections and the sample information at different z-sections can be recovered based on the captured 2D images. We demonstrate the reported approach for virtual confocal imaging through a diffusing layer and underwater 3D imaging through diluted milk. We show that we can acquire the entire confocal volume in ~1s with a throughput of 420 megapixels per second. Our approach may provide new insights for developing confocal light ranging and detection systems in degraded visual environments.
