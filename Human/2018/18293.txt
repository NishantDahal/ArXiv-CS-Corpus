A Bayesian Approach to Block Structure Inference in AV1-based Multi-rate Video Encoding

Due to differences in frame structure, existing multi-rate video encoding algorithms cannot be directly adapted to encoders utilizing special reference frames such as AV1 without introducing substantial rate-distortion loss. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel bayesian block structure inference model inspired by a modification to an HEVC-based algorithm. It estimates the posterior probabilistic distributions of block partitioning, and adapts early terminations in the RDO procedure accordingly. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides flexibility for controlling the tradeoff between speed and coding efficiency, and can achieve an average time saving of 36.1% (up to 50.6%) with negligible bitrate cost.
