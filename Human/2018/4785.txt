Location data quality in context: directions and challenges

In the last decade, following the emergence of the mobile applications domain, the significance of location information has changed radically. Nowadays, location data not only is a key component of geospatial databases, but also a critical resource for a broad spectrum of applications, including Location-based Services and IOT solutions. This change of perspective has been made possible by the availability of localization technologies providing accurate and reliable location information on moving entities in real time. We refer to real-time location as positioning data. Positioning data has unique characteristics, such as the strong dependency from both the localization technology and the environmental context, which make the specification of standard quality metrics and quality assessment procedures a complex task. In this paper, we elaborate on such an aspect, focusing in particular on indoor positioning data.
