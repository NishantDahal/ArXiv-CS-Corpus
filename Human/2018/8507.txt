Terrain RL Simulator

We provide $89$ challenging simulation environments that range in difficulty. The difficulty of solving a task is linked not only to the number of dimensions in the action space but also to the size and shape of the distribution of configurations the agent experiences. Therefore, we are releasing a number of simulation environments that include randomly generated terrain. The library also provides simple mechanisms to create new environments with different agent morphologies and the option to modify the distribution of generated terrain. 
We believe using these and other more complex simulations will help push the field closer to creating human-level intelligence.
