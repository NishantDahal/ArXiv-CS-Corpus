Privacy-Preserving Probabilistic Forecasting for Temporal-spatial Correlated Wind Farms

Adopting Secure scalar product and Secure sum techniques, we propose a privacy-preserving method to build the joint and conditional probability distribution functions of multiple wind farms' output considering the temporal-spatial correlation. The proposed method can protect the raw data of wind farms (WFs) from disclosure, and are mathematically equivalent to the centralized method which needs to gather the raw data of all WFs.
