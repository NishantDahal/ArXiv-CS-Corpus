Using the Jupyter Notebook as a Tool for Open Science: An Empirical Study

As scientific work becomes more computational and data intensive, research processes and results become more difficult to interpret and reproduce. In this poster, we show how the Jupyter notebook, a tool originally designed as a free version of Mathematica notebooks, has evolved to become a robust tool for scientists to share code, associated computation, and documentation.
