Towards Realisation of Heterogeneous Earth-Observation Sensor Database Framework for the Sensor Observation Service based on PostGIS

Environmental monitoring and management systems in most cases deal with models and spatial analytics that involve the integration of in-situ and remote Geosensor observations. In-situ sensor observations and those gathered by remote sensors are usually provided by different databases and services in real-time dynamic services such as the Geo-Web Services. Thus, data have to be pulled from different databases and transferred over the network before they are fused and processed on the service middleware. This process is very massive and unnecessary communication-work load on the service middleware. Massive work load in large raster downloads from flat-file raster data sources each time a request is made and huge integration and geo-processing work load on the service middleware which could actually be better leveraged at the database This paper therefore proposes the realization of heterogeneous sensor database framework based on PostGIS for integration, geo-processing and spatial analysis of remote and in-situ sensor observations at the database level. Also discussed in this paper is how the framework can be integrated in the Sensor Observation Service (SOS) to reduce communication and massive workload on the Geospatial Web Services and as well make query request from the user end a lot more flexible.
