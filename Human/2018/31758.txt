On Meta-Learning for Dynamic Ensemble Selection

In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using meta-learning. The framework is divided into three steps. In the first step, the pool of classifiers is generated from the training data. The second phase is responsible to extract the meta-features and train the meta-classifier. Five distinct sets of meta-features are proposed, each one corresponding to a different criterion to measure the level of competence of a classifier for the classification of a given query sample. The meta-features are computed using the training data and used to train a meta-classifier that is able to predict whether or not a base classifier from the pool is competent enough to classify an input instance. Three different training scenarios for the training of the meta-classifier are considered: problem-dependent, problem-independent and hybrid. Experimental results show that the problem-dependent scenario provides the best result. In addition, the performance of the problem-dependent scenario is strongly correlated with the recognition rate of the system. A comparison with state-of-the-art techniques shows that the proposed-dependent approach outperforms current dynamic ensemble selection techniques.
