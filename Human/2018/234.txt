A Multi-Biometrics for Twins Identification Based Speech and Ear

The development of technology biometrics becomes crucial more. To define human characteristic biometric systems are used but because of inability of traditional biometric systems to recognize twins, multimodal biometric systems are developed. In this study a multimodal biometric recognition system is proposed to recognize twins from each other and from the other people by using image and speech data. The speech or image data can be enough to recognize people from each other but twins cannot be distinguished with one of these data. Therefore a robust recognition system with the combine of speech and ear images is needed. As database, the photos and speech data of 39 twins are used. For speech recognition MFCC and DTW algorithms are used. Also, Gabor filter and DCVA algorithms are used for ear identification. Multi-biometrics success rate is increased by making matching score level fusion. Especially, rank-5 is reached 100%. We think that speech and ear can be complementary. Therefore, it is result that multi-biometrics based speech and ear is effective for human identifications.
