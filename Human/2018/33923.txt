Continuous Trajectory Planning Based on Learning Optimization in High Dimensional Input Space for Serial Manipulators

To continuously generate trajectories for serial manipulators with high dimensional degrees of freedom (DOF) in the dynamic environment, a real-time optimal trajectory generation method based on machine learning aiming at high dimensional inputs is presented in this paper. First, a learning optimization (LO) framework is established, and implementations with different sub-methods are discussed. Additionally, multiple criteria are defined to evaluate the performance of LO models. Furthermore, aiming at high dimensional inputs, a database generation method based on input space dimension-reducing mapping is proposed. At last, this method is validated on motion planning for haptic feedback manipulators (HFM) in virtual reality systems. Results show that the input space dimension-reducing method can significantly elevate the efficiency and quality of database generation and consequently improve the performance of the LO. Moreover, using this LO method, real-time trajectory generation with high dimensional inputs can be achieved, which lays a foundation for continuous trajectory planning for high-DOF-robots in complex environments.
