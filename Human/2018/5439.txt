Modeling the distribution of the arrival angle based on transmitter antenna pattern

An angular distribution of received signals has a significant impact on their spectral and correlational properties. Most of angular dispersion models do not consider antenna patterns. The developed procedure for determining the propagation path parameters enables a wide range of assessment of the impact of the propagation environment on the received signal properties. In contrast to the other models, this procedure is based on a geometrical structure, which parameters are defined on the basis of power delay profile or spectrum This modeling method allows also the power radiation pattern (PRP) of the transmitting antenna. The aim of the paper is to present the influence of the transmitter antenna PRP on the scattering propagation paths that arrive at the receiver. This analysis is realized on the basis of simulations studies using the developed procedure. Presented in this paper procedure maps the effects of propagation phenomena that predominate in an azimuth plane.
