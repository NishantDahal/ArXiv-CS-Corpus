Spatial Co-location Pattern Mining - A new perspective using Graph Database

Spatial co-location pattern mining refers to the task of discovering the group of objects or events that co-occur at many places. Extracting these patterns from spatial data is very difficult due to the complexity of spatial data types, spatial relationships, and spatial auto-correlation. These patterns have applications in domains including public safety, geo-marketing, crime prediction and ecology. Prior work focused on using the spatial join. While these approaches provide state-of-the-art results, they are very expensive to compute due to the multiway spatial join and scaling them to real-world datasets is an open problem. We address these limitations by formulating the co-location pattern discovery as a clique enumeration problem over a neighborhood graph (which is materialized using a distributed graph database). We propose three new traversal based algorithms, namely $CliqueEnum_G$, $CliqueEnum_K$ and $CliqueExtend$. We provide the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms by evaluating them for a large real-life dataset. The three algorithms allow for a trade-off between time and memory requirements and support interactive data analysis without having to recompute all the intermediate results. These attributes make our algorithms applicable to a wide range of use cases for different data sizes.
