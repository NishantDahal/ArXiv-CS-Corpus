Determination of Critical Success Factors Affecting Mobile Learning: A Meta-Analysis Approach

With rapid technological advancements, mobile learning (m-Learning) offers incredible opportunities, especially in the area of higher education. However, while interest in this area has been significant and several pilot studies have been conducted within universities, relatively less is known about how higher educational institutions can make efficient use of the m-Learning platform to support teaching and learning. Although there are numerous studies in the area, the lack of this insight is mostly due to the fact that very little effort has been made to collate these studies and determine a common set of key success factors that affect the acceptance of m-Learning within universities. This study conducts a systematic analysis of several studies conducted in the area of m-Learning to assess the critical success factors, by making use of the meta-analysis technique. Our investigation has shown that the most important perceived advantages of m-Learning, from learner perspectives, are collaboration during studies, the prospect of ubiquitous learning in space and time, and user friendly application design.
