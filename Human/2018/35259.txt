Role action embeddings: scalable representation of network positions

We consider the question of embedding nodes with similar local neighborhoods together in embedding space, commonly referred to as "role embeddings." We propose RAE, an unsupervised framework that learns role embeddings. It combines a within-node loss function and a graph neural network (GNN) architecture to place nodes with similar local neighborhoods close in embedding space. We also propose a faster way of generating negative examples called neighbor shuffling, which quickly creates negative examples directly within batches. These techniques can be easily combined with existing GNN methods to create unsupervised role embeddings at scale. We then explore role action embeddings, which summarize the non-structural features in a node's neighborhood, leading to better performance on node classification tasks. We find that the model architecture proposed here provides strong performance on both graph and node classification tasks, in some cases competitive with semi-supervised methods.
