Infinite dimensional finitely forcible graphon

Graphons are analytic objects associated with convergent sequences of dense graphs. Finitely forcible graphons, i.e., those determined by finitely many subgraph densities, are of particular interest because of their relation to various problems in extremal combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Lovasz and Szegedy conjectured that the topological space of typical vertices of a finitely forcible graphon always has finite dimension, which would have implications on the minimum number of parts in its weak eps-regular partition. We disprove the conjecture by constructing a finitely forcible graphon with the space of typical vertices that has infinite dimension.
