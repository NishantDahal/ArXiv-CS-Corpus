Multiple Access Multicarrier Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution

One of the most important practical realizations of the fundamentals of quantum mechanics is continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). Here we propose the adaptive multicarrier quadrature division-multiuser quadrature allocation (AMQD-MQA) multiple access technique for continuous-variable quantum key distribution. The MQA scheme is based on the AMQD modulation, which granulates the inputs of the users into Gaussian subcarrier continuous-variables (CVs). In an AMQD-MQA multiple access scenario, the simultaneous reliable transmission of the users is handled by the dynamic allocation of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs. We propose two different settings of AMQD-MQA for multiple input-multiple output communication. We introduce a rate-selection strategy that tunes the modulation variances and allocates adaptively the quadratures of the users over the sub-channels. We also prove the rate formulas if only partial channel side information is available for the users of the sub-channel conditions. We show a technique for the compensation of a nonideal Gaussian input modulation, which allows the users to overwhelm the modulation imperfections to reach optimal capacity-achieving communication over the Gaussian sub-channels. We investigate the diversity amplification of the sub-channel transmittance coefficients and reveal that a strong diversity can be exploited by opportunistic Gaussian modulation.
