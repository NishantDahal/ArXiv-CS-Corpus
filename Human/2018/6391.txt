Methodology to analyze the accuracy of 3D objects reconstructed with collaborative robot based monocular LSD-SLAM

SLAM systems are mainly applied for robot navigation while research on feasibility for motion planning with SLAM for tasks like bin-picking, is scarce. Accurate 3D reconstruction of objects and environments is important for planning motion and computing optimal gripper pose to grasp objects. In this work, we propose the methods to analyze the accuracy of a 3D environment reconstructed using a LSD-SLAM system with a monocular camera mounted onto the gripper of a collaborative robot. We discuss and propose a solution to the pose space conversion problem. Finally, we present several criteria to analyze the 3D reconstruction accuracy. These could be used as guidelines to improve the accuracy of 3D reconstructions with monocular LSD-SLAM and other SLAM based solutions.
