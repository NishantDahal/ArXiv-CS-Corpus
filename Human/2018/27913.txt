Event Coreference Resolution Using Neural Network Classifiers

This paper presents a neural network classifier approach to detecting both within- and cross- document event coreference effectively using only event mention based features. Our approach does not (yet) rely on any event argument features such as semantic roles or spatiotemporal arguments. Experimental results on the ECB+ dataset show that our approach produces F1 scores that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods for both within-document and cross-document event coreference resolution when we use B3 and CEAFe evaluation measures, but gets worse F1 score with the MUC measure. However, when we use the CoNLL measure, which is the average of these three scores, our approach has slightly better F1 for within- document event coreference resolution but is significantly better for cross-document event coreference resolution.
