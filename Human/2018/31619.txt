Meta Distribution of Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in Poisson Networks

We study the meta distribution (MD) of the coverage probability (CP) in downlink non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) networks. Two schemes are assessed based on the location of the NOMA users: 1) anywhere in the network, 2) cell-center users only. The moments of the MD for both schemes are derived and the MD is approximated via the beta distribution. Closed-form moments are derived for the first scheme; for the second scheme exact and approximate moments, to simplify the integral calculation, are derived. We show that restricting NOMA to cell-center users provides significantly higher mean, lower variance and better percentile performance for the CP.
