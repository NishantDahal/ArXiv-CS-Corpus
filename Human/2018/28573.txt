Overview of PicTropes, a film trope dataset

From the database DBTropes.org, we have created a dataset of films and the tropes that they use, which we have called PicTropes. In this report we provide the descriptive analysis and a further discussion on the dataset PicTropes: The extracted features will help us decide the best values for a future recommendation system and content generator, whereas the analysis of the distribution functions that fit the best will help us interpret the relation between the films and the tropes that were found inside them. Additionally, we provide rankings of the top-25 tropes and films, which will help us discuss and formulate questions to guide future extensions of the PicTropes dataset.
