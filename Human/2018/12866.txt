Python Framework for HP Adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Two Phase Flow in Porous Media

In this paper we present a framework for solving two phase flow problems in porous media. The discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin method and includes local grid adaptivity and local choice of polynomial degree. The method is implemented using the new Python frontend Dune-FemPy to the open source framework Dune. The code used for the simulations is made available as Jupyter notebook and can be used through a Docker container. We present a number of time stepping approaches ranging from a classical IMPES method to fully coupled implicit scheme. The implementation of the discretization is very flexible allowing for test different formulations of the two phase flow model and adaptation strategies.
