PlayNPort: A Portable Wireless Music Player and Text Reader System

Portable Consumer Electronics has made a mark in the industry. With the ease of use at an accessible price range, they have experienced significant growth in the market. Our idea is to develop a portable wireless music player and text reader using a Cortex-M series microcontroller and bare-metal programming techniques. We chose to use an SD card as the storage device. The resulting electronic device is similar to a consumer grade music player available in a car. The system comprises an MCU, an MP3 encoder/decoder, an LCD, an audio output jack, an SD card and a remote control. We also present various challenges involved in developing the system and solutions we used to overcome the challenges. The intricacy of the work lies in the fact that the system was developed to be consumer-centric by providing a rich User Experience. It can be used as a personal entertainment system in a car.
