Distributed Cartesian Power Graph Segmentation for Graphon Estimation

We study an extention of total variation denoising over images to over Cartesian power graphs and its applications to estimating non-parametric network models. The power graph fused lasso (PGFL) segments a matrix by exploiting a known graphical structure, $G$, over the rows and columns. Our main results shows that for any connected graph, under subGaussian noise, the PGFL achieves the same mean-square error rate as 2D total variation denoising for signals of bounded variation. We study the use of the PGFL for denoising an observed network $H$, where we learn the graph $G$ as the $K$-nearest neighborhood graph of an estimated metric over the vertices. We provide theoretical and empirical results for estimating graphons, a non-parametric exchangeable network model, and compare to the state of the art graphon estimation methods.
