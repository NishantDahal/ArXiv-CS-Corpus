Parameter Sharing Reinforcement Learning Architecture for Multi Agent Driving Behaviors

Multi-agent learning provides a potential framework for learning and simulating traffic behaviors. This paper proposes a novel architecture to learn multiple driving behaviors in a traffic scenario. The proposed architecture can learn multiple behaviors independently as well as simultaneously. We take advantage of the homogeneity of agents and learn in a parameter sharing paradigm. To further speed up the training process asynchronous updates are employed into the architecture. While learning different behaviors simultaneously, the given framework was also able to learn cooperation between the agents, without any explicit communication. We applied this framework to learn two important behaviors in driving: 1) Lane-Keeping and 2) Over-Taking. Results indicate faster convergence and learning of a more generic behavior, that is scalable to any number of agents. When compared the results with existing approaches, our results indicate equal and even better performance in some cases.
