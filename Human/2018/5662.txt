LoRa Throughput Analysis with Imperfect Spreading Factor Orthogonality

LoRa is one of the promising techniques for enabling Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Although LoRa allows flexible adaptations of coverage and data rates, it is subject to intrinsic types of interferences: co-SF interferences where end-devices with the same Spreading Factors (SFs) are subject to collisions, and inter-SF interferences where end-devices with different SFs experience collisions. Most current works have considered perfect orthogonality among different SFs. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the achievable LoRa throughput in uplink, where the capture conditions specific to LoRa are included. Results show the accuracy of our analysis despite approximations, and the throughput losses from imperfect SF orthogonality, under different SF allocations. Our analysis will enable the design of specific SF allocation mechanisms, in view of further throughput enhancements.
