Automatic Identification of Arabic expressions related to future events in Lebanon's economy

In this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify future events in Lebanon's economy from Arabic texts. Challenges are threefold: first, we need to build a corpus of Arabic texts that covers Lebanon's economy; second, we need to study how future events are expressed linguistically in these texts; and third, we need to automatically identify the relevant textual segments accordingly. We will validate this method on a constructed corpus form the web and show that it has very promising results. To do so, we will be using SLCSAS, a system for semantic analysis, based on the Contextual Explorer method, and "AlKhalil Morpho Sys" system for morpho-syntactic analysis.
