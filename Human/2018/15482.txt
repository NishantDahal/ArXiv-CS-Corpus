Quantum Penny Flip game with unawareness

Games with unawareness model strategic situations in which players' perceptions about the game are limited. They take into account the fact that the players may be unaware of some of the strategies available to them or their opponents as well as the players may have a restricted view about the number of players participating in the game. The aim of the research is to introduce this notion into theory of quantum games. We shall focus on PQ Penny Flip game introduced by D. Meyer. We shall formalize the previous results and consider other cases of unawareness in the game.
