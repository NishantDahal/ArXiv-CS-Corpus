Presentation Attack Detection for Iris Recognition: An Assessment of the State of the Art

Iris recognition is increasingly used in large-scale applications. As a result, presentation attack detection for iris recognition takes on fundamental importance. This survey covers the diverse research literature on this topic. Different categories of presentation attack are described and placed in an application-relevant framework, and the state of the art in detecting each category of attack is summarized. One conclusion from this is that presentation attack detection for iris recognition is not yet a solved problem. Datasets available for research are described, research directions for the near- and medium-term future are outlined, and a short list of recommended readings are suggested.
