Throughput Optimization of Coexistent LTE-U and WiFi in Next Generation Networks

Next generation networks are envisioned to have ubiquitous availability and seamless access as main goals. In general, coexistence of multiple access technologies is one of the most promising way to achieve these goals, particularly using WiFi and LTE (Long Term Evolution) simultaneously which are two major players in future Internet. LTE is primarily used in a licensed spectrum but an unlicensed version is also in use by research communities. In this work we study LTE-U (LTE-Unlicensed) and WiFi Coexistence in a handheld device by analyzing existing scheduling mechanisms and proposing a novel scheme of cooperation. Throughput and fairness of these multi-homed technologies are studied in detailed. Also, we propose to use a deferral based proactive scheme for improved system utilization.
