Module-less Synthesis on Cyberphysical Digital Microfluidic Biochip Ensuring Error Detection and Routing Performance Optimization

Digital Microfluidic Biochips consist of Two Dimensional microarrays that are integrated with different healthcare related cyberphysical systems and expected to be used extensively in near future. Thus, faster and error-free synthesis techniques need to be implemented on such chips. Various Bio protocols are performed based on different mixing modules present on the chip until now. In this work, the concept of such dedicated virtual modules has been eliminated and a novel Module Less Synthesis method is proposed for accomplishing bioassays for cyberphysical DMFBs. However, path congestion problem and operational errors are inevitable in MLS approach.
