Implementing SCRUM to develop a connected robot

Agile methods are receiving a growing interest from industry and these approaches are nowadays well accepted and deployed in software engineering. However, some issues remain to introduce agility in systems engineering. The objective of this paper is to show an agile management implementation in an educational project consisting in developing a connected mobile robot, and to evaluate the issues and benefits of adopting an agile approach. Among the most famous agile management methods, SCRUM has been chosen to lead this experiment. This paper first presents the project and how students traditionally manage it, then it describes how Scrum could be used instead. It evaluates the difficulties and interests to introduce agility in this project, and concludes on the ability of Scrum to design, test and progressively integrate the system, thus providing an operational prototype more quickly.
