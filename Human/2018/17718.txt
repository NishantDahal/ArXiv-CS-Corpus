Predicting the Integer Decomposition Property via Machine Learning

In this paper we investigate the ability of a neural network to approximate algebraic properties associated to lattice simplices. In particular we attempt to predict the distribution of Hilbert basis elements in the fundamental parallelepiped, from which we detect the integer decomposition property (IDP). We give a gentle introduction to neural networks and discuss the results of this prediction method when scanning very large test sets for examples of IDP simplices.
