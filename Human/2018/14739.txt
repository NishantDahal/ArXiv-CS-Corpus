Classification of remote sensing images using attribute profiles and feature profiles from different trees: a comparative study

The motivation of this paper is to conduct a comparative study on remote sensing image classification using the morphological attribute profiles (APs) and feature profiles (FPs) generated from different types of tree structures. Over the past few years, APs have been among the most effective methods to model the image's spatial and contextual information. Recently, a novel extension of APs called FPs has been proposed by replacing pixel gray-levels with some statistical and geometrical features when forming the output profiles. FPs have been proved to be more efficient than the standard APs when generated from component trees (max-tree and min-tree). In this work, we investigate their performance on the inclusion tree (tree of shapes) and partition trees (alpha tree and omega tree). Experimental results from both panchromatic and hyperspectral images again confirm the efficiency of FPs compared to APs.
