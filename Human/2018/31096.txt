Web3D Graphics enabled through Sensor Networks for Cost-Effective Assessment and Management of Energy Efficiency in Buildings

The past decade has seen the advent of numerous building energy efficiency visualization and simulation systems; however, most of them rely on theoretical thermal models to suggest building structural design for new constructions and modifications for existing ones. Sustainable methods of construction have made tremendous progress. The example of the German Energy-Plus- House technology uses a combination of (almost) zero-carbon passive heating technologies. A web-enabled X3D visualization and simulation system coupled with a cost-effective set of temperature/humidity sensors can provide valuable insights into building design, materials and construction that can lead to significant energy savings and an improved thermal comfort for residents, resulting in superior building energy efficiency. A cost-effective hardware-software prototype system is proposed in this paper that can provide real-time data driven visualization or offline simulation of 3D thermal maps for residential and/or commercial buildings on the Web.
