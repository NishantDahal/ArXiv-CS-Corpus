A Secure Multiple Elliptic Curves Digital Signature Algorithm for Blockchain

Most cryptocurrency systems or systems based on blockchain technology are currently using the elliptic curves digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) on the secp256k1 curve, which is susceptible to backdoors implemented by the curve creator (secp256k1). The paper proposes a multiple elliptic curves digi-tal signature algorithm (MECDSA), which allows not only for setting the number of elliptic curves according to practical security requirements, but also for editing the parameters of each elliptic curve. The performance analy-sis proves that the scheme is secure and efficient, and can avoid any back-doors implemented by curve creators. We suggest that the systems based on blockchain should operate in two elliptic curves considering the contradic-tion between security and efficiency.
