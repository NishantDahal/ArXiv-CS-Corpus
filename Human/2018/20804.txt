A Communication Protocol for Man-Machine Networks

One of the most challenging coordination problems in artificial intelligence is to achieve successful collaboration across large-scale heterogeneous systems that include Robots, Agents, and People (RAP). In the best case, these RAP systems are potentially capable of leveraging the strengths of the individual entities to achieve complex distributed tasks. However, without intelligent communication protocols, man-machine partnerships are likely to fail as the humans become overloaded with irrelevant information. This paper introduces a communication protocol for man machine systems and demonstrates that its message routing performance approaches the central optimized solution in a simulated smart environment scenario.
