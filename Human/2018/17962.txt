Semantic Parsing: Syntactic assurance to target sentence using LSTM Encoder CFG-Decoder

Semantic parsing can be defined as the process of mapping natural language sentences into a machine interpretable, formal representation of its meaning. Semantic parsing using LSTM encoder-decoder neural networks have become promising approach. However, human automated translation of natural language does not provide grammaticality guarantees for the sentences generate such a guarantee is particularly important for practical cases where a data base query can cause critical errors if the sentence is ungrammatical. In this work, we propose an neural architecture called Encoder CFG-Decoder, whose output conforms to a given context-free grammar. Results are show for any implementation of such architecture display its correctness and providing benchmark accuracy levels better than the literature.
