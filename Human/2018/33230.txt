A Concise Review of 5G New Radio Capabilities for Directional Access at mmWave Frequencies

In this work, we briefly outline the core 5G air interface improvements introduced by the latest New Radio (NR) specifications, as well as elaborate on the unique features of initial access in 5G NR with a particular emphasis on millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency range. The highly directional nature of 5G mmWave cellular systems poses a variety of fundamental differences and research problem formulations, and a holistic understanding of the key system design principles behind the 5G NR is essential. Here, we condense the relevant information collected from a wide diversity of 5G NR standardization documents (based on 3GPP Release 15) to distill the essentials of directional access in 5G mmWave cellular, which becomes the foundation for any corresponding system-level analysis.
