A Brief Review of Real-World Color Image Denoising

Filtering real-world color images is challenging due to the complexity of noise that can not be formulated as a certain distribution. However, the rapid development of camera lens pos- es greater demands on image denoising in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Currently, the most widely accepted framework employs the combination of transform domain techniques and nonlocal similarity characteristics of natural images. Based on this framework, many competitive methods model the correlation of R, G, B channels with pre-defined or adaptively learned transforms. In this chapter, a brief review of related methods and publicly available datasets is presented, moreover, a new dataset that includes more natural outdoor scenes is introduced. Extensive experiments are performed and discussion on visual effect enhancement is included.
