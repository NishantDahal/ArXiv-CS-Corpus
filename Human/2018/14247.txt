Traffic Differentiation in Dense WLANs with CSMA/ECA-DR MAC Protocol

In today's WLANs, scheduling of packet transmissions solely relies on the collision and success a station may experience. To better support traffic differentiation in dense WLANs, in this paper, we propose a distributed reservation mechanism for the Carrier Sense Multiple Access Extended Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) MAC protocol, termed CSMA/ECA-DR, based on which stations can collaboratively achieve higher network performance. In addition, proper Contention Window (CW) will be chosen based on the instantaneously estimated number of active contenders in the network. Simulation results from dense scenarios with traffic differentiation demonstrate that CSMA/ECA-DR can greatly improve the efficiency of WLANs for traffic differentiation even with large numbers of contenders.
