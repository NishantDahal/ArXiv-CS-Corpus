A class of constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]/\left<u^2\right>$

Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $m$ be a positive integer satisfying $p^m \equiv 3~(\text{mod }4).$ Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ be the finite field with $p^m$ elements, and let $R=\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]/\left<u^2\right>$ be the finite commutative chain ring with unity. In this paper, we determine all constacyclic codes of length $4p^s$ over $R$ and their dual codes, where $s$ is a positive integer. We also determine their sizes and list some isodual constacyclic codes of length $4p^s$ over $R.$
