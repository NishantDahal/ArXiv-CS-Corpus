White Noise from the White Goods? Conceptual and Empirical Perspectives on Ambient Domestic Computing

Within this chapter we consider the emergence of ambient domestic computing systems, both conceptually and empirically. We critically assess visions of post-desktop computing, paying particular attention to one contemporary trend: the internet of things (IoT). We examine the contested nature of this term, looking at the historical trajectory of similar technologies, and the regulatory issues they can pose, particularly in the home. We also look to the emerging regulatory solution of privacy by design, unpacking practical challenges it faces. The novelty of our contribution stems from a turn to practice through a set of empirical perspectives. We present findings that document the practical experiences and viewpoints of leading experts in technology law and design.
