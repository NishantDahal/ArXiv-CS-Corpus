Applying Cooperative Machine Learning to Speed Up the Annotation of Social Signals in Large Multi-modal Corpora

Scientific disciplines, such as Behavioural Psychology, Anthropology and recently Social Signal Processing are concerned with the systematic exploration of human behaviour. A typical work-flow includes the manual annotation (also called coding) of social signals in multi-modal corpora of considerable size. For the involved annotators this defines an exhausting and time-consuming task. In the article at hand we present a novel method and also provide the tools to speed up the coding procedure. To this end, we suggest and evaluate the use of Cooperative Machine Learning (CML) techniques to reduce manual labelling efforts by combining the power of computational capabilities and human intelligence. The proposed CML strategy starts with a small number of labelled instances and concentrates on predicting local parts first. Afterwards, a session-independent classification model is created to finish the remaining parts of the database. Confidence values are computed to guide the manual inspection and correction of the predictions. To bring the proposed approach into application we introduce NOVA - an open-source tool for collaborative and machine-aided annotations. In particular, it gives labellers immediate access to CML strategies and directly provides visual feedback on the results. Our experiments show that the proposed method has the potential to significantly reduce human labelling efforts.
