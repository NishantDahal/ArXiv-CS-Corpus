Performance Analysis of Molecular Spatial Modulation (MSM) in Diffusion based Molecular MIMO Communication Systems

In diffusion-based molecular communication, information is transferred from a transmitter to a receiver using molecular carriers. The low achievable data rate is the main disadvantage of diffusion-based molecular over radio-based communication. One solution to overcome this disadvantage is molecular MIMO communication. In this paper, we introduce molecular spatial modulation (MSM) in molecular MIMO communication to increase the data rate of the system. Also, special detection methods are used, all of which are based on the threshold level detection method. They use diversity techniques in molecular communication systems if the channel matrix that we introduce is full rank. Also, for a 2$\times$1 system, we define an optimization problem to obtain the suitable number of molecules for transmitting to reduce BER of this systems. Then the proposed modulation is generalized to $2\times2$ and $4\times4$ systems. In each of these systems, special detection methods based on the threshold level detection are used. Finally, based on BER, systems using MSM are fairly compared to the systems that have similar data rates. The simulation results show that the proposed modulation and detection methods reduce BER. Whereas the proposed methods are very simple and practical for molecular systems.
