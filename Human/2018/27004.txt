Refining Santa: An Exercise in Efficient Synchronization

The Santa Claus Problem is an intricate exercise for concurrent programming. This paper outlines the refinement steps to develop a highly efficient implementation with concurrent objects, starting from a simple specification. The efficiency of the implementation is compared to those in other languages.
