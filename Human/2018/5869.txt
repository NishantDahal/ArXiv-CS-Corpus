What Should You Know Before Developing a Service Identification Approach

In this paper, we answer a set of research questions that are required to develop service identification approach based on the analysis of object- oriented software. Such research questions are: (1) what is a service, (2) how are services different from software components, (3) what are types of services, (4) what are existing service identification approaches that consider service types into account, and (5) how to identify services based on the object-oriented source code with respect to their types. Our methodology is based on performing a literature review to identify the answers of these research questions. Also, we propose a taxonomy of service types.
