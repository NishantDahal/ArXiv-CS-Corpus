X-GANs: Image Reconstruction Made Easy for Extreme Cases

Image reconstruction including image restoration and denoising is a challenging problem in the field of image computing. We present a new method, called X-GANs, for reconstruction of arbitrary corrupted resource based on a variant of conditional generative adversarial networks (conditional GANs). In our method, a novel generator and multi-scale discriminators are proposed, as well as the combined adversarial losses, which integrate a VGG perceptual loss, an adversarial perceptual loss, and an elaborate corresponding point loss together based on the analysis of image feature. Our conditional GANs have enabled a variety of applications in image reconstruction, including image denoising, image restoration from quite a sparse sampling, image inpainting, image recovery from the severely polluted block or even color-noise dominated images, which are extreme cases and haven't been addressed in the status quo. We have significantly improved the accuracy and quality of image reconstruction. Extensive perceptual experiments on datasets ranging from human faces to natural scenes demonstrate that images reconstructed by the presented approach are considerably more realistic than alternative work. Our method can also be extended to handle high-ratio image compression.
