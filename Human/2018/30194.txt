Amortized Bayesian inference for clustering models

We develop methods for efficient amortized approximate Bayesian inference over posterior distributions of probabilistic clustering models, such as Dirichlet process mixture models. The approach is based on mapping distributed, symmetry-invariant representations of cluster arrangements into conditional probabilities. The method parallelizes easily, yields iid samples from the approximate posterior of cluster assignments with the same computational cost of a single Gibbs sampler sweep, and can easily be applied to both conjugate and non-conjugate models, as training only requires samples from the generative model.
