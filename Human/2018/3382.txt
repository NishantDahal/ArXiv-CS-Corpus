MOEA/D with Angle-based Constrained Dominance Principle for Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems

This paper proposes a novel constraint-handling mechanism named angle-based constrained dominance principle (ACDP) embedded in a decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). To maintain the diversity of the working population, ACDP utilizes the information of the angle of solutions to adjust the dominance relation of solutions during the evolutionary process. This paper uses 14 benchmark instances to evaluate the performance of the MOEA/D with ACDP (MOEA/D-ACDP). Additionally, an engineering optimization problem (which is I-beam optimization problem) is optimized. The proposed MOEA/D-ACDP, and four other decomposition-based CMOEAs, including C-MOEA/D, MOEA/D-CDP, MOEA/D-Epsilon and MOEA/D-SR are tested by the above benchmarks and the engineering application. The experimental results manifest that MOEA/D-ACDP is significantly better than the other four CMOEAs on these test instances and the real-world case, which indicates that ACDP is more effective for solving CMOPs.
