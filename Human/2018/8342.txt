A Survey on Graph Drawing Beyond Planarity

Graph Drawing Beyond Planarity is a rapidly growing research area that classifies and studies geometric representations of non-planar graphs in terms of forbidden crossing configurations. Aim of this survey is to describe the main research directions in this area, the most prominent known results, and some of the most challenging open problems.
