Event-triggered consensus of multi-agent systems under directed topology based on periodic sampled-data

The event-triggered consensus problem of first-order multi-agent systems under directed topology is investigated. The event judgements are only implemented at periodic time instants. Under the designed consensus algorithm, the sampling period is permitted to be arbitrarily large. Another advantage of the designed consensus algorithm is that, for systems with time delay, consensus can be achieved for any finite delay only if it is bounded by the sampling period. The case of strongly connected topology is first investigated. Then, the result is extended to the most general topology which only needs to contain a spanning tree. A novel method based on positive series is introduced to analyze the convergence of the closed-loop systems. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.
