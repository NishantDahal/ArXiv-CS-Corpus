Hyper-Process Model: A Zero-Shot Learning algorithm for Regression Problems based on Shape Analysis

Zero-shot learning (ZSL) can be defined by correctly solving a task where no training data is available, based on previous acquired knowledge from different, but related tasks. So far, this area has mostly drawn the attention from computer vision community where a new unseen image needs to be correctly classified, assuming the target class was not used in the training procedure. Apart from image classification, only a couple of generic methods were proposed that are applicable to both classification and regression. These learn the relation among model coefficients so new ones can be predicted according to provided conditions. So far, up to our knowledge, no methods exist that are applicable only to regression, and take advantage from such setting. Therefore, the present work proposes a novel algorithm for regression problems that uses data drawn from trained models, instead of model coefficients. In this case, a shape analyses on the data is performed to create a statistical shape model and generate new shapes to train new models. The proposed algorithm is tested in a theoretical setting using the beta distribution where main problem to solve is to estimate a function that predicts curves, based on already learned different, but related ones.
