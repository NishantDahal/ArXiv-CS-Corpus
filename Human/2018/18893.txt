DNA Computing for Combinational Logic

With the progressive scale-down of semiconductor's feature size, people are looking forward to More Moore and More than Moore. In order to offer a possible alternative implementation process, people are trying to figure out a feasible transfer from silicon to molecular computing. Such transfer lies on bio-based modules programming with computer-like logic, aiming at realizing the Turing machine. To accomplish this, the DNA-based combinational logic is inevitably the first step we have taken care of. This timely overview paper introduces combinational logic synthesized in DNA computing from both analog and digital perspectives separately. State-of-the-art research progress is summarized for interested readers to quick understand DNA computing, initiate discussion on existing techniques and inspire innovation solutions. We hope this paper can pave the way for the future DNA computing synthesis.
