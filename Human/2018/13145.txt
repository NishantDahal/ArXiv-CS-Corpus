SeNA-CNN: Overcoming Catastrophic Forgetting in Convolutional Neural Networks by Selective Network Augmentation

Lifelong learning aims to develop machine learning systems that can learn new tasks while preserving the performance on previous learned tasks. In this paper we present a method to overcome catastrophic forgetting on convolutional neural networks, that learns new tasks and preserves the performance on old tasks without accessing the data of the original model, by selective network augmentation. The experiment results showed that SeNA-CNN, in some scenarios, outperforms the state-of-art Learning without Forgetting algorithm. Results also showed that in some situations it is better to use SeNA-CNN instead of training a neural network using isolated learning.
