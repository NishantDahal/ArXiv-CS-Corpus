ASIC Implementation of Time-Domain Digital Backpropagation with Deep-Learned Chromatic Dispersion Filters

We consider time-domain digital backpropagation with chromatic dispersion filters jointly optimized and quantized using machine-learning techniques. Compared to the baseline implementations, we show improved BER performance and >40% power dissipation reductions in 28-nm CMOS.
