Low Overhead Weighted-Graph-Coloring-Based Two-Layer Precoding for FDD Massive MIMO Systems

A massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, operating in Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) mode of operation, suffers from prohibitively high overhead associated with downlink channel state information (CSI) acquisition and downlink precoding, due to the lack of uplink/downlink channel reciprocity. In this paper, a heuristic edge-weighted vertex-coloring based pattern division (EWVC-PD) scheme is proposed to alleviate the overhead of a two-layer precoding approach, in a practical scenario where the user clusters undergo serious angular-spreading-range (ASR) overlapping. Specifically, under a constraint of limited number of subchannels, an undirected edge-weighted graph (EWG) is firstly constructed, to depict the potential ASR overlapping relationship among clusters. Then, inspired by classical graph coloring algorithms, we develop the EWVC-PD scheme which mitigate the ASR by subchannel orthogonalization between clusters possessing serious ASR overlapping, and multiplexing the ones having slight ASR overlapping. Simulation results reveal that our scheme efficiently outperforms the existing pattern division schemes.
