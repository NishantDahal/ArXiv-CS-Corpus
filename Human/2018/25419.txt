Peer to Peer Sharing of Distributed Energy Resources

As the penetration of distributed energy resources in the residential sector increases, the scope for sharing arrangements expands. We model a peer-to-peer rental market for rooftop solar and energy storage in the residential sector, with households seeking to minimize their electricity costs. For varying adoption levels, we characterize the market rental price, quantity, and participation rate. We find that up to 15% adoption, the peer-to-peer market generates a surplus comparable to that attainable though a centralized sharing model. The peer-to-peer market can incentivize an increase in total adoption in the long run. We find that direct subsidies would be a cheaper way to increase adoption if enabling the peer-to-peer market increases distribution grid costs by more than a few percent. This cost increase would be related to how locally the peer-to-peer market can match renters and owners. We compute metrics of this localness and find that the market clears quite locally for a wide range of adoption rates.
