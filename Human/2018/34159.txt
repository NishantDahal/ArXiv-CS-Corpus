Computational interpretations of classical reasoning: From the epsilon calculus to stateful programs

The problem of giving a computational meaning to classical reasoning lies at the heart of logic. This article surveys three famous solutions to this problem - the epsilon calculus, modified realizability and the dialectica interpretation - and re-examines them from a modern perspective, with a particular emphasis on connections with algorithms and programming.
