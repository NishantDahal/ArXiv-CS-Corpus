Power Control for Harmonic Utility in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access based Visible Light Communications

Visible light communication is a promising technique in future networks due to its advantages of high data rate and licensed-free spectrum. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered as a candidate of multiple access schemes in 5G networks and beyond. In this paper, we study the power control problem in NOMA-based visible light communication. An optimization problem is formulated, where the objective is the harmonic-rate utility function. The optimal solution is achieved optimally by equivalently transforming the underlying problem into a convex problem. Simulation result is provided to validate performance of the proposed approach.
