A Semi-Analytical Method for Calculating Revisit Time for Satellite Constellations with Discontinuous Coverage

This paper presents a unique approach to the problem of calculating revisit time metrics for different satellite orbits, sensor geometries, and constellation configurations with application to early lifecycle design and optimisation processes for Earth observation missions. The developed semi-analytical approach uses an elliptical projected footprint geometry to provide an accuracy similar to that of industry standard numerical orbit simulation software but with an efficiency of published analytical methods. Using the developed method, extensive plots of maximum revisit time are presented for varying altitude, inclination, target latitudes, sensor capabilities, and constellation configuration, providing valuable reference for Earth observation system design.
