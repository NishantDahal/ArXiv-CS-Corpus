Throughput Maximization in Cloud-Radio Access Networks using Rate-Aware Network Coding

One of the most promising techniques for network-wide interference management necessitates a redesign of the network architecture known as cloud radio access network (CRAN). The cloud is responsible for coordinating multiple Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) and scheduling users to their radio resources blocks (RRBs). The transmit frame of each RRH consists of several orthogonal RRBs each maintained at a certain power level (PL). While previous works considered a vanilla version in which each RRB can serve a single user, this paper proposes mixing the flows of multiple users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). As such, the total throughput is maximized. The joint user scheduling and power adaptation problem is solved by designing, for each RRB, a subgraph in which each vertex represents potential user-RRH associations, encoded files, transmission rates, and PLs for one specific RRB. It is shown that the original problem is equivalent to a maximum-weight clique problem over the union of all subgraphs, called herein the CRAN-IDNCgraph. Extensive simulation results are provided to attest the effectiveness of the proposed solution against state of the art algorithms. In particular, the presented simulation results reveal that the method achieves substantial performance gains for all system configurations which collaborates the theoretical findings.
