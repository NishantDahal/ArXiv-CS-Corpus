Shannon Entropy for Neutrosophic Information

The paper presents an extension of Shannon entropy for neutrosophic information. This extension uses a new formula for distance between two neutrosophic triplets. In addition, the obtained results are particularized for bifuzzy, intuitionistic and paraconsistent fuzzy information.
