Internet of Things Security and Forensics: Challenges and Opportunities

The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions pervasive, connected, and smart nodes interacting autonomously while offering all sorts of services. Wide distribution, openness and relatively high processing power of IoT objects made them an ideal target for cyber attacks. Moreover, as many of IoT nodes are collecting and processing private information, they are becoming a goldmine of data for malicious actors. Therefore, security and specifically the ability to detect compromised nodes, together with collecting and preserving evidences of an attack or malicious activities emerge as a priority in successful deployment of IoT networks. In this paper, we first introduce existing major security and forensics challenges within IoT domain and then briefly discuss about papers published in this special issue targeting identified challenges.
