Model-Based Stochastic Search for Large Scale Optimization of Multi-Agent UAV Swarms

Recent work from the reinforcement learning community has shown that Evolution Strategies are a fast and scalable alternative to other reinforcement learning methods. In this paper we show that Evolution Strategies are a special case of model-based stochastic search methods. This class of algorithms has nice asymptotic convergence properties and known convergence rates. We show how these methods can be used to solve both cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in an efficient manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on two complex multi-agent UAV swarm combat scenarios: where a team of fixed wing aircraft must attack a well-defended base, and where two teams of agents go head to head to defeat each other.
