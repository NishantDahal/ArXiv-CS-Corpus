Adult content in Social Live Streaming Services: Characterizing deviant users and relationships

Social Live Stream Services (SLSS) exploit a new level of social interaction. One of the main challenges in these services is how to detect and prevent deviant behaviors that violate community guidelines. In this work, we focus on adult content production and consumption in two widely used SLSS, namely Live.me and Loops Live, which have millions of users producing massive amounts of video content on a daily basis. We use a pre-trained deep learning model to identify broadcasters of adult content. Our results indicate that moderation systems in place are highly ineffective in suspending the accounts of such users. We create two large datasets by crawling the social graphs of these platforms, which we analyze to identify characterizing traits of adult content producers and consumers, and discover interesting patterns of relationships among them, evident in both networks.
