Mitigation of Flooding and Slow DDoS Attacks in a Software-Defined Network

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a constant threat for services in the Internet. This year, the record for the largest DDoS attack ever observed was set at 1.7 Tbps. Meanwhile, detection and mitigation mechanisms are still lacking behind. Many mitigation systems require the assistance by the victim - or the victim's administrator themself has to become active to mitigate attacks. We introduced a system that can detect attacks, identify attackers, and mitigate the attacks purely within the network infrastructure. With the improved flexibility of software-defined networks, new possibilities to mitigate such attacks can be implemented. In addition to our short paper on the mitigation of reflective DDoS attacks on LCN 2018, we also like to demonstrate our work on mitigating flooding attacks presented at LCN 2017 and our mitigation of slow DDoS attacks. In our demo, we show how these systems can be combined and how they work when faced with such different attacks.
