Strong Interference Alignment

Interference alignment (IA) adjusts signaling scheme such that all interfering signals are squeezed in interference subspace. IA mostly achieves its performance via infinite extension of the channel, which is a major challenge for IA in practical systems. In this paper, we make part of interference very strong and achieve perfect IA within limited number of channel extensions. A single-hop $3$ user single antenna interference channel (IFC) is considered and it is shown that only one of the interfering signal streams needs to be strong so that perfect IA is feasible.
