Polarization Weight Family Methods for Polar Code Construction

Polar codes are the first proven capacity-achieving codes. Recently, they are adopted as the channel coding scheme for 5G due to their superior performance.A polar code for encoding length-K information bits in length-N codeword could be specified by the polar code construction method. Most construction methods define a polar code related to channel parameter set, e.g. designed signal-to-noise ratio. Polarization weight (PW) is a channel-independent approximation method, which estimates the subchannel reliability as a function of its index. In this paper, we generalize the PW method by including higher-order bases or extended bases. The proposed methods have robust performance while preserving the computational and mathematical simplicity as PW.
