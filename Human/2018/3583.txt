Classification of Things in DBpedia using Deep Neural Networks

The Semantic Web aims at representing knowledge about the real world at web scale - things, their attributes and relationships among them can be represented as nodes and edges in an inter-linked semantic graph. In the presence of noisy data, as is typical of data on the Semantic Web, a software Agent needs to be able to robustly infer one or more associated actionable classes for the individuals in order to act automatically on it. We model this problem as a multi-label classification task where we want to robustly identify types of the individuals in a semantic graph such as DBpedia, which we use as an exemplary dataset on the Semantic Web. Our approach first extracts multiple features for the individuals using random walks and then performs multi-label classification using fully-connected Neural Networks. Through systematic exploration and experimentation, we identify the effect of hyper-parameters of the feature extraction and the fully-connected Neural Network structure on the classification performance. Our final results show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art inferencing systems like SDtype and SLCN, from which we can conclude that random-walk-based feature extraction of individuals and their multi-label classification using Deep Neural Networks is a promising alternative to these systems for type classification of individuals on the Semantic Web. The main contribution of our work is to introduce a novel approach that allows us to use Deep Neural Networks to identify types of individuals in a noisy semantic graph by extracting features using random walks
