Locomoting robots composed of immobile robots

Robotic materials are multi-robot systems formulated to leverage the low-order computation and actuation of the constituents to manipulate the high-order behavior of the entire material. We study the behaviors of ensembles composed of smart active particles, smarticles. Smarticles are small, low cost robots equipped with basic actuation and sensing abilities that are individually incapable of rotating or displacing. We demonstrate that a "supersmarticle", composed of many smarticles constrained within a bounding membrane, can harness the internal collisions of the robotic material among the constituents and the membrane to achieve diffusive locomotion. The emergent diffusion can be directed by modulating the robotic material properties in response to a light source, analogous to biological phototaxis. The light source introduces asymmetries within the robotic material, resulting in modified populations of interaction modes and dynamics which ultimately result in supersmarticle biased locomotion. We present experimental methods and results for the robotic material which moves with a directed displacement in response to a light source.
