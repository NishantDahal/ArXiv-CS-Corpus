Majorization and Rényi Entropy Inequalities via Sperner Theory

A natural link between the notions of majorization and strongly Sperner posets is elucidated. It is then used to obtain a variety of consequences, including new Rényi entropy inequalities for sums of independent, integer-valued random variables.
