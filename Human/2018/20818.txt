Multilayer Optimization for the Quantum Internet

We define a multilayer optimization method for the quantum Internet. Multilayer optimization integrates separate procedures for the optimization of the quantum layer and the classical layer of the quantum Internet. The multilayer optimization procedure defines advanced techniques for the optimization of the layers. The optimization of the quantum layer covers the minimization of total usage time of quantum memories in the quantum nodes, the maximization of the entanglement throughput over the entangled links, and the reduction of the number of entangled links between the arbitrary source and target quantum nodes. The objective of the optimization of the classical layer is the cost minimization of any auxiliary classical communications. The multilayer optimization framework provides a practically implementable tool for quantum network communications, or long-distance quantum communications.
