Building Encoder and Decoder with Deep Neural Networks: On the Way to Reality

Deep learning has been a groundbreaking technology in various fields as well as in communications systems. In spite of the notable advancements of deep neural network (DNN) based technologies in recent years, the high computational complexity has been a major obstacle to apply DNN in practical communications systems which require real-time operation. In this sense, challenges regarding practical implementation must be addressed before the proliferation of DNN-based intelligent communications becomes a reality. To the best of the authors' knowledge, for the first time, this article presents an efficient learning architecture and design strategies including link level verification through digital circuit implementations using hardware description language (HDL) to mitigate this challenge and to deduce feasibility and potential of DNN for communications systems. In particular, DNN is applied for an encoder and a decoder to enable flexible adaptation with respect to the system environments without needing any domain specific information. Extensive investigations and interdisciplinary design considerations including the DNN-based autoencoder structure, learning framework, and low-complexity digital circuit implementations for real-time operation are taken into account by the authors which ascertains the use of DNN-based communications in practice.
