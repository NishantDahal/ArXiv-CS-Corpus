Dynamics of Opinions with Social Biases

This paper aims to provide a systemic analysis to social opinion dynamics subject to individual biases. As a generalization of the classical DeGroot social interactions, defined by linearly coupled dynamics of peer opinions that evolve over time, biases add to state-dependent edge weights and therefore lead to highly nonlinear network dynamics. Previous studies have dealt with convergence and stability analysis of such systems for a few specific initial node opinions and network structures, and here we focus on how individual biases affect social equilibria and their stabilities. First of all, we prove that when the initial network opinions are polarized towards one side of the state space, node biases will drive the opinion evolution to the corresponding interval boundaries. Such polarization attraction effect continues to hold under even directed and switching network structures. Next, for a few fundamental network structures, some important interior network equilibria are presented explicitly for a wide range of system parameters, which are shown to be locally unstable in general. Particularly, the interval centroid is proven to be unstable regardless of the bias level and the network topologies.
