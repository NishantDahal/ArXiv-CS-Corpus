Summary of a Literature Review in Scalability of QoS-aware Service Composition

This paper shows that authors have no consistent way to characterize the scalability of their solutions, and so consider only a limited number of scaling characteristics. This review aimed at establishing the evidence that the route for designing and evaluating the scalability of dynamic QoS-aware service composition mechanisms has been lacking systematic guidance, and has been informed by a very limited set of criteria. For such, we analyzed 47 papers, from 2004 to 2018.
