Symmetries of Quantified Boolean Formulas

While symmetries are well understood for Boolean formulas and successfully exploited in practical SAT solving, less is known about symmetries in quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). There are some works introducing adaptions of propositional symmetry breaking techniques, with a theory covering only very specific parts of QBF symmetries. We present a general framework that gives a concise characterization of symmetries of QBF. Our framework naturally incorporates the duality of universal and existential symmetries resulting in a general basis for QBF symmetry breaking.
