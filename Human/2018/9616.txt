Sparse Gaussian ICA

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Its goal is to recover a latent random vector S with independent components from samples of X=AS where A is an unknown mixing matrix. Critically, all existing methods for ICA rely on and exploit strongly the assumption that S is not Gaussian as otherwise A becomes unidentifiable. In this paper, we show that in fact one can handle the case of Gaussian components by imposing structure on the matrix A. Specifically, we assume that A is sparse and generic in the sense that it is generated from a sparse Bernoulli-Gaussian ensemble. Under this condition, we give an efficient algorithm to recover the columns of A given only the covariance matrix of X as input even when S has several Gaussian components.
