The Sounds of Cyber Threats

The Internet enables users to access vast resources, but it can also expose users to harmful cyber-attacks. This paper investigates human factors issues concerning the use of sounds in a cyber-security domain. It describes a methodology, referred to as sonification, to effectively design and develop auditory cyber-security threat indicators to warn users about cyber-attacks. A case study is presented, along with the results, of various types of usability testing with a number of Internet users who are visually impaired. The paper concludes with a discussion of future steps to enhance this work.
