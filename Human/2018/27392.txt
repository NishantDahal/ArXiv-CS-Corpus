The rank of random matrices over finite fields

We determine the rank of a random matrix A over a finite field with prescribed numbers of non-zero entries in each row and column. As an application we obtain a formula for the rate of low-density parity check codes. This formula verifies a conjecture of Lelarge [Proc. IEEE Information Theory Workshop 2013]. The proofs are based on coupling arguments and the interpolation method from mathematical physics.
