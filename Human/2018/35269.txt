Error correcting codes from sub-exceeding fonction

In this paper, we present error-correcting codes which are the results of our research on the sub-exceeding functions. For a short and medium distance data transmission (wifi network, bluetooth, cable, ...), we see that these codes mentioned above present many advantages compared with the Hamming code which is a 1 correcting code.
