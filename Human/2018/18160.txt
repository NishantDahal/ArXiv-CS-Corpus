An Efficient Technique for Protecting Location Privacy of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Users

Cooperative spectrum sensing, despite its effectiveness in enabling dynamic spectrum access, suffers from location privacy threats, merely because secondary users (SUs)' sensing reports that need to be shared with a fusion center to make spectrum availability decisions are highly correlated to the users' locations. It is therefore important that cooperative spectrum sensing schemes be empowered with privacy-preserving capabilities so as to provide SUs with incentives for participating in the sensing task. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving protocol that uses an additional architectural entity and makes use of various cryptographic mechanisms to preserve the location privacy of SUs while performing reliable and efficient spectrum sensing. We show that not only is our proposed scheme secure and more efficient than existing alternatives, but also achieves fault tolerance and is robust against sporadic network topological changes.
