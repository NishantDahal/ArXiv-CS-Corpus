MAC level Throughput comparison: 802.11ax vs. 802.11ac

In this paper we compare between the maximum Throughputs received in IEEE 802.11ax and IEEE 802.11ac in a scenario where a single user continuously transmits to another one. The comparison is done as a function of the Modulation/Coding scheme in use. In IEEE 802.11ax we consider two modes of operation where in one Acknowledgment frame up to 64 or 256 frames are acknowledged respectively. IEEE 802.11ax outperforms IEEE 802.11ac by at most 48% and 29% in unreliable and reliable channels respectively.
