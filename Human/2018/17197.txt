A Comprehensive Review of Technologies Used for Screening, Assessment, and Rehabilitation of Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term for a wide range of developmental disorders. For the past two decades, researchers proposed the use of various technologies in order to tackle specific symptoms of the disorder. Although there exist many literature reviews about screening, assessment, and rehabilitation of ASD, no comprehensive survey of types of technologies in all defined symptoms of ASD has been presented. Therefore, in this paper a comprehensive survey of previous studies has been presented in which the studies are classified into three main categories, and several sub-categories, and three main technologies. An analysis of the number of studies in each category and sub-category is given to help researchers decide on areas which need further investigation. The analysis show that the majority of studies fall into the software-based systems technology category. Finally, a brief review of studies in each category of ASD is presented for each type of technology. As a result, this paper also helps researchers to obtain an overview of the typical methods of using a specific technology in ASD screening, assessment, and rehabilitation.
