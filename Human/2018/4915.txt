A Telecom Perspective on the Internet of Drones: From LTE-Advanced to 5G

Drones are driving numerous and evolving use cases, and creating transformative socio-economic benefits. Drone operation needs wireless connectivity for communication between drones and ground control systems, among drones, and between drones and air traffic management systems. Mobile networks are well positioned to identify, track, and control the growing fleet of drones. The wide-area, quality, and secure connectivity provided by mobile networks can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of drone operations beyond visual line-of-sight range. In this article, we elaborate how the drone ecosystem can benefit from mobile technologies, summarize key capabilities required by drone applications, and analyze the service requirements on mobile networks. We present field trial results collected in LTE-Advanced networks to gain insights into the capabilities of the current 4G+ networks for connected drones and share our vision on how 5G networks can further support diversified drone applications.
