A Logarithmic Barrier Method For Proximal Policy Optimization

Proximal policy optimization(PPO) has been proposed as a first-order optimization method for reinforcement learning. We should notice that an exterior penalty method is used in it. Often, the minimizers of the exterior penalty functions approach feasibility only in the limits as the penalty parameter grows increasingly large. Therefore, it may result in the low level of sampling efficiency. This method, which we call proximal policy optimization with barrier method (PPO-B), keeps almost all advantageous spheres of PPO such as easy implementation and good generalization. Specifically, a new surrogate objective with interior penalty method is proposed to avoid the defect arose from exterior penalty method. Conclusions can be draw that PPO-B is able to outperform PPO in terms of sampling efficiency since PPO-B achieved clearly better performance on Atari and Mujoco environment than PPO.
