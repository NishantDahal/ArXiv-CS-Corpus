Eigenvalue Analysis via Kernel Density Estimation

In this paper, we propose an eigenvalue analysis -- of system dynamics models -- based on the Mutual Information measure, which in turn will be estimated via the Kernel Density Estimation method. We postulate that the proposed approach represents a novel and efficient multivariate eigenvalue sensitivity analysis.
