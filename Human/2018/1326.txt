Improving the Secrecy of Distributed Storage Systems using Interference Alignment

Regenerating codes based on the approach of interference alignment for wireless interference channel achieve the cut-set bound for distributed storage systems. These codes provide data reliability, and perform efficient exact node repair when some node fails. Interference alignment as a concept is especially important to improve the repair efficiency of a failed node in a minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code. In addition it can improve the stored data security in presence of passive intruders. In this paper we construct a new code resilient against a threat model where a passive eavesdropper can access the data stored on a subset of nodes and the downloaded data during the repair process of a subset of failed nodes. We achieve an optimal secrecy capacity for the new explicit construction of MSR interference alignment code. Hence, we show that the eavesdropper obtains zero information from the original message stored across the distributed storage, and that we achieve a perfect secrecy.
