BKTreebank: Building a Vietnamese Dependency Treebank

Dependency treebank is an important resource in any language. In this paper, we present our work on building BKTreebank, a dependency treebank for Vietnamese. Important points on designing POS tagset, dependency relations, and annotation guidelines are discussed. We describe experiments on POS tagging and dependency parsing on the treebank. Experimental results show that the treebank is a useful resource for Vietnamese language processing.
