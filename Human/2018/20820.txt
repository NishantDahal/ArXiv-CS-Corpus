Sentiment Index of the Russian Speaking Facebook

A sentiment index measures the average emotional level in a corpus. We introduce four such indexes and use them to gauge average "positiveness" of a population during some period based on posts in a social network. This article for the first time presents a text-, rather than word-based sentiment index. Furthermore, this study presents the first large-scale study of the sentiment index of the Russian-speaking Facebook. Our results are consistent with the prior experiments for the English language.
