Study on A High-integrated Cloud-Based Customer Relationship Management System

In the context of the business applications, integrating an on-premise customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with other systems used to be resource-consuming and complicated in terms of data and system interworking. With the help of cloud computing technology, on-cloud business applications have the capability of integrating CRM with ERP and other systems more efficiently. This allows large enterprises as well as small and medium companies (SMEs) manage critical business processes (such as Sales, Marketing, Customer Service, Operations, Finance, Field Service and Project Service Automation) in a unified manner. Therefore, businesses can cover the entire customer lifecycle by effectively utilizing all of these resources. This case study analyses on-demand CRM applications that are part of Microsoft Dynamics 365. By studying the structures and how Dynamics 365 CRM integrates with other applications, this paper provides a reference to companies that plan to switch their on-premise CRM to the Cloud.
