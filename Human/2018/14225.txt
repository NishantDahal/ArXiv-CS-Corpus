Adaptive guaranteed-performance consensus design for high-order multiagent systems

The current paper addresses the distributed guaranteed-performance consensus design problems for general high-order linear multiagent systems with leaderless and leader-follower structures, respectively. The information about the Laplacian matrix of the interaction topology or its minimum nonzero eigenvalue is usually required in existing works on the guaranteed-performance consensus, which means that their conclusions are not completely distributed. A new translation-adaptive strategy is proposed to realize the completely distributed guaranteed-performance consensus control by using the structure feature of a complete graph in the current paper. For the leaderless case, an adaptive guaranteed-performance consensualization criterion is given in terms of Riccati inequalities and a regulation approach of the consensus control gain is presented by linear matrix inequalities. Extensions to the leader-follower cases are further investigated. Especially, the guaranteed-performance costs for leaderless and leader-follower cases are determined, respectively, which are associated with the intrinsic structure characteristic of the interaction topologies. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate theoretical results.
