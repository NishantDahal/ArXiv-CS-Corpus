Relative Pose Based Redundancy Removal: Collaborative RGB-D Data Transmission in Mobile Visual Sensor Networks

The Relative Pose based Redundancy Removal(RPRR) scheme is presented, which has been designed for mobile RGB-D sensor networks operating under bandwidth-constrained operational scenarios. Participating sensor nodes detect the redundant visual and depth information to prevent their transmission leading to a significant improvement in wireless channel usage efficiency and power savings. Experimental results show that wireless channel utilization is improved by 250% and battery consumption is halved when the RPRR scheme is used instead of sending the sensor images independently.
