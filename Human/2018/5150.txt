Secure Web Access Control Algorithm

The paper presents a flexible and efficient method to secure the access to a Web site implemented in PHP script language. The algorithm is based on the PHP session mechanism. The proposed method is a general one and offers the possibility to implement a PHP based secured access to a Web site, through a portal page and using an additional script included in any site page, which is required to be accessed only by registered users. This paper presents the design, implementation and integration of the algorithm on any generic WEB site.
