Solving Minimum k-supplier in Adleman-Lipton model

In this paper, we consider an algorithm for solving the minimum k supplier problem using the Adleman Lipton model. The procedure works in polynomial steps for the minimum k supplier problem of an undirected graph with n vertices, which is an NP hard combinatorial optimization problem.
