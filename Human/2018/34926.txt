Verl√§ssliche Software im 21. Jahrhundert

Software is the main innovation driver in many different areas, like cloud services, autonomous driving, connected medical devices, and high-frequency trading. All these areas have in common that they require high dependability. In this paper, we discuss challenges and research directions imposed by these new areas on guaranteeing the dependability. On the one hand challenges include characteristics of the systems themselves, e. g., open systems and ad-hoc structures. On the other hand, we see new aspects of dependability like behavioral traceability.
