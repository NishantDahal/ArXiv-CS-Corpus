Fair Allocation of Indivisible Items With Externalities

One of the important yet insufficiently studied subjects in fair allocation is the externality effect among agents. For a resource allocation problem, externalities imply that a bundle allocated to an agent may affect the utilities of other agents.
  In this paper, we conduct a study of fair allocation of indivisible goods when the externalities are not negligible. We present a simple and natural model, namely \emph{network externalities}, to capture the externalities. To evaluate fairness in the network externalities model, we generalize the idea behind the notion of maximin-share ($\MMS$) to achieve a new criterion, namely, \emph{extended-maximin-share} ($\EMMS$). Next, we consider two problems concerning our model.
  First, we discuss the computational aspects of finding the value of $\EMMS$ for every agent. For this, we introduce a generalized form of partitioning problem that includes many famous partitioning problems such as maximin, minimax, and leximin partitioning problems. We show that a $1/2$-approximation algorithm exists for this partitioning problem.
  Next, we investigate on finding approximately optimal $\EMMS$ allocations. That is, allocations that guarantee every agent a utility of at least a fraction of his extended-maximin-share. We show that under a natural assumption that the agents are $α$-self-reliant, an $α/2$-$\EMMS$ allocation always exists. The combination of this with the former result yields a polynomial-time $α/4$-$\EMMS$ allocation algorithm.
