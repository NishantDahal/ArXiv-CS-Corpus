Gosig: Scalable Byzantine Consensus on Adversarial Wide Area Network for Blockchains

Existing Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols face significant challenges in the consortium blockchain scenario. On the one hand, we can make little assumptions about the reliability and security of the underlying Internet. On the other hand, the applications on consortium blockchains demand a system as scalable as the Bit-coin but providing much higher performance, as well as provable safety. We present a new BFT protocol, Gosig, that combines crypto-based secret leader selection and multi-round voting in the protocol layer with implementation layer optimizations such as gossip-based message propagation. In particular, Gosig guarantees safety even in a network fully controlled by adversaries, while providing provable liveness with easy-to-achieve network connectivity assumption. On a wide area testbed consisting of 140 Amazon EC2 servers spanning 14 cities on five continents, we show that Gosig can achieve over 4,000 transactions per second with less than 1 minute transaction confirmation time.
