COBOL to Java and Newspapers Still Get Delivered

This paper is an experience report on migrating an American newspaper company's business-critical IBM mainframe application to Linux servers by automatically translating the application's source code from COBOL to Java and converting the mainframe data store from VSAM KSDS files to an Oracle relational database. The mainframe application had supported daily home delivery of the newspaper since 1979. It was in need of modernization in order to increase interoperability and enable future convergence with newer enterprise systems as well as to reduce operating costs. Testing the modernized application proved to be the most vexing area of work. This paper explains the process that was employed to test functional equivalence between the legacy and modernized applications, the main testing challenges, and lessons learned after having operated and maintained the modernized application in production over the last eight months. The goal of delivering a functionally equivalent system was achieved, but problems remained to be solved related to new feature development, business domain knowledge transfer, and recruiting new software engineers to work on the modernized application.
