The algorithm of formation of a training set for an artificial neural network for image segmentation

This article suggests an algorithm of formation a training set for artificial neural network in case of image segmentation. The distinctive feature of this algorithm is that it using only one image for segmentation. The segmentation performs using three-layer perceptron. The main method of the segmentation is a method of region growing. Neural network is using for get a decision to include pixel into an area or not. Impulse noise is using for generation of a training set. Pixels damaged by noise are not related to the same region. Suggested method has been tested with help of computer experiment in automatic and interactive modes.
