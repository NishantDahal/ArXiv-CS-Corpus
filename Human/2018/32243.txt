Fuzzy Based Wellness Analyzer

Social health and emotional wellness is a matter of concern in today's urban world. Being the part of a metropolis has an effect on mental health through the influence of increased stressors and factors such as overcrowded and polluted environment, high levels of violence, and reduced social support. It is important to realize that only healthy citizens can constitute together a smart city. In this paper, we present a fuzzy-based approach for analyzing the well being of a person. We track the general day to day activities of a person and analyze its performance. To do so, we divide the factors affecting the wellness of a person into three components which are the physical, productive and social. Using these parameters, we output a coefficient for the overall well being of a person.
