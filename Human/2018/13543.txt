Wireless Networks for Mobile Edge Computing: Spatial Modeling and Latency Analysis (Extended version)

Next-generation wireless networks will provide users ubiquitous low-latency computing services using devices at the network edge, called mobile edge computing (MEC). The key operation of MEC, mobile computation offloading (MCO), is to offload computation intensive tasks from users. Since each edge device comprises an access point (AP) and a computer server (CS), a MEC network can be decomposed as a radio access network (RAN) cascaded with a CS network (CSN). Based on the architecture, we investigate network constrained latency performance, namely communication latency (comm-latency) and computation latency (comp-latency) under the constraints of RAN coverage and CSN stability. To this end, a spatial random network is modeled featuring random node distribution, parallel computing, non-orthogonal multiple access, and random computation-task generation. Given the model and the said network constraints, we derive the scaling laws of comm-latency and comp-latency with respect to network-load parameters (density of mobiles and their task-generation rates) and network-resource parameters (bandwidth, density of APs/CSs, CS computation rate). Essentially, the analysis involves the interplay of theories of stochastic geometry, queueing, and parallel computing. Combining the derived scaling laws quantifies the tradeoffs between the latencies, network coverage and network stability. The results provide useful guidelines for MEC-network provisioning and planning by avoiding either of the cascaded RAN or CSN being a performance bottleneck.
