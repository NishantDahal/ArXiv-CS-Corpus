A Nonparametric Delayed Feedback Model for Conversion Rate Prediction

Predicting conversion rates (CVRs) in display advertising (e.g., predicting the proportion of users who purchase an item (i.e., a conversion) after its corresponding ad is clicked) is important when measuring the effects of ads shown to users and to understanding the interests of the users. There is generally a time delay (i.e., so-called {\it delayed feedback}) between the ad click and conversion. Owing to the delayed feedback, samples that are converted after an observation period may be treated as negative. To overcome this drawback, CVR prediction assuming that the time delay follows an exponential distribution has been proposed. In practice, however, there is no guarantee that the delay is generated from the exponential distribution, and the best distribution with which to represent the delay depends on the data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric delayed feedback model for CVR prediction that represents the distribution of the time delay without assuming a parametric distribution, such as an exponential or Weibull distribution. Because the distribution of the time delay is modeled depending on the content of an ad and the features of a user, various shapes of the distribution can be represented potentially. In experiments, we show that the proposed model can capture the distribution for the time delay on a synthetic dataset, even when the distribution is complicated. Moreover, on a real dataset, we show that the proposed model outperforms the existing method that assumes an exponential distribution for the time delay in terms of conversion rate prediction.
