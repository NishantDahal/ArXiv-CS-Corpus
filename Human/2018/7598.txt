Stable Throughput Region of Cognitive-Relay Networks with Imperfect Sensing and Finite Relaying Buffer

In this letter, we obtain the stable throughput region for a cognitive relaying scheme with a finite relaying buffer and imperfect sensing. The analysis investigates the effect of the secondary user's finite relaying capabilities under different scenarios of primary, secondary and relaying links outages. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effect of miss detection and false alarm probabilities on the achievable throughput for the primary and secondary users.
