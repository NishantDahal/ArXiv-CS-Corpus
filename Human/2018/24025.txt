Local Reconstruction Codes: A Class of MDS-PIR Capacity-Achieving Codes

We prove that a class of distance-optimal local reconstruction codes (LRCs), an important family of repair-efficient codes for distributed storage systems, achieve the maximum distance separable private information retrieval capacity for the case of noncolluding nodes. This particular class of codes includes Pyramid codes and other LRCs proposed in the literature.
