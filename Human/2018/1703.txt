Structure of linear codes over the ring $B_k$

We study the structure of linear codes over the ring $B_k$ which is defined by $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}[v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_k]/\langle v_i^2=v_i,~v_iv_j=v_jv_i \rangle_{i,j=1}^k.$ In order to study the codes, we begin with studying the structure of the ring $B_k$ via a Gray map which also induces a relation between codes over $B_k$ and codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}.$ We consider Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual codes, MacWilliams relations, as well as Singleton-type bounds for these codes. Further, we characterize cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes using their images under the Gray map, and give the generators for these type of codes.
