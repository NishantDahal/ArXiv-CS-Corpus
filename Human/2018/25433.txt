Doubly F-Bounded Generics

In this paper we suggest how f-bounded generics in nominally-typed OOP can be extended to the more general notion we call `doubly f-bounded generics' and we suggest how doubly f-bounded generics can be reasoned about. We also (attempt to) prove, using a coinductive argument, that our reasoning method is mathematically sound.
