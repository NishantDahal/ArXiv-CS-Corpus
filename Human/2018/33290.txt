Interference-Free Transceiver Design and Signal Detection for Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems over Frequency-Selective Channels

In this letter, we study the ambient backscatter communication systems over frequency-selective channels. Specifically, we propose an interference-free transceiver design to facilitate signal detection at the reader. Our design utilizes the cyclic prefix (CP) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) source symbols, which can cancel the signal interference and thus enhance the detection accuracy at the reader. Meanwhile, our design results in no interference on the existing OFDM communication systems. We also suggest a maximum likelihood (ML) detector for the reader and derive two detection thresholds. Simulations are then provided to corroborate our proposed studies.
