Interactive Cognitive Assessment Tools: A Case Study on Digital Pens for the Clinical Assessment of Dementia

Interactive cognitive assessment tools may be valuable for doctors and therapists to reduce costs and improve quality in healthcare systems. Use cases and scenarios include the assessment of dementia. In this paper, we present our approach to the semi-automatic assessment of dementia. We describe a case study with digital pens for the patients including background, problem description and possible solutions. We conclude with lessons learned when implementing digital tests, and a generalisation for use outside the cognitive impairments field.
