QARC: Video Quality Aware Rate Control for Real-Time Video Streaming via Deep Reinforcement Learning

Due to the fluctuation of throughput under various network conditions, how to choose a proper bitrate adaptively for real-time video streaming has become an upcoming and interesting issue. Recent work focuses on providing high video bitrates instead of video qualities. Nevertheless, we notice that there exists a trade-off between sending bitrate and video quality, which motivates us to focus on how to get a balance between them. In this paper, we propose QARC (video Quality Awareness Rate Control), a rate control algorithm that aims to have a higher perceptual video quality with possibly lower sending rate and transmission latency. Starting from scratch, QARC uses deep reinforcement learning(DRL) algorithm to train a neural network to select future bitrates based on previously observed network status and past video frames, and we design a neural network to predict future perceptual video quality as a vector for taking the place of the raw picture in the DRL's inputs. We evaluate QARC over a trace-driven emulation. As excepted, QARC betters existing approaches.
