Certified Mapper: Repeated testing for acyclicity and obstructions to the nerve lemma

The Mapper algorithm does not include a check for whether the cover produced conforms to the requirements of the nerve lemma. To perform a check for obstructions to the nerve lemma, statistical considerations of multiple testing quickly arise.
  In this paper, we propose several statistical approaches to finding obstructions: through a persistent nerve lemma, through simulation testing, and using a parametric refinement of simulation tests.
  We suggest Certified Mapper -- a method built from these approaches to generate certificates of non-obstruction, or identify specific obstructions to the nerve lemma -- and we give recommendations for which statistical approaches are most appropriate for the task.
