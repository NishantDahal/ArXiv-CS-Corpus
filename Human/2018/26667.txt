5Gperf: signal processing performance for 5G

The 5Gperf project was conducted by Huawei research teams in 2016-17. It was concerned with the acceleration of signal-processing algorithms for a 5G base-station prototype. It improved on already optimized SIMD-parallel CPU algorithms and designed a new software tool for higher programmer productivity when converting MATLAB code to optimized C
