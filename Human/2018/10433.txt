A novel algorithm for solving the Decision Boolean Satisfiability Problem without algebra

This paper depicts an algorithm for solving the Decision Boolean Satisfiability Problem using the binary numerical properties of a Special Decision Satisfiability Problem, parallel execution, object oriented, and short termination. The two operations: expansion and simplification are used to explains why using algebra grows the resolution steps. It is proved that its complexity has an upper bound of $2^{n-1}$ where $n$ is the number of logical variables of the given problem.
