Pull-based Bloom Filter-based Routing for Information-Centric Networks

In Named Data Networking (NDN), there is a need for routing protocols to populate Forwarding Information Base (FIB) tables so that the Interest messages can be forwarded. To populate FIBs, clients and routers require some routing information. One method to obtain this information is that network nodes exchange routing information by each node advertising the available content objects. Bloom Filter-based Routing approaches like BFR [1], use Bloom Filters (BFs) to advertise all provided content objects, which consumes valuable bandwidth and storage resources. This strategy is inefficient as clients request only a small number of the provided content objects and they do not need the content advertisement information for all provided content objects. In this paper, we propose a novel routing algorithm for NDN called pull-based BFR in which servers only advertise the demanded file names. We compare the performance of pull-based BFR with original BFR and with a flooding-assisted routing protocol. Our experimental evaluations show that pull-based BFR outperforms original BFR in terms of communication overhead needed for content advertisements, average roundtrip delay, memory resources needed for storing content advertisements at clients and routers, and the impact of false positive reports on routing. The comparisons also show that pull-based BFR outperforms flooding-assisted routing in terms of average round-trip delay.
