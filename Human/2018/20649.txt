Kinetostatic analysis and solution classification of a class of planar tensegrity mechanisms

Tensegrity mechanisms are composed of rigid and tensile parts that are in equilibrium. They are interesting alternative designs for some applications, such as modelling musculo-skeleton systems. Tensegrity mechanisms are more difficult to analyze than classical mechanisms as the static equilibrium conditions that must be satisfied generally result in complex equations. A class of planar one-degree-of-freedom tensegrity mechanisms with three linear springs is analyzed in detail for the sake of systematic solution classifications. The kinetostatic equations are derived and solved under several loading and geometric conditions. It is shown that these mechanisms exhibit up to six equilibrium configurations, of which one or two are stable, depending on the geometric and loading conditions. Discriminant varieties and cylindrical algebraic decomposition combined with Groebner base elimination are used to classify solutions as a function of the geometric, loading and actuator input parameters.
