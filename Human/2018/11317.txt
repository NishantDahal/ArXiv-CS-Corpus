Therefore, rating of a review is one of the reliable factors for all users to read and trust the reviews. This paper analyzes the texts of the reviews to evaluate and predict the ratings. Moreover, we study the effect of lexical features generated from text as well as sentimental words on the accuracy of rating prediction. Our analysis show that words with high information gain score are more efficient compared to words with high TF-IDF value.
