The Complex Link

Cyberspace is being more and more tightly linked to the physical space and socioeconomic space to emerge a cyber-physical-socioeconomic space, where humans, machines and physical objects in the natural environment interact with each other, efficiently share resources and co-evolve to emerge cyber-physical-social patterns from different spaces. The complex space provides a new reality for experiencing, understanding, thinking and making intelligent decisions. Various links, mappings, and flows bridge and extend the existing understandings to render Cyber-Physical-Socioeconomic Intelligence.
