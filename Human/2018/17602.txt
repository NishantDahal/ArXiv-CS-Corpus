Statistical Characterization of Second Order Scattering Fading Channels

We present a new approach to the statistical characterization of the second order scattering fading (SOSF) channel model, which greatly simplifies its analysis. Exploiting the unadvertised fact that the SOSF channel can be seen as a continuous mixture of Rician fading channels, we obtain expressions for its probability density function and cumulative density function that are numerically better-behaved than those available in the literature. Our approach allows for obtaining new results for the SOSF model, such as a closed-form expression for its moment-generating function, as well as the characterization of the average channel capacity. Relevantly, and somehow counterintuitively, we observe that in the presence of a strong line-of-sight (LOS) component, the channel capacity of a LOS plus double-Rayleigh scattered diffuse component is larger than its LOS plus Rayleigh (i.e Rician-like) counterpart.
