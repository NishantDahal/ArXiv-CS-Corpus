Beam Selection for MmWave Massive MIMO Systems Under Hybrid Transceiver Architecture

Hybrid analog/digital precoding is a promising technology to cut down hardware cost in massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems at millimeter wave frequencies. In this letter, we propose a joint beam selection scheme for analog domain precoding under discrete lens array. By considering channel correlation among users, the proposed scheme is able to avoid inter-user interference and maximize system sum rate. Moreover, a bio-inspired ant colony optimization-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a near-optimal solution with dramatically reduced computational complexity. Finally, simulations show the advantages of the proposed scheme in improving system sum rate.
