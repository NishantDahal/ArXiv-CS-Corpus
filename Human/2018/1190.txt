Bridging the Gap: Simultaneous Fine Tuning for Data Re-Balancing

There are many real-world classification problems wherein the issue of data imbalance (the case when a data set contains substantially more samples for one/many classes than the rest) is unavoidable. While under-sampling the problematic classes is a common solution, this is not a compelling option when the large data class is itself diverse and/or the limited data class is especially small. We suggest a strategy based on recent work concerning limited data problems which utilizes a supplemental set of images with similar properties to the limited data class to aid in the training of a neural network. We show results for our model against other typical methods on a real-world synthetic aperture sonar data set. Code can be found at github.com/JohnMcKay/dataImbalance.
