Outlier detection on network flow analysis

It is important to be able to detect and classify malicious network traffic flows such as DDoS attacks from benign flows. Normally the task is performed by using supervised classification algorithms. In this paper we analyze the usage of outlier detection algorithms for the network traffic classification problem.
