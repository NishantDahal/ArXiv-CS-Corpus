Early Scheduling in Parallel State Machine Replication

State machine replication is standard approach to fault tolerance. One of the key assumptions of state machine replication is that replicas must execute operations deterministically and thus serially. To benefit from multi-core servers, some techniques allow concurrent execution of operations in state machine replication. Invariably, these techniques exploit the fact that independent operations (those that do not share any common state or do not update shared state) can execute concurrently. A promising category of solutions trades scheduling freedom for simplicity. This paper generalizes this category of scheduling solutions. In doing so, it proposes an automated mechanism to schedule operations on worker threads at replicas. We integrate our contributions to a popular state machine replication framework and experimentally compare the resulting system to more classic approaches.
