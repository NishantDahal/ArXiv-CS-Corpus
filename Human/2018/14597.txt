Generalized bent Boolean functions and strongly regular Cayley graphs

In this paper we define the (edge-weighted) Cayley graph associated to a generalized Boolean function, introduce a notion of strong regularity and give several of its properties. We show some connections between this concept and generalized bent functions (gbent), that is, functions with flat Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. In particular, we find a complete characterization of quartic gbent functions in terms of the strong regularity of their associated Cayley graph.
