Low Dose CT Image Denoising Using a Generative Adversarial Network with Wasserstein Distance and Perceptual Loss

In this paper, we introduce a new CT image denoising method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) with Wasserstein distance and perceptual similarity. The Wasserstein distance is a key concept of the optimal transform theory, and promises to improve the performance of the GAN. The perceptual loss compares the perceptual features of a denoised output against those of the ground truth in an established feature space, while the GAN helps migrate the data noise distribution from strong to weak. Therefore, our proposed method transfers our knowledge of visual perception to the image denoising task, is capable of not only reducing the image noise level but also keeping the critical information at the same time. Promising results have been obtained in our experiments with clinical CT images.
