Class-Based Interference Management in Wireless Networks

Technological advancement has brought revolutionary change in the converged wireless networks. Due to the existence of different types of traffic, provisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) becomes a challenge in the wireless networks. In case of a congested network, resource allocation has emerged as an effective way to provide the excessive users with desirable QoS. Since QoS for non-real-time traffic are not as strict as for real-time traffic, the unoccupied channels of the adjacent cells can be assigned to the non-real-time traffic to retain QoS for real-time traffic. This results in the intensified bandwidth utilization as well as less interference for the real-time traffic. In this paper, we propose an effective radio resource management scheme that relies on the dynamically assigned bandwidth allocation process. In case of interference management, we classify the traffic into real-time traffic and non-real-time traffic and give priority to the real-time traffic. According to our scheme, the real-time traffic among the excessive number of users are reassigned to the original channels which have been occupied by non-real-time traffic and the non-real-time traffic are allocated to the assigned channels of those real-time traffic. The architecture allows improved signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) for real-time traffic along with intensification in the bandwidth utilization of the network. Besides, the increased system capacity and lower outage probability of the network bear the significance of the proposed scheme.
