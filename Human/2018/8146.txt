A Multi-Beam NOMA Framework for Hybrid mmWave Systems

In this paper, we propose a multi-beam non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework for hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. The proposed framework enables the use of a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains in hybrid mmWave systems to accommodate multiple users with various angles of departures (AODs). A beam splitting technique is introduced to generate multiple analog beams to facilitate NOMA transmission. We analyze the performance of a system when there are sufficient numbers of antennas driven by a single RF chain at each transceiver. Furthermore, we derive the sufficient and necessary conditions of antenna allocation, which guarantees that the proposed multi-beam NOMA scheme outperforms the conventional time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme in terms of system sum-rate. The numerical results confirm the accuracy of the developed analysis and unveil the performance gain achieved by the proposed multi-beam NOMA scheme over the single-beam NOMA scheme.
