On buildings that compute. A proposal

We present ideas aimed at bringing revolutionary changes on architectures and buildings of tomorrow by radically advancing the technology for the building material concrete and hence building components. We propose that by using nanotechnology we could embed computation and sensing directly into the material used for construction. Intelligent concrete blocks and panels advanced with stimuli-responsive smart paints are the core of the proposed architecture. In particular, the photo-responsive paint would sense the buildings internal and external environment while the nano-material-concrete composite material would be capable of sensing the building environment and implement massive-parallel information processing resulting in distributed decision making. A calibration of the proposed materials with in-materio suitable computational methods and corresponding building information modelling, computer-aided design and digital manufacturing tools could be achieved via models and prototypes of information processing at nano-level. The emergent technology sees a building as high-level massive-parallel computer --- assembled of computing concrete blocks. Based on the generic principles of neuromorphic computation and reservoir computing we envisage a single building or an urban quarter to turn into a large-scale sensing substrate. It could behave as a universal computer, collecting and processing environmental information in situ enabling appropriate data fusion.
