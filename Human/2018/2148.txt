Curves in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and two-rich points

We obtain a new bound on the number of two-rich points spanned by an arrangement of low degree algebraic curves in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Specifically, we show that an arrangement of $n$ algebraic curves determines at most $C_εn^{4/3+3ε}$ two-rich points, provided at most $n^{2/3+2ε}$ curves lie in any low degree hypersurface and at most $n^{1/3+ε}$ curves lie in any low degree surface. This result follows from a structure theorem about arrangements of curves that determine many two-rich points.
