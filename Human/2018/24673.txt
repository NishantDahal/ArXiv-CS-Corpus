Torchbearer: A Model Fitting Library for PyTorch

We introduce torchbearer, a model fitting library for pytorch aimed at researchers working on deep learning or differentiable programming. The torchbearer library provides a high level metric and callback API that can be used for a wide range of applications. We also include a series of built in callbacks that can be used for: model persistence, learning rate decay, logging, data visualization and more. The extensive documentation includes an example library for deep learning and dynamic programming problems and can be found at http://torchbearer.readthedocs.io. The code is licensed under the MIT License and available at https://github.com/ecs-vlc/torchbearer.
