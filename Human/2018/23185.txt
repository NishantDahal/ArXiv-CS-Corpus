Truly Concurrent Process Algebra Is Reversible

Based on our previous process algebra for concurrency APTC, we prove that it is reversible with a little modifications. The reversible algebra has four parts: Basic Algebra for Reversible True Concurrency (BARTC), Algebra for Parallelism in Reversible True Concurrency (APRTC), recursion and abstraction.
