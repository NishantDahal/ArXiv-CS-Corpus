Equitable total coloring of corona of cubic graphs

The minimum number of total independent partition sets of $V \cup E$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is called the \emph{total chromatic number} of $G$, denoted by $χ''(G)$. If the difference between cardinalities of any two total independent sets is at most one, then the minimum number of total independent partition sets of $V \cup E$ is called the \emph{equitable total chromatic number}, and is denoted by $χ''_=(G)$.
  In this paper we consider equitable total coloring of coronas of cubic graphs, $G \circ H$. It turns out that, independly on the values of equitable total chromatic number of factors $G$ and $H$, equitable total chromatic number of corona $G \circ H$ is equal to $Δ(G \circ H) +1$. Thereby, we confirm Total Coloring Conjecture (TCC), posed by Behzad in 1964, and Equitable Total Coloring Conjecture (ETCC), posed by Wang in 2002, for coronas of cubic graphs. As a direct consequence we get that all coronas of cubic graphs are of Type 1.
