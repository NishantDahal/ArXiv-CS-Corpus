Is Leakage Power a Linear Function of Temperature?

In this work, we present a study of the leakage power modeling techniques commonly used in the architecture community. We further provide an analysis of the error in leakage power estimation using the various modeling techniques. We strongly believe that this study will help researchers determine an appropriate leakage model to use in their work, based on the desired modeling accuracy and speed.
