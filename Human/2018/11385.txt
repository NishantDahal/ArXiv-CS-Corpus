MPLS-based Reduction of Flow Table Entries in SDN Switches Supporting Multipath Transmission

In the paper, a new mechanism for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) flow aggregation accompanied with multipath transmission is proposed. The aggregation results in a low number of flow entries in core switches. This type of scalability improvement of flow processing is obtained thanks to application of the procedure based on introduction of centrally managed MPLS label distribution performed by an SDN controller. Moreover, multipath transmission improves network resource utilization.
  The proposed mechanism does not involve definition of new protocols. It neither needs application of legacy signalling protocols. Only simple modifications of the existing solutions, assured by flexibility of OpenFlow, are necessary. Additionally, the mechanism significantly reduces communication between the controller and switches, thus enabling a fine-grained flow-level control. Furthermore, the proposed solution can be incrementally deployed in legacy networks. The simulations show that a number of flow entries in core switches can be reduced as much as of 96%, while the overall network traffic is increased by about 32\%. Moreover, the number of OpenFlow messages is reduced by about 98%.
