Feature Selection Based on Unique Relevant Information for Health Data

Feature selection, which searches for the most representative features in observed data, is critical for health data analysis. Unlike feature extraction, such as PCA and autoencoder based methods, feature selection preserves interpretability, meaning that the selected features provide direct information about certain health conditions (i.e., the label). Thus, feature selection allows domain experts, such as clinicians, to understand the predictions made by machine learning based systems, as well as improve their own diagnostic skills. Mutual information is often used as a basis for feature selection since it measures dependencies between features and labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel mutual information based feature selection (MIBFS) method called SURI, which boosts features with high unique relevant information. We compare SURI to existing MIBFS methods using 3 different classifiers on 6 publicly available healthcare data sets. The results indicate that, in addition to preserving interpretability, SURI selects more relevant feature subsets which lead to higher classification performance. More importantly, we explore the dynamics of mutual information on a public low-dimensional health data set via exhaustive search. The results suggest the important role of unique relevant information in feature selection and verify the principles behind SURI.
