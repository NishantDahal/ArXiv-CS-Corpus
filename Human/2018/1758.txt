Fully Optical Spacecraft Communications: Implementing an Omnidirectional PV-Cell Receiver and 8Mb/s LED Visible Light Downlink with Deep Learning Error Correction

Free space optical communication techniques have been the subject of numerous investigations in recent years, with multiple missions expected to fly in the near future. Existing methods require high pointing accuracies, drastically driving up overall system cost. Recent developments in LED-based visible light communication (VLC) and past in-orbit experiments have convinced us that the technology has reached a critical level of maturity. On these premises, we propose a new optical communication system utilizing a VLC downlink and a high throughput, omnidirectional photovoltaic cell receiver system. By performing error-correction via deep learning methods and by utilizing phase-delay interference, the system is able to deliver data rates that match those of traditional laser-based solutions. A prototype of the proposed system has been constructed, demonstrating the scheme to be a feasible alternative to laser-based methods. This creates an opportunity for the full scale development of optical communication techniques on small spacecraft as a backup telemetry beacon or as a high throughput link.
