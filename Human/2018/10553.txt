Groups of automorphisms of p-adic integers and the problem of the existence of fully homomorphic ciphers

In this paper, we study groups of automorphisms of algebraic systems over a set of $p$-adic integers with different sets of arithmetic and coordinate-wise logical operations and congruence relations modulo $p^k,$ $k\ge 1.$ The main result of this paper is the description of groups of automorphisms of $p$-adic integers with one or two arithmetic or coordinate-wise logical operations on $p$-adic integers. To describe groups of automorphisms, we use the apparatus of the $p$-adic analysis and $p$-adic dynamical systems. The motive for the study of groups of automorphism of algebraic systems over $p$-adic integers is the question of the existence of a fully homomorphic encryption in a given family of ciphers. The relationship between these problems is based on the possibility of constructing a "continuous" $p$-adic model for some families of ciphers (in this context, these ciphers can be considered as "discrete" systems). As a consequence, we can apply the "continuous" methods of $p$-adic analysis to solve the "discrete" problem of the existence of fully homomorphic ciphers.
