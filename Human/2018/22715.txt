Isotropic Scattering in a Flatland Half-Space

We solve the Milne, constant-source and albedo problems for isotropic scattering in a two-dimensional "Flatland" half-space via the Wiener-Hopf method. The Flatland $H$-function is derived and benchmark values and some identities unique to Flatland are presented. A number of the derivations are supported by Monte Carlo simulation.
