A new class of curves of rational B-spline type

A new class of rational parametrization has been developed and it was used to generate a new family of rational functions B-splines $\displaystyle{{\left({}^α{\mathbf B}_{i}^{k} \right)}_{i=0}^{k}}$ which depends on an index $α\in (-\infty,0)\cup (1,+\infty)$. This family of functions verifies, among other things, the properties of positivity, of partition of the unit and, for a given degree k, constitutes a true basis approximation of continuous functions. We loose, however, the regularity classical optimal linked to the multiplicity of nodes, which we recover in the asymptotic case, when $α\longrightarrow \infty$. The associated \mbox{B-splines} curves verify the traditional properties particularly that of a convex hull and we see a certain "conjugated symmetry" related to $α$. The case of open knot vectors without an inner node leads to a new family of rational Bezier curves that will be separately, object of in-depth analysis.
