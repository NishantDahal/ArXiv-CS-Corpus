Rentable Internet of Things Infrastructure for Sensing as a Service (S2aaS)

Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) model [1] [2] is inspired by the traditional Everything as a service (XaaS) approaches [3]. It aims to better utilize the existing Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. S2aaS vision aims to create 'rentable infrastructure' where interested parties can gather IoT data by paying a fee for the infrastructure owners.
