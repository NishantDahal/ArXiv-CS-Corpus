Virtual Carrier Sensing Based Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems

The 5th generation mobile communication systems aim to support massive access for future wireless applications. Unfortunately, wireless resource scarcity in random access (RA) is a fundamental bottleneck for enabling massive access. To address this problem, we propose a virtual carrier sensing (VCS) based RA scheme in massive MIMO systems. The essence of the proposed scheme lies in exploiting wireless spatial resources of uplink channels occupied by assigned user equipments (UEs) to increase channel resources for RA. With the proposed scheme, RA UEs are able to exploit the spatial resources that are approximately orthogonal to those of assigned UEs, thus sharing the uplink channel resource with assigned UEs without causing significant interference to them. Specifically, to ensure RA UEs avoid serious interference with assigned UEs, base station (BS) sends tailored virtual carriers to RA UEs on behalf of assigned UEs. RA UEs then conduct VCS to determine whether or not the uplink channel resource is available for RA. Closed-form approximations for probability of channel availability and uplink achievable rate with the proposed scheme are derived. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to significantly increase channel resources of RA for massive access.
