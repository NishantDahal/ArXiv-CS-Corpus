A New Secure Network Architecture to Increase Security Among Virtual Machines in Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a new model of computing which provides scalability, flexibility and on-demand service. Virtualization is one of the main components of the cloud, but unfortunately, this technology suffers from many security vulnerabilities. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new secure architecture of Virtual Network machines in order to increase security among virtual machines in a virtualized environment (Xen as a case study). First, we expose the different network modes based on Xen Hypervisor, and then we analyze vulnerabilities and security issues within this kind of environment. Finally, we present in details new secure architecture and demonstrate how it can face the main security network attacks.
