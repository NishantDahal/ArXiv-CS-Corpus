Nauticle: a general-purpose particle-based simulation tool

Nauticle is a general-purpose simulation tool for the flexible and highly configurable application of particle-based methods of either discrete or continuum phenomena. It is presented that Nauticle has three distinct layers for users and developers, then the top two layers are discussed in detail. The paper introduces the Symbolic Form Language (SFL) of Nauticle, which facilitates the formulation of user-defined numerical models at the top level in text-based configuration files and provides simple application examples of use. On the other hand, at the intermediate level, it is shown that the SFL can be intuitively extended with new particle methods without tedious recoding or even the knowledge of the bottom level. Finally, the efficiency of the code is also tested through a performance benchmark.
