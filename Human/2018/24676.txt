Downlink Performance of Uplink Fractional Power Control in 5G Massive MIMO Systems

Uplink power control is an efficient scheme to mitigate pilot contamination in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study on the effects of fractional power control (FPC) on the downlink performance of the most relevant fifth generation (5G) massive MIMO deployments. Specifically, we perform thorough system simulations based on the most recent three dimensional spatial channel model released by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project to evaluate the impact of different deployment-related parameters such as pilot reuse factor, beamforming criterion, and base station array size. Our results indicate the most suitable tuning of the FPC parameters and show that optimized FPC provides huge gains in the cell border throughput when compared to a baseline scheme with all the users transmitting at maximum power. Moreover, our simulations also demonstrate that the effectiveness of FPC grows in scenarios with severe pilot contamination, confirming that implementing this feature is essential in realistic deployments.
