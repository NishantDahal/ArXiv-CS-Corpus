Mathematical Modeling of Routes Maintenance and Recovery Procedure for MANETs

Routing is one of the most mysterious issues from the birth of networks up till now. Designing routing protocols for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is a complicated task because unpredictable mobility patterns of mobile nodes greatly effect routing decisions. Various routing protocols are designed to improve this very problem. Different simulator based routing protocols are designed but these protocols might fail during deployment because of the testing procedures of simulators. In this study, a novel formal model for routes management is proposed for MANETs. Formal methods are the most novel techniques based purely on mathematics and are used for the verification, validation of critical systems/models and guarantee the correctness and completeness of hardware/software systems. The proposed routing model is a complete and detailed graph based logical model defined in VDM-SL (formal language) and then verified and validated by using VDM-SL toolbox.
