SAM-RCNN: Scale-Aware Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Pedestrian Detection

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled significant improvements in pedestrian detection owing to the strong representation ability of the CNN features. Recently, aggregating features from multiple layers of a CNN has been considered as an effective approach, however, the same approach regarding feature representation is used for detecting pedestrians of varying scales. Consequently, it is not guaranteed that the feature representation for pedestrians of a particular scale is optimised. In this paper, we propose a Scale-Aware Multi-resolution (SAM) method for pedestrian detection which can adaptively select multi-resolution convolutional features according to pedestrian sizes. The proposed SAM method extracts the appropriate CNN features that have strong representation ability as well as sufficient feature resolution, given the size of the pedestrian candidate output from a region proposal network. Moreover, we propose an enhanced SAM method, termed as SAM+, which incorporates complementary features channels and achieves further performance improvement. Evaluations on the challenging Caltech and KITTI pedestrian benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
