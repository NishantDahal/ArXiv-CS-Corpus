Multivariate Analysis of Orthogonal Range Searching and Graph Distances Parameterized by Treewidth

We show that the eccentricities, diameter, radius, and Wiener index of an undirected $n$-vertex graph with nonnegative edge lengths can be computed in time $O(n\cdot \binom{k+\lceil\log n\rceil}{k} \cdot 2^k k^2 \log n)$, where $k$ is the treewidth of the graph. For every $ε>0$, this bound is $n^{1+ε}\exp O(k)$, which matches a hardness result of Abboud, Vassilevska Williams, and Wang (SODA 2015) and closes an open problem in the multivariate analysis of polynomial-time computation. To this end, we show that the analysis of an algorithm of Cabello and Knauer (Comp. Geom., 2009) in the regime of non-constant treewidth can be improved by revisiting the analysis of orthogonal range searching, improving bounds of the form $\log^d n$ to $\binom{d+\lceil\log n\rceil}{d}$, as originally observed by Monier (J. Alg. 1980).
  We also investigate the parameterization by vertex cover number.
