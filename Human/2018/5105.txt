Rate-distortion functions of non-stationary Markoff chains and their block-independent approximations

It is proved that the limit of the normalized rate-distortion functions of block independent approximations of an irreducible, aperiodic Markoff chain is independent of the initial distribution of the Markoff chain and thus, is also equal to the rate-distortion function of the Markoff chain.
