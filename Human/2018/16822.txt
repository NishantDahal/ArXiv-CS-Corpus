Challenges in Monocular Visual Odometry: Photometric Calibration, Motion Bias and Rolling Shutter Effect

Monocular visual odometry (VO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have seen tremendous improvements in accuracy, robustness and efficiency, and have gained increasing popularity over recent years. Nevertheless, not so many discussions have been carried out to reveal the influences of three very influential yet easily overlooked aspects: photometric calibration, motion bias and rolling shutter effect. In this work, we evaluate these three aspects quantitatively on the state of the art of direct, feature-based and semi-direct methods, providing the community with useful practical knowledge both for better applying existing methods and developing new algorithms of VO and SLAM. Conclusions (some of which are counter-intuitive) are drawn with both technical and empirical analyses to all of our experiments. Possible improvements on existing methods are directed or proposed, such as a sub-pixel accuracy refinement of ORB-SLAM which boosts its performance.
