On the Security of an Unconditionally Secure, Universally Composable Inner Product Protocol

In this paper we discuss the security of a distributed inner product (DIP) protocol [IEEE TIFS, 11(1), (2016), 59-73]. We show information leakage in this protocol that does not happen in an ideal execution of DIP functionality. In some scenarios, this information leakage enables one of the parties to completely learn the other party's input. We will give examples of such scenarios.
