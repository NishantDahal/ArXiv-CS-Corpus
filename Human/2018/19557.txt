Complexity of the CNF-satisfiability problem

This paper is devoted to the complexity of the Boolean satisfiability problem. We consider a version of this problem, where the Boolean formula is specified in the conjunctive normal form. We prove an unexpected result that the CNF-satisfiability problem can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time.
