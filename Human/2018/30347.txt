Using AI to Design Stone Jewelry

Jewelry has been an integral part of human culture since ages. One of the most popular styles of jewelry is created by putting together precious and semi-precious stones in diverse patterns. While technology is finding its way in the production process of such jewelry, designing it remains a time-consuming and involved task. In this paper, we propose a unique approach using optimization methods coupled with machine learning techniques to generate novel stone jewelry designs at scale. Our evaluation shows that designs generated by our approach are highly likeable and visually appealing.
