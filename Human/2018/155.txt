Deep Learning Approach for Very Similar Objects Recognition Application on Chihuahua and Muffin Problem

We address the problem to tackle the very similar objects like Chihuahua or muffin problem to recognize at least in human vision level. Our regular deep structured machine learning still does not solve it. We saw many times for about year in our community the problem. Today we proposed the state-of-the-art solution for it. Our approach is quite tricky to get the very high accuracy. We propose the deep transfer learning method which could be tackled all this type of problems not limited to just Chihuahua or muffin problem. It is the best method to train with small data set not like require huge amount data.
