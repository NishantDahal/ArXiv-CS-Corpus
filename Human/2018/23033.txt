Bit Partitioning Schemes for Multicell Zero-Forcing Coordinated Beamforming

In this paper, we have studied the bit partitioning schemes for the multicell multiple-input and single-output (MISO) infrastructure. Zero forcing beamforming is used to null out the interference signals and the random vector quantization, quantizes the channel vectors. For minimal feedback period (MFP), the upper bound of rate loss is calculated and optimal bit partitioning among the channels is shown. For adaptive feedback period scheme (AFP), joint optimization schemes of feedback period and bit partitioning are proposed. Finally, we compare the sum rate efficiency of each scheme and conclude that minimal feedback period outperforms other schemes.
