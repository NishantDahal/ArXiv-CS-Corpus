Entity Linking in 40 Languages using MAG

A plethora of Entity Linking (EL) approaches has recently been developed. While many claim to be multilingual, the MAG (Multilingual AGDISTIS) approach has been shown recently to outperform the state of the art in multilingual EL on 7 languages. With this demo, we extend MAG to support EL in 40 different languages, including especially low-resources languages such as Ukrainian, Greek, Hungarian, Croatian, Portuguese, Japanese and Korean. Our demo relies on online web services which allow for an easy access to our entity linking approaches and can disambiguate against DBpedia and Wikidata. During the demo, we will show how to use MAG by means of POST requests as well as using its user-friendly web interface. All data used in the demo is available at https://hobbitdata.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/agdistis/
