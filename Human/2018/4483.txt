Mining Communication Data in a Music Community: A Preliminary Analysis

Comments play an important role within online creative communities because they make it possible to foster the production and improvement of authors' artifacts. We investigate how comment-based communication help shape members' behavior within online creative communities. In this paper, we report the results of a preliminary study aimed at mining the communication network of a music community for collaborative songwriting, where users collaborate online by first uploading new songs and then by adding new tracks and providing feedback in forms of comments.
