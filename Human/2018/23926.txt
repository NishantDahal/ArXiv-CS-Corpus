A Physical Perspective on Control Points and Polar Forms: Bézier Curves, Angular Momentum and Harmonic Oscillators

Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves play an important role in computer-aided geometric design and numerical analysis, and their study relates to mathematical fields such as abstract algebra, algebraic geometry and probability theory. We describe a theoretical framework that incorporates the different aspects of the Bernstein-Bézier theory, based on concepts from theoretical physics. We relate Bézier curves to the theory of angular momentum in both classical and quantum mechanics, and describe physical analogues of various properties of Bézier curves -- such as their connection with polar forms -- in the context of quantum spin systems. This previously unexplored relationship between geometric design and theoretical physics is established using the mathematical theory of Hamiltonian mechanics and geometric quantization. An alternative description of spin systems in terms of harmonic oscillators serves as a physical analogue of Pólya's urn models for Bézier curves. We relate harmonic oscillators to Poisson curves and the analytical blossom as well. We present an overview of the relevant mathematical and physical concepts, and discuss opportunities for further research.
