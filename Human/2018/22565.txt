Joint Localization and Mapping through Millimeter Wave MIMO in 5G Systems - Extended Version

Millimeter wave signals with multiple transmit and receive antennas are considered as enabling technology for enhanced mobile broadband services in 5G systems. While this combination is mainly associated with achieving high data rates, it also offers huge potential for radio-based positioning. Recent studies showed that millimeter wave systems with multiple transmit and receive antennas are capable of jointly estimating the position and orientation of a mobile terminal while mapping the radio environment simultaneously. To this end, we present a message passing-based estimator which jointly estimates the position and orientation of the mobile terminal, as well as the location of reflectors or scatterers. We provide numerical examples showing that this estimator can provide considerably higher estimation accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art estimator. Our examples demonstrate that our message passing-based estimator neither requires the presence of a line-of-sight path nor prior knowledge regarding any of the parameters to be estimated.
