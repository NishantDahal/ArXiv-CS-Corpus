ISO/EPC Addressing Methods to Support Supply Chain in the Internet of Things

RFID systems are among the major infrastructures of the Internet of Things, which follow ISO and EPC standards. In addition, ISO standard constitutes the main layers of supply chain, and many RFID systems benefit from ISO standard for different purposes. In this paper, we tried to introduce addressing systems based on ISO standards, through which the range of things connected to the Internet of Things will grow. Our proposed methods are addressing methods which can be applied to both ISO and EPC standards. The proposed methods are simple, hierarchical, and low cost implementation. In addition, the presented methods enhance interoperability among RFIDs, and also enjoys a high scalability, since it well covers all of EPC schemes and ISO supply chain standards. Further, by benefiting from a new algorithm for long EPCs known as selection algorithm, they can significantly facilitate and accelerate the operation of address mapping.
