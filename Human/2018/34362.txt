Femural Head Autosegmentation for 3D Radiotherapy Planning: Preliminary Results

Contouring of organs at risk is an important but time consuming part of radiotherapy treatment planning. Several authors proposed methods for automatic delineation but the clinical experts eye remains the gold standard method. In this paper, we present a totally visual software for automated delineation of the femural head. The software was successfully characterized in pelvic CT Scan of prostate patients (n=11). The automatic delineation was compared with manual and approved delineation through blind test evaluated by a panel of seniors radiation oncologists (n=9). Clinical experts evaluated that no any contouring correction were need in 77.8% and 67.8% of manual and automatic delineation respectively. Our results show that the software is robust, the automated delineation was reproducible in all patient, and its performance was similar to manually delineation.
