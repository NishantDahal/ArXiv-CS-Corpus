Long Short-Term Memory for Japanese Word Segmentation

This study presents a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network approach to Japanese word segmentation (JWS). Previous studies on Chinese word segmentation (CWS) succeeded in using recurrent neural networks such as LSTM and gated recurrent units (GRU). However, in contrast to Chinese, Japanese includes several character types, such as hiragana, katakana, and kanji, that produce orthographic variations and increase the difficulty of word segmentation. Additionally, it is important for JWS tasks to consider a global context, and yet traditional JWS approaches rely on local features. In order to address this problem, this study proposes employing an LSTM-based approach to JWS. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with respect to various Japanese corpora.
