Increasing the Capability of Neural Networks for Surface Reconstruction from Noisy Point Clouds

This paper builds upon the current methods to increase their capability and automation for 3D surface construction from noisy and potentially sparse point clouds. It presents an analysis of an artificial neural network surface regression and mapping method, describing caveats, improvements and justification for the different approach.
