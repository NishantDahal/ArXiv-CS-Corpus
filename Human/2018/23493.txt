Analysis of Uplink Scheduling for Haptic Communications

While new mechanisms and configurations of the 5G radio are offering step forward in delivery of ultra-reliable low latency communication services in general, and haptic communications in particular, they could inversely impact the remainder of traffic services. In this paper, we investigate the uplink access procedure, how different advances in this procedure enhance delivery of haptic communication, and how it affects the remainder of traffic services in the network. We model this impact as the remainder of service, using stochastic network calculus. Our results show how best the tradeoff between faster or more resource efficient uplink access can be made depending on the rate of haptic data, which is directly relevant to the application domain of haptic communication.
