Virtual Net: a Decentralized Architecture for Interaction in Mobile Virtual Worlds

With the development of mobile technology, mobile virtual worlds have attracted massive users. To improve scalability, a peer-to-peer virtual world provides the solution to accommodate more users without increasing hardware investment. In mobile settings, however, existing P2P solutions are not applicable due to the unreliability of mobile devices and the instability of mobile networks. To address the issue, a novel infrastructure model, called Virtual Net, is proposed to provide fault-tolerance in managing user content and object state. In this paper, the key problem, namely object state update, is resolved to maintain state consistency and high interaction responsiveness. This work is important in implementing a scalable mobile virtual world.
