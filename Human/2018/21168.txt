Universal software platform for visualizing class F curves, log-aesthetic curves and development of applied CAD systems

This article describes the capabilities of a universal software platform for visualizing class F curves and developing specialized applications for CAD systems based on Microsoft Excel VBA, the software complex FairCurveModeler, and computer algebra systems. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of a software platform for visualizing functional and log-aesthetic curves integrated with CAD Fusion360. The value of the curves is evident in visualizing the qualitative geometry of the product shape in industrial design. Moreover, the requirements for the characteristics of class F curves are emphasized to form a visual purity of shape in industrial design and to provide a positive emotional perception of the visual image of the product by a person.
