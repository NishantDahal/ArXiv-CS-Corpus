A Fixed-Parameter Linear-Time Algorithm to Compute Principal Typings of Planar Flow Networks

We present an alternative and simpler method for computing principal typings of flow networks. When limited to planar flow networks, the method can be made to run in fixed-parameter linear-time -- where the parameter not to be exceeded is what is called the edge-outerplanarity of the networks' underlying graphs.
