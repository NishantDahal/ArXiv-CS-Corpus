Optimal Multicast of Tiled 360 VR Video in OFDMA Systems

In this letter, we study optimal multicast of tiled 360 virtual reality (VR) video from one server (base station or access point) to multiple users in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system. For given video quality, we optimize the subcarrier, transmission power and transmission rate allocation to minimize the total transmission power. For given transmission power budget, we optimize the subcarrier, transmission power and transmission rate allocation to maximize the received video quality. These two optimization problems are non-convex problems. We obtain a globally optimal closed-form solution and a near optimal solution of the two problems, separately, both revealing important design insights for multicast of tiled 360 VR video in OFDMA systems.
