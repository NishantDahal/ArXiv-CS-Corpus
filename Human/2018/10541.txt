An adaptive parallel processing strategy in complex event processing systems over data streams

Efficient matching of incoming events of data streams to persistent queries is fundamental to event stream processing systems. These applications require dealing with high volume and continuous data streams with fast processing time on distributed complex event processing (CEP) systems. Therefore, a well-managed parallel processing technique is needed for improving the performance of the system. However, the specific properties of pattern operators in the CEP systems increase the difficulties of the parallel processing problem. To address these issues, a parallelization model and an adaptive parallel processing strategy are proposed for the complex event processing by introducing a histogram, and utilizing the probability and queue theory. The proposed strategy can estimate the optimal event splitting policy, which can suit the most recent workloads conditions such that the selected policy has the least expected waiting time for further processing the arriving events. The proposed strategy can keep the CEP system running fast under the variation of the time window sizes of operators and input rates of streams. Finally, the utility of our work is demonstrated through the experiments on the StreamBase system.
