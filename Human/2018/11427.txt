One Formalization of Virtue Ethics via Learning

Given that there exist many different formal and precise treatments of deontologi- cal and consequentialist ethics, we turn to virtue ethics and consider what could be a formalization of virtue ethics that makes it amenable to automation. We present an embroyonic formalization in a cognitive calculus (which subsumes a quantified first-order logic) that has been previously used to model robust ethical principles, in both the deontological and consequentialist traditions.
