Sensor Networks Architecture for Vehicles and Pedestrians Traffic Control

In this paper we present a sensor network based architecture for urban traffic management, hierarchically structured on three layers: sensing, processing& aggregation and control. On proposed architecture we define traffic decongestion methods for vehicles and also for pedestrians. Finally, we presented a case study on how traffic control can be implemented in a concrete situation, based on the proposed architecture, pointing future directions of development.
