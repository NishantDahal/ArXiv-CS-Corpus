A New Aggregation based Scheduling method for rapidly changing IEEE 802.11ac Wireless channels

In this paper we suggest a novel idea to improve the Throughput of a rapidly chang- ing WiFi channel by exploiting the standard aggregation schemes in IEEE 802.11ac networks, and by transmitting several copies of the same MPDU(s) in a single trans- mission attempt. We test this idea in scenarios where Link Adaptation is not used and show a significant improvement, in the order of tens of percents, in the achieved Throughput. Keywords
