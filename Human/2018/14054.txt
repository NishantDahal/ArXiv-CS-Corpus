CT Image Registration in Acute Stroke Monitoring

We present a new system based on tracking the temporal evolution of stroke lesions using an image registration technique on CT exams of the patient's brain. The system is able to compare past CT exams with the most recent one related to stroke event in order to evaluate past lesions which are not related to stroke. Then, it can compare recent CT exams related to the current stroke for assessing the evolution of the lesion over time. A new similarity measure is also introduced for the comparison of the source and target images during image registration. It will result in a cheaper, faster and more accessible evaluation of the acute phase of the stroke overcoming the current limitations of the proposed systems in the state-of-the-art.
