Implementation of Simplex Channels in the Blom's Keys Pre-Distribution Scheme

In article the modification of the Blom's keys preliminary distribution scheme, considering the direction of information streams is suggested. For this modification it is necessary to use function from three variables. Function of formation of key materials will be the asymmetrical. The exponential form of this function which does not increase the volume of key materials is suggested.
