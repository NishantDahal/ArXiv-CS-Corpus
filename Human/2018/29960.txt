Data Management in Time-Domain Astronomy: Requirements and Challenges

In time-domain astronomy, we need to use the relational database to manage star catalog data. With the development of sky survey technology, the size of star catalog data is larger, and the speed of data generation is faster. So, in this paper, we make a systematic and comprehensive introduction to process the data in time-domain astronomy, and valuable research questions are detailed. Then, we list candidate systems usually used in astronomy and point out the advantages and disadvantages of these systems. In addition, we present the key techniques needed to deal with astronomical data. Finally, we summarize the challenges faced by the design of our database prototype.
