Regularized adversarial examples for model interpretability

As machine learning algorithms continue to improve, there is an increasing need for explaining why a model produces a certain prediction for a certain input. In recent years, several methods for model interpretability have been developed, aiming to provide explanation of which subset regions of the model input is the main reason for the model prediction. In parallel, a significant research community effort is occurring in recent years for developing adversarial example generation methods for fooling models, while not altering the true label of the input,as it would have been classified by a human annotator. In this paper, we bridge the gap between adversarial example generation and model interpretability, and introduce a modification to the adversarial example generation process which encourages better interpretability. We analyze the proposed method on a public medical imaging dataset, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and show that it significantly outperforms the leading known alternative method. Our suggested method is simple to implement, and can be easily plugged into most common adversarial example generation frameworks. Additionally, we propose an explanation quality metric - $APE$ - "Adversarial Perturbative Explanation", which measures how well an explanation describes model decisions.
