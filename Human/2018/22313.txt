Subsampled Turbulence Removal Network

We present a deep-learning approach to restore a sequence of turbulence-distorted video frames from turbulent deformations and space-time varying blurs. Instead of requiring a massive training sample size in deep networks, we purpose a training strategy that is based on a new data augmentation method to model turbulence from a relatively small dataset. Then we introduce a subsampled method to enhance the restoration performance of the presented GAN model. The contributions of the paper is threefold: first, we introduce a simple but effective data augmentation algorithm to model the turbulence in real life for training in the deep network; Second, we firstly purpose the Wasserstein GAN combined with $\ell_1$ cost for successful restoration of turbulence-corrupted video sequence; Third, we combine the subsampling algorithm to filter out strongly corrupted frames to generate a video sequence with better quality.
