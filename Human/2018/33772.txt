A Rich-Variant Architecture for a User-Aware multi-tenant SaaS approach

Software as a Service cloud computing model favorites the Multi-Tenancy as a key factor to exploit economies of scale. However Multi-Tenancy present several disadvantages. Therein, our approach comes to assign instances to multi-tenants with an optimal solution while ensuring more economies of scale and avoiding tenants hesitation to share resources. The present paper present the architecture of our user-aware multi-tenancy SaaS approach based on the use of rich-variant components. The proposed approach seek to model services functional customization as well as automation of computing the optimal distribution of instances by tenants. The proposed model takes into consideration tenants functional requirements and tenants deployment requirements to deduce an optimal distribution using essentially a specific variability engine and a graph-based execution framework.
