Necessary Field Size and Probability for MDP and Complete MDP Convolutional Codes

It has been shown that maximum distance profile (MDP) convolutional codes have optimal recovery rate for windows of a certain length, when transmitting over an erasure channel. In addition, the subclass of complete MDP convolutional codes has the ability to reduce the waiting time during decoding. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the necessary field size for the existence of MDP and complete MDP convolutional codes and show that these bounds improve the already existing ones. Moreover, we derive lower bounds for the probability that a random code is MDP respective complete MDP.
