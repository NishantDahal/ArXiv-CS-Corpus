The Simultaneous Identification Capacity of the Classical--Quantum Multiple Access Channel

Here we discuss message identification, a problem formalized by Rudolf Ahlswede and Gunter Dueck, over a classical-quantum multiple access channel with two classical senders and one quantum receiver. We show that the simultaneous identification capacity, a capacity defined by Peter LÃ¶ber, of this multiple access channel is equal to its message transmission capacity region.
