On the Existence of a Sample Mean in Dynamic Time Warping Spaces

The concept of sample mean in dynamic time warping (DTW) spaces has been successfully applied to improve pattern recognition systems and generalize centroid-based clustering algorithms. Its existence has neither been proved nor challenged. This article presents sufficient conditions for existence of a sample mean in DTW spaces. The proposed result justifies prior work on approximate mean algorithms, sets the stage for constructing exact mean algorithms, and is a first step towards a statistical theory of DTW spaces.
