Torpid Mixing of Markov Chains for the Six-vertex Model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$

In this paper, we study the mixing time of two widely used Markov chain algorithms for the six-vertex model, Glauber dynamics and the directed-loop algorithm, on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove, for the first time that, on finite regions of the square lattice these Markov chains are torpidly mixing under parameter settings in the ferroelectric phase and the anti-ferroelectric phase.
