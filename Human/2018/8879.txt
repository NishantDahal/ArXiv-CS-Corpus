Solving Bongard Problems with a Visual Language and Pragmatic Reasoning

More than 50 years ago Bongard introduced 100 visual concept learning problems as a testbed for intelligent vision systems. These problems are now known as Bongard problems. Although they are well known in the cognitive science and AI communities only moderate progress has been made towards building systems that can solve a substantial subset of them. In the system presented here, visual features are extracted through image processing and then translated into a symbolic visual vocabulary. We introduce a formal language that allows representing complex visual concepts based on this vocabulary. Using this language and Bayesian inference, complex visual concepts can be induced from the examples that are provided in each Bongard problem. Contrary to other concept learning problems the examples from which concepts are induced are not random in Bongard problems, instead they are carefully chosen to communicate the concept, hence requiring pragmatic reasoning. Taking pragmatic reasoning into account we find good agreement between the concepts with high posterior probability and the solutions formulated by Bongard himself. While this approach is far from solving all Bongard problems, it solves the biggest fraction yet.
