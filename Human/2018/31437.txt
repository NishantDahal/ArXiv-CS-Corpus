The approaches to evaluation of scientific activity outcome were considered and the tendency of transition from formal quantitative indicators to receiving expert conclusion on the basis of bibliometric indicators was noted. The principles of the Leiden manifesto of scientometrics were set out, keeping to which provides clear monitoring and support of science development, and favours establishing of the constructive dialog between scientific environment and society as well. The conceptual statements and peculiarities of practical realization of the informative and analytical system "Bibliometryka Ukraynskoyi Nauky" ("Bibliometrics of the Ukrainian Science") elaborated by the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine, are being represented. The proposals on the formation of advisory councils, which are aimed to adopt conclusions on the effectiveness of research activity of institutions, were considered. The feasibility of building a common platform for expert evaluation of scientific studies for countries of the Eastern Partnership by initiating similar bibliometric projects in these countries and their further convergence is proved.
