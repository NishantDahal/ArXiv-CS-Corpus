Effect of quantified irreducibility on the computability of subshift entropy

We study the difficulty of computing topological entropy of subshifts subjected to mixing restrictions. This problem is well-studied for multidimensional subshifts of finite type : there exists a threshold in the irreducibility rate where the difficulty jumps from computable to uncomputable, but its location is an open problem. In this paper, we establish the location of this threshold for a more general class, subshifts with decidable languages, in any dimension.
