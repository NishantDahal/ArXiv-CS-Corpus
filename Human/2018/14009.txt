A New Angle on L2 Regularization

Imagine two high-dimensional clusters and a hyperplane separating them. Consider in particular the angle between: the direction joining the two clusters' centroids and the normal to the hyperplane. In linear classification, this angle depends on the level of L2 regularization used. Can you explain why?
