Deep Reinforcement Learning based Resource Allocation for V2V Communications

In this paper, we develop a decentralized resource allocation mechanism for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications based on deep reinforcement learning, which can be applied to both unicast and broadcast scenarios. According to the decentralized resource allocation mechanism, an autonomous agent', a V2V link or a vehicle, makes its decisions to find the optimal sub-band and power level for transmission without requiring or having to wait for global information. Since the proposed method is decentralized, it incurs only limited transmission overhead. From the simulation results, each agent can effectively learn to satisfy the stringent latency constraints on V2V links while minimizing the interference to vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications.
