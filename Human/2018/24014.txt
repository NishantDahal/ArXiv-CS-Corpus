SECS: Efficient Deep Stream Processing via Class Skew Dichotomy

Despite that accelerating convolutional neural network (CNN) receives an increasing research focus, the save on resource consumption always comes with a decrease in accuracy. To both increase accuracy and decrease resource consumption, we explore an environment information, called class skew, which is easily available and exists widely in daily life. Since the class skew may switch as time goes, we bring up probability layer to utilize class skew without any overhead during the runtime. Further, we observe class skew dichotomy that some class skew may appear frequently in the future, called hot class skew, and others will never appear again or appear seldom, called cold class skew. Inspired by techniques from source code optimization, two modes, i.e., interpretation and compilation, are proposed. The interpretation mode pursues efficient adaption during runtime for cold class skew and the compilation mode aggressively optimize on hot ones for more efficient deployment in the future. Aggressive optimization is processed by class-specific pruning and provides extra benefit. Finally, we design a systematic framework, SECS, to dynamically detect class skew, processing interpretation and compilation, as well as select the most accurate architectures under the runtime resource budget. Extensive evaluations show that SECS can realize end-to-end classification speedups by a factor of 3x to 11x relative to state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, at a higher accuracy.
