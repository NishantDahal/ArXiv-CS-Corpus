Robot human interface for housekepeer with wireless capabilities

This paper presents the design and implementation of a Human Interface for a housekeeper robot. It bases on the idea of making the robot understand the human needs without making the human go through the details of robots work, for example, the way that the robot implements the work or the method that the robot uses to plan the path in order to reach the work area. The interface commands based on idioms of the natural human language and designed in a manner that the user gives the robot several commands with their execution date/time.
