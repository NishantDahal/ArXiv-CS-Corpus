3D Pose Estimation for Fine-Grained Object Categories

Existing object pose estimation datasets are related to generic object types and there is so far no dataset for fine-grained object categories. In this work, we introduce a new large dataset to benchmark pose estimation for fine-grained objects, thanks to the availability of both 2D and 3D fine-grained data recently. Specifically, we augment two popular fine-grained recognition datasets (StanfordCars and CompCars) by finding a fine-grained 3D CAD model for each sub-category and manually annotating each object in images with 3D pose. We show that, with enough training data, a full perspective model with continuous parameters can be estimated using 2D appearance information alone. We achieve this via a framework based on Faster/Mask R-CNN. This goes beyond previous works on category-level pose estimation, which only estimate discrete/continuous viewpoint angles or recover rotation matrices often with the help of key points. Furthermore, with fine-grained 3D models available, we incorporate a dense 3D representation named as location field into the CNN-based pose estimation framework to further improve the performance.
