Robust and Globally Optimal Manhattan Frame Estimation in Near Real Time

Most man-made environments, such as urban and indoor scenes, consist of a set of parallel and orthogonal planar structures. These structures are approximated by the Manhattan world assumption, in which notion can be represented as a Manhattan frame (MF). Given a set of inputs such as surface normals or vanishing points, we pose an MF estimation problem as a consensus set maximization that maximizes the number of inliers over the rotation search space. Conventionally, this problem can be solved by a branch-and-bound framework, which mathematically guarantees global optimality. However, the computational time of the conventional branch-and-bound algorithms is rather far from real-time. In this paper, we propose a novel bound computation method on an efficient measurement domain for MF estimation, i.e., the extended Gaussian image (EGI). By relaxing the original problem, we can compute the bound with a constant complexity, while preserving global optimality. Furthermore, we quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for various synthetic and real-world data. We also show the versatility of our approach through three different applications: extension to multiple MF estimation, 3D rotation based video stabilization, and vanishing point estimation (line clustering).
