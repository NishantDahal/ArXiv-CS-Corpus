Image Based Camera Localization: an Overview

Recently, virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, autonomous driving et al attract much attention of both academic and industrial community, in which image based camera localization is a key task. However, there has not been a complete review on image-based camera localization. It is urgent to map this topic to help people enter the field quickly. In this paper, an overview of image based camera localization is presented. A new and complete kind of classifications for image based camera localization is provided and the related techniques are introduced. Trends for the future development are also discussed. It will be useful to not only researchers but also engineers and other people interested.
