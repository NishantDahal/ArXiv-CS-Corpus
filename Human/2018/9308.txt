Telepresence System based on Simulated Holographic Display

We present a telepresence system based on a custom-made simulated holographic display that produces a full 3D model of the remote participants using commodity depth sensors. Our display is composed of a video projector and a quadrangular pyramid made of acrylic, that allows the user to experience an omnidirectional visualization of a remote person without the need for head-mounted displays. To obtain a precise representation of the participants, we fuse together multiple views extracted using a deep background subtraction method. Our system represents an attempt to democratize high-fidelity 3D telepresence using off-the-shelf components.
