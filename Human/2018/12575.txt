The 2-adic complexity of a class of binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation magnitude

Recently, a class of binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation magnitude has been presented by Su et al. based on interleaving technique and Ding-Helleseth-Lam sequences (Des. Codes Cryptogr., https://doi.org/10.1007/s10623-017-0398-5). And its linear complexity has been proved to be large enough to resist the B-M Algorighm (BMA) by Fan (Des. Codes Cryptogr., https://doi.org/10.1007/s10623-018-0456-7). In this paper, we study the 2-adic complexity of this class of binary sequences. Our result shows that the 2-adic complexity of this class of sequence is no less than one half of its period, i.e., its 2-adic complexity is large enough to resist the Rational Aproximation Algorithm (RAA).
