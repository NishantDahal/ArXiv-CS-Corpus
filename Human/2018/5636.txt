Almost all string graphs are intersection graphs of plane convex sets

A {\em string graph} is the intersection graph of a family of continuous arcs in the plane. The intersection graph of a family of plane convex sets is a string graph, but not all string graphs can be obtained in this way. We prove the following structure theorem conjectured by Janson and Uzzell: The vertex set of {\em almost all} string graphs on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into {\em five} cliques such that some pair of them is not connected by any edge ($n\rightarrow\infty$). We also show that every graph with the above property is an intersection graph of plane convex sets. As a corollary, we obtain that {\em almost all} string graphs on $n$ vertices are intersection graphs of plane convex sets.
