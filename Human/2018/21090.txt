Some notes on the superintuitionistic logic of chequered subsets of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$

I investigate the superintuitionistic analogue of the modal logic of chequered subsets of $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ introduced by van Benthem et al. It is observed that this logic possesses the disjunction property, contains the Scott axiom, fails to contain the Kreisel-Putnam axiom and it is a sublogic of the Medvedev logic.
