Ultra-Reliable Short Message Cooperative Relaying Protocols under Nakagami-m Fading

In the next few years, the development of wireless communication systems propel the world into a fully connected society where the Machine-type Communications (MTC) plays a substantial role as key enabler in the future cellular systems. MTC is categorized into mMTC and uMTC, where mMTC provides the connectivity to massive number of devices while uMTC is related to low latency and ultra-high reliability of the wireless communications. This paper studies uMTC with incremental relaying technique, where the source and relay collaborate to transfer the message to a destination. In this paper, we compare the performance of two distinct cooperative relaying protocols with the direct transmission under the finite blocklength (FB) regime. We define the overall outage probability in each relaying scenario, supposing Nakagami-m fading. We show that cooperative communication outperforms direct transmission under the FB regime. In addition, we examine the impact of fading severity and power allocation factor on the outage probability and the minimum delay required to meet the ultra-reliable communication requirements. Moreover, we provide the outage probability in closed form.
