Computer algebra tools for Feynman integrals and related multi-sums

In perturbative calculations, e.g., in the setting of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) one aims at the evaluation of Feynman integrals. Here one is often faced with the problem to simplify multiple nested integrals or sums to expressions in terms of indefinite nested integrals or sums. Furthermore, one seeks for solutions of coupled systems of linear differential equations, that can be represented in terms of indefinite nested sums (or integrals). In this article we elaborate the main tools and the corresponding packages, that we have developed and intensively used within the last 10 years in the course of our QCD-calculations.
