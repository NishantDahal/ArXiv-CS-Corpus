HOC-Tree: A Novel Index for efficient Spatio-temporal Range Search

With the rapid development of mobile computing and Web services, a huge amount of data with spatial and temporal information have been collected everyday by smart mobile terminals, in which an object is described by its spatial information and temporal information. Motivated by the significance of spatio-temporal range search and the lack of efficient search algorithm, in this paper, we study the problem of spatio-temporal range search (STRS), a novel index structure is proposed, called HOC-Tree, which is based on Hilbert curve and OC-Tree, and takes both spatial and temporal information into consideration. Based on HOC-Tree, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the problem of spatio-temporal range search. Comprehensive experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art technique.
