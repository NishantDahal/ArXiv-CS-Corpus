Optimal Error Correcting Delivery Scheme for an Optimal Coded Caching Scheme with Small Buffers

Optimal delivery scheme for coded caching problems with small buffer sizes and the number of users no less than the amount of files in the server was proposed by Chen, Fan and Letaief ["Fundamental limits of caching: improved bounds for users with small buffers," (IET Communications), 2016]. This scheme is referred to as the CFL scheme. In this paper, the link between the server and the users is assumed to be error prone only during the delivery phase. Closed form expressions for average rate and peak rate of error correcting delivery scheme for CFL prefetching scheme is obtained. An optimal error correcting delivery scheme for caching problems employing CFL prefetching is proposed.
