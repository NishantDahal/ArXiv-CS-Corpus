Using technology of augmented reality in a mobile-based learning environment of the higher educational institution

The definition of the augmented reality concept is based on the analysis of scientific publications. It is noted that online experiments with augmented reality provide students with the opportunity to observe and describe the operation with real systems by changing their parameters, and also partially replace experimental installations with objects of augmented reality. The scheme for realizing the augmented reality is considered. The possibilities of working with augmented reality objects in teaching physics is highlighted. It is indicated that the use of the augmented reality tools allows to increase the realness of the research; provides emotional and cognitive experience, helps attract students to systematic training; provides correct information about the installation in the process of experimentation; creates new ways of representing real objects in the learning process.
