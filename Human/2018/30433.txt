Security management for backhaul-aware 5G-V2X

Security is a primary concern for the networks aiming at the utilization of Cellular (C) services for connecting Vehicles to Everything (V2X). At present, C-V2X is observing a paradigm shift from Long Term Evolution (LTE) - Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) to Fifth Generation (5G) based functional architecture. However, security and credential management are still concerns to be resolved under 5G-V2X. A sizably voluminous number of key updates and non-availability of sub-functions at the edge cause adscititious overheads and decrement the performance while alarming the possibilities of variants of cyber attacks. In this paper, security management is studied as a principle of sustainability and its tradeoff is evaluated with the number of key-updates required to maintain an authenticated connection of a vehicle to the 5G-terminals keeping intact the security functions at the backhaul. A numerical study is presented to determine the claims and understand the proposed tradeoff.
