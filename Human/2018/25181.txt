A Deep Learning Spatiotemporal Prediction Framework for Mobile Crowdsourced Services

This papers presents a deep learning-based framework to predict crowdsourced service availability spatially and temporally. A novel two-stage prediction model is introduced based on historical spatio-temporal traces of mobile crowdsourced services. The prediction model first clusters mobile crowdsourced services into regions. The availability prediction of a mobile crowdsourced service at a certain location and time is then formulated as a classification problem. To determine the availability duration of predicted mobile crowdsourced services, we formulate a forecasting task of time series using the Gramian Angular Field. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework through multiple experiments.
