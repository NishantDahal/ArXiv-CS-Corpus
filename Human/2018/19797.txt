Ontology-based Approach for Identifying the Credibility Domain in Social Big Data

A challenge of managing and extracting useful knowledge from social media data sources has attracted much attention from academic and industry. To address this challenge, semantic analysis of textual data is focused in this paper. We propose an ontology-based approach to extract semantics of textual data and define the domain of data. In other words, we semantically analyse the social data at two levels i.e. the entity level and the domain level. We have chosen Twitter as a social channel challenge for a purpose of concept proof. Domain knowledge is captured in ontologies which are then used to enrich the semantics of tweets provided with specific semantic conceptual representation of entities that appear in the tweets. Case studies are used to demonstrate this approach. We experiment and evaluate our proposed approach with a public dataset collected from Twitter and from the politics domain. The ontology-based approach leverages entity extraction and concept mappings in terms of quantity and accuracy of concept identification.
