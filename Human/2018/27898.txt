Current Trends and Future Research Directions for Interactive Music

In this review, it is explained and compared different software and formalisms used in music interaction: sequencers, computer-assisted improvisation, meta- instruments, score-following, asynchronous dataflow languages, synchronous dataflow languages, process calculi, temporal constraints and interactive scores. Formal approaches have the advantage of providing rigorous semantics of the behavior of the model and proving correctness during execution. The main disadvantage of formal approaches is lack of commercial tools.
