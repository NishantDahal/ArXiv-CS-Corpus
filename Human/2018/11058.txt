IoT-based Big Data Analysis of School Buildings Performance

The utilization of IoT in the educational domain so far has trailed other more commercial application domains. In this chapter, we study a number of aspects that are based on big data produced by a large-scale infrastructure deployed inside a fleet of educational buildings in Europe. We discuss how this infrastructure essentially enables a set of different applications, complemented by a detailed discussion regarding both performance aspects of the implementation of this IoT platform, as well as results that provide insights to its actual application in real life, both from an educational and business standpoint.
