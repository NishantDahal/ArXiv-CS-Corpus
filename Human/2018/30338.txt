Beyond the Desktop: Emerging Technologies for Supporting 3D Collaborative Teams

The emergence of several trends, including the increased availability of wireless networks, miniaturization of electronics and sensing technologies, and novel input and output devices, is creating a demand for integrated, full-time displays for use across a wide range of applications, including collaborative environments. In this paper, we present and discuss emerging visualization methods we are developing particularly as they relate to deployable displays and displays worn on the body to support mobile users.
