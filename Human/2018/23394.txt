Image Reconstruction Using Deep Learning

This paper proposes a deep learning architecture that attains statistically significant improvements over traditional algorithms in Poisson image denoising espically when the noise is strong. Poisson noise commonly occurs in low-light and photon- limited settings, where the noise can be most accurately modeled by the Poission distribution. Poisson noise traditionally prevails only in specific fields such as astronomical imaging. However, with the booming market of surveillance cameras, which commonly operate in low-light environments, or mobile phones, which produce noisy night scene pictures due to lower-grade sensors, the necessity for an advanced Poisson image denoising algorithm has increased. Deep learning has achieved amazing breakthroughs in other imaging problems, such image segmentation and recognition, and this paper proposes a deep learning denoising network that outperforms traditional algorithms in Poisson denoising especially when the noise is strong. The architecture incorporates a hybrid of convolutional and deconvolutional layers along with symmetric connections. The denoising network achieved statistically significant 0.38dB, 0.68dB, and 1.04dB average PSNR gains over benchmark traditional algorithms in experiments with image peak values 4, 2, and 1. The denoising network can also operate with shorter computational time while still outperforming the benchmark algorithm by tuning the reconstruction stride sizes.
