Tools and resources for Romanian text-to-speech and speech-to-text applications

In this paper we introduce a set of resources and tools aimed at providing support for natural language processing, text-to-speech synthesis and speech recognition for Romanian. While the tools are general purpose and can be used for any language (we successfully trained our system for more than 50 languages and participated in the Universal Dependencies Shared Task), the resources are only relevant for Romanian language processing.
