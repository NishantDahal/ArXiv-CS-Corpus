On the Key Generation Rate of Physically Unclonable Functions

In this paper, an algebraic binning based coding scheme and its associated achievable rate for key generation using physically unclonable functions (PUFs) is determined. This achievable rate is shown to be optimal under the generated-secret (GS) model for PUFs. Furthermore, a polar code based polynomial-time encoding and decoding scheme that achieves this rate is also presented.
