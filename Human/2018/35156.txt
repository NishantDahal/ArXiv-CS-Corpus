A Behavioral Compact Model of 3D NAND Flash Memory

We present a behavioral compact model of 3D NAND flash memory for integrated circuits and system-level applications. This model is easy to implement, computationally efficient, fast, accurate and effectively accounts for the different parasitic capacitance coupling effects applicable to the 3D geometry of the vertical channel Macaroni body charge-trap flash memory. The model parameter extraction methodology is simple and can be extended to reproduce the electrical behavior of different 3D NAND flash memory architectures (with different page size, dimension, or number of stacked layers). We believe that the developed compact model would equip the circuit designers and system architects with an effective tool for design-exploration of 3D NAND flash memory devices for diverse unconventional analog applications.
