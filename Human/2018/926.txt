Asymptotic Distribution of Multilevel Channel Polarization for a Certain Class of Erasure Channels

This study examines multilevel channel polarization for a certain class of erasure channels that the input alphabet size is an arbitrary composite number. We derive limiting proportions of partially noiseless channels for such a class. The results of this study are proved by an argument of convergent sequences, inspired by Alsan and Telatar's simple proof of polarization, and without martingale convergence theorems for polarization process.
