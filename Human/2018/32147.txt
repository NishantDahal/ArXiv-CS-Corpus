Sparsemax and Relaxed Wasserstein for Topic Sparsity

Topic sparsity refers to the observation that individual documents usually focus on several salient topics instead of covering a wide variety of topics, and a real topic adopts a narrow range of terms instead of a wide coverage of the vocabulary. Understanding this topic sparsity is especially important for analyzing user-generated web content and social media, which are featured in the form of extremely short posts and discussions. As topic sparsity of individual documents in online social media increases, so does the difficulty of analyzing the online text sources using traditional methods.
  In this paper, we propose two novel neural models by providing sparse posterior distributions over topics based on the Gaussian sparsemax construction, enabling efficient training by stochastic backpropagation. We construct an inference network conditioned on the input data and infer the variational distribution with the relaxed Wasserstein (RW) divergence. Unlike existing works based on Gaussian softmax construction and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, our approaches can identify latent topic sparsity with training stability, predictive performance, and topic coherence. Experiments on different genres of large text corpora have demonstrated the effectiveness of our models as they outperform both probabilistic and neural methods.
