In Defense of the Classification Loss for Person Re-Identification

The recent research for person re-identification has been focused on two trends. One is learning the part-based local features to form more informative feature descriptors. The other is designing effective metric learning loss functions such as the triplet loss family. We argue that learning global features with classification loss could achieve the same goal, even with some simple and cost-effective architecture design. In this paper, we first explain why the person re-id framework with standard classification loss usually has inferior performance compared to metric learning. Based on that, we further propose a person re-id framework featured by channel grouping and multi-branch strategy, which divides global features into multiple channel groups and learns the discriminative channel group features by multi-branch classification layers. The extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms prior state-of-the-arts in terms of both accuracy and inference speed.
