Generative Adversarial Learning for Spectrum Sensing

A novel approach of training data augmentation and domain adaptation is presented to support machine learning applications for cognitive radio. Machine learning provides effective tools to automate cognitive radio functionalities by reliably extracting and learning intrinsic spectrum dynamics. However, there are two important challenges to overcome, in order to fully utilize the machine learning benefits with cognitive radios. First, machine learning requires significant amount of truthed data to capture complex channel and emitter characteristics, and train the underlying algorithm (e.g., a classifier). Second, the training data that has been identified for one spectrum environment cannot be used for another one (e.g., after channel and emitter conditions change). To address these challenges, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with deep learning structures is used to 1)~generate additional synthetic training data to improve classifier accuracy, and 2) adapt training data to spectrum dynamics. This approach is applied to spectrum sensing by assuming only limited training data without knowledge of spectrum statistics. Machine learning classifiers are trained with limited, augmented and adapted training data to detect signals. Results show that training data augmentation increases the classifier accuracy significantly and this increase is sustained with domain adaptation as spectrum conditions change.
