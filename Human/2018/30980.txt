On the Capacity of MISO Channels with One-Bit ADCs and DACs

A one-bit wireless transceiver is a promising communication architecture that not only can facilitate the design of mmWave communication systems but also can extremely diminish power consumption. The non-linear distortion effects by one-bit quantization at the transceiver, however, change the fundamental limits of communication rates. In this paper, the capacity of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) fading channel with one-bit transceiver is characterized in a closed form when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at both a transmitter and a receiver. One major finding is that the capacity achieving transmission strategy is to uniformly use four multi-dimensional constellation points. The four multi-dimensional constellation points are optimally chosen as a function of the channel and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the channel input set constructed by a spatial lattice modulation method. As a byproduct, it is shown that a few-bit CSI feedback suffices to achieve the capacity. For the case when CSI is not perfectly known to the receiver, practical channel training and CSI feedback methods are presented, which effectively exploit the derived capacity-achieving transmission strategy.
