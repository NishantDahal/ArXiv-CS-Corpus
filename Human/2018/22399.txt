Hierarchical Information Quadtree: Efficient Spatial Temporal Image Search for Multimedia Stream

Massive amount of multimedia data that contain times- tamps and geographical information are being generated at an unprecedented scale in many emerging applications such as photo sharing web site and social networks applications. Due to their importance, a large body of work has focused on efficiently computing various spatial image queries. In this paper,we study the spatial temporal image query which considers three important constraints during the search including time recency, spatial proximity and visual relevance. A novel index structure, namely Hierarchical Information Quadtree(\hiq), to efficiently insert/delete spatial temporal images with high arrive rates. Base on \hiq an efficient algorithm is developed to support spatial temporal image query. We show via extensive experimentation with real spatial databases clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our methods.
