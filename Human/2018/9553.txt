Performance Analysis for Practical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks with LoS/NLoS Transmissions

In this paper, we provide a performance analysis for practical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled networks. By considering both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions between aerial base stations (BSs) and ground users, the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency (ASE) are derived. Considering that there is no consensus on the path loss model for studying UAVs in the literature, in this paper, three path loss models, i.e., high-altitude model, low-altitude model and ultra-low-altitude model, are investigated and compared. Moreover, the lower bound of the network performance is obtained assuming that UAVs are hovering randomly according to homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), while the upper bound is derived assuming that UAVs can instantaneously move to the positions directly overhead ground users. From our analytical and simulation results for a practical UAV height of 50 meters, we find that the network performance of the high-altitude model and the low-altitude model exhibit similar trends, while that of the ultra-low-altitude model deviates significantly from the above two models. In addition, the optimal density of UAVs to maximize the coverage probability performance has also been investigated.
