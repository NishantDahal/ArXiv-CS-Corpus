Minimum Symbol Error Rate-Based Constant Envelope Precoding for Multiuser Massive MISO Downlink

This paper considers the problem of constant envelope (CE) precoder designs for multiuser massive MISO downlink channels. The use of CE signals allows one to employ low-cost radio frequency chains and thereby facilitates the implementation of massive MIMO. However, the subsequent CE precoder designs are usually challenging owing to the non-convex CE constraints. The existing CE precoder designs consider minimization of some measures on the distortion levels of the received symbols, and they usually aim at improving the symbol-error rate (SER) performances. In this paper we formulate a minimum SER-based design for CE precoding. The design formulation is non-convex and we propose two low-complexity first-order algorithms using gradient projection. Curiously, our simulation results show that the proposed designs can achieve bit-error rate performance close to that of zero-forcing beamforming without CE signaling restrictions.
