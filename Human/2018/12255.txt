A Unified Framework of Deep Neural Networks by Capsules

With the growth of deep learning, how to describe deep neural networks unifiedly is becoming an important issue. We first formalize neural networks mathematically with their directed graph representations, and prove a generation theorem about the induced networks of connected directed acyclic graphs. Then, we set up a unified framework for deep learning with capsule networks. This capsule framework could simplify the description of existing deep neural networks, and provide a theoretical basis of graphic designing and programming techniques for deep learning models, thus would be of great significance to the advancement of deep learning.
