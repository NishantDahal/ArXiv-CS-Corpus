Evolution of natural patterns from random fields

In the article a transition from pattern evolution equation of reaction-diffusion type to a cellular automaton (CA) is described. The applicability of CA is demonstrated by generating patterns of complex irregular structure on a hexagonal and quadratic lattice. With this aim a random initial field is transformed by a sequence of CA actions into a new pattern. On the hexagonal lattice this pattern resembles a lizard skin. The properties of CA are specified by the most simple majority rule that adapts selected cell state to the most frequent state of cells in its surrounding. The method could be of interest for manufacturing of textiles as well as for modeling of patterns on skin of various animals.
