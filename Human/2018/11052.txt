Vehicular Communication Networks in Automated Driving Era

Embedded with advanced sensors, cameras and processors, the emerging automated driving vehicles are capable of sensing the environment and conducting automobile operation, paving the way to modern intelligent transportation systems (ITS) with high safety and efficiency. On the other hand, vehicular communication networks (VCNs) connect vehicles, infrastructures, clouds, and all other devices with communication modules, whereby vehicles can obtain local and global information to make intelligent operation decisions. Although the sensing-based automated driving technologies and VCNs have been investigated independently, their interactions and mutual benefits are still underdeveloped. In this article, we argue that VCNs have attractive potentials to enhance the on-board sensing-based automated vehicles from different perspectives, such as driving safety, transportation efficiency, as well as customer experiences. A case study is conducted to demonstrate that the traffic jam can be relieved at intersections with automated driving vehicles coordinated with each other through VCNs. Furthermore, we highlight the critical yet interesting issues for future research, based on the specific requirements posed by automated driving on VCNs.
