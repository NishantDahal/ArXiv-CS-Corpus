Comparison of angular spread for 6 and 60 GHz based on 3GPP standard

In an urban environment, a multipath propagation is one of the basic phenomena affecting a quality of received signals. This causes dispersions in time and angular domains. Basic parameters describing these dispersions are the rms delay spread and rms angle spread, respectively. The delay spread is related to a frequency of the transmitted signal and the nature of the propagation environment. In this paper, we show a mutual relationship between the time and angular dispersions in the received signal. The obtained simulation results present a comparison of the described dispersions for two different frequencies. In this case, the multi-elliptical propagation model and standard model developed by 3GPP are the basis for the simulation analysis of new communication system solutions.
