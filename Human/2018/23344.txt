Omnidirectional Bipedal Walking with Direct Fused Angle Feedback Mechanisms

An omnidirectional closed-loop gait based on the direct feedback of orientation deviation estimates is presented in this paper. At the core of the gait is an open-loop central pattern generator. The orientation feedback is derived from a 3D nonlinear attitude estimator, and split into the relevant angular deviations in the sagittal and lateral planes using the concept of fused angles. These angular deviations from expected are used by a number of independent feedback mechanisms, including one that controls timing, to perform stabilising corrective actions. The tuning of the feedback mechanisms is discussed, including an LQR-based approach for tuning the transient sagittal response. The actuator control scheme and robot pose representations in use are also addressed. Experimental results on an igus Humanoid Open Platform demonstrate the core concept of this paper, that if the sensor management and feedback chains are carefully constructed, comparatively simple model-free and robot-agnostic feedback mechanisms can successfully stabilise a generic bipedal gait.
