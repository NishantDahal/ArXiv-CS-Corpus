Learning to Detect Fake Face Images in the Wild

Although Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be used to generate the realistic image, improper use of these technologies brings hidden concerns. For example, GAN can be used to generate a tampered video for specific people and inappropriate events, creating images that are detrimental to a particular person, and may even affect that personal safety. In this paper, we will develop a deep forgery discriminator (DeepFD) to efficiently and effectively detect the computer-generated images. Directly learning a binary classifier is relatively tricky since it is hard to find the common discriminative features for judging the fake images generated from different GANs. To address this shortcoming, we adopt contrastive loss in seeking the typical features of the synthesized images generated by different GANs and follow by concatenating a classifier to detect such computer-generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DeepFD successfully detected 94.7% fake images generated by several state-of-the-art GANs.
