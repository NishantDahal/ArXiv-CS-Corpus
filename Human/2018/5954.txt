Semi-BCI Algebras

The notion of semi-BCI algebras is introduced and some of its properties are investigated. This algebra is another generalization for BCI-algebras. It arises from the "intervalization" of BCI algebras. Semi-BCI have a similar structure to Pseudo-BCI algebras however they are not the same. In this paper we also provide an investigation on the similarity between these classes of algebras by showing how they relate to the process of intervalization.
