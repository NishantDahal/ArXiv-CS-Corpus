A Robust Secure Hybrid Analog and Digital Receive Beamforming Scheme for Efficient Interference Reduction

Medium-scale or large-scale receive antenna array with digital beamforming can be employed at receiver to make a significant interference reduction, but leads to expensive cost and high complexity of the RF-chain circuit. To deal with this issue, a classic analog-and-digital beamforming (ADB) structure was proposed in the literature for greatly reducing the number of RF-chains. Based on the ADB structure, we in this paper propose a robust hybrid ADB scheme to resist directions of arrival (DOAs) estimation errors. The key idea of our scheme is to employ null space projection (NSP) in analog beamforming domain and diagonal loading (DL) method in digital beamforming domain. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs more robustly, and moreover, has a significant improvement on the receive signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) compared to NSP ADB scheme and DL method.
