Toward Cross-Layer Design for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access: A Quality-of-Experience Perspective

Recent years have seen proliferation in versatile mobile devices and an upsurge in the growth of data-consuming application services. Orthogonal multiple access (OMA) technologies in today's mobile systems fall inefficient in the presence of such massive connectivity and traffic demands. In this regards, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been advocated by the research community to embrace unprecedented requirements. Current NOMA designs have been demonstrated to largely improve conventional system performance in terms of throughput and latency, while their impact on the end users' perceived experience has not yet been comprehensively understood. We envision that quality-of-experience (QoE) awareness is a key pillar for NOMA designs to fulfill versatile user demands in the 5th generation (5G) wireless communication systems. This article systematically investigates QoE-aware NOMA designs that translate the physical-layer benefits of NOMA to the improvement of users' perceived experience in upper layers. We shed light on design principles and key challenges in realizing QoE-aware NOMA designs. With these principles and challenges in mind, we develop a general architecture with a dynamic network scheduling scheme. We provide some implications for future QoE-aware NOMA designs by conducting a case study in video streaming applications.
