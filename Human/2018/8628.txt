Newtonian Action Advice: Integrating Human Verbal Instruction with Reinforcement Learning

A goal of Interactive Machine Learning (IML) is to enable people without specialized training to teach agents how to perform tasks. Many of the existing machine learning algorithms that learn from human instructions are evaluated using simulated feedback and focus on how quickly the agent learns. While this is valuable information, it ignores important aspects of the human-agent interaction such as frustration. In this paper, we present the Newtonian Action Advice agent, a new method of incorporating human verbal action advice with Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a way that improves the human-agent interaction. In addition to simulations, we validated the Newtonian Action Advice algorithm by conducting a human-subject experiment. The results show that Newtonian Action Advice can perform better than Policy Shaping, a state-of-the-art IML algorithm, both in terms of RL metrics like cumulative reward and human factors metrics like frustration.
