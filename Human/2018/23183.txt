Automatic Skin Lesion Segmentation Using GrabCut in HSV Colour Space

Skin lesion segmentation is one of the first steps towards automatic Computer-Aided Diagnosis of skin cancer. Vast variety in the appearance of the skin lesion makes this task very challenging. The contribution of this paper is to apply a power foreground extraction technique called GrabCut for automatic skin lesion segmentation with minimal human interaction in HSV color space. Preprocessing was performed for removing the outer black border. Jaccard Index was measured to evaluate the performance of the segmentation method. On average, 0.71 Jaccard Index was achieved on 1000 images from ISIC challenge 2017 Training Dataset.
