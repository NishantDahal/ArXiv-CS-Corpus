Image contrast enhancement using fuzzy logic

Image enhancement is a method of improving the quality of an image and contrast is a major aspect. Traditional methods of contrast enhancement like histogram equalization results in over/under enhancement of the image especially a lower resolution one. This paper aims at developing a new Fuzzy Inference System to enhance the contrast of the low resolution images overcoming the shortcomings of the traditional methods. Results obtained using both the approaches are compared.
