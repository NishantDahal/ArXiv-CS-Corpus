Union bound for quantum information processing

In this paper, we prove a quantum union bound that is relevant when performing a sequence of binary-outcome quantum measurements on a quantum state. The quantum union bound proved here involves a tunable parameter that can be optimized, and this tunable parameter plays a similar role to a parameter involved in the Hayashi-Nagaoka inequality [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 49(7):1753 (2003)], used often in quantum information theory when analyzing the error probability of a square-root measurement. An advantage of the proof delivered here is that it is elementary, relying only on basic properties of projectors, the Pythagorean theorem, and the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality. As a non-trivial application of our quantum union bound, we prove that a sequential decoding strategy for classical communication over a quantum channel achieves a lower bound on the channel's second-order coding rate. This demonstrates the advantage of our quantum union bound in the non-asymptotic regime, in which a communication channel is called a finite number of times. We expect that the bound will find a range of applications in quantum communication theory, quantum algorithms, and quantum complexity theory.
