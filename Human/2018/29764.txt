Composable secure multi-client delegated quantum computation

The engineering challenges involved in building large scale quantum computers, and the associated infrastructure requirements, mean that when such devices become available it is likely that this will be in limited numbers and in limited geographic locations. It is likely that many users will need to rely on remote access to delegate their computation to the available hardware. In such a scenario, the privacy and reliability of the delegated computations are important concerns. On the other hand, the distributed nature of modern computations has led to a widespread class of applications in which a group of parties attempt to perform a joint task over their inputs, e.g., in cloud computing. In this paper, we study the multi-client delegated quantum computation problem where we consider the global computation be made up of local computations that are individually decided by the clients. Each client part is kept secret from the server and the other clients. We construct a composable secure multi-client delegated quantum computation scheme from any composable secure single-client delegated quantum computation protocol and quantum authentication codes.
