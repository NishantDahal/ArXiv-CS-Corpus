Obstructions for three-coloring graphs without induced paths on six vertices

We prove that there are 24 4-critical $P_6$-free graphs, and give the complete list. We remark that, if $H$ is connected and not a subgraph of $P_6$, there are infinitely many 4-critical $H$-free graphs. Our result answers questions of Golovach et al. and Seymour.
