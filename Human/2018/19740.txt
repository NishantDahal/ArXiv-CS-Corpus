Pose Flow: Efficient Online Pose Tracking

Multi-person articulated pose tracking in unconstrained videos is an important while challenging problem. In this paper, going along the road of top-down approaches, we propose a decent and efficient pose tracker based on pose flows. First, we design an online optimization framework to build the association of cross-frame poses and form pose flows (PF-Builder). Second, a novel pose flow non-maximum suppression (PF-NMS) is designed to robustly reduce redundant pose flows and re-link temporal disjoint ones. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms best-reported results on two standard Pose Tracking datasets by 13 mAP 25 MOTA and 6 mAP 3 MOTA respectively. Moreover, in the case of working on detected poses in individual frames, the extra computation of pose tracker is very minor, guaranteeing online 10FPS tracking.
