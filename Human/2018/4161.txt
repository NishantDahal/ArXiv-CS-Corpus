A Linear Variational Principle for Riemann Mappings and Discrete Conformality

We consider Riemann mappings from bounded Lipschitz domains in the plane to a triangle. We show that in this case the Riemann mapping has a linear variational principle: it is the minimizer of the Dirichlet energy over an appropriate affine space. By discretizing the variational principle in a natural way we obtain discrete conformal maps which can be computed by solving a sparse linear system. We show that these discrete conformal maps converge to the Riemann mapping in $H^1$, even for non-Delaunay triangulations. Additionally, for Delaunay triangulations the discrete conformal maps converge uniformly and are known to be bijective. As a consequence we show that the Riemann mapping between two bounded Lipschitz domains can be uniformly approximated by composing the Riemann mappings between each Lipschitz domain and the triangle.
