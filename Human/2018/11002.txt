Training of photonic neural networks through in situ backpropagation

Recently, integrated optics has gained interest as a hardware platform for implementing machine learning algorithms. Of particular interest are artificial neural networks, since matrix-vector multi- plications, which are used heavily in artificial neural networks, can be done efficiently in photonic circuits. The training of an artificial neural network is a crucial step in its application. However, currently on the integrated photonics platform there is no efficient protocol for the training of these networks. In this work, we introduce a method that enables highly efficient, in situ training of a photonic neural network. We use adjoint variable methods to derive the photonic analogue of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the standard method for computing gradients of conventional neural networks. We further show how these gradients may be obtained exactly by performing intensity measurements within the device. As an application, we demonstrate the training of a numerically simulated photonic artificial neural network. Beyond the training of photonic machine learning implementations, our method may also be of broad interest to experimental sensitivity analysis of photonic systems and the optimization of reconfigurable optics platforms.
