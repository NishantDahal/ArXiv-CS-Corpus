Go-Smart: Open-Ended, Web-Based Modelling of Minimally Invasive Cancer Treatments via a Clinical Domain Approach

Clinicians benefit from online treatment planning systems, through off-site accessibility, data sharing and professional interaction. As well as enhancing clinical value, incorporation of simulation tools affords innovative avenues for open-ended, multi-disciplinary research collaboration. An extensible system for clinicians, technicians, manufacturers and researchers to build on a simulation framework is presented. This is achieved using a domain model that relates entities from theoretical, engineering and clinical domains, allowing algorithmic generation of simulation configuration for several open source solvers.
  The platform is applied to Minimally Invasive Cancer Treatments (MICTs), allowing interventional radiologists to upload patient data, segment patient images and validate simulated treatments of radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation and irreversible electroporation. A traditional radiology software layout is provided in-browser for clinical use, with simple, guided simulation, primarily for training and research. Developers and manufacturers access a web-based system to manage their own simulation components (equipment, numerical models and clinical protocols) and related parameters.
  This system is tested by interventional radiologists at four centres, using pseudonymized patient data, as part of the Go-Smart Project (http://gosmart-project.eu). The simulation technology is released as a set of open source components http://github.com/go-smart.
