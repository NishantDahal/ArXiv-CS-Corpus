An Integral Pose Regression System for the ECCV2018 PoseTrack Challenge

For the ECCV 2018 PoseTrack Challenge, we present a 3D human pose estimation system based mainly on the integral human pose regression method. We show a comprehensive ablation study to examine the key performance factors of the proposed system. Our system obtains 47mm MPJPE on the CHALL_H80K test dataset, placing second in the ECCV2018 3D human pose estimation challenge. Code will be released to facilitate future work.
