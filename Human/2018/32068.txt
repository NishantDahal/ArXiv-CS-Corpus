Spelling Error Correction Using a Nested RNN Model and Pseudo Training Data

We propose a nested recurrent neural network (nested RNN) model for English spelling error correction and generate pseudo data based on phonetic similarity to train it. The model fuses orthographic information and context as a whole and is trained in an end-to-end fashion. This avoids feature engineering and does not rely on a noisy channel model as in traditional methods. Experiments show that the proposed method is superior to existing systems in correcting spelling errors.
