Thresholds quantifying proportionality criteria for election methods

We define several different thresholds for election methods by considering different scenarios, corresponding to different proportionality criteria that have been proposed by various authors. In particular, we reformulate the criteria known as DPC, PSC, JR, PJR, EJR in our setting. We consider multi-winner election methods of different types, using ballots with unordered lists of candidates or ordered lists, and for comparison also methods using only party lists. The thresholds are calculated for many different election methods. The considered methods include classical ones such as BV, SNTV and STV (with some results going back to e.g. Droop and Dodgson in the 19th century); we also study in detail several perhaps lesser known methods by Phragm√©n and Thiele. There are also many cases left as open problems.
