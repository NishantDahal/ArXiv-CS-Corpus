Optimal Equi-difference Conflict-avoiding Codes

An equi-differece conflict-avoiding code $(CAC^{e})\ \mathcal{C}$ of length $n$ and weight $ω$ is a collection of $ω$-subsets (called codewords) which has the form $\{0,i,2i,\cdots,(ω-1)i\}$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ such that $Δ(c_{1})\capΔ(c_{2})=\emptyset$ holds for any $c_{1},\ c_{2}\in\mathcal{C}$, $c_{1}\neq c_{2}$ where $Δ(c)=\{j-i \ (\mbox{mod}\ n) \; | \; i,j\in c,i\neq j\}.$ A code $\mathcal{C}\in CAC^{e}s$ with maximum code size for given $n$ and $ω$ is called optimal and is said to be perfect if $\cup_{c\in \mathcal{C}}Δ(c)=\mathbb{Z}_{n}\backslash \{0\}.$ In this paper, we show how to combine a $\mathcal{C}_{1}\in CAC^{e}(q_{1},ω)$ and a $\mathcal{C}_{2}\in CAC^{e}(q_{2},ω)$ into a $\mathcal{C}\in CAC^{e}(q_{1}q_{2},ω)$ under certain conditions. One necessary condition for a $CAC^{e}$ of length $q_{1}q_{2}$ and weight $ω$ being optimal is given. We also consider explicit construction of perfect $\mathcal{C}\in CAC^{e}(p,ω)$ of odd prime $p$ and weight $ω\geq3$. Finally, for positive integer $k$ and prime $p\equiv1 \ (\mbox{mod}\ 4k)$, we consider explicit construction of quasi-perfect $\mathcal{C}\in CAC^{e}(2p,4k+1)$.
