A Core Model for Choreographic Programming

Choreographic Programming is a programming paradigm for building concurrent programs that are deadlock-free by construction, as a result of programming communications declaratively and then synthesising process implementations automatically. Despite strong interest on choreographies, a foundational model that explains which computations can be performed with the hallmark constructs of choreographies is still missing.
  In this work, we introduce Core Choreographies (CC), a model that includes only the core primitives of choreographic programming. Every computable function can be implemented as a choreography in CC, from which we can synthesise a process implementation where independent computations run in parallel. We discuss the design of CC and argue that it constitutes a canonical model for choreographic programming.
