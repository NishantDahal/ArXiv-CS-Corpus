Toward Efficient and Robust Biped Walking Optimization

Practical bipedal robot locomotion needs to be both energy efficient and robust to variability and uncertainty. In this paper, we build upon recent works in trajectory optimization for robot locomotion with two primary goals. First, we wish to demonstrate the importance of (a) considering and quantifying not only energy efficiency but also robustness of gaits, and (b) optimization not only of nominal motion trajectories but also of robot design parameters and feedback control policies. As a second, complementary focus, we present results from optimization studies on a 5-link planar walking model, to provide preliminary data on particular trade-offs and general trends in improving efficiency versus robustness. In addressing important, open challenges, we focus in particular on discussions of the effects of choices made (a) in formulating what is always, necessarily only an approximate optimization, in choosing metrics for performance, and (b) in structuring and tuning feedback control.
