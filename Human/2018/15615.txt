Resource Provisioning and Scheduling Algorithm for Meeting Cost and Deadline-Constraints of Scientific Workflows in IaaS Clouds

Infrastructure as a Service model of cloud computing is a desirable platform for the execution of cost and deadline constrained workflow applications as the elasticity of cloud computing allows large-scale complex scientific workflow applications to scale dynamically according to their deadline requirements. However, scheduling of these multitask workflow jobs in a distributed computing environment is a computationally hard multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The critical challenge is to schedule the workflow tasks whilst meeting user quality of service (QoS) requirements and the application's deadline. The existing research work not only fails to address this challenge but also do not incorporate the basic principles of elasticity and heterogeneity of computing resources in cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a resource provisioning and scheduling algorithm to schedule the workflow applications on IaaS clouds to meet application deadline constraints while optimizing the execution cost. The proposed algorithm is based on the nature-inspired population based Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) optimization algorithm. The experimental results in the simulated environment of CloudSim with four real-world workflow applications demonstrates that IWD algorithm schedules workflow tasks with optimized cost within the specified deadlines. Moreover, the IWD algorithm converges fast to near optimal solution.
