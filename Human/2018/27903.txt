Efficient Trajectory Optimization for Robot Motion Planning

Motion planning for multi-jointed robots is challenging. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem, most existing works decompose motion planning as easier subproblems. However, because of the inconsistent performance metrics, only sub-optimal solution can be found by decomposition based approaches. This paper presents an optimal control based approach to address the path planning and trajectory planning subproblems simultaneously. Unlike similar works which either ignore robot dynamics or require long computation time, an efficient numerical method for trajectory optimization is presented in this paper for motion planning involving complicated robot dynamics. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by numerical results. Experimental results are used to show the feasibility of the presented planning algorithm.
