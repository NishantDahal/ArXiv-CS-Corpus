When deep learning meets security

Deep learning is an emerging research field that has proven its effectiveness towards deploying more efficient intelligent systems. Security, on the other hand, is one of the most essential issues in modern communication systems. Recently many papers have shown that using deep learning models can achieve promising results when applied to the security domain. In this work, we provide an overview for the recent studies that apply deep learning techniques to the field of security.
