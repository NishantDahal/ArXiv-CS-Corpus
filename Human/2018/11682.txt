Towards Malware Detection via CPU Power Consumption: Data Collection Design and Analytics (Extended Version)

This paper presents an experimental design and data analytics approach aimed at power-based malware detection on general-purpose computers. Leveraging the fact that malware executions must consume power, we explore the postulate that malware can be accurately detected via power data analytics. Our experimental design and implementation allow for programmatic collection of CPU power profiles for fixed tasks during uninfected and infected states using five different rootkits. To characterize the power consumption profiles, we use both simple statistical and novel, sophisticated features. We test a one-class anomaly detection ensemble (that baselines non-infected power profiles) and several kernel-based SVM classifiers (that train on both uninfected and infected profiles) in detecting previously unseen malware and clean profiles. The anomaly detection system exhibits perfect detection when using all features and tasks, with smaller false detection rate than the supervised classifiers. The primary contribution is the proof of concept that baselining power of fixed tasks can provide accurate detection of rootkits. Moreover, our treatment presents engineering hurdles needed for experimentation and allows analysis of each statistical feature individually. This work appears to be the first step towards a viable power-based detection capability for general-purpose computers, and presents next steps toward this goal.
