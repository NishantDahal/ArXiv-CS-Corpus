Exploiting Location Information to Enhance Throughput in Downlink V2I Systems

Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology, combined with millimeter wave (mmW) networks, may support high data rates for vehicular communication and therefore provides a whole new set of services. However, in dense urban environment, pedestrians or buildings cause strong blockage to the narrow beams at mmW, severely deteriorating the transmission rate. In this work, we model the downlink mmW V2I system as a simple erasure broadcast channel where the erasure (blockage) event is considered as the state of the channel. While state feedback can be obtained through protocols such as Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ), we also assume that the current state can be estimated through the location information shared by the communication peers. We evaluate, through an information-theoretic approach, the achievable downlink rate in such a system. Despite its highly theoretical nature, our result sheds light on how much the location information can contribute to improve the downlink date rate, e.g., as a function of the mobility (velocity) of the vehicles.
