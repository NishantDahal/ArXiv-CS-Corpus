Quantitative Evaluation of Base and Detail Decomposition Filters Based on their Artifacts

This paper introduces a quantitative evaluation of filters that seek to separate an image into its large-scale variations, the base layer, and its fine-scale variations, the detail layer. Such methods have proliferated with the development of HDR imaging and the proposition of many new tone-mapping operators. We argue that an objective quality measurement for all methods can be based on their artifacts. To this aim, the four main recurrent artifacts are described and mathematically characterized. Among them two are classic, the luminance halo and the staircase effect, but we show the relevance of two more, the contrast halo and the compartmentalization effect. For each of these artifacts we design a test-pattern and its attached measurement formula. Then we fuse these measurements into a single quality mark, and obtain in that way a ranking method valid for all filters performing a base+detail decomposition. This synthetic ranking is applied to seven filters representative of the literature and shown to agree with expert artifact rejection criteria.
