Git Loss for Deep Face Recognition

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in computer vision tasks, such as face recognition and verification, and have achieved state-of-the-art results due to their ability to capture discriminative deep features. Conventionally, CNNs have been trained with softmax as supervision signal to penalize the classification loss. In order to further enhance the discriminative capability of deep features, we introduce a joint supervision signal, Git loss, which leverages on softmax and center loss functions. The aim of our loss function is to minimize the intra-class variations as well as maximize the inter-class distances. Such minimization and maximization of deep features are considered ideal for face recognition task. We perform experiments on two popular face recognition benchmarks datasets and show that our proposed loss function achieves maximum separability between deep face features of different identities and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two major face recognition benchmark datasets: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces (YTF). However, it should be noted that the major objective of Git loss is to achieve maximum separability between deep features of divergent identities.
