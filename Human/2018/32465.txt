Spatio-Temporal Instance Learning: Action Tubes from Class Supervision

The goal of this work is spatio-temporal action localization in videos, using only the supervision from video-level class labels. The state-of-the-art casts this weakly-supervised action localization regime as a Multiple Instance Learning problem, where instances are a priori computed spatio-temporal proposals. Rather than disconnecting the spatio-temporal learning from the training, we propose Spatio-Temporal Instance Learning, which enables action localization directly from box proposals in video frames. We outline the assumptions of our model and propose a max-margin objective and optimization with latent variables that enable spatio-temporal learning of actions from video labels. We also provide an efficient linking algorithm and two reranking strategies to facilitate and further improve the action localization. Experimental evaluation on four action datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for localization from weak supervision. Moreover, we show how to incorporate other supervision levels and mixtures, as a step towards determining optimal supervision strategies for action localization.
