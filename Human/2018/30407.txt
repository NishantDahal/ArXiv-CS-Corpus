Design paradigms of intelligent control systems on a chip

This paper focuses on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) design and implementation of intelligent control system applications on a chip, specifically fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm processing units. Initially, an overview of the FPGA technology is presented, followed by design methodologies, development tools and the use of hardware description languages (HDL). Two FPGA design examples with the use of Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) of parameterized fuzzy logic controller cores are discussed. Thereinafter, a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) designed by the authors in previous work and realized on FPGA featuring a Digital Fuzzy Logic Controller (DFLC) and a soft processor core for the path tracking problem of mobile robots is discussed. Finally a Genetic Algorithm implementation (previously published by the authors) in FPGA chip for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is also discussed.
