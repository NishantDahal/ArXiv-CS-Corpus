Several classes of minimal linear codes with few weights from weakly regular plateaued functions

Minimal linear codes have significant applications in secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. There are several methods to construct linear codes, one of which is based on functions over finite fields. Recently, many construction methods of linear codes based on functions have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we generalize the recent construction methods given by Tang et al. in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 62(3), 1166-1176, 2016] to weakly regular plateaued functions over finite fields of odd characteristic. We first construct three weight linear codes from weakly regular plateaued functions based on the second generic construction and determine their weight distributions. We next give a subcode with two or three weights of each constructed code as well as its parameter. We finally show that the constructed codes in this paper are minimal, which confirms that the secret sharing schemes based on their dual codes have the nice access structures.
