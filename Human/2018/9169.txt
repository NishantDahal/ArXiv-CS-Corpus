Implementing Line-Hermitian Grassmann codes

In [I. Cardinali and L. Giuzzi. Line Hermitian Grassmann codes and their parameters. Finite Fields Appl., 51: 407-432, 2018] we introduced line Hermitian Grassmann codes and determined their parameters. The aim of this paper is to present (in the spirit of [I. Cardinali and L. Giuzzi. Enumerative coding for line polar Grassmannians with applications to codes. Finite Fields Appl., 46:107-138, 2017]) an algorithm for the point enumerator of a line Hermitian Grassmannian which can be usefully applied to get efficient encoders, decoders and error correction algorithms for the aforementioned codes.
