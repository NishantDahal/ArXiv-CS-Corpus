Crowdsensing and privacy in smart city applications

Smartness in smart cities is achieved by sensing phenomena of interest and using them to make smart decisions. Since the decision makers may not own all the necessary sensing infrastructures, crowdsourced sensing, can help collect important information of the city in near real-time. However, involving people brings of the risk of exposing their private information.This chapter explores crowdsensing in smart city applications and its privacy implications.
