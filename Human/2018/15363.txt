UAV-Enabled Communication Using NOMA

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as flying base stations (BSs) to leverage the strength of line-of-sight connections and effectively support the coverage and throughput of wireless communication. This paper considers a multiuser communication system, in which a single-antenna UAV-BS serves a large number of ground users by employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The max-min rate optimization problem is formulated under total power, total bandwidth, UAV altitude, and antenna beamwdith constraints. The objective of max-min rate optimization is non-convex in all optimization variables, i.e. UAV altitude, transmit antenna beamwidth, power allocation and bandwidth allocation for multiple users. A path-following algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem. Next, orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and dirty paper coding (DPC)-based max-min rate optimization problems are formulated and respective path-following algorithms are developed to solve them. Numerical results show that NOMA outperforms OMA and achieves rates similar to those attained by DPC. In addition, a clear rate gain is observed by jointly optimizing all the parameters rather than optimizing a subset of parameters, which confirms the desirability of their joint optimization.
