Comparison of Limited Feedback Schemes for NOMA Transmission in mmWave Drone Networks

Introducing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based communication network is a promising solution to enhance its spectral efficiency. However, for realistic deployment of such a network, identifying a practical user feedback scheme for NOMA is essential. In this paper, considering two practical feedback schemes we introduce NOMA transmission to UAVs acting as aerial base stations (BS) to provide coverage at a large stadium. In particular, a UAV-BS generates directional beams, and multiple users are served simultaneously within the same beam employing NOMA transmission. Each user is considered to have a target rate based on its quality of service (QoS) requirements. In order to relieve the burden of tracking and feeding back full channel state information, we consider two limited feedback schemes as practical alternatives: 1) user distance, and 2) user angle with respect to beamforming direction under different user region geometries. Our evaluation results show that NOMA with limited feedback can provide better sum rates compared to its orthogonal counterpart. Further, based on the geometry of user region we identify that there is an optimal feedback scheme and user ordering criteria for NOMA transmission which can maximize sum rates.
