An Anchor-Free Region Proposal Network for Faster R-CNN based Text Detection Approaches

The anchor mechanism of Faster R-CNN and SSD framework is considered not effective enough to scene text detection, which can be attributed to its IoU based matching criterion between anchors and ground-truth boxes. In order to better enclose scene text instances of various shapes, it requires to design anchors of various scales, aspect ratios and even orientations manually, which makes anchor-based methods sophisticated and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor-free region proposal network (AF-RPN) to replace the original anchor-based RPN in the Faster R-CNN framework to address the above problem. Compared with a vanilla RPN and FPN-RPN, AF-RPN can get rid of complicated anchor design and achieve higher recall rate on large-scale COCO-Text dataset. Owing to the high-quality text proposals, our Faster R-CNN based two-stage text detection approach achieves state-of-the-art results on ICDAR-2017 MLT, ICDAR-2015 and ICDAR-2013 text detection benchmarks when using single-scale and single-model (ResNet50) testing only.
