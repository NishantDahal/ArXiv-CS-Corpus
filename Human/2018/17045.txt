Continuous Authentication of Smartphones Based on Application Usage

An empirical investigation of active/continuous authentication for smartphones is presented in this paper by exploiting users' unique application usage data, i.e., distinct patterns of use, modeled by a Markovian process. Variations of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are evaluated for continuous user verification, and challenges due to the sparsity of session-wise data, an explosion of states, and handling unforeseen events in the test data are tackled. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed formulation does not depend on the top N-apps, rather uses the complete app-usage information to achieve low latency. Through experimentation, empirical assessment of the impact of unforeseen events, i.e., unknown applications and unforeseen observations, on user verification is done via a modified edit-distance algorithm for simple sequence matching. It is found that for enhanced verification performance, unforeseen events should be incorporated in the models by adopting smoothing techniques with HMMs. For validation, extensive experiments on two distinct datasets are performed. The marginal smoothing technique is the most effective for user verification in terms of equal error rate (EER) and with a sampling rate of 1/30s^{-1} and 30 minutes of historical data, and the method is capable of detecting an intrusion within ~2.5 minutes of application use.
