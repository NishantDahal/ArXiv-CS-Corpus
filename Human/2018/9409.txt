Combining STPA and BDD for Safety Analysis and Verification in Agile Development: A Controlled Experiment

Context: Agile development is in widespread use, even in safety-critical domains. Motivation: However, there is a lack of an ap- propriate safety analysis and verification method in agile development. Objective: In this paper, we investigate the use of Behavior Driven De- velopment (BDD) instead of standard User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for safety verification with System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) for safety analysis in agile development. Method: We evaluate the effect of this combination in a controlled experiment with 44 students in terms of productivity, test thoroughness, fault detection effectiveness and com- munication effectiveness. Results: The results show that BDD is more effective for safety verification regarding the impact on communication effectiveness than standard UAT, whereas productivity, test thorough- ness and fault detection effectiveness show no statistically significant difference in our controlled experiment. Conclusion: The combination of BDD and STPA seems promising with an enhancement on communica- tion, but its impact needs more research.
