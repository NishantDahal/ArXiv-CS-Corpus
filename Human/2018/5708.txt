Smartphone based Driving Style Classification Using Features Made by Discrete Wavelet Transform

Smartphones consist of different sensors, which provide a platform for data acquisition in many scientific researches such as driving style identification systems. In the present paper, smartphone data are used to evaluate the driving styles based on maneuvers analysis. The data obtained for each maneuver is the speed of the vehicle steering and the vehicle's direct and lateral acceleration. To classify the drivers based on their driving style, machine-learning algorithms can be used on these data. However, these data usually contains more information than it is needed and cause a bad effect on the learning accuracy. In addition, they may transfer some wrong information to the learning algorithm. Thus, we used Haar discrete wavelet transformation to remove noise effects. Then, we get the discrete wavelet transformation with four levels from smartphone sensors data, which include low-to-high frequencies, respectively. The obtained features vector for each maneuver includes the raw signal variance as well as the variance of the wavelet transform components. On these vectors, we use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for features selection. Then, we use SVM, RBF and MLP neural networks on these features to separate braking and dangerous speed maneuvers from the safe ones as well as dangerous turning, U-turn and lane-changing maneuvers. The results are very interesting.
