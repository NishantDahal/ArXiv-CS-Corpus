Index Codes for Interlinked Cycle Structures with Outer Cycles

Index code construction for a class of side-information graphs called interlinked cycle (IC) structures without outer cycles is given by Thapa, Ong and Johnson (C. Thapa, L. Ong, and S. Johnson, "Interlinked Cycles for Index Coding: Generalizing Cycles and Cliques", in \textit{IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 63, no. 6, Jun. 2017}, "Interlinked Cycles for Index Coding: Generalizing Cycles and Cliques", in arxiv (arxiv:1603.00092v2 [cs.IT] 25 Feb 2018)). In this paper, construction of index codes for interlinked cycle (IC) structures with outer cycles is given along with a decoding algorithm.
