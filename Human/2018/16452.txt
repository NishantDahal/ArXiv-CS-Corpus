User Association and Resource Allocation in Unified NOMA Enabled Heterogeneous Ultra Dense Networks

Heterogeneous ultra dense networks (HUDNs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been identified as two proposing techniques for the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems due to their great capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency. This article investigates the application of NOMA techniques in HUDNs to support massive connectivity in 5G systems. Particularly, a unified NOMA framework is proposed, including power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA, which can be configured flexibly to serve different applications scenarios. As a further advance, the unified NOMA framework enabled HUDNs is further investigated, with particular focuses on the user association and resource allocation. Two case studies are provided for demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified NOMA enabled HUDNs. Finally, some main challenges and promising research directions in NOMA enabled HUDNs are identified.
