Skew cyclic and skew $(α_1 + uα_2 + vα_3 + uvα_4)$-constacyclic codes over $F_q + uF_q + vF_q + uvF_q$

In this note, we study skew cyclic and skew constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathcal{R}=F_{q}+uF_{q}+vF_{q}+uvF_{q}$ where $q=p^{m},$ $p$ is an odd prime, $u^{2}=u,~v^{2}=v,~uv=vu$. We show that Gray images of a skew cyclic and skew $α$-constacyclic code of length $n$ are skew quasi-cyclic code of length $4n$ over $F_{q}$ of index 4. Also, it is shown that skew $α$-constacyclic codes are either equivalent to $α$-constacyclic codes or $α$-quasi-twisted codes over $\mathcal{R}$. Further, structural properties, specially, generating polynomials and idempotent generators for skew cyclic and skew constacyclic codes are determined by decomposition method.
