Algebraic matching techniques for fast decoding of polar codes with Reed-Solomon kernel

We propose to reduce the decoding complexity of polar codes with non-Arikan kernels by employing a (near) ML decoding algorithm for the codes generated by kernel rows. A generalization of the order statistics algorithm is presented for soft decoding of Reed-Solomon codes. Algebraic properties of the Reed-Solomon code are exploited to increase the reprocessing order. The obtained algorithm is used as a building block to obtain a decoder for polar codes with Reed-Solomon kernel.
