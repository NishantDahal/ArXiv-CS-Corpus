Evaluation of IEEE 802.11ad for mmWave V2V Communications

Autonomous vehicles can construct a more accurate perception of their surrounding environment by exchanging rich sensor data with nearby vehicles. Such exchange can require larger bandwidths than currently provided by ITS-G5/DSRC and Cellular V2X. Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can provide higher bandwidth and could complement current V2X standards. Recent studies have started investigating the potential of IEEE 802.11ad to support high bandwidth vehicular communications. This paper introduces the first performance evaluation of the IEEE 802.11ad MAC (Medium Access Control) and beamforming mechanism for mmWave V2V communications. The study highlights existing opportunities and shortcomings that should guide the development of mmWave communications for V2V communications.
