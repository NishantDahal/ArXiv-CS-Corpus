Enhanced navigation systems in GPS denied environments for visually impaired people: A Survey

Although outdoor navigation systems are mostly dependent on GPS, indoor systems have to rely upon different techniques for localizing the user, due to unavailability of GPS signals in indoor environments. Over the past decade various indoor navigation systems have been developed. In this paper an overview of some existing indoor navigation systems for visually impaired people are presented and they are compared from different perspectives. The evaluated techniques are ultrasonic systems, RFID-based solutions, computer vision aided navigation systems, ans smartphone-based applications.
