A new viewpoint of the Gödel's incompleteness theorem and its applications

A new viewpoint of the Gödel's incompleteness theorem be given in this article which reveals the deep relationship between the logic and computation. Upon the results of these studies, an algorithm be given which shows how to search a proof of statement in first order logic from finite concrete examples, and an approach be proposed to improve searching mathematical proof by neural network.
