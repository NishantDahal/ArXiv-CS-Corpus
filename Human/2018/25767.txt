Design, Simulation, and Testing of a Flexible Actuated Spine for Quadruped Robots

Walking quadruped robots face challenges in positioning their feet and lifting their legs during gait cycles over uneven terrain. The robot Laika is under development as a quadruped with a flexible, actuated spine designed to assist with foot movement and balance during these gaits. This paper presents the first set of hardware designs for the spine of Laika, a physical prototype of those designs, and tests in both hardware and simulations that show the prototype's capabilities. Laika's spine is a tensegrity structure, used for its advantages with weight and force distribution, and represents the first working prototype of a tensegrity spine for a quadruped robot. The spine bends by adjusting the lengths of the cables that separate its vertebrae, and twists using an actuated rotating vertebra at its center. The current prototype of Laika has stiff legs attached to the spine, and is used as a test setup for evaluation of the spine itself. This work shows the advantages of Laika's spine by demonstrating the spine lifting each of the robot's four feet, both as a form of balancing and as a precursor for a walking gait. These foot motions, using specific combinations of bending and rotation movements of the spine, are measured in both simulation and hardware experiments. Hardware data are used to calibrate the simulations, such that the simulations can be used for control of balancing or gait cycles in the future. Future work will attach actuated legs to Laika's spine, and examine balancing and gait cycles when combined with leg movements.
