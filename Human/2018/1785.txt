A Scalable and Extensible Checkpointing Scheme for Massively Parallel Simulations

Realistic simulations in engineering or in the materials sciences can consume enormous computing resources and thus require the use of massively parallel supercomputers. The probability of a failure increases both with the runtime and with the number of system components. For future exascale systems it is therefore considered critical that strategies are developed to make software resilient against failures. In this article, we present a scalable, distributed, diskless, and resilient checkpointing scheme that can create and recover snapshots of a partitioned simulation domain. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the checkpoint strategy for simulations with up to $40$ billion computational cells executing on more than $400$ billion floating point values. A checkpoint creation is shown to require only a few seconds and the new checkpointing scheme scales almost perfectly up to more than $260\,000$ ($2^{18}$) processes. To recover from a diskless checkpoint during runtime, we realize the recovery algorithms using ULFM MPI. The checkpointing mechanism is fully integrated in a state-of-the-art high-performance multi-physics simulation framework. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the method with a realistic phase-field simulation originating in the material sciences and with a lattice Boltzmann method implementation.
