Using Blippar Augmented Reality Browser in the Practical Training of Mechanical Engineers

The purpose of the study is to justify the expediency of using the Blippar augmented reality browser for professional and practical training of future mechanical engineers. Tasks of the research: to analyze the expediency of using augmented reality tools in the professional training of bachelors of applied mechanics; to carry out the selection of augmented reality tools, which is expedient to use in the training of future engineer mechanics; to develop educational materials using the chosen augmented reality tools. The object of the study is the professional training of future mechanical engineers. The subject of the study is the use of the augmented reality tools in the professional training of bachelors of applied mechanics. The paper analyzes the relevance and expediency of the use of the augmented reality tools in the professional training of future mechanical engineers. It is determined that the augmented reality tools will promote the development of ICT competence and graphic competence of bachelors of applied mechanics The model of the use of the augmented reality tools in the training of future mechanical engineers is proposed. As the main tool, the Blippar browser and Blippbuilder's cloud-based script development tool are chosen. An example of the creation of markers and scenes of augmented reality using the selected tools is given. The advantages and disadvantages of used tools are indicated. The proposed learning tools and methods can be applied to vocational and practical training of mechanical engineers.
