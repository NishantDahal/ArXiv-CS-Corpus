Assessing the Utility of Weather Data for Photovoltaic Power Prediction

Photovoltaic systems have been widely deployed in recent times to meet the increased electricity demand as an environmental-friendly energy source. The major challenge for integrating photovoltaic systems in power systems is the unpredictability of the solar power generated. In this paper, we analyze the impact of having access to weather information for solar power generation prediction and find weather information that can help best predict photovoltaic power.
