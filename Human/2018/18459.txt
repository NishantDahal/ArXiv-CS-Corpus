Verification and Calibration of Antenna Cross-Polarization Discrimination and Penetration Loss for Millimeter Wave Communications

This article presents measurement guidelines and verification procedures for antenna cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and penetration loss measurements for millimeter wave (mmWave) channel sounder systems. These techniques are needed to ensure accurate and consistent measurements by different researchers at different frequencies and bandwidths. Measurements at 73 GHz are used to demonstrate and verify the guidelines, and show the consistency of the antenna XPD factor and the penetration loss at different transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation distances, thus providing a systematic method that may be used at any frequency for reliable field measurements.
