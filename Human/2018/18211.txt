Enhancing Middleware-based IoT Applications through Run-Time Pluggable QoS Management Mechanisms. Application to a oneM2M compliant IoT Middleware

In the recent years, telecom and computer networks have witnessed new concepts and technologies through Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN, which allows applications to have a control over the network, and NFV, which allows deploying network functions in virtualized environments, are two paradigms that are increasingly used for the Internet of Things (IoT). This Internet (IoT) brings the promise to interconnect billions of devices in the next few years rises several scientific challenges in particular those of the satisfaction of the quality of service (QoS) required by the IoT applications. In order to address this problem, we have identified two bottlenecks with respect to the QoS: the traversed networks and the intermediate entities that allows the application to interact with the IoT devices. In this paper, we first present an innovative vision of a "network function" with respect to their deployment and runtime environment. Then, we describe our general approach of a solution that consists in the dynamic, autonomous, and seamless deployment of QoS management mechanisms. We also describe the requirements for the implementation of such approach. Finally, we present a redirection mechanism, implemented as a network function, allowing the seamless control of the data path of a given middleware traffic. This mechanism is assessed through a use case related to vehicular transportation.
