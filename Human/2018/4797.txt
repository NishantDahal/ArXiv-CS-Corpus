A Review on Image Texture Analysis Methods

Texture classification is an active topic in image processing which plays an important role in many applications such as image retrieval, inspection systems, face recognition, medical image processing, etc. There are many approaches extracting texture features in gray-level images such as local binary patterns, gray level co-occurrence matrices, statistical features, skeleton, scale invariant feature transform, etc. The texture analysis methods can be categorized in 4 groups titles: statistical methods, structural methods, filter-based and model based approaches. In many related researches, authors have tried to extract color and texture features jointly. In this respect, combined methods are considered as efficient image analysis descriptors. Mostly important challenges in image texture analysis are rotation sensitivity, gray scale variations, noise sensitivity, illumination and brightness conditions, etc. In this paper, we review most efficient and state-of-the-art image texture analysis methods. Also, some texture classification approaches are survived.
