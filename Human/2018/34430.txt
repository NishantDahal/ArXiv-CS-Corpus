Privacy-preserving data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes in Internet of Things: A review

Privacy problems are lethal and getting more attention than any other issue with the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Since IoT has many application areas including smart home, smart grids, smart healthcare system, smart and intelligent transportation and many more. Most of these applications are fueled by the resource-constrained sensor network, such as Smart healthcare system is powered by Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) and Smart home and weather monitoring systems are fueled by Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In the mentioned application areas sensor node life is a very important aspect of these technologies as it explicitly effects the network life and performance. Data aggregation techniques are used to increase sensor node life by decreasing communication overhead. However, when the data is aggregated at intermediate nodes to reduce communication overhead, data privacy problems becomes more vulnerable. Different Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation (PPDA) techniques have been proposed to ensure data privacy during data aggregation in resource-constrained sensor nodes. We provide a review and comparative analysis of the state of the art PPDA techniques in this paper. The comparative analysis is based on Computation Cost, Communication overhead, Privacy Level, resistance against malicious aggregator, sensor node life and energy consumption by the sensor node. We have studied the most recent techniques and provide in-depth analysis of the minute steps involved in these techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most recent and comprehensive study of PPDA techniques.
