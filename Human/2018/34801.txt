HEVC Inter Coding Using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks and Artificial Reference Pictures

The efficiency of motion compensated prediction in modern video codecs highly depends on the available reference pictures. Occlusions and non-linear motion pose challenges for the motion compensation and often result in high bit rates for the prediction error. We propose the generation of artificial reference pictures using deep recurrent neural networks. Conceptually, a reference picture at the time instance of the currently coded picture is generated from previously reconstructed conventional reference pictures. Based on these artificial reference pictures, we propose a complete coding pipeline based on HEVC. By using the artificial reference pictures for motion compensated prediction, average BD-rate gains of 1.5% over HEVC are achieved.
