Energy-Efficient Mobile Network I/O

By year 2020, the number of smartphone users globally will reach 3 Billion and the mobile data traffic (cellular + WiFi) will exceed PC Internet traffic the first time. As the number of smartphone users and the amount of data transferred per smartphone grow exponentially, limited battery power is becoming an increasingly critical problem for mobile devices which heavily depend on network I/O. Despite the growing body of research in power management techniques for the mobile devices at the hardware layer as well as the lower layers of the networking stack, there has been little work focusing on saving energy at the application layer for the mobile systems during network I/O. In this paper, we show that significant energy savings can be achieved with application-layer solutions at the mobile systems during data transfer with no performance penalty. In many cases, performance increase and energy savings can be achieved simultaneously.
