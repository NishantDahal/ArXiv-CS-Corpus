Facade Segmentation in the Wild

Urban facade segmentation from automatically acquired imagery, in contrast to traditional image segmentation, poses several unique challenges. 360-degree photospheres captured from vehicles are an effective way to capture a large number of images, but this data presents difficult-to-model warping and stitching artifacts. In addition, each pixel can belong to multiple facade elements, and different facade elements (e.g., window, balcony, sill, etc.) are correlated and vary wildly in their characteristics. In this paper, we propose three network architectures of varying complexity to achieve multilabel semantic segmentation of facade images while exploiting their unique characteristics. Specifically, we propose a MULTIFACSEGNET architecture to assign multiple labels to each pixel, a SEPARABLE architecture as a low-rank formulation that encourages extraction of rectangular elements, and a COMPATIBILITY network that simultaneously seeks segmentation across facade element types allowing the network to 'see' intermediate output probabilities of the various facade element classes. Our results on benchmark datasets show significant improvements over existing facade segmentation approaches for the typical facade elements. For example, on one commonly used dataset, the accuracy scores for window(the most important architectural element) increases from 0.91 to 0.97 percent compared to the best competing method, and comparable improvements on other element types.
