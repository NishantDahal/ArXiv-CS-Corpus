Analysis of Outage Probability of MRC with $η-μ$ co-channel interference

Approximate outage probability expressions are derived for systems employing maximum ratio combining, when both the desired signal and the interfering signals are subjected to $η-μ$ fading, with the interferers having unequal power. The approximations are in terms of the Appell Function and Gauss hypergeometric function. A close match is observed between the outage probability result obtained through the derived analytical expression and the one obtained through Monte-Carlo simulations.
