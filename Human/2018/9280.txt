Bus Trajectory-Based Street-Centric Routing for Message Delivery in Urban Vehicular Ad hoc Networks

This paper focuses on the routing algorithm for the communications between vehicles and places in urban VANET. As one of the basic transportation facilities in an urban setting, buses periodically run along their fixed routes and widely cover city streets. The trajectory of bus lines can be seen as a sub map of a city. Based on the characters of bus networks, we propose a bus trajectory-based street-centric routing algorithm (BTSC), which uses bus as main relay to deliver message. In BTSC, we build a routing graph based on the trajectories of bus lines by analyzing the probability of bus appearing on every street. We propose two novel concepts, i.e. the probability of street consistency (PSC) and the probability of path consistency (PPC) which is used as metrics to determine routing paths for message delivery. This aims to choose the best path with higher density of busses and lower probability of transmission direction deviating from the routing path. In order to improve the bus forwarding opportunity, we design a bus-based forwarding strategy with ant colony optimization (FACO) to find a reliable and steady multi-hop link between two relay buses in order to decrease end-to-end delay. BTSC makes the improvements in the selection of routing path and the strategy of message forwarding. Simulation results show that our proposed routing algorithm has a better performance in transmission ratio, transmission delay and adaptability to different networks.
