3D segmentation of mandible from multisectional CT scans by convolutional neural networks

Segmentation of mandibles in CT scans during virtual surgical planning is crucial for 3D surgical planning in order to obtain a detailed surface representation of the patients bone. Automatic segmentation of mandibles in CT scans is a challenging task due to large variation in their shape and size between individuals. In order to address this challenge we propose a convolutional neural network approach for mandible segmentation in CT scans by considering the continuum of anatomical structures through different planes. The proposed convolutional neural network adopts the architecture of the U-Net and then combines the resulting 2D segmentations from three different planes into a 3D segmentation. We implement such a segmentation approach on 11 neck CT scans and then evaluate the performance. We achieve an average dice coefficient of $ 0.89 $ on two testing mandible segmentation. Experimental results show that our proposed approach for mandible segmentation in CT scans exhibits high accuracy.
