How Local is the Local Diversity? Reinforcing Sequential Determinantal Point Processes with Dynamic Ground Sets for Supervised Video Summarization

The large volume of video content and high viewing frequency demand automatic video summarization algorithms, of which a key property is the capability of modeling diversity. If videos are lengthy like hours-long egocentric videos, it is necessary to track the temporal structures of the videos and enforce local diversity. The local diversity refers to that the shots selected from a short time duration are diverse but visually similar shots are allowed to co-exist in the summary if they appear far apart in the video. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model, built upon SeqDPP, to dynamically control the time span of a video segment upon which the local diversity is imposed. In particular, we enable SeqDPP to learn to automatically infer how local the local diversity is supposed to be from the input video. The resulting model is extremely involved to train by the hallmark maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which further suffers from the exposure bias and non-differentiable evaluation metrics. To tackle these problems, we instead devise a reinforcement learning algorithm for training the proposed model. Extensive experiments verify the advantages of our model and the new learning algorithm over MLE-based methods.
