Unified Receiver Design in Wireless Relay Networks Using Mixed-Integer Programming Techniques

Wireless receiver design is critical to the overall system performance. In this work, we apply the techniques of mixed-integer programming to formulate a unified receiver in relay networks with only partial channel information. We also relax all the constraints into real field to save computations, but at the cost of bit error performance. Moreover, a receiver formulation with adaptive number of constraints is proposed using the cutting plane techniques. Last but not least, number of flops is investigated for different formulations.
