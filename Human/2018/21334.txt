A Spectrum Sharing Solution for the Efficient Use of mmWave Bands in 5G Cellular Scenarios

Regulators all around the world have started identifying the portions of the spectrum that will be used for the next generation of cellular networks. A band in the mmWave spectrum will be exploited to increase the available capacity. In response to the very high expected traffic demand, a sharing mechanism may make it possible to use the spectrum more efficiently. In this work, moving within the European and Italian regulatory conditions, we propose the use of Licensed Spectrum Access (LSA) to coordinate sharing among cellular operators. Additionally, we show some preliminary results on our research activities which are focused on a dynamic spectrum sharing approach applied in simulated 5G cellular scenarios.
