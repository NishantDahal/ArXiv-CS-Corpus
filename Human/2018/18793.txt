Synthetic Sampling for Multi-Class Malignancy Prediction

We explore several oversampling techniques for an imbalanced multi-label classification problem, a setting often encountered when developing models for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems. While most CADx systems aim to optimize classifiers for overall accuracy without considering the relative distribution of each class, we look into using synthetic sampling to increase per-class performance when predicting the degree of malignancy. Using low-level image features and a random forest classifier, we show that using synthetic oversampling techniques increases the sensitivity of the minority classes by an average of 7.22% points, with as much as a 19.88% point increase in sensitivity for a particular minority class. Furthermore, the analysis of low-level image feature distributions for the synthetic nodules reveals that these nodules can provide insights on how to preprocess image data for better classification performance or how to supplement the original datasets when more data acquisition is feasible.
