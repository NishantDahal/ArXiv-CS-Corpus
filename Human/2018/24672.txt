Wideband Hybrid Precoding for Next-Generation Backhaul/Fronthaul Based on mmWave FD-MIMO

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is considered as an indispensable technique for the next-generation backhaul/fronthaul network thanks to its large transmission bandwidth. Especially for heterogeneous network (HetNet), the mmWave full-dimension (FD)-MIMO is exploited to establish the backhaul/fronthaul link between phantom-cell base stations (BSs) and macro-cell BSs, where an efficient precoding is prerequisite. Against this background, this paper proposes a principle component analysis (PCA)-based hybrid precoding for wideband mmWave MIMO backhaul/fronthaul channels. We first propose an optimal hybrid precoder by exploiting principal component analysis (PCA), whereby the optimal high dimensional frequency-selective precoder are projected to the low-dimensional frequency-flat precoder. Moreover, the combiner is designed by leveraging the weighted PCA, where the covariance of received signal is taken into account as weight to the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) fully-digital combiner for further improved performance. Simulations have confirmed that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional schemes in spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error-rate (BER) performance.
