Alien wavelength technique to enhance garr optical network

GARR optical network used to be composed of two separate optical network domains on its national infrastructure. With the aim to integrate these two domains and deliver high performance services all over its infrastructure, we implemented the so called alien wavelength technique, thus improving the overall efficiency of the Italian research and education network in a cost-effective way. This paper describes the activity, results, and our experience in the integration of alien wavelengths in a production environment, with a special emphasis on deployment and operational issues.
