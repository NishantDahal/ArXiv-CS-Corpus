On the Effects of Subpacketization in Content-Centric Mobile Networks

A large-scale content-centric mobile ad hoc network employing subpacketization is studied in which each mobile node having finite-size cache moves according to the reshuffling mobility model and requests a content object from the library independently at random according to the Zipf popularity distribution. Instead of assuming that one content object is transferred in a single time slot, we consider a more challenging scenario where the size of each content object is considerably large and thus only a subpacket of a file can be delivered during one time slot, which is motivated by a fast mobility scenario. Under our mobility model, we consider a single-hop-based content delivery and characterize the fundamental trade-offs between throughput and delay. The order-optimal throughput-delay trade-off is analyzed by presenting the following two content reception strategies: the sequential reception for uncoded caching and the random reception for maximum distance separable (MDS)-coded caching. We also perform numerical evaluation to validate our analytical results. In particular, we conduct performance comparisons between the uncoded caching and the MDS-coded caching strategies by identifying the regimes in which the performance difference between the two caching strategies becomes prominent with respect to system parameters such as the Zipf exponent and the number of subpackets. In addition, we extend our study to the random walk mobility scenario and show that our main results are essentially the same as those in the reshuffling mobility model.
