Analysis Acoustic Features for Acoustic Scene Classification and Score fusion of multi-classification systems applied to DCASE 2016 challenge

This paper describes an acoustic scene classification method which achieved the 4th ranking result in the IEEE AASP challenge of Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events 2016. In order to accomplish the ensuing task, several methods are explored in three aspects: feature extraction, feature transformation, and score fusion for final decision. In the part of feature extraction, several features are investigated for effective acoustic scene classification. For resolving the issue that the same sound can be heard in different places, a feature transformation is applied for better separation for classification. From these, several systems based on different feature sets are devised for classification. The final result is determined by fusing the individual systems. The method is demonstrated and validated by the experiment conducted using the Challenge database.
