BSGD-TV: A parallel algorithm solving total variation constrained image reconstruction problems

We propose a parallel reconstruction algorithm to solve large scale TV constrained linear inverse problems. We provide a convergence proof and show numerically that our method is significantly faster than the main competitor, block ADMM.
