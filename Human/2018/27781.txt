Increasing the Reusability of Enforcers with Lifecycle Events

Runtime enforcement can be effectively used to improve the reliability of software applications. However, it often requires the definition of ad hoc policies and enforcement strategies, which might be expensive to identify and implement. This paper discusses how to exploit lifecycle events to obtain useful enforcement strategies that can be easily reused across applications, thus reducing the cost of adoption of the runtime enforcement technology. The paper finally sketches how this idea can be used to define libraries that can automatically overcome problems related to applications misusing them.
