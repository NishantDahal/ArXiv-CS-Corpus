Automatic Language Identification System for Hindi and Magahi

Language identification has become a prerequisite for all kinds of automated text processing systems. In this paper, we present a rule-based language identifier tool for two closely related Indo-Aryan languages: Hindi and Magahi. This system has currently achieved an accuracy of approx 86.34%. We hope to improve this in the future. Automatic identification of languages will be significant in the accuracy of output of Web Crawlers.
