Hierarchical Bipartite Graph Convolution Networks

Recently, graph neural networks have been adopted in a wide variety of applications ranging from relational representations to modeling irregular data domains such as point clouds and social graphs. However, the space of graph neural network architectures remains highly fragmented impeding the development of optimized implementations similar to what is available for convolutional neural networks. In this work, we present BiGraphNet, a graph neural network architecture that generalizes many popular graph neural network models and enables new efficient operations similar to those supported by ConvNets. By explicitly separating the input and output nodes, BiGraphNet: (i) generalizes the graph convolution to support new efficient operations such as coarsened graph convolutions (similar to strided convolution in convnets), multiple input graphs convolution and graph expansions (unpooling) which can be used to implement various graph architectures such as graph autoencoders, and graph residual nets; and (ii) accelerates and scales the computations and memory requirements in hierarchical networks by performing computations only at specified output nodes.
