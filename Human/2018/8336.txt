A Basic Model of KBS Software

The Euclid 6.2 project MOSES addressed quality issues in the development of military KBS. A contribution to this project was to develop a computational model of KBS that could be used to define and analyze aspects of KBS quality. Since a key characteristic of KBS is search, a computational model based on non-determinism was developed and used to express terms relating to quality. This research report describes the approach.
