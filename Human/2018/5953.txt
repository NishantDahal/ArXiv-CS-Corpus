A Survey on Deep Learning Toolkits and Libraries for Intelligent User Interfaces

This paper provides an overview of prominent deep learning toolkits and, in particular, reports on recent publications that contributed open source software for implementing tasks that are common in intelligent user interfaces (IUI). We provide a scientific reference for researchers and software engineers who plan to utilise deep learning techniques within their IUI research and development projects.
