Expert System for Diagnosis of Chest Diseases Using Neural Networks

This article represents one of the contemporary trends in the application of the latest methods of information and communication technology for medicine through an expert system helps the doctor to diagnose some chest diseases which is important because of the frequent spread of chest diseases nowadays in addition to the overlap symptoms of these diseases, which is difficult to right diagnose by doctors with several algorithms: Forward Chaining, Backward Chaining, Neural Network(Back Propagation). However, this system cannot replace the doctor function, but it can help the doctor to avoid wrong diagnosis and treatments. It can also be developed in such a way to help the novice doctors.
