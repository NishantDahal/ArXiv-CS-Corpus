A decoding algorithm for binary linear codes using Groebner bases

It has been discovered that linear codes may be described by binomial ideals. This makes it possible to study linear codes by commutative algebra and algebraic geometry methods. In this paper, we give a decoding algorithm for binary linear codes by utilizing the Groebner bases of the associated ideals.
