UAV Aided Aerial-Ground IoT for Air Quality Sensing in Smart City: Architecture, Technologies and Implementation

As air pollution is becoming the largest environmental health risk, the monitoring of air quality has drawn much attention in both theoretical studies and practical implementations. In this article, we present a real-time, fine-grained and power-efficient air quality monitoring system based on aerial and ground sensing. The architecture of this system consists of four layers: the sensing layer to collect data, the transmission layer to enable bidirectional communications, the processing layer to analyze and process the data, and the presentation layer to provide graphic interface for users. Three major techniques are investigated in our implementation, given by the data processing, the deployment strategy and the power control. For data processing, spacial fitting and short-term prediction are performed to eliminate the influences of the incomplete measurement and the latency of data uploading. The deployment strategies of ground sensing and aerial sensing are investigated to improve the quality of the collected data. The power control is further considered to balance between power consumption and data accuracy. Our implementation has been deployed in Peking University and Xidian University since February 2018, and has collected about 100 thousand effective data samples by June 2018.
