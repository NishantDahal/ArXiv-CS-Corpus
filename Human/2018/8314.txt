QoS Provisioning in Large Wireless Networks

Quality of service (QoS) provisioning in next-generation mobile communications systems entails a deep understanding of the delay performance. The delay in wireless networks is strongly affected by the traffic arrival process and the service process, which in turn depends on the medium access protocol and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) distribution. In this work, we characterize the conditional distribution of the service process given the point process in Poisson bipolar networks. We then provide an upper bound on the delay violation probability combining tools from stochastic network calculus and stochastic geometry. Furthermore, we analyze the delay performance under statistical queueing constraints using the effective capacity formulation. The impact of QoS requirements, network geometry and link distance on the delay performance is identified. Our results provide useful insights for guaranteeing stringent delay requirements in large wireless networks.
