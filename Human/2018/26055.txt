Exact Camera Location Recovery by Least Unsquared Deviations

We establish exact recovery for the Least Unsquared Deviations (LUD) algorithm of Ozyesil and Singer. More precisely, we show that for sufficiently many cameras with given corrupted pairwise directions, where both camera locations and pairwise directions are generated by a special probabilistic model, the LUD algorithm exactly recovers the camera locations with high probability. A similar exact recovery guarantee was established for the ShapeFit algorithm by Hand, Lee and Voroninski, but with typically less corruption.
