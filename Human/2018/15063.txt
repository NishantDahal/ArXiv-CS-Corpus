Holographic Automata for Ambient Immersive A. I. via Reservoir Computing

We prove the existence of a semilinear representation of Cellular Automata (CA) with the introduction of multiple convolution kernels. Examples of the technique are presented for rules akin to the "edge-of-chaos" including the Turing universal rule 110 for further utilization in the area of reservoir computing. We also examine the significance of their dual representation on a frequency or wavelength domain as a superposition of plane waves for distributed computing applications including a new proposal for a "Hologrid" that could be realized with present Wi-Fi,Li-Fi technologies.
