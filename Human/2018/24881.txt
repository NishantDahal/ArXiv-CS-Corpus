Stochastically Controlled Stochastic Gradient for the Convex and Non-convex Composition problem

In this paper, we consider the convex and non-convex composition problem with the structure $\frac{1}{n}\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^n {{F_i}( {G( x )} )}$, where $G( x )=\frac{1}{n}\sum\nolimits_{j = 1}^n {{G_j}( x )} $ is the inner function, and $F_i(\cdot)$ is the outer function. We explore the variance reduction based method to solve the composition optimization. Due to the fact that when the number of inner function and outer function are large, it is not reasonable to estimate them directly, thus we apply the stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) method to estimate the gradient of the composition function and the value of the inner function. The query complexity of our proposed method for the convex and non-convex problem is equal to or better than the current method for the composition problem. Furthermore, we also present the mini-batch version of the proposed method, which has the improved the query complexity with related to the size of the mini-batch.
