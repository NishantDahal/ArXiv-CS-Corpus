Robust Edge-Preserved Surface Mesh Polycube Deformation

The problem of polycube construction or deformation is an essential problem in computer graphics. In this paper, we present a robust, simple, efficient and automatic algorithm to deform the meshes of arbitrary shapes into their polycube ones. We derive a clear relationship between a mesh and its corresponding polycube shape. Our algorithm is edge-preserved, and works on surface meshes with or without boundaries. Our algorithm outperforms previous ones in speed, robustness, efficiency. Our method is simple to implement. To demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method, we apply it to hundreds of models of varying complexity and topology. We demonstrat that our method compares favorably to other state-of-the-art polycube deformation methods.
