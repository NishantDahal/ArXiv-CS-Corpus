Study of Unique-Word Based GFDM Transmission Systems

In this paper, we propose the use of a deterministic sequence, known as unique word (UW), instead of the cyclic prefix (CP) in generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) systems. The UW consists of known sequences that, if not null, can be used advantageously for synchronization and channel estimation purposes. In addition, UW allows the application of a highly efficient linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) smoother for noise reduction at the receiver. To avoid the conditions of non-orthogonality caused by the insertion of the UW and performance degradation in time varying frequency-selective channels, we use frequency-shift offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FS-OQAM). We present a signal model of a UW-GFDM system considering a single and multiple UWs. We then develop an LMMSE receive filter for signal reception of the proposed UW-GFDM system. Simulations show that the proposed UW-GFDM system outperforms prior work.
