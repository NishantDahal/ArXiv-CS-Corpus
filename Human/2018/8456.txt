Scheduling Intelligent System for Time Shortening

The paper presents a scheduling intelligent system intended for the project management and for the operation management as well, having integrated a planner time buffer method combined with the PERT (Programme Evaluation and Review Technique) method which can drastically short the planned time. The system also adjusts if necessary the duration for the un-expecting situations during the evolution of the planner recalculating the probability to reach the deadline. The system is developed with a friendly graphical interface, which guide the user during the progress of the project providing warnings and suggestions for adjusting in real time the planner. Once the scheduling intelligent system is launched in progress, its functions are combined at the different levels, depending of the user needs. The base functions of the system are: planning, diagnosis, supervising and forecast. A real implementation is showed as a study case, is related to a software development planner.
