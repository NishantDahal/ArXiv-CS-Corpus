Optimizing MDS Coded Caching in Wireless Networks with Device-to-Device Communication

We consider the caching of content in the mobile devices in a dense wireless network using maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. We focus on an area, served by a base station (BS), where mobile devices move around according to a random mobility model. Users requesting a particular file download coded packets from caching devices within a communication range, using device-to-device communication. If additional packets are required to decode the file, these are downloaded from the BS. We analyze the device mobility and derive a good approximation of the distribution of caching devices within the communication range of mobile devices at any given time. We then optimize the MDS codes to minimize the network load under a cache size constraint and show that using optimized MDS codes results in significantly lower network load compared to when caching the most popular files. We further show numerically that caching coded packets of each file on all mobile devices, i.e., maximal spreading, is optimal.
