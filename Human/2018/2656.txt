Segmentation of Bleeding Regions in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Images an Approach for inside Capsule Video Summarization

Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is an effective means of diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Detection of informative scenes by WCE could reduce the length of transmitted videos and can help with the diagnosis. In this paper we propose a simple and efficient method for segmentation of the bleeding regions in WCE captured images. Suitable color channels are selected and classified by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure. The MLP structure is quantized such that the implementation does not require multiplications. The proposed method is tested by simulation on WCE bleeding image dataset. The proposed structure is designed considering hardware resource constrains that exist in WCE systems.
