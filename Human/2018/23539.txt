Correlation Clustering Generalized

We present new results for LambdaCC and MotifCC, two recently introduced variants of the well-studied correlation clustering problem. Both variants are motivated by applications to network analysis and community detection, and have non-trivial approximation algorithms. We first show that the standard linear programming relaxation of LambdaCC has a $Θ(\log n)$ integrality gap for a certain choice of the parameter $λ$. This sheds light on previous challenges encountered in obtaining parameter-independent approximation results for LambdaCC. We generalize a previous constant-factor algorithm to provide the best results, from the LP-rounding approach, for an extended range of $λ$. MotifCC generalizes correlation clustering to the hypergraph setting. In the case of hyperedges of degree $3$ with weights satisfying probability constraints, we improve the best approximation factor from $9$ to $8$. We show that in general our algorithm gives a $4(k-1)$ approximation when hyperedges have maximum degree $k$ and probability weights. We additionally present approximation results for LambdaCC and MotifCC where we restrict to forming only two clusters.
