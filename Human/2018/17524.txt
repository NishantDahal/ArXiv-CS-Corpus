A 36-Element Solution To Schneiders' Pyramid Hex-Meshing Problem And A Parity-Changing Template For Hex-Mesh Revision

In this paper, we present a solution that uses the least number of hexahedra to build a pyramid, which is the key block required for one type of automatic hex-meshing method to be successful. When the initial result of a hex-meshing program is not appropriate for specific applications, some templates are used for revision. The templates reported thus far are parity-preserving, which means that the parity of the number of hexahedra in a mesh is unchanged after a revision following the templates. We present a parity-changing template that makes the template set integral and more effective. These two findings are obtained by a program that we developed for this study, which is a tool for researchers to observe the characteristics of small hexahedral packings.
