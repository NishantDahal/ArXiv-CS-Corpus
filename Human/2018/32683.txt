A note on the efficiency of position mechanisms with budget constraints

We study the social efficiency of several well-known mechanisms for the allocation of a set of available (advertising) positions to a set of competing budget-constrained users (advertisers). Specifically, we focus on the Generalized Second Price auction (GSP), the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism (VCG) and the Expressive Generalized First Price auction (EGFP). Using the liquid welfare as our efficiency benchmark, we prove a tight bound of 2 on the liquid price of anarchy and stability of these mechanisms for pure Nash equilibria.
