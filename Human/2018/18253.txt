Concept-Based Embeddings for Natural Language Processing

In this work, we focus on effectively leveraging and integrating information from concept-level as well as word-level via projecting concepts and words into a lower dimensional space while retaining most critical semantics. In a broad context of opinion understanding system, we investigate the use of the fused embedding for several core NLP tasks: named entity detection and classification, automatic speech recognition reranking, and targeted sentiment analysis.
