Representations of quadratic combinatorial optimization problems: A case study using the quadratic set covering problem

The objective function of a quadratic combinatorial optimization problem (QCOP) can be represented by two data points, a quadratic cost matrix Q and a linear cost vector c. Different, but equivalent, representations of the pair (Q, c) for the same QCOP are well known in literature. Research papers often state that without loss of generality we assume Q is symmetric, or upper-triangular or positive semidefinite, etc. These representations however have inherently different properties. Popular general purpose 0-1 QCOP solvers such as GUROBI and CPLEX do not suggest a preferred representation of Q and c. Our experimental analysis discloses that GUROBI prefers the upper triangular representation of the matrix Q while CPLEX prefers the symmetric representation in a statistically significant manner. Equivalent representations, although preserve optimality, they could alter the corresponding lower bound values obtained by various lower bounding schemes. For the natural lower bound of a QCOP, symmetric representation produced tighter bounds, in general. Effect of equivalent representations when CPLEX and GUROBI run in a heuristic mode are also explored. Further, we review various equivalent representations of a QCOP from the literature that have theoretical basis to be viewed as strong and provide new theoretical insights for generating such equivalent representations making use of constant value property and diagonalization (linearization) of QCOP instances.
