Exploring Server-side Blocking of Regions

One of the Internet's greatest strengths is the degree to which it facilitates access to any of its resources from users anywhere in the world. However, users in the developing world have complained of websites blocking their countries. We explore this phenomenon using a measurement study. With a combination of automated page loads, manual checking, and traceroutes, we can say, with high confidence, that some websites do block users from some regions. We cannot say, with high confidence, why, or even based on what criteria, they do so except for in some cases where the website states a reason. We do report qualitative evidence that fears of abuse and the costs of serving requests to some regions may play a role.
