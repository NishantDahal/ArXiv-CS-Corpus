Designing a blended learning of system programming for software engineering bachelors

The research objective is to design a blended learning of system programming for software engineering bachelors. Under blended learning we understand the way of implementing the content of the training, which integrates classroom and non-auditing learning activities provided that a pedagogically balanced combination of traditional, distance and mobile learning technologies. Modern approaches to the design and implementation of training systems are considered. The studying purposes of system programming for software engineering bachelors are determined. The complex of practical tasks from the course is developed. The methods of training that will be used when studying individual thematic sections of system programming are determined. A plan for studying each thematic section has been developed: The organizational model of the student's work during the study of the discipline "System programming" with the use of the blended learning management system is proposed.
