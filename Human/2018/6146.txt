Optimum Linear Codes with Support Constraints over Small Fields

We consider the problem of designing optimal linear codes (in terms of having the largest minimum distance) subject to a support constraint on the generator matrix. We show that the largest minimum distance can be achieved by a subcode of a Reed-Solomon code of small field size. As a by-product of this result, we settle the GM-MDS conjecture of Dau et. al. in the affirmative.
