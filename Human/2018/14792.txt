A Tour Of The Student's E-Learning Puddle

E-learning has revolutionized our realm in more than just a listable number of ways. But it took a paradigm shift when it entered the threshold of the varsity system. With the prevailing spoon-feeding era, are the students really industry ready? We answer that by confirming a fact: web-based learning has become the oxygen of freshers in the IT Industry instead of the traditional learning done through graduation. Furthermore, are university enforced e-learning assessment systems a true representation of a student's proficiency? This paper is a peep into what web-based e-learning systems are to a student of today's world, by giving an overview of university-level e-learning in India deploying an example from SRM University's organizational framework. It assesses a key e-learning trend, the implementation of which bridges the gap between universities and the industry. It is proposed to provide constructive feedback to the e-learning community and shine some light on areas of scope for future developments.
