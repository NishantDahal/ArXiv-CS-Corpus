Secrecy and Robustness for Active Attack in Secure Network Coding and its Application to Network Quantum Key Distribution

In network coding, we discuss the effect of sequential error injection on information leakage. We show that there is no improvement when the operations in the network are linear operations. However, when the operations in the network contains non-linear operations, we find a counterexample to improve Eve's obtained information. Furthermore, we discuss the asymptotic rate in a linear network under the secrecy and robustness conditions as well as under the secrecy condition alone. Finally, we apply our results to network quantum key distribution, which clarifies the type of network that enables us to realize secure long distance communication via short distance quantum key distribution.
