Why Interpretability in Machine Learning? An Answer Using Distributed Detection and Data Fusion Theory

As artificial intelligence is increasingly affecting all parts of society and life, there is growing recognition that human interpretability of machine learning models is important. It is often argued that accuracy or other similar generalization performance metrics must be sacrificed in order to gain interpretability. Such arguments, however, fail to acknowledge that the overall decision-making system is composed of two entities: the learned model and a human who fuses together model outputs with his or her own information. As such, the relevant performance criteria should be for the entire system, not just for the machine learning component. In this work, we characterize the performance of such two-node tandem data fusion systems using the theory of distributed detection. In doing so, we work in the population setting and model interpretable learned models as multi-level quantizers. We prove that under our abstraction, the overall system of a human with an interpretable classifier outperforms one with a black box classifier.
