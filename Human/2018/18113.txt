Phase Retrieval for Signals in Union of Subspaces

We consider the phase retrieval problem for signals that belong to a union of subspaces. We assume that amplitude measurements of the signal of length $n$ are observed after passing it through a random $m \times n$ measurement matrix. We also assume that the signal belongs to the span of a single $d$-dimensional subspace out of $R$ subspaces, where $d\ll n$. We assume the knowledge of all possible subspaces, but the true subspace of the signal is unknown. We present an algorithm that jointly estimates the phase of the measurements and the subspace support of the signal. We discuss theoretical guarantees on the recovery of signals and present simulation results to demonstrate the empirical performance of our proposed algorithm. Our main result suggests that if properly initialized, then $O(d+\log R)$ random measurements are sufficient for phase retrieval if the unknown signal belongs to the union of $R$ low-dimensional subspaces.
