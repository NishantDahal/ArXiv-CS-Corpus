Exposing A Customizable, Decentralized Cryptoeconomy as a Data Type

Purposely modular, this protocol enables customization of several protocol properties, including the consensus properties implemented, blockchain type, the roots used, and virtual machine opcodes, among others. These modules enable implementing parties to control the behavior of their economy, with a minimal amount of effort, and no sacrifice in participant cryptoeconomic quality. This work also demonstrates the simplification of the developer experience by abstracting away all technological details, except basic CRUD-based operations, using various programming languages. We demonstrate the mechanism design approach taken, and formalize a process for deploying populations of blockchain economies at scale. The framework shown includes adequate tooling for simulation, development, deployment, maintenance, and analytic-based decision making. Lastly, we introduce an expressive programming language for the purpose of creating, and interacting with the cryptoeconomy designed by the implementing developer.
