Staging Human-computer Dialogs: An Application of the Futamura Projections

We demonstrate an application of the Futamura Projections to human-computer interaction, and particularly to staging human-computer dialogs. Specifically, by providing staging analogs to the classical Futamura Projections, we demonstrate that the Futamura Projections can be applied to the staging of human-computer dialogs in addition to the execution of programs.
