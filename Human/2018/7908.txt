The Creation Phase in Network Slicing: From a Service Order to an Operative Network Slice

Network slicing is considered a key mechanism to serve the multitude of tenants (e.g. vertical industries) targeted by forthcoming 5G systems in a flexible and cost-efficient manner. In this paper, we present a SDN/NFV architecture with multi-tenancy support. This architecture enables a network slice provider to deploy network slice instances for multiple tenants on-the-fly, and simultaneously provision them with isolation guarantees. Following the Network Slice as-a-Service delivery model, a tenant may access a Service Catalog, selecting the slice that best fits its needs and ordering its deployment. This work provides a detailed view on the stages that a network slice provider must follow to deploy the ordered network slice instance, accommodating it into a multi-domain infrastructure, and putting it operative for tenant's consumption. These stages address critical issues identified in the literature, including (i) the mapping from high-level service requirements to network functions and infrastructure requirements, (ii) the admission control, and (iii) the specific information a network slice descriptor should have. With the proposed architecture and the recommended set of stages, network slice providers can deploy (and later operate) slice instances with great agility, flexibility, and full automation.
