Teaching DevOps in Corporate Environments: An experience report

This paper describes our experience of training a team of developers of an East-European phone service provider. The training experience was structured in two sessions of two days each conducted in different weeks with a gap of about fifteen days. The first session was dedicated to the Continuous Integration Delivery Pipeline, and the second on Agile methods. We summarize the activity, its preparation and delivery and draw some conclusions out of it on our mistakes and how future session should be addressed.
