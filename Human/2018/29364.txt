Recent Advances in Information-Centric Networking based Internet of Things (ICN-IoT)

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is being realized as a promising approach to accomplish the shortcomings of current IP-address based networking. ICN models are based on naming the content to get rid of address-space scarcity, accessing the content via name-based-routing, caching the content at intermediate nodes to provide reliable, efficient data delivery and self-certifying contents to ensure better security. Obvious benefits of ICN in terms of fast and efficient data delivery and improved reliability raises ICN as highly promising networking model for Internet of Things (IoTs) like environments. IoT aims to connect anyone and/or anything at any time by any path on any place. From last decade, IoTs attracts both industry and research communities. IoTs is an emerging research field and still in its infancy. Thus, this paper presents the potential of ICN for IoTs by providing state-of-the-art literature survey. We discuss briefly the feasibility of ICN features and their models (and architectures) in the context of IoT. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive survey on ICN based caching, naming, security and mobility approaches for IoTs with appropriate classification. Furthermore, we present operating systems (OS) and simulation tools for ICNIoT. Finally, we provide important research challenges and issues faced by ICN for IoTs.
