Co-evolution and morphogenetic systems

The emerging field of morphogenetic engineering proposes to design complex heterogeneous system focused on the paradigm of emergence. Necessarily at the interface of disciplines, its concepts can be defined through multiple viewpoints. This contribution aims at linking a co-evolutionary perspective on such systems with morphogenesis, and therein at bringing a novel conceptual approach to the bottom-up design of complex systems which allows to fully consider co-evolutive processes. We first situate systems of interest at the interface between biological and social systems, and introduce a multidisciplinary perspective on co-evolution. Building on Holland's signals and boundaries theory of complex adaptive systems, we finally suggest that morphogenetic systems are equivalent to combinations of co-evolutionary niches. This introduces an entry to morphogenetic engineering focused on co-evolution between components of a system. Applications can be found in a broad range of subjects, which we illustrate with the example of planning in territorial systems, suggesting an extended scope for the relevance of morphogenetic engineering concepts.
