Vehicle Platooning Simulations with Functional Reactive Programming

Functional languages have provided major benefits to the verification community. Although features such as purity, a strong type system, and computational abstractions can help guide programmers away from costly errors, these can present challenges when used in a reactive system. Functional Reactive Programming is a paradigm that allows users the benefits of functional languages and an easy interface to a reactive environment. We present a tool for building autonomous vehicle controllers in FRP using Haskell.
