Modeling Personalized Dynamics of Social Network and Opinion at Individual Level

Network dynamics has always been a meaningful topic deserving exploration in the realm of academy. previous network models contain two parts: (1) generating structure as per user property; (2) changing property as per network structure. Properties in these models, however, cannot be interpreted to concept in prevalent social theories or empirical truth. Also, they usually treat everyone in an uniform fashion. While such assumption is quite misguiding, and thus saliently limits their performance. To overcome these flaws, we devise a personalized evolving model for social network and opinion (PENO), where citizens' ideology is revealed by variable opinions and four dimensions of personality are considered for each entity - leadership, openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Opinion propagates via social tie, tie generates from opinion affinity, and personalities integrally work with opinion and tie across evolution. To our best knowledge, PENO is the first attempt to introduce personality impact in network dynamics and verify social science with reasonable visualization during simulation. We also present its probabilistic graph and conceive iterative learning algorithm. Experiments show PENO outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines over two typical prediction tasks - congress voting prediction for legislative bills and friendship prediction on a book-commenting website. Finally, we discuss its scalability to do multi-task learning and transfer learning in daily scenarios.
