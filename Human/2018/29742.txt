Hand Gesture Detection and Conversion to Speech and Text

The hand gestures are one of the typical methods used in sign language. It is very difficult for the hearing-impaired people to communicate with the world. This project presents a solution that will not only automatically recognize the hand gestures but will also convert it into speech and text output so that impaired person can easily communicate with normal people. A camera attached to computer will capture images of hand and the contour feature extraction is used to recognize the hand gestures of the person. Based on the recognized gestures, the recorded soundtrack will be played.
