Reasoning about multiple aspects in DLs: Semantics and Closure Construction

Starting from the observation that rational closure has the undesirable property of being an "all or nothing" mechanism, we here propose a multipreferential semantics, which enriches the preferential semantics underlying rational closure in order to separately deal with the inheritance of different properties in an ontology with exceptions. We provide a multipreference closure mechanism which is sound with respect to the multipreference semantics.
