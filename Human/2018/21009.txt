zoNNscan : a boundary-entropy index for zone inspection of neural models

The training of deep neural network classifiers results in decision boundaries which geometry is still not well understood. This is in direct relation with classification problems such as so called adversarial examples. We introduce zoNNscan, an index that is intended to inform on the boundary uncertainty (in terms of the presence of other classes) around one given input datapoint. It is based on confidence entropy, and is implemented through sampling in the multidimensional ball surrounding that input. We detail the zoNNscan index, give an algorithm for approximating it, and finally illustrate its benefits on four applications, including two important problems for the adoption of deep networks in critical systems: adversarial examples and corner case inputs. We highlight that zoNNscan exhibits significantly higher values than for standard inputs in those two problem classes.
