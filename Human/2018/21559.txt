Technology utilization patterns and business growth in Small/Medium Enterprises

Technology was created to support and grow Business. Modern business that uses technology efficiently, grows at a phenomenal rate (Statista.com, 2018). The assumption therefore is that businesses that utilize insufficient technology, or use technology inefficiently, experience reduced growth and possibly, business decline.
  Technological development holds great significance in most industries particularly in wastage reduction, process optimization and consequently bottom-line revenue enhancement and price-leadership. We've seen revolutionary technological development during the 20th century / 21st century thus far, (Ivanovic et al, 2015) and it's led to drastic growth in fields like communication, computer science, monitoring of operations, remote working, high performance analytics and many more. Some fields have even come into existence purely due to technology.
  Technological equipment cannot compensate for the skills, knowledge or creativity of human employees. However, expertise of the average employee can be greatly enhanced using intelligent software. Use of such equipment decreases the need for unskilled and semi-skilled workers - but can exponentially increase speed of performance for skilled workers. Innovations are key defining criteria for competitive differentiation - but some of these can be easily copied, which basically means that innovation and improvement are continuous processes. Process standardization comes through in a big way when technological solutions are applied in the work. It regulates/optimizes the number of employees needed, power consumption, potentially reduces wastage, drastically improves hygiene process (where relevant). The natural outcome is greater process efficiency and cost efficiency.
