Como funciona o Deep Learning

Deep Learning methods are currently the state-of-the-art in many problems which can be tackled via machine learning, in particular classification problems. However there is still lack of understanding on how those methods work, why they work and what are the limitations involved in using them. In this chapter we will describe in detail the transition from shallow to deep networks, include examples of code on how to implement them, as well as the main issues one faces when training a deep network. Afterwards, we introduce some theoretical background behind the use of deep models, and discuss their limitations.
