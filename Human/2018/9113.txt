Toward Formalizing Teleportation of Pedagogical Artificial Agents

Our paradigm for the use of artificial agents to teach requires among other things that they persist through time in their interaction with human students, in such a way that they "teleport" or "migrate" from an embodiment at one time t to a different embodiment at later time t'. In this short paper, we report on initial steps toward the formalization of such teleportation, in order to enable an overseeing AI system to establish, mechanically, and verifiably, that the human students in question will likely believe that the very same artificial agent has persisted across such times despite the different embodiments.
