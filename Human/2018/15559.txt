Anchored in a Data Storm: How Anchoring Bias Can Affect User Strategy, Confidence, and Decisions in Visual Analytics

Cognitive biases have been shown to lead to faulty decision-making. Recent research has demonstrated that the effect of cognitive biases, anchoring bias in particular, transfers to information visualization and visual analytics. However, it is still unclear how users of visual interfaces can be anchored and the impact of anchoring on user performance and decision-making process. To investigate, we performed two rounds of between-subjects, in-laboratory experiments with 94 participants to analyze the effect of visual anchors and strategy cues in decision-making with a visual analytic system that employs coordinated multiple view design. The decision-making task is identifying misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned one of three treatment groups (including control) in which participant training processes were modified. Our findings reveal that strategy cues and visual anchors (scenario videos) can significantly affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy. We discuss the implications of our experiment results on training users how to use a newly developed visual interface. We call for more careful consideration into how visualization designers and researchers train users to avoid unintentionally anchoring users and thus affecting the end result.
