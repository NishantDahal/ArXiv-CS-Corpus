Smart Routing for Improved PLC Backhauling of the Radio Access Network

Transmission line theory enables the bottom up study of networks based on wireline infrastructures. This technique is here applied to a simulator that brings together powerline communication networks with small radio cells ones in a hybrid paradigm: this allows to implement a study of channel capacity and communication quality based on the geometrical properties of the network and the type of cables employed to enable connectivity. Results are shown regarding how deterministic properties related to performance in the network can be retrieved and used to enable a smart routing algorithm.
