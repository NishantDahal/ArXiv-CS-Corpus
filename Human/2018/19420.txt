Analysis of the Veracities of Industry Used Software Development Life Cycle Methodologies

Currently, software industries are using different SDLC (software development life cycle) models which are designed for specific purposes. The use of technology is booming in every perspective of life and the software behind the technology plays an enormous role. As the technical complexities are increasing, successful development of software solely depends on the proper management of development processes. So, it is inevitable to introduce improved methodologies in the industry so that modern human centred software applications development can be managed and delivered to the user successfully. So, in this paper, we have explored the facts of different SDLC models and perform their comparative analysis.
