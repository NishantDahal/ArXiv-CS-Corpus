Improved Detection Strategies for Nonlinear Frequency-Division Multiplexing

Two novel detection strategies for nonlinear Fourier transform-based transmission schemes are proposed. We show, through numerical simulations, that both strategies achieve a good performance improvement (up to 3 dB and 5 dB) with respect to conventional detection, respectively without or only moderately increasing the computational complexity of the receiver.
