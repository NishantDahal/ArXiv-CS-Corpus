Arithmetic Word Problem Solver using Frame Identification

Automatic Word problem solving has always posed a great challenge for the NLP community. Usually a word problem is a narrative comprising of a few sentences and a question is asked about a quantity referred in the sentences. Solving word problem involves reasoning across sentences, identification of operations, their order, relevant quantities and discarding irrelevant quantities. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatic arithmetic word problem solving. Our approach starts with frame identification. Each frame can either be classified as a state or an action frame. The frame identification is dependent on the verb in a sentence. Every frame is unique and is identified by its slots. The slots are filled using dependency parsed output of a sentence. The slots are entity holder, entity, quantity of the entity, recipient, additional information like place, time. The slots and frames helps to identify the type of question asked and the entity referred. Action frames act on state frame(s) which causes a change in quantities of the state frames. The frames are then used to build a graph where any change in quantities can be propagated to the neighboring nodes. Most of the current solvers can only answer questions related to the quantity, while our system can answer different kinds of questions like `who', `what' other than the quantity related questions `how many'.
  There are three major contributions of this paper. 1. Frame Annotated Corpus (with a frame annotation tool) 2. Frame Identification Module 3. A new easily understandable Framework for word problem solving
