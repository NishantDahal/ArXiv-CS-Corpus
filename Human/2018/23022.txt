Separable Codes for the Symmetric Multiple-Access Channel

A binary matrix is called an s-separable code for the disjunctive multiple-access channel (disj-MAC) if Boolean sums of sets of s columns are all distinct. The well-known issue of the combinatorial coding theory is to obtain upper and lower bounds on the rate of s-separable codes for disj-MAC. In our paper, we generalize the problem and discuss upper and lower bounds on the rate of q-ary s-separable codes for models of noiseless symmetric MAC, i.e., when at each time instant the output signal of MAC is a symmetric function of its s input signals.
