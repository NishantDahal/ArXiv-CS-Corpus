A simple expression for the map of Asplund's distances with the multiplicative Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) law

We introduce a simple expression for the map of Asplund's distances with the multiplicative Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP) law. It is a difference between a morphological dilation and a morphological erosion with an additive structuring function which corresponds to a morphological gradient.
