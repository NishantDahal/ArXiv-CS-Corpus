On Robustness of Massive MIMO Systems Against Passive Eavesdropping under Antenna Selection

In massive MIMO wiretap settings, the base station can significantly suppress eavesdroppers by narrow beamforming toward legitimate terminals. Numerical investigations show that by this approach, secrecy is obtained at no significant cost. We call this property of massive MIMO systems `secrecy for free' and show that it not only holds when all the transmit antennas at the base station are employed, but also when only a single antenna is set active. Using linear precoding, the information leakage to the eavesdroppers can be sufficiently diminished, when the total number of available transmit antennas at the base station grows large, even when only a fixed number of them are selected. This result indicates that passive eavesdropping has no significant impact on massive MIMO systems, regardless of the number of active transmit antennas.
