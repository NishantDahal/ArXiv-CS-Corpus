Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images based on MSB Prediction and Huffman Coding

With the development of cloud storage and privacy protection, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) has attracted increasing attention as a technology that can embed additional data in the encryption domain. In general, an RDHEI method embeds secret data in an encrypted image while ensuring that the embedded data can be extracted error-free and the original image can be restored lossless. In this paper, A high-capacity RDHEI algorithm is proposed. At first, the Most Significant Bits (MSB) of each pixel was predicted adaptively and marked by Huffman coding in the original image. Then, the image was encrypted by a stream cipher method. At last, the vacated space can be used to embed additional data. Experimental results show that our method achieved higher embedding capacity while comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.
