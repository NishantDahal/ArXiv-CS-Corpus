An Affordable Bio-Sensing and Activity Tagging Platform for HCI Research

We present a novel multi-modal bio-sensing platform capable of integrating multiple data streams for use in real-time applications. The system is composed of a central compute module and a companion headset. The compute node collects, time-stamps and transmits the data while also providing an interface for a wide range of sensors including electroencephalogram, photoplethysmogram, electrocardiogram, and eye gaze among others. The companion headset contains the gaze tracking cameras. By integrating many of the measurements systems into an accessible package, we are able to explore previously unanswerable questions ranging from open-environment interactions to emotional response studies. Though some of the integrated sensors are designed from the ground-up to fit into a compact form factor, we validate the accuracy of the sensors and find that they perform similarly to, and in some cases better than, alternatives.
