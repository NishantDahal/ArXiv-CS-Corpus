On randomized generation of slowly synchronizing automata

Motivated by the randomized generation of slowly synchronizing automata, we study automata made of permutation letters and a merging letter of rank $ n\!-\!1 $. We present a constructive randomized procedure to generate synchronizing automata of that kind with (potentially) large alphabet size based on recent results on \textit{primitive} sets of matrices. We report numerical results showing that our algorithm finds automata with much larger reset threshold than a mere uniform random generation and we present new families of automata with reset threshold of $ Î©(n^2/4) $. We finally report theoretical results on randomized generation of primitive sets of matrices: a set of permutation matrices with a $ 0 $ entry changed into a $ 1 $ is primitive and has exponent of $ O(n\log n) $ with high probability in case of uniform random distribution and the same holds for a random set of binary matrices where each entry is set, independently, equal to $ 1 $ with probability $ p $ and equal to $ 0 $ with probability $ 1-p $, when $ np-\log n\rightarrow\infty $ as $ n\rightarrow\infty $.
