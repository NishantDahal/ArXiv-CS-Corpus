Discovering Markov Blanket from Multiple interventional Datasets

In this paper, we study the problem of discovering the Markov blanket (MB) of a target variable from multiple interventional datasets. Datasets attained from interventional experiments contain richer causal information than passively observed data (observational data) for MB discovery. However, almost all existing MB discovery methods are designed for finding MBs from a single observational dataset. To identify MBs from multiple interventional datasets, we face two challenges: (1) unknown intervention variables; (2) nonidentical data distributions. To tackle the challenges, we theoretically analyze (a) under what conditions we can find the correct MB of a target variable, and (b) under what conditions we can identify the causes of the target variable via discovering its MB. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose a new algorithm for discovering MBs from multiple interventional datasets, and present the conditions/assumptions which assure the correctness of the algorithm. To our knowledge, this work is the first to present the theoretical analyses about the conditions for MB discovery in multiple interventional datasets and the algorithm to find the MBs in relation to the conditions. Using benchmark Bayesian networks and real-world datasets, the experiments have validated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the paper.
