Criteria for the CloudSim Environment

CPU is undoubtedly the most important resource of the computer system. Recent advances in software and system architecture have increased processing complexity, as computing is now distributed and parallel. CloudSim represents the complexity of an application in terms of its computational requirements. CloudSim [9] is a complete solution for simulating Cloud Computing environments and building test beds for provisioning algorithms. This paper analyzes and evaluates the performance of cloud environment modeling using CloudSim. We describe the CloudSim architecture and then investigate the new models and techniques in CloudSim.
