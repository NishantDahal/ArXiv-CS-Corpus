Image Segmentation Based on Multiscale Fast Spectral Clustering

In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular clustering algorithms for image segmentation. However, it has restricted applicability to large-scale images due to its high computational complexity. In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm called Fast Spectral Clustering based on quad-tree decomposition. The algorithm focuses on the spectral clustering at superpixel level and its computational complexity is O(nlogn) + O(m) + O(m^(3/2)); its memory cost is O(m), where n and m are the numbers of pixels and the superpixels of a image. Then we propose Multiscale Fast Spectral Clustering by improving Fast Spectral Clustering, which is based on the hierarchical structure of the quad-tree. The computational complexity of Multiscale Fast Spectral Clustering is O(nlogn) and its memory cost is O(m). Extensive experiments on real large-scale images demonstrate that Multiscale Fast Spectral Clustering outperforms Normalized cut in terms of lower computational complexity and memory cost, with comparable clustering accuracy.
