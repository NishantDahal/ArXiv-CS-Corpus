Sufficient Conditions for the Tightness of Shannon's Capacity Bounds for Two-Way Channels

New sufficient conditions for determining in closed form the capacity region of point-to-point memoryless two-way channels (TWCs) are derived. The proposed conditions not only relax Shannon's condition which can identify only TWCs with a certain symmetry property but also generalize other existing results. Examples are given to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed conditions.
