Energy-aware virtual machine selection method for cloud data center resource allocation

Saving energy is an important issue for cloud providers to reduce energy cost in a data center. With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, it is time to examine various energy reduction methods for which energy consumption could be reduced and lead us to green cloud computing. In this paper, our aim is to propose a virtual machine selection algorithm to improve the energy efficiency of a cloud data center. We are also presenting experimental results of the proposed algorithm in a cloud computing based simulation environment. The proposed algorithm dynamically took the virtual machines' allocation, deallocation, and reallocation action to the physical server. However, it depends on the load and heuristics based on the analysis placement of a virtual machine which is decided over time. From the results obtained from the simulation, we have found that our proposed virtual machine selection algorithm reduces the total energy consumption by 19% compared to the existing one. Therefore, the energy consumption cost of a cloud data center reduces and also lowers the carbon footprint. Simulation-based experimental results show that the proposed heuristics which are based on resource provisioning algorithms reduce the energy consumption of the cloud data center and decrease the virtual machine's migration rate.
