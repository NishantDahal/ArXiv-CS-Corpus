Agile Behaviour Design: A Design Approach for Structuring Game Characters and Interactions

In this paper, a novel design methodology-Agile Behaviour Design-is presented that accommodates the requirements for developing complex game agents suitable for industrial environments. An essential part of the design approach is to support independent work of both designers and programmers by reducing bottleneck situations. The approach fosters the creation of more loose and fluid interactions between design and implementation, leaving more freedom for creative expression.
