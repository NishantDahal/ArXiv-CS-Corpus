Time-Series Prediction of Proximal Aggression Onset in Minimally-Verbal Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Physiological Biosignals

It has been suggested that changes in physiological arousal precede potentially dangerous aggressive behavior in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are minimally verbal (MV-ASD). The current work tests this hypothesis through time-series analyses on biosignals acquired prior to proximal aggression onset. We implement ridge-regularized logistic regression models on physiological biosensor data wirelessly recorded from 15 MV-ASD youth over 64 independent naturalistic observations in a hospital inpatient unit. Our results demonstrate proof-of-concept, feasibility, and incipient validity predicting aggression onset 1 minute before it occurs using global, person-dependent, and hybrid classifier models.
