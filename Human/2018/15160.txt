Novel Architecture of Pipeline Radix 2 power of 2 SDF FFT Based on Digit-Slicing Technique

The prevalent need for very high-speed digital signals processing in wireless communications has driven the communications system to high-performance levels. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel structure for efficient implementation for the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor to meet the requirement for high-speed wireless communication system standards. Based on the algorithm, architecture analysis, the design of pipeline Radix 2power of 2 SDF FFT processor based on digit-slicing Multiplier-Less is proposed. Furthermore, this paper proposed an optimal constant multiplication arithmetic design to multiply a fixed point input selectively by one of the several present twiddle factor constants. The proposed architecture was simulated using MATLAB software and the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Virtex 4 was targeted to synthesis the proposed architecture. The design was tested in real hardware of TLA5201 logic analyzer and the ISE synthesis report results the high speed of 669.277 MHz with the total equivalent gate count of 14,854. Meanwhile, It can be found as significant improvement over Radix 22 DIF SDF FFT processor and can be concluded that the proposed pipeline Radix 22 DIF SDF FFT processor based on digit-slicing multiplier-less is an enable in solving problems that affect the most high-speed wireless communication systems capability in FFT and possesses huge potentials for future related works and research areas.
