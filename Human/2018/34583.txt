Utility based Joint Uplink Downlink Optimization Energy Harvesting enabled Hybrid RF/VLC system

Hybrid Radio Frequency/ Visible Light Communication (RF/VLC) systems have been recognized as effective means to enhance data rate. So far the study of data rate has been limited to downlink communications. In this letter, we study the maximization of the total data rate which also involves the uplink data rate. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm.
