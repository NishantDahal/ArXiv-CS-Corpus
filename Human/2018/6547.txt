Station Assignment with Reallocation

We study a dynamic allocation problem that arises in various scenarios where mobile clients joining and leaving the system have to communicate with static stations via radio transmissions. Restrictions are a maximum delay, or laxity, between consecutive client transmissions and a maximum bandwidth that a station can share among its clients. We study the problem of assigning clients to stations so that every client transmits to some station, satisfying those restrictions. We consider reallocation algorithms, where clients are revealed at its arrival time, the departure time is unknown until they leave, and clients may be reallocated to another station, but at a cost proportional to the reciprocal of the client laxity. We present negative results for previous related protocols that motivate the study; we introduce new protocols that expound trade-offs between station usage and reallocation cost; we determine experimentally a classification of the clients attempting to balance those opposite goals; we prove theoretically bounds on our performance metrics; and we show through simulations that, for realistic scenarios, our protocols behave much better than our theoretical guarantees.
