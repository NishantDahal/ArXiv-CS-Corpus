Complexity of the Steiner Network Problem with Respect to the Number of Terminals

In the Directed Steiner Network problem we are given an arc-weighted digraph $G$, a set of terminals $T \subseteq V(G)$, and an (unweighted) directed request graph $R$ with $V(R)=T$. Our task is to output a subgraph $G' \subseteq G$ of the minimum cost such that there is a directed path from $s$ to $t$ in $G'$ for all $st \in A(R)$.
  It is known that the problem can be solved in time $|V(G)|^{O(|A(R)|)}$ [Feldman&Ruhl, SIAM J. Comput. 2006] and cannot be solved in time $|V(G)|^{o(|A(R)|)}$ even if $G$ is planar, unless Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails [Chitnis et al., SODA 2014]. However, as this reduction (and other reductions showing hardness of the problem) only shows that the problem cannot be solved in time $|V(G)|^{o(|T|)}$ unless ETH fails, there is a significant gap in the complexity with respect to $|T|$ in the exponent.
  We show that Directed Steiner Network is solvable in time $f(R)\cdot |V(G)|^{O(c_g \cdot |T|)}$, where $c_g$ is a constant depending solely on the genus of $G$ and $f$ is a computable function. We complement this result by showing that there is no $f(R)\cdot |V(G)|^{o(|T|^2/ \log |T|)}$ algorithm for any function $f$ for the problem on general graphs, unless ETH fails.
