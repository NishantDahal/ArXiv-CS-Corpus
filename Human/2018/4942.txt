Effective Capacity Analysis in Ultra-Dense Wireless Networks with Random Interference

Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) provide a promising paradigm to cope with exponentially increasing mobile traffic. However, little work has to date considered unsaturated traffic with quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. This paper presents a new cross-layer analytical model to capture the unsaturated traffic of a UDN in the presence of QoS requirements. The effective capacity (EC) of the UDN is derived, taking into account small-scale channel fading and possible interference. Key properties of the EC are revealed. The amount of traffic impacts effective capacity of the UDN due to the sophisticated interactions among small base stations operating in the same frequency. The maximization of total effective capacity is formulated as a non-cooperative game in the paper. The best-response function is derived, iteratively searching the Nash equilibrium point. System simulation results indicate that our proposed model is accurate. The simulations also show the maximum allowed arrival rate with the QoS guarantee, compared with the full interference model.
