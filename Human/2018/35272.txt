MIMO Beampattern and Waveform Design with Low Resolution DACs

Digital beamforming and waveform generation techniques in MIMO radar offer enormous advantages in terms of flexibility and performance compared to conventional radar systems based on analog implementations. To allow for such fully digital design with an efficient hardware complexity, we consider the use of low resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) while maintaining a separate radio-frequency chain per antenna. A sum of squared residuals (SSR) formulation for the beampattern and spectral shaping problem is solved based on the Generalized Approximate Message Passing (GAMP) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate good performance in terms of spectral shaping as well as cross-correlation properties of the different probing waveforms even with just 2-bit resolution per antenna.
