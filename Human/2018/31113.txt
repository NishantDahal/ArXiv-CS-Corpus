Molecular computers

We propose the chemlambda artificial chemistry, whose behavior strongly suggests that real molecules which embed Interaction Nets patterns and real chemical reactions which resemble Interaction Nets graph rewrites could be a realistic path towards molecular computers, in the sense explained in the article.
