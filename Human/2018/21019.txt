Abnormal Event Detection and Location for Dense Crowds using Repulsive Forces and Sparse Reconstruction

This paper proposes a method based on repulsive forces and sparse reconstruction for the detection and location of abnormal events in crowded scenes. In order to avoid the challenging problem of accurately tracking each specific individual in a dense or complex scene, we divide each frame of the surveillance video into a fixed number of grids and select a single representative point in each grid as the individual to track. The repulsive force model, which can accurately reflect interactive behaviors of crowds, is used to calculate the interactive forces between grid particles in crowded scenes and to construct a force flow matrix using these discrete forces from a fixed number of continuous frames. The force flow matrix, which contains spatial and temporal information, is adopted to train a group of visual dictionaries by sparse coding. To further improve the detection efficiency and avoid concept drift, we propose a fully unsupervised global and local dynamic updating algorithm, based on sparse reconstruction and a group of word pools. For anomaly location, since our method is based on a fixed grid, we can judge whether anomalies occur in a region intuitively according to the reconstruction error of the corresponding visual words. We experimentally verify the proposed method using the UMN dataset, the UCSD dataset and the Web dataset separately. The results indicate that our method can not only detect abnormal events accurately, but can also pinpoint the location of anomalies.
