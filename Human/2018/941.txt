The DCS Theorem

Blockchain design involves many tradeoffs, and much debate has focused on tradeoffs related to scaling parameters such as blocksize. To address some of the confusion around this subject, we present a probability proof of the DCS Triangle. We use the triangle to show decentralized consensus systems, like blockchains, can have Decentralization, Consensus, or Scale, but not all three properties simultaneously. We then describe two methods for getting around the limitations suggested by the triangle.
