Making Name-Based Content Routing More Efficient than Link-State Routing

The Diffusive Name-based Routing Protocol (DNRP) is introduced for efficient name-based routing in information-centric networks (ICN). DNRP establishes and maintains multiple loop-free routes to the nearest instances of a name prefix using only distance information. DNRP eliminates the need for periodic updates, maintaining topology information, storing complete paths to content replicas, or knowing about all the sites storing replicas of named content. DNRP is suitable for large ICNs with large numbers of prefixes stored at multiple sites. It is shown that DNRP provides loop-free routes to content independently of the state of the topology and that it converges within a finite time to correct routes to name prefixes after arbitrary changes in the network topology or the placement of prefix instances. The result of simulation experiments illustrates that DNRP is more efficient than link-state routing approaches.
