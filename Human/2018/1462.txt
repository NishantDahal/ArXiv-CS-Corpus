The cover time of a biased random walk on a random cubic graph

We study a random walk that prefers tou se unvisited edges in the context of random cubic graphs. We establish asymptotically correct estimates for the vertex and edge cover times, these being $\approx n\log n$ and $\approx \frac32n\log n$ respectively.
