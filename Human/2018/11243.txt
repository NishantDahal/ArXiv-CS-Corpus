Presheaf Models of Relational Modalities in Dependent Type Theory

This report is an extension of 'A Model of Parametric Dependent Type Theory in Bridge/Path Cubical Sets' (Nuyts, arXiv:1706.04383). The purpose of this text is to prove all technical aspects of our model for dependent type theory with parametric quantifiers (Nuyts, Vezzosi and Devriese, 2017) and with degrees of relatedness (Nuyts and Devriese, 2018).
