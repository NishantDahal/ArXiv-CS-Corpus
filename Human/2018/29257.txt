Capturability-based Pattern Generation for Walking with Variable Height

Capturability analysis of the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model enabled walking with constrained height based on the capture point. We generalize this analysis to the variable-height  inverted  pendulum  (VHIP)  and  show  how  it  enables 3D walking over uneven terrains based on capture inputs. Thanks to a tailored optimization scheme, we can compute these inputs fast enough for real-time model predictive control. We implement this approach as open-source software and demonstrate it in dynamic simulations.
