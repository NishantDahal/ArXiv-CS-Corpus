CUPSMAN: Control User Plane Separation Based Routing in Ad-hoc Networks

Separation of user (data) plane from the control plane in networks helps scale resources independently, increase the quality of service and facilitate autonomy by employing software-defined networking techniques. Clustering introduces hierarchy in ad hoc networks where control functions can be carried out by some designated cluster heads. It is also an effective solution to handle challenges due to lack of centralized controllers and infrastructure in ad-hoc networks. Clustered network topologies gain a significant amount of scalability and reliability in comparison to flat topologies. Different roles that nodes have in a clustered network can be effectively used for routing as well. In this paper, we propose a novel plane-separated routing algorithm, Cluster-based Hybrid Routing Algorithm (CHRA). In CHRA, we take advantage of the hierarchical clustered structure through control and user plane separation (CUPS) in mobile ad-hoc networks. In the cluster neighborhood with a particular size, a link-state routing is used to minimize delay, control overhead, and also utilize energy consumption. For facilitating the communication with distant nodes, we form a routing backbone that is responsible for both control and data messages. The results show that CHRA outperforms its opponents in terms of fair energy consumption and end-to-end delay.
