Coverage Probability Analysis of UAV Cellular Networks in Urban Environments

In this paper, we study coverage probabilities of the UAV-assisted cellular network modeled by 2-dimension (2D) Poisson point process. The cellular user is assumed to connect to the nearest aerial base station. We derive the explicit expressions for the downlink coverage probability for the Rayleigh fading channel. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of performance when taking the property of air-to-ground channel into consideration. Our analytical and numerical results show that the coverage probability is affected by UAV height, pathloss exponent and UAV density. To maximize the coverage probability, the optimal height and density of UAVs are studied, which could be beneficial for the UAV deployment design.
