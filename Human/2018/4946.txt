A Hybrid Approach for Efficient Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Green C-RAN

In this paper, we consider a green cloud radio access network (C-RAN) with simultaneous wireless and power transfer ability. In order to reduce the energy consumed for updating the chanel state information (CSI), energy users are divided into two different groups, including the free charge group and the MIMO group. Then a semi-definite programming problem is formulated under the constraints of energy and information transmission requirements. To minimize the total energy consumption, two algorithms are developed to authorize the energy users into two group divisions in single time slot. Then the algorithms are extended to long term scenarios consisting training and long term stages, the CSI of free charge energy users are not required during the long term stage. Simulation and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in significantly reducing the energy consumption of C-RAN systems.
