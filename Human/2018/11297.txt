Improved Shortest Path Maps with GPU Shaders

We present in this paper several improvements for computing shortest path maps using OpenGL shaders. The approach explores GPU rasterization as a way to propagate optimal costs on a polygonal 2D environment, producing shortest path maps which can efficiently be queried at run-time. Our improved method relies on Compute Shaders for improved performance, does not require any CPU pre-computation, and handles shortest path maps both with source points and with line segment sources. The produced path maps partition the input environment into regions sharing a same parent point along the shortest path to the closest source point or segment source. Our method produces paths with global optimality, a characteristic which has been mostly neglected in animated virtual environments. The proposed approach is particularly suitable for the animation of multiple agents moving toward the entrances or exits of a virtual environment, a situation which is efficiently represented with the proposed path maps.
