Analysis of Relaxation Time in Random Walk with Jumps

We study the relaxation time in the random walk with jumps. The random walk with jumps combines random walk based sampling with uniform node sampling and improves the performance of network analysis and learning tasks. We derive various conditions under which the relaxation time decreases with the introduction of jumps.
