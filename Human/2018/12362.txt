Necessary Conditions for K/2 Degrees of Freedom

Stotz et al., 2016, reported a sufficient (injectivity) condition for each user in a K-user single-antenna constant interference channel to achieve 1/2 degree of freedom. The present paper proves that this condition is necessary as well and hence provides an equivalence characterization of interference channel matrices allowing full degrees of freedom.
