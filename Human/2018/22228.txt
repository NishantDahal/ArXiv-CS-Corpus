An AI Based Super Nodes Selection Algorithm in BlockChain Networks

In blockchain systems, especially cryptographic currencies such as Bitcoin, the double-spending and Byzantine-general-like problem are solved by reaching consensus protocols among all nodes. The state-of-the-art protocols include Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake. Proof-of-Work urges nodes to prove their computing power measured in hash rate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition. The other two take into account the amount of stake of each nodes and even design a vote in Delegated-Proof-of-Stake. However, these frameworks have several drawbacks, such as consuming a large number of electricity, leading the whole blockchain to a centralized system and so on. In this paper, we propose the conceptual framework, fundamental theory and research methodology, based on artificial intelligence technology that exploits nearly complementary information of each nodes. And we designed a particular convolutional neural network and a dynamic threshold, which obtained the super nodes and the random nodes, to reach the consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework combines the advantages of Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake by avoiding complicated hash operation and monopoly. Furthermore, it compares favorably to the three state-of-the-art consensus frameworks, in terms of security and the speed of transaction confirmation.
