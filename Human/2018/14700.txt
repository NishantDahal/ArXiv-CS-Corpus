Positioning Data-Rate Trade-off in mm-Wave Small Cells and Service Differentiation for 5G Networks

We analyze a millimeter wave network, deployed along the streets of a city, in terms of positioning and downlink data-rate performance, respectively. First, we present a transmission scheme where the base stations provide jointly positioning and data-communication functionalities. Accordingly, we study the trade-off between the localization and the data rate performance based on theoretical bounds. Then, we obtain an upper bound on the probability of beam misalignment based on the derived localization error bound. Finally, we prescribe the network operator a scheme to select the beamwidth and the power splitting factor between the localization and communication functions to address different quality of service requirements, while limiting cellular outage.
