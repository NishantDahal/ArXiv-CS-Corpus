Fashion is Taking Shape: Understanding Clothing Preference Based on Body Shape From Online Sources

To study the correlation between clothing garments and body shape, we collected a new dataset (Fashion Takes Shape), which includes images of users with clothing category annotations. We employ our multi-photo approach to estimate body shapes of each user and build a conditional model of clothing categories given body-shape. We demonstrate that in real-world data, clothing categories and body-shapes are correlated and show that our multi-photo approach leads to a better predictive model for clothing categories compared to models based on single-view shape estimates or manually annotated body types. We see our method as the first step towards the large-scale understanding of clothing preferences from body shape.
