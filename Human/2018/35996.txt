Validity of Clusters Produced By kernel-$k$-means With Kernel-Trick

This paper corrects the proof of the Theorem 2 from the Gower's paper \cite[page 5]{Gower:1982} as well as corrects the Theorem 7 from Gower's paper \cite{Gower:1986}. The first correction is needed in order to establish the existence of the kernel function used commonly in the kernel trick e.g. for $k$-means clustering algorithm, on the grounds of distance matrix. The correction encompasses the missing if-part proof and dropping unnecessary conditions. The second correction deals with transformation of the kernel matrix into a one embeddable in Euclidean space.
