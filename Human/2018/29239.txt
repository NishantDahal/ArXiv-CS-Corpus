Detection of persistent signals and its relation to coherent feedforward loops

Many studies have shown that cells use temporal dynamics of signalling molecules to encode information. One particular class of temporal dynamics is persistent and transient signals, i.e. signals of long and short durations respectively. It has been shown that the coherent type-1 feedforward loop with an AND logic at the output (or C1-FFL for short) can be used to discriminate a persistent input signal from a transient one. This has been done by modelling the C1-FFL, and then use the model to show that persistent and transient input signals give, respectively, a non-zero and zero output. Instead of assuming the structure of C1-FFL, this paper shows that it is possible to deduce the C1-FFL model from the requirement of discriminating a persistent signal. We do this by first formulating a statistical detection problem of distinguishing persistent signals from transient ones. The solution of the detection problem is to compute the log-likelihood ratio of observing a persistent signal to a transient signal. We show that, if this log-likelihood ratio is positive, which happens when the signal is likely to be persistent, then it can be approximately computed by a C1-FFL. Although the capability of C1-FFL to discriminate persistent signals is known, this paper adds an information processing interpretation on how a C1-FFL works as a detector of persistent signals.
