Semidefinite Relaxation Based Blind Equalization using Constant Modulus Criterion

Blind equalization is a classic yet open problem. Statistic-based algorithms, such as constant modulus (CM), were widely investigated. One inherent issue with blind algorithms is the phase ambiguity of equalized signals. In this letter, we propose a novel scheme based on CM criterion and take advantage of the asymmetric property in a class of LDPC codes to resolve the phase ambiguity. Specifically, a new formulation with modified CM objective function and relaxed code constraints is presented.
