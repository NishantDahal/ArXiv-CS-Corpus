Evaluation of Intel Memory Drive Technology Performance for Scientific Applications

In this paper, we present benchmark data for Intel Memory Drive Technology (IMDT), which is a new generation of Software-defined Memory (SDM) based on Intel ScaleMP collaboration and using 3D XPointTM based Intel Solid-State Drives (SSDs) called Optane. We studied IMDT performance for synthetic benchmarks, scientific kernels, and applications. We chose these benchmarks to represent different patterns for computation and accessing data on disks and memory. To put performance of IMDT in comparison, we used two memory configurations: hybrid IMDT DDR4/Optane and DDR4 only systems. The performance was measured as a percentage of used memory and analyzed in detail. We found that for some applications DDR4/Optane hybrid configuration outperforms DDR4 setup by up to 20%.
