Accelerating Viterbi Algorithm using Custom Instruction Approach

In recent years, the decoding algorithms in communication networks are becoming increasingly complex aiming to achieve high reliability in correctly decoding received messages. These decoding algorithms involve computationally complex operations requiring high performance computing hardware, which are generally expensive. A cost-effective solution is to enhance the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the processors by creating new custom instructions for the computational parts of the decoding algorithms. In this paper, we propose to utilize the custom instruction approach to efficiently implement the widely used Viterbi decoding algorithm by adding the assembly language instructions to the ISA of DLX, PicoJava II and NIOS II processors, which represent RISC, stack and FPGA-based soft-core processor architectures, respectively. By using the custom instruction approach, the execution time of the Viterbi algorithm is significantly improved by approximately 3 times for DLX and PicoJava II, and by 2 times for NIOS II.
