Finding the optimal nets for self-folding Kirigami

Three-dimensional shells can be synthesized from the spontaneous self-folding of two-dimensional templates of interconnected panels, called nets. However, some nets are more likely to self-fold into the desired shell under random movements. The optimal nets are the ones that maximize the number of vertex connections, i.e., vertices that have only two of its faces cut away from each other in the net. Previous methods for finding such nets are based on random search and thus do not guarantee the optimal solution. Here, we propose a deterministic procedure. We map the connectivity of the shell into a shell graph, where the nodes and links of the graph represent the vertices and edges of the shell, respectively. Identifying the nets that maximize the number of vertex connections corresponds to finding the set of maximum leaf spanning trees of the shell graph. This method allows not only to design the self-assembly of much larger shell structures but also to apply additional design criteria, as a complete catalog of the maximum leaf spanning trees is obtained.
