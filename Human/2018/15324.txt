Enhancing PHY Security of MISO NOMA SWIPT Systems With a Practical Non-Linear EH Model

Non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) are promising techniques to improve spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. However, the security of NOMA SWIPT systems has not received much attention in the literature. In this paper, an artificial noise-aided beamforming design problem is studied to enhance the security of a multiple-input single-output NOMA SWIPT system where a practical non-linear energy harvesting model is adopted. The problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. Two algorithms are proposed to tackle this problem based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation. Simulation results show that a performance gain can be obtained by using NOMA compared to the conventional orthogonal multiple access. It is also shown that the performance of the algorithm using a cost function is better than the algorithm using SDR at the cost of a higher computation complexity.
