A Pommaret Bases Approach to the Degree of a Polynomial Ideal

In this paper, we study first the relationship between Pommaret bases and Hilbert series. Given a finite Pommaret basis, we derive new explicit formulas for the Hilbert series and for the degree of the ideal generated by it which exhibit more clearly the influence of each generator. Then we establish a new dimension depending Bezout bound for the degree and use it to obtain a dimension depending bound for the ideal membership problem.
