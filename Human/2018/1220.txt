On Enhancing Genetic Algorithms Using New Crossovers

This paper investigates the use of more than one crossover operator to enhance the performance of genetic algorithms. Novel crossover operators are proposed such as the Collision crossover, which is based on the physical rules of elastic collision, in addition to proposing two selection strategies for the crossover operators, one of which is based on selecting the best crossover operator and the other randomly selects any operator. Several experiments on some Travelling Salesman Problems (TSP) have been conducted to evaluate the proposed methods, which are compared to the well-known Modified crossover operator and partially mapped Crossover (PMX) crossover. The results show the importance of some of the proposed methods, such as the collision crossover, in addition to the significant enhancement of the genetic algorithms performance, particularly when using more than one crossover operator.
