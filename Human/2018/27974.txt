What does my knowing your plans tell me?

For robots acting in the presence of observers, we examine the information that is divulged if the observer is party to the robot's plan. Privacy constraints are specified as the stipulations on what can be inferred during plan execution. We imagine a case in which the robot's plan is divulged beforehand, so that the observer can use this {\em a priori} information along with the disclosed executions. The divulged plan, which can be represented by a procrustean graph, is shown to undermine privacy precisely to the extent that it can eliminate action-observation sequences that will never appear in the plan. Future work will consider how the divulged plan might be sought as the output of a planning procedure.
