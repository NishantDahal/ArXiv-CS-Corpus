Broadcasting in Ad Hoc Multiple Access Channels

We study broadcast in multiple access channels in dynamic adversarial settings. There is an unbounded supply of anonymous stations attached to a synchronous channel. There is an adversary who injects packets into stations to be broadcast on the channel. The adversary is restricted by injection rate, burstiness, and by how many passive stations can be simultaneously activated by providing them with packets. We consider deterministic distributed broadcast algorithms, which are further categorized by their properties. We investigate for which injection rates can algorithms attain bounded packet latency, when adversaries are restricted to be able to activate at most one station per round. The rates of algorithms we present make the increasing sequence consisting of $\frac{1}{3}$, $\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, reflecting the additional features of algorithms. We show that injection rate $\frac{3}{4}$ cannot be handled with bounded packet latency.
