Sector-Based Radio Resource Allocation (SBRRA) Algorithm for Better Quality of Service and Experience in Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication

The mounting content sharing among users has resulted in a considerable rise in wireless data traffic, pressurizing the cellular networks to undergo a suitable upheaval. A competent technology of the fifth-generation networks (5G) for efficiently supporting proximity-based applications is Device-to-Device (D2D) communication, underlaying cellular networks. Significant advances have been made till date, for allocating resources to D2D users in cellular networks, such that sharing of spectral resources between cellular and D2D users is carried out in a coordinated manner. In this paper, a sector-based radio resource allocation (SBRRA) algorithm for resource block allocation to D2D pairs has been proposed, where the number of resource blocks (RBs) is allocated to each D2D pair in an adaptive manner, based on the demanded application by each pair. Different applications demand a varying number of RBs, in accordance with their priority. This algorithm focusses on the use of sectored antennas at the base station, for a better performance and low complexity. Extensive simulations are carried out, considering real-time scenario, for ensuring satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) by the users. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is proved by comparing it with the RB allocation using Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
