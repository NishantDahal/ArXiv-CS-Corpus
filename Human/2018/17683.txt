On Enumerating Distributions for Associated Vectors in the Entropy Space

This paper focuses on the problem of finding a distribution for an associated entropic vector in the entropy space nearest to a given, possibly non-entropic, target vector for random variables with a constraint on alphabet size. We show the feasibility to find distribution for associated vector via a sequence of perturbations in the probability mass function. Then we present an algorithm for numerically solving the problem together with extensions, applications, and comparison with the known results.
