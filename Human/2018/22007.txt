Use of "Web Map Image" and copyright act

In this paper, we reviewed the notes on using Web map image provided by Web map service, from the viewpoint of copyright act. The copyright act aims to contribute to creation of culture by protecting the rights of authors and others, and promoting fair exploitation of cultural products. Therefore, everyone can use copyrighted materials to the extent of the copyright limitation based on copyright act. The Web map image, including maps, aerial photo and satellite image, are one of copyrighted materials, so it can be used within the limits of copyright. However, the available range of Web map image under the copyright act is not wide. In addition, it is pointed out that the copyright act has not been able to follow the progress of digitalization of copyrighted materials. It is expected to revise the copyright act corresponding to digitalization of copyrighted work.
