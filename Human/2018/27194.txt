Autonomous Functional Locomotion in a Tendon-Driven Limb via Limited Experience

Robots will become ubiquitously useful only when they can use few attempts to teach themselves to perform different tasks, even with complex bodies and in dynamical environments. Vertebrates, in fact, successfully use trial-and-error to learn multiple tasks in spite of their intricate tendon-driven anatomies. Roboticists find such tendon-driven systems particularly hard to control because they are simultaneously nonlinear, under-determined (many tendon tensions combine to produce few net joint torques), and over-determined (few joint rotations define how many tendons need to be reeled-in/payed-out). We demonstrate---for the first time in simulation and in hardware---how a model-free approach allows few-shot autonomous learning to produce effective locomotion in a 3-tendon/2-joint tendon-driven leg. Initially, an artificial neural network fed by sparsely sampled data collected using motor babbling creates an inverse map from limb kinematics to motor activations, which is analogous to juvenile vertebrates playing during development. Thereafter, iterative reward-driven exploration of candidate motor activations simultaneously refines the inverse map and finds a functional locomotor limit-cycle autonomously. This biologically-inspired algorithm, which we call G2P (General to Particular), enables versatile adaptation of robots to changes in the target task, mechanics of their bodies, and environment. Moreover, this work empowers future studies of few-shot autonomous learning in biological systems, which is the foundation of their enviable functional versatility.
