Efficient Channel Estimator with Angle-Division Multiple Access

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) is an enabling technology of 5G wireless communication. The performance of an M-MIMO system is highly dependent on the speed and accuracy of obtaining the channel state information (CSI). The computational complexity of channel estimation for an M-MIMO system can be reduced by making use of the sparsity of the M-MIMO channel. In this paper, we propose the hardware-efficient channel estimator based on angle-division multiple access (ADMA) for the first time. Preamble, uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) training are also implemented. For further hardware-efficiency consideration, optimization regarding quantization and approximation strategies have been discussed. Implementation techniques such as pipelining and systolic processing are also employed for hardware regularity. Numerical results and FPGA implementation have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed channel estimator.
