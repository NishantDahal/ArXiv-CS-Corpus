Considerations regarding security issues impact on systems availability

Control systems behavior can be analyzed taking into account a large number of parameters: performances, reliability, availability, security. Each control system presents various security vulnerabilities that affect in lower or higher measure its functioning. In this paper the authors present a method to assess the impact of security issues on the systems availability. A fuzzy model for estimating the availability of the system based on the security level and achieved availability coefficient (depending on MTBF and MTR) is developed and described. The results of the fuzzy inference system (FIS) are presented in the last section of the paper.
