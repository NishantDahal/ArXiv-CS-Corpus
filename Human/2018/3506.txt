D2.4 Report on the final prototype of programming abstractions for energy-efficient inter-process communication

Work package 2 (WP2) aims to develop libraries for energy-efficient inter-process communication and data sharing on the EXCESS platforms. The Deliverable D2.4 reports on the final prototype of programming abstractions for energy-efficient inter- process communication. Section 1 is the updated overview of the prototype of programming abstraction and devised power/energy models. The Section 2-6 contain the latest results of the four studies: i) GreenBST, a energy-efficient and concurrent search tree (cf. Section 2) ii) Customization methodology for implementation of streaming aggregation in embedded systems (cf. Section 3) iii) Energy Model on CPU for Lock-free Data-structures in Dynamic Environments (cf. Section 4.10) iv) A General and Validated Energy Complexity Model for Multithreaded Algorithms (cf. Section 5)
