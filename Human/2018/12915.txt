Localized Traffic Sign Detection with Multi-scale Deconvolution Networks

Autonomous driving is becoming a future practical lifestyle greatly driven by deep learning. Specifically, an effective traffic sign detection by deep learning plays a critical role for it. However, different countries have different sets of traffic signs, making localized traffic sign recognition model training a tedious and daunting task. To address the issues of taking amount of time to compute complicate algorithm and low ratio of detecting blurred and sub-pixel images of localized traffic signs, we propose Multi-Scale Deconvolution Networks (MDN), which flexibly combines multi-scale convolutional neural network with deconvolution sub-network, leading to efficient and reliable localized traffic sign recognition model training. It is demonstrated that the proposed MDN is effective compared with classical algorithms on the benchmarks of the localized traffic sign, such as Chinese Traffic Sign Dataset (CTSD), and the German Traffic Sign Benchmarks (GTSRB).
