Bilgisayar Muhendisligi Egitiminde Teknoloji Egilimlerinin Takip Edilmesi

Today computers have become an integral part of life. However, most people's interaction with computers in on end-user-level. Computer engineers are needed while designing and developing a structure of computer systems, software and hardware systems and also they need when implementing and solving problems while using these systems. Training of qualified computer engineers is vital to have a say in future technology. Recently, big data analysis, cloud technologies, wearable technologies, mobile and online services become popular. For that reason, computer engineering education should update itself regularly and keep up with the latest improvements. In this study, it is touched on some topics which are suggested to extend computer engineering curricula such as big data analyses, wearable technologies internet of things, cloud technologies, identity management and cyber security which are expected to widening in the area and also demanded that computer engineering student should be qualified on. Related topics will be described and usage areas will be explained, developments and future roles will be mentioned and also expected achievements will be described. These achievement's relevance with learning outcomes of departments which are accredited by MUDEK will be defined.
