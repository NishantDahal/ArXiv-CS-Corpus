Hierarchical and State-based Architectures for Robot Behavior Planning and Control

In this paper, two behavior control architectures for autonomous agents in the form of cross-platform C++ frameworks are presented, the State Controller Library and the Behavior Control Framework. While the former is state-based and generalizes the notion of states and finite state machines to allow for multi-action planning, the latter is behavior-based and exploits a hierarchical structure and the concept of inhibitions to allow for dynamic transitioning. The two frameworks have completely independent implementations, but can be used effectively in tandem to solve behavior control problems on all levels of granularity. Both frameworks have been used to control the NimbRo-OP, a humanoid soccer robot developed by team NimbRo of the University of Bonn.
