Effective Building Block Design for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks using Search

Deep learning has shown promising results on many machine learning tasks but DL models are often complex networks with large number of neurons and layers, and recently, complex layer structures known as building blocks. Finding the best deep model requires a combination of finding both the right architecture and the correct set of parameters appropriate for that architecture. In addition, this complexity (in terms of layer types, number of neurons, and number of layers) also present problems with generalization since larger networks are easier to overfit to the data. In this paper, we propose a search framework for finding effective architectural building blocks for convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our approach is much faster at finding models that are close to state-of-the-art in performance. In addition, the models discovered by our approach are also smaller than models discovered by similar techniques. We achieve these twin advantages by designing our search space in such a way that it searches over a reduced set of state-of-the-art building blocks for CNNs including residual block, inception block, inception-residual block, ResNeXt block and many others. We apply this technique to generate models for multiple image datasets and show that these models achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (and even surpassing the state-of-the-art in one case). We also show that learned models are transferable between datasets.
