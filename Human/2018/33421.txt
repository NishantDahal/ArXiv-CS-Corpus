Use the Keys Pre-Distribution KDP-scheme for Mandatory Access Control Implementation

The possibility of use the keys preliminary distribution KDP-scheme for mandatory access control realization in the distributed systems with user's hierarchy is considered. The modified keys preliminary distribution algorithm is suggested. It is developed a method for creation of subsets family for solution this task.
