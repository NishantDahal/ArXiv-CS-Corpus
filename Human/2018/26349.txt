Symbiotic Radio: A New Communication Paradigm for Passive Internet-of-Things

In this paper, a novel technique, called symbiotic radio (SR), is proposed for passive Internet-of-Things (IoT), in which a backscatter device (BD) is integrated with a primary transmission. The primary transmitter is designed to assist the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver decodes the information from the primary transmitter as well as the BD. We consider a multiple-input single-output (MISO) SR and the symbol period for BD transmission is designed to be either the same as or much longer than that of the primary system, resulting in parasitic or commensal relationship between the primary and BD transmissions. We first derive the achievable rates for the primary system and the BD transmission. Then, we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization problem and the transmit power minimization problem, and solve these non-convex problems by applying semi-definite relaxation technique. In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. Simulation results show that when the BD transmission rate is properly designed, the proposed SR not only enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering, but also enhances the achievable rate of the primary system by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.
