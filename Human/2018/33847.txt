Light Weight Color Image Warping with Inter-Channel Information

Image warping is a necessary step in many multimedia applications such as texture mapping, image-based rendering, panorama stitching, image resizing and optical flow computation etc. Traditionally, color image warping interpolation is performed in each color channel independently. In this paper, we show that the warping quality can be significantly enhanced by exploiting the cross-channel correlation. We design a warping scheme that integrates intra-channel interpolation with cross-channel variation at very low computational cost, which is required for interactive multimedia applications on mobile devices. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated by extensive experiments.
