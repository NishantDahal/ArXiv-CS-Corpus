To Edge or Not to Edge?

Edge computing caters to a wide range of use cases from latency sensitive to bandwidth constrained applications. However, the exact specifications of the edge that give the most benefit for each type of application are still unclear. We investigate the concrete conditions when the edge is feasible, i.e., when users observe performance gains from the edge while costs remain low for the providers, for an application that requires both low latency and high bandwidth: video analytics.
