Measuring and Computing Database Inconsistency via Repairs

We propose a generic numerical measure of inconsistency of a database with respect to a set of integrity constraints. It is based on an abstract repair semantics. A particular inconsistency measure associated to cardinality-repairs is investigated; and we show that it can be computed via answer-set programs.
