CaMKII activation supports reward-based neural network optimization through Hamiltonian sampling

Synaptic plasticity is implemented and controlled through over thousand different types of molecules in the postsynaptic density and presynaptic boutons that assume a staggering array of different states through phosporylation and other mechanisms. One of the most prominent molecule in the postsynaptic density is CaMKII, that is described in molecular biology as a "memory molecule" that can integrate through auto-phosporylation Ca-influx signals on a relatively large time scale of dozens of seconds. The functional impact of this memory mechanism is largely unknown. We show that the experimental data on the specific role of CaMKII activation in dopamine-gated spine consolidation suggest a general functional role in speeding up reward-guided search for network configurations that maximize reward expectation. Our theoretical analysis shows that stochastic search could in principle even attain optimal network configurations by emulating one of the most well-known nonlinear optimization methods, simulated annealing. But this optimization is usually impeded by slowness of stochastic search at a given temperature. We propose that CaMKII contributes a momentum term that substantially speeds up this search. In particular, it allows the network to overcome saddle points of the fitness function. The resulting improved stochastic policy search can be understood on a more abstract level as Hamiltonian sampling, which is known to be one of the most efficient stochastic search methods.
