Asynchronous decentralized accelerated stochastic gradient descent

In this work, we introduce an asynchronous decentralized accelerated stochastic gradient descent type of method for decentralized stochastic optimization, considering communication and synchronization are the major bottlenecks. We establish $\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$ (resp., $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrtε)$) communication complexity and $\mathcal{O}(1/ε^2)$ (resp., $\mathcal{O}(1/ε)$) sampling complexity for solving general convex (resp., strongly convex) problems.
