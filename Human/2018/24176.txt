An FPGA-Accelerated Design for Deep Learning Pedestrian Detection in Self-Driving Vehicles

With the rise of self-driving vehicles comes the risk of accidents and the need for higher safety, and protection for pedestrian detection in the following scenarios: imminent crashes, thus the car should crash into an object and avoid the pedestrian, and in the case of road intersections, where it is important for the car to stop when pedestrians are crossing. Currently, a special topology of deep neural networks called Fused Deep Neural Network (F-DNN) is considered to be the state of the art in pedestrian detection, as it has the lowest miss rate, yet it is very slow. Therefore, acceleration is needed to speed up the performance. This project proposes two contributions to address this problem, by using a deep neural network used for object detection, called Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD). The first contribution is training and tuning the hyperparameters of SSD to improve pedestrian detection. The second contribution is a new FPGA design for accelerating the model on the Altera Arria 10 platform. The final system will be used in self-driving vehicles in real-time. Preliminary results of the improved SSD shows 3% higher miss-rate than F-DNN on Caltech pedestrian detection benchmark, but 4x performance improvement. The acceleration design is expected to achieve an additional performance improvement significantly outweighing the minimal difference in accuracy.
