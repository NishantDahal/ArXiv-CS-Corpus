UAV-Enabled Cooperative Jamming for Improving Secrecy of Ground Wiretap Channel

This letter proposes a novel UAV-enabled mobile jamming scheme to improve the secrecy rate of ground wiretap channel. Specifically, a UAV is employed to transmit jamming signals to combat against eavesdropping. Such a mobile jamming scheme is particularly appealing since the UAV-enabled jammer can fly close to the eavesdropper and opportunistically jam it by leveraging the UAV's mobility. We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and jamming power over a given flight period. To make the problem more tractable, we drive a closed-form lower bound for the achievable secrecy rate, based on which the UAV's trajectory and transmit power are optimized alternately by an efficient iterative algorithm applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design can significantly enhance the secrecy rate of the considered wiretap system as compared to benchmark schemes.
