Channel Input Adaptation via Natural Type Selection

For the model of communication through a discrete memoryless channel using i.i.d. random block codes, where the channel is changing slowly from block to block, we propose a stochastic algorithm for adaptation of the generating distribution of the code in the process of continuous reliable communication. The purpose of the algorithm is to match the generating distribution $Q(x)$ to the changing channel $P(y\,|\,x)$, so that reliable communication is maintained at some constant rate $R$. This is achieved by a feedback of one bit per transmitted block. The feedback bit is determined by the joint type of the last transmitted codeword and the received block, a constant threshold $T>R$, and some conditional distribution $Φ(x\,|\,y)$. Depending on the value of the feedback bit, the system parameters $Q(x)$ and $Φ(x\,|\,y)$ are both updated according to the joint type of the last transmitted and received blocks, or remain unchanged.
  We show that, under certain technical conditions, the iterations of the algorithm lead to a distribution $Q(x)$, which guarantees reliable communication for all rates below the threshold $T$, provided that the discrete memoryless channel capacity of $P(y\,|\,x)$ stays above $T$.
