Jointly Controlled Lotteries with Biased Coins

We provide a mechanism that uses two biased coins and implements any distribution on a finite set of elements, in such a way that even if the outcomes of one of the coins is determined by an adversary, the final distribution remains unchanged. We apply this result to show that every quitting game in which at least two players have at least two continue actions has an undiscounted $\ep$-equilibrium, for every $\ep > 0$.
