Music generation with variational recurrent autoencoder supported by history

A new architecture of an artificial neural network that helps to generate longer melodic patterns is introduced alongside with methods for post-generation filtering. The proposed approach called variational autoencoder supported by history is based on a recurrent highway gated network combined with a variational autoencoder. Combination of this architecture with filtering heuristics allows generating pseudo-live acoustically pleasing and melodically diverse music.
