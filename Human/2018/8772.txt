Automatic Detection and Query of Wireless Spectrum Events from Streaming Data

Several alternatives for more efficient spectrum management have been proposed over the last decade, resulting in new techniques for automatic wideband spectrum sensing. However, while spectrum sensing technology is important, understanding, using and taking actions on this data for better spectrum and network resource management is at least equally important. In this paper, we propose a system that is able to automatically detect wireless spectrum events from streaming spectrum sensing data, and enables the consumption of the events as they are produced, as a statistical report or on a per-query basis. The proposed system is referred to as spectrum streamer and is wireless technology agnostic, scalable, able to deliver actionable information to humans and machines and also enables application development by custom querying of the detected events.
