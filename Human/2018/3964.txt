First Demonstration of an Automatic Multilayer Intent-Based Secure Service Creation by an Open Source SDN Orchestrator

In this work we demonstrate an automatic intent-based encryption layer selection and configuration for a multilayer network covering IP and optical utilizing an open source SDN orchestrator. Results indicate that the processing impact of a secure channel creation is negligible.
