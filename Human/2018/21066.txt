The perceived quality of process discovery tools

Process discovery has seen a rise in popularity in the last decade for both researchers and businesses. Recent developments mainly focused on the power and the functionalities of the discovery algorithm. While continuous improvement of these functional aspects is very important, non-functional aspects such as visualization and usability are often overlooked. However, these aspects are considered valuable for end-users and play an important part in the experience of these end-users when working with a process discovery tool. A questionnaire has been sent out to give end-users the opportunity to voice their opinion on available process discovery tools and about the state of process discovery as a domain in general. The results of 66 respondents are presented and compared with the answers of 63 respondents that were contacted through one particular software vendor's employee and customer base (i.e., Celonis).
