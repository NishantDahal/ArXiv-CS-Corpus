Survey on Error Concealment Strategies and Subjective Testing of 3D Videos

Over the last decade, different technologies to visualize 3D scenes have been introduced and improved. These technologies include stereoscopic, multi-view, integral imaging and holographic types. Despite increasing consumer interest; poor image quality, crosstalk or side effects of 3D displays and also the lack of defined broadcast standards has hampered the advancement of 3D displays to the mass consumer market. Also, in real time transmission of 3DTV sequences over packet-based networks may results in visual quality degradations due to packet loss and others. In the conventional 2D videos different extrapolation and directional interpolation strategies have been used for concealing the missing blocks but in 3D, it is still an emerging field of research. Few studies have been carried out to define the assessment methods of stereoscopic images and videos. But through industrial and commercial perspective, subjective quality evaluation is the most direct way to evaluate human perception on 3DTV systems. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art error concealment strategies and the subjective evaluation of 3D videos and proposes a low complexity frame loss concealment method for the video decoder. Subjective testing on prominent datasets videos and comparison with existing concealment methods show that the proposed method is very much efficient to conceal errors of stereoscopic videos in terms of computation time, comfort and distortion.
