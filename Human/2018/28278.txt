Compound Binary Search Tree and Algorithms

The Binary Search Tree (BST) is average in computer science which supports a compact data structure in memory and oneself even conducts a row of quick algorithms, by which people often apply it in dynamical circumstance. Besides these edges, it is also with weakness on its own structure specially with poor performance at worst case. In this paper, we will develop this data structure into a synthesis to show a series of novel features residing in. Of that, there are new methods invented for raising the performance and efficiency nevertheless some existing ones in logarithm or linear time.
