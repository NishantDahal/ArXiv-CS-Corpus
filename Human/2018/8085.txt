Fingerprint Match in Box

We open source fingerprint Match in Box, a complete end-to-end fingerprint recognition system embedded within a 4 inch cube. Match in Box stands in contrast to a typical bulky and expensive proprietary fingerprint recognition system which requires sending a fingerprint image to an external host for processing and subsequent spoof detection and matching. In particular, Match in Box is a first of a kind, portable, low-cost, and easy-to-assemble fingerprint reader with an enrollment database embedded within the reader's memory and open source fingerprint spoof detector, feature extractor, and matcher all running on the reader's internal vision processing unit (VPU). An onboard touch screen and rechargeable battery pack make this device extremely portable and ideal for applying both fingerprint authentication (1:1 comparison) and fingerprint identification (1:N search) to applications (vaccination tracking, food and benefit distribution programs, human trafficking prevention) in rural communities, especially in developing countries. We also show that Match in Box is suited for capturing neonate fingerprints due to its high resolution (1900 ppi) cameras.
