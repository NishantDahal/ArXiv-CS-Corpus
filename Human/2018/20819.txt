Entanglement Availability Differentiation Service for the Quantum Internet

A fundamental concept of the quantum Internet is quantum entanglement. In a quantum Internet scenario where the legal users of the network have different priority levels or where a differentiation of entanglement availability between the users is a necessity, an entanglement availability service is essential. Here we define the entanglement availability differentiation (EAD) service for the quantum Internet. In the proposed EAD framework, the differentiation is either made in the amount of entanglement with respect to the relative entropy of entanglement associated with the legal users, or in the time domain with respect to the amount of time that is required to establish a maximally entangled system between the legal parties. The framework provides an efficient and easily-implementable solution for the differentiation of entanglement availability in experimental quantum networking scenarios.
