Universal Slope Sets for Upward Planar Drawings

We prove that every set $\mathcal S$ of $Δ$ slopes containing the horizontal slope is universal for $1$-bend upward planar drawings of bitonic $st$-graphs with maximum vertex degree $Δ$, i.e., every such digraph admits a $1$-bend upward planar drawing whose edge segments use only slopes in $\mathcal S$. This result is worst-case optimal in terms of the number of slopes, and, for a suitable choice of $\mathcal S$, it gives rise to drawings with worst-case optimal angular resolution. In addition, we prove that every such set $\mathcal S$ can be used to construct $2$-bend upward planar drawings of $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs with at most $4n-9$ bends in total. Our main tool is a constructive technique that runs in linear time.
