Mapping excellence in national research systems: the case of Italy

The study of the concept of "scientific excellence" and the methods for its measurement and evaluation is taking on increasing importance in the development of research policies in many nations. However, scientific excellence results as difficult to define in both conceptual and operational terms, because of its multi-dimensional and highly complex character. The literature on the theme is limited to few studies of an almost pioneering character. This work intends to contribute to the state of the art by exploring a bibliometric methodology which is effective, simple and inexpensive, and which further identifies "excellent" centers of research by beginning from excellence of the individual researchers affiliated with such centers. The study concentrates on the specific case of public research organizations in Italy, analyzing 109 scientific categories of research in the so called "hard" sciences and identifying 157 centers of excellence operating in 60 of these categories. The findings from this first application of the methodology should be considered exploratory and indicative. With a longer period of observation and the addition of further measurements, making the methodology more robust, it can be extended and adapted to a variety of national and supranational contexts, aiding with policy decisions at various levels.
