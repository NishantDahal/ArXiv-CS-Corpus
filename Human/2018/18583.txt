Study of Switched Max-Link Buffer-Aided Relay Selection for Cooperative MIMO Systems

In this paper, we investigate relay selection for cooperative multiple-antenna systems that are equipped with buffers, which increase the reliability of wireless links. In particular, we present a novel relay selection technique based on switching and the Max-Link protocol that is named Switched Max-Link. We also introduce a novel relay selection criterion based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle denoted maximum minimum distance that is incorporated into. Simulations are then employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed and existing techniques.
