Design of LDPC Codes for the Unequal Power Two-User Gaussian Multiple Access Channel

In this work, we describe an LDPC code design framework for the unequal power two-user Gaussian multiple access channel using EXIT charts. We show that the sum-rate of the LDPC codes designed using our approach can get close to the maximal sum-rate of the two-user Gaussian multiple access channel. Moreover, we provide numerical simulation results that demonstrate the excellent finite-length performance of the designed LDPC codes.
