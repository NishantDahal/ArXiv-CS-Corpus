Imprecise temporal associations and decision support systems

The quick and pervasive infiltration of decision support systems, artificial intelligence, and data mining in consumer electronics and everyday life in general has been significant in recent years. Fields such as UX have been facilitating the integration of such technologies into software and hardware, but the back-end processing is still based on binary foundations. This article describes an approach to mining for imprecise temporal associations among events in data streams, taking into account the very natural concept of approximation. This type of association analysis is likely to lead to more meaningful and actionable decision support systems.
