Age of Information and Throughput in a Shared Access Network with Heterogeneous Traffic

We consider a cognitive shared access scheme consisting of a high priority primary node and a low priority network with $N$ secondary nodes accessing the spectrum. Assuming bursty traffic at the primary node, saturated queues at the secondary nodes, and multipacket reception capabilities at the receivers, we derive analytical expressions of the time average age of information of the primary node and the throughput of the secondary nodes. We formulate two optimization problems, the first aiming to minimize the time average age of information of the primary node subject to an aggregate secondary throughput requirement. The second problem aims to maximize the aggregate secondary throughput of the network subject to a maximum time average staleness constraint. Our results provide guidelines for the design of a multiple access system with multipacket reception capabilities that fulfils both timeliness and throughput requirements.
