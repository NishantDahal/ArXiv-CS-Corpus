Autostackability of Thompson's group $F$

The word problem for Thompson's group $F$ has a solution, but it remains unknown whether $F$ is automatic or has a finite or regular convergent (terminating and confluent) rewriting system. We show that the group $F$ admits a natural extension of these two properties, namely autostackability, and we give an explicit bounded regular convergent prefix-rewriting system for $F$.
