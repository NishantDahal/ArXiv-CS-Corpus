Overcoming the Challenges of Solar Rover Autonomy: Enabling Long-Duration Planetary Navigation

The successes of previous and current Mars rovers have encouraged space agencies worldwide to pursue additional planetary exploration missions with more ambitious navigation goals. For example, NASA's planned Mars Sample Return mission will be a multi-year undertaking that will require a solar-powered rover to drive over 150 metres per sol for approximately three months. This paper reviews the mobility planning framework used by current rovers and surveys the major challenges involved in continuous long-distance navigation on the Red Planet. It also discusses recent work related to environment-aware and energy-aware navigation, and provides a perspective on how such work may eventually allow a solar-powered rover to achieve autonomous long-distance navigation on Mars.
