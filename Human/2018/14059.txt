Matrix Recovery from Rank-One Projection Measurements via Nonconvex Minimization

In this paper, we consider the matrix recovery from rank-one projection measurements proposed in [Cai and Zhang, Ann. Statist., 43(2015), 102-138], via nonconvex minimization. We establish a sufficient identifiability condition, which can guarantee the exact recovery of low-rank matrix via Schatten-$p$ minimization $\min_{X}\|X\|_{S_p}^p$ for $0<p<1$ under affine constraint, and stable recovery of low-rank matrix under $\ell_q$ constraint and Dantzig selector constraint. Our condition is also sufficient to guarantee low-rank matrix recovery via least $q$ minimization $\min_{X}\|\mathcal{A}(X)-b\|_{q}^q$ for $0<q\leq1$. And we also extend our result to Gaussian design distribution, and show that any matrix can be stably recovered for rank-one projection from Gaussian distributions via least $1$ minimization with high probability.
