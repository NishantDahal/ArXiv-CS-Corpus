Interference Mitigation Using Dynamic Frequency Re-use for Dense Femtocell Network Architectures

The next generation network aims to efficiently deploy low cost and low power cellular base station in the subscriber's home environment. For the femtocell deployment, frequency allocation among femtocells and macrocell is big concern to mitigate the interference, and to ensure the best use of the expensive spectrum. There are many sources of interference in integrated femtocell/macrocell networks. Lagging in proper management of interference reduces the system capacity, increases the outage probability, and finally users feel bad quality of experience (QoE). The cost effective interference management technique depends on the size of femtocells deployment. In this paper, firstly we present deployable various possible femtocell network scenarios. We propose the dynamic frequency re-use scheme to mitigate interference for femtocell deployment. For highly dense femtocells, we propose the functionalities of self organizing network (SON) based femtocell network architecture. The outage probability of a femtocell user is analyzed in details. The performances of the proposed schemes for various femtocell deployments are performed using numerical analysis.
