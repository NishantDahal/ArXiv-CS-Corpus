Device-to-Device Aided Multicasting

We consider a device-to-device (D2D) aided multicast channel, where a transmitter wishes to convey a common message to many receivers and these receivers cooperate with each other. We propose a simple computationally efficient scheme requiring only statistical channel knowledge at transmitter. Our analysis in general topologies reveals that, when the number of receivers $K$ grows to infinity, the proposed scheme guarantees a multicast rate of ${1 \over 2} \log_2(1 + β\ln K )$ with high probability for any $β< β^\star$ where $β^\star$ depends on the network topology. This scheme undergoes a phase transition at threshold $β^\star \ln K$ where transmissions are successful/unsuccessful with high probability when the SNR is above/below this threshold. We also analyze the outage rate of the proposed scheme in the same setting.
