A Review of Software-Defined WLANs: Architectures and Central Control Mechanisms

The significant growth in the number of WiFi-enabled devices as well as the increase in the traffic conveyed through wireless local area networks (WLANs) necessitate the adoption of new network control mechanisms. Specifically, dense deployment of access points, client mobility, and emerging QoS demands bring about challenges that cannot be effectively addressed by distributed mechanisms. Recent studies show that software-defined WLANs (SDWLANs) simplify network control, improve QoS provisioning, and lower the deployment cost of new network control mechanisms. In this paper, we present an overview of SDWLAN architectures and provide a qualitative comparison in terms of features such as programmability and virtualization. In addition, we classify and investigate the two important classes of centralized network control mechanisms: (i) association control (AsC) and (ii) channel assignment (ChA). We study the basic ideas employed by these mechanisms, and in particular, we focus on the metrics utilized and the problem formulation techniques proposed. We present a comparison of these mechanisms and identify open research problems.
