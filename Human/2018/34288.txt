Features Extraction Based on an Origami Representation of 3D Landmarks

Feature extraction analysis has been widely investigated during the last decades in computer vision community due to the large range of possible applications. Significant work has been done in order to improve the performance of the emotion detection methods. Classification algorithms have been refined, novel preprocessing techniques have been applied and novel representations from images and videos have been introduced. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method and a novel facial landmarks' representation aiming to improve the facial emotion detection accuracy. We apply our novel methodology on the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset and other datasets for affect classification based on Action Units (AU). The performance evaluation demonstrates an improvement on facial emotion classification (accuracy and F1 score) that indicates the superiority of the proposed methodology.
