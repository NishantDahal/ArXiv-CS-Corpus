Decidability of Timed Communicating Automata

We study the reachability problem for networks of timed communicating processes. Each process is a timed automaton communicating with other processes by exchanging messages over unbounded FIFO channels. Messages carry clocks which are checked at the time of transmission and reception with suitable timing constraints. Each automaton can only access its set of local clocks and message clocks of sent/received messages. Time is dense and all clocks evolve at the same rate. Our main contribution is a complete characterisation of decidable and undecidable communication topologies generalising and unifying previous work. From a technical point of view, we use quantifier elimination and a reduction to counter automata with registers.
