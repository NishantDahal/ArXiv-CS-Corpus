Perturbation Resilient Clustering for $k$-Center and Related Problems via LP Relaxations

We consider clustering in the perturbation resilience model that has
been studied since the work of Bilu and Linial [ICS, 2010] and
Awasthi, Blum and Sheffet [Inf. Proc. Lett., 2012]. A clustering instance
$I$ is said to be $α$-perturbation resilient if the optimal
solution does not change when the pairwise distances are modified by
a factor of $α$ and the perturbed distances satisfy the metric
property --- this is the metric perturbation resilience property
introduced in Angelidakis et. al. [STOC, 2010] and a weaker requirement than prior
models. We make two high-level contributions.
 1) We show that the natural LP relaxation of $k$-center and
asymmetric $k$-center is integral for $2$-perturbation resilient
instances. We belive that demonstrating the goodness of standard
LP relaxations complements existing results that are based on combinatorial algorithms
designed for the perturbation model.
 2) We define a simple new model of perturbation resilience for
clustering with \emph{outliers}. Using this model we show that the
unified MST and dynamic programming based algorithm proposed by Angelidakis et. al. [STOC, 2010]
exactly solves the clustering with outliers
problem for several common center based objectives (like $k$-center,
$k$-means, $k$-median) when the instances is $2$-perturbation resilient.
We further show that a natural LP relxation is integral for
$2$-perturbation resilient instances of \kcenter with outliers.
