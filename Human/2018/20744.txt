Integrity Authentication for SQL Query Evaluation on Outsourced Databases: A Survey

Spurred by the development of cloud computing, there has been considerable recent interest in the Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) paradigm. Users lacking in expertise or computational resources can outsource their data and database management needs to a third-party service provider. Outsourcing, however, raises an important issue of result integrity: how can the client verify with lightweight overhead that the query results returned by the service provider are correct (i.e., the same as the results of query execution locally)? This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the progress on the current approaches for result integrity of SQL query evaluation in the DaaS model. The survey also includes some potential future research directions for result integrity verification of the outsourced computations.
