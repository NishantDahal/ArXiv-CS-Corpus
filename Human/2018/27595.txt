Accelerator Virtualization in Fog Computing: Moving From the Cloud to the Edge

Hardware accelerators are available on the Cloud for enhanced analytics. Next generation Clouds aim to bring enhanced analytics using accelerators closer to user devices at the edge of the network for improving Quality-of-Service by minimizing end-to-end latencies and response times. The collective computing model that utilizes resources at the Cloud-Edge continuum in a multi-tier hierarchy comprising the Cloud, the Edge and user devices is referred to as Fog computing. This article identifies challenges and opportunities in making accelerators accessible at the Edge. A holistic view of the Fog architecture is key to pursuing meaningful research in this area.
