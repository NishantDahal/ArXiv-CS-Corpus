Toward incremental FIB aggregation with quick selections (FAQS)

Several approaches to mitigating the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) overflow problem were developed and software solutions using FIB aggregation are of particular interest. One of the greatest concerns to deploy these algorithms to real networks is their high running time and heavy computational overhead to handle thousands of FIB updates every second. In this work, we manage to use a single tree traversal to implement faster aggregation and update handling algorithm with much lower memory footprint than other existing work. We utilize 6-year realistic IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables from 2011 to 2016 to evaluate the performance of our algorithm with various metrics. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that IPv6 FIB aggregation has been performed. Our new solution is 2.53 and 1.75 times as fast as the-state-of-the-art FIB aggregation algorithm for IPv4 and IPv6 FIBs, respectively, while achieving a near-optimal FIB aggregation ratio.
