Game-Theoretical Strategy of Robot in the Area with Dynamical Obstacles

The effectiveness of a robot manipulation to a large extent is determined by the speed of making this or that movement needed for carrying out the task. Accordingly to this the problem of optimal robot control is often subdivided into two subproblems solved separately. In an autonomous regime the trajectory planning is fulfilled for providing the robot movement time close to the minimal.
