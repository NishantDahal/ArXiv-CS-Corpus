An Edge Extrusion-Approach to Generate Extruded Miura-Ori and Its Double Tiling Origami Patterns

This paper proposes a family of origami tessellations called extruded Miura-Ori, whose folded state lies between two parallel planes with some faces on the planes, potentially useful for folded core materials because of face bonding. An extruded Miura-Ori is obtained by cutting Miura-Ori apart along the edges and face diagonals before inserting the extrusion of the section edges. We compute the extrusion direction to obtain a valid extruded Miura-Ori. The extruded Miura-Ori usually has three valid states. We analyse the third state (final folded state) in depth to show that a continuous family of parameters can produce origami tessellations that can completely tile the top and bottom planes.
