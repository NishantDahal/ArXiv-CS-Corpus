Recommendation System of Grants-in-Aid for Researchers by using JSPS Keyword

An acquisition of a research grant is important for the researchers to conduct a research. The university will build up the organization and reinforce the acquirement of external funds. The researcher becomes aware of grant information and should investigate what kinds of grant it is. Therefore, the staff at the support center for the Industry-Academia collaboration will classify the grant into some categories according to the research fields. However, the task is difficult to realize the matching of the research fields, because the expert knowledge is required to completely classify them. We have developed recommendation system of Grant-in-Aid system for researchers by using JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) keywords. The characteristic keywords are extracted from web sites and then the association rules between researchers and grants are determined in the IF-THEN rule format. This paper discusses the experimental results by using the developed system.
