Topological Data Analysis of Single-cell Hi-C Contact Maps

In this article, we show how the recent statistical techniques developed in Topological Data Analysis for the Mapper algorithm can be extended and leveraged to formally define and statistically quantify the presence of topological structures coming from biological phenomena in datasets of CCC contact maps.
