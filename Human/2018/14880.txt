Key Enabling Technologies for Secure and Scalable Future Fog-IoT Architecture: A Survey

Fog or Edge computing has recently attracted broad attention from both industry and academia. It is deemed as a paradigm shift from the current centralized cloud computing model and could potentially bring a "Fog-IoT" architecture that would significantly benefit the future ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) systems and applications. However, it takes a series of key enabling technologies including emerging technologies to realize such a vision. In this article, we will survey these key enabling technologies with specific focuses on security and scalability, which are two very important and much-needed characteristics for future large-scale deployment. We aim to draw an overall big picture of the future for the research and development in these areas.
