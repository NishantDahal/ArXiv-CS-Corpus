Modelling Evaluation of MPLS using Physical and virtual Network on GNS3

The Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is an emerging technology which have quality, effectiveness and administration quality. On the contrary, traditional network inside part passage steering conventions ruin the viable acknowledgment of modern activity designing approaches in legacy IP systems. Virtualization of the network could easily be assuring the network performance and virtual network are logically connected with one physical machine so that data could easily be send and get information from one virtual machine to the next machine. The purpose of this Paper is to analyse the traffic of MPLS using physical and virtual networks. This Paper will show that MPLS could also be run on physical and virtual networks. MPLS is running nowadays to provide local area network speed into the wide area Network.
