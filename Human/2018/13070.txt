Improving Object Counting with Heatmap Regulation

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to improve one-look regression models for object counting from images. We use class activation map visualizations to illustrate the drawbacks of learning a pure one-look regression model for a counting task. Based on these insights, we enhance one-look regression counting models by regulating activation maps from the final convolution layer of the network with coarse ground-truth activation maps generated from simple dot annotations. We call this strategy heatmap regulation (HR). We show that this simple enhancement effectively suppresses false detections generated by the corresponding one-look baseline model and also improves the performance in terms of false negatives. Evaluations are performed on four different counting datasets --- two for car counting (CARPK, PUCPR+), one for crowd counting (WorldExpo) and another for biological cell counting (VGG-Cells). Adding HR to a simple VGG front-end improves performance on all these benchmarks compared to a simple one-look baseline model and results in state-of-the-art performance for car counting.
