A Cache-based Optimizer for Querying Enhanced Knowledge Bases

With recent emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), information collection on our physical world and environment can be achieved at a much higher granularity and such detailed knowledge will play a critical role in improving the productivity, operational effectiveness, decision making, and in identifying new business models for economic growth. Efficient discovery and querying such knowledge remains a key challenge due to the limited capability and high latency of connections to the interfaces of knowledge bases, e.g., the SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we present a querying system on SPARQL endpoints for knowledge bases that performs queries faster than the state-of-the-art systems. Our system features a cache-based optimization scheme to improve querying performance by prefetching and caching the results of predicted potential queries. The evaluations on query sets from SPARQL endpoints of DBpedia and Linked GeoData showcase the effectiveness of our approach.
