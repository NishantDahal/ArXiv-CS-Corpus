Performance Evaluation of Shared Hosting Security Methods

Shared hosting is a kind of web hosting in which multiple websites reside on one webserver. It is cost-effective and makes the administration easier for websites' owners. However, shared hosting has some performance and security issues. In default shared hosting configuration, all websites' scripts are executed under the webserver's user account regardless of their owners. Therefore, a website is able to access other websites' resources. This security problem arises from lack of proper isolation between different websites hosted on the same webserver. In this survey, we have examined different methods for handling mentioned security issue. Also we evaluated the performance of mentioned methods. Finally, we evaluated performance of these methods with various configurations.
