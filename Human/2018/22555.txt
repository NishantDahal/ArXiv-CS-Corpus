CoCo: Compact and Optimized Consolidation of Modularized Service Function Chains in NFV

The modularization of Service Function Chains (SFCs) in Network Function Virtualization (NFV) could introduce significant performance overhead and resource efficiency degradation due to introducing frequent packet transfer and consuming much more hardware resources. In response, we exploit the lightweight and individually scalable features of elements in Modularized SFCs (MSFCs) and propose CoCo, a compact and optimized consolidation framework for MSFC in NFV. CoCo addresses the above problems in two ways. First, CoCo Optimized Placer pays attention to the problem of which elements to consolidate and provides a performance-aware placement algorithm to place MSFCs compactly and optimize the global packet transfer cost. Second, CoCo Individual Scaler innovatively introduces a push-aside scaling up strategy to avoid degrading performance and taking up new CPU cores. To support MSFC consolidation, CoCo also provides an automatic runtime scheduler to ensure fairness when elements are consolidated on CPU core. Our evaluation results show that CoCo achieves significant performance improvement and efficient resource utilization.
