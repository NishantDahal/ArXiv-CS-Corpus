Exploiting Multiple Access in Clustered Millimeter Wave Networks: NOMA or OMA?

In this paper, we introduce a clustered millimeter wave network with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where the base station (BS) is located at the center of each cluster and all users follow a Poisson Cluster Process. To provide a realistic directional beamforming, an actual antenna pattern is deployed at all BSs. We provide a nearest-random scheme, in which near user is the closest node to the corresponding BS and far user is selected at random, to appraise the coverage performance and universal throughput of our system. Novel closed-form expressions are derived under a loose network assumption. Moreover, we present several Monte Carlo simulations and numerical results, which show that: 1) NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access regarding the system rate; 2) the coverage probability is proportional to the number of possible NOMA users and a negative relationship with the variance of intra-cluster receivers; and 3) an optimal number of the antenna elements is existed for maximizing the system throughput.
