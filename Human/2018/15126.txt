Performance evaluation for CRUD operations in asynchronously replicated document oriented database

NoSQL databases are becoming increasingly popular as more developers seek new ways for storing information. The popularity of these databases has risen due to their flexibility and scalability needed in domains like Big Data and Cloud Computing. This paper examines asynchronous replication, one of the key features for a scalable and flexible system. Three of the most popular Document-Oriented Databases, MongoDB, CouchDB, and Couchbase, are examined. For testing, the execution time for CRUD operations for a single database instance and for a distributed environment with two nodes is taken into account and the results are compared with tests outcomes obtained for three relational database management systems: Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
