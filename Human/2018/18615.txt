DLOPT: Deep Learning Optimization Library

Deep learning hyper-parameter optimization is a tough task. Finding an appropriate network configuration is a key to success, however most of the times this labor is roughly done. In this work we introduce a novel library to tackle this problem, the Deep Learning Optimization Library: DLOPT. We briefly describe its architecture and present a set of use examples.
