Geographical veracity of indicators derived from mobile phone data

In this contribution we summarize insights on the geographical veracity of using mobile phone data to create (statistical) indicators. We focus on problems that persist with spatial allocation, spatial delineation and spatial aggregation of information obtained from mobile phone data. For each of the cases, we offer insights from our works on a French CDR dataset and propose both short and long term solutions. As such, we aim at offering a list of challenges, and a roadmap for future work on the topic.
