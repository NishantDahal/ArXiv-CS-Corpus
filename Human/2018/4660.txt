The rotating normal form of braids is regular

Defined on Birman-Ko-Lee monoids, the rotating normal form has strong connections with the Dehornoy's braid ordering. It can be seen as a process for selecting between all the representative words of a Birman-Ko-Lee braid a particular one, called rotating word. In this paper we construct, for all n   2, a finite-state automaton which recognizes rotating words on n strands, proving that the rotating normal form is regular. As a consequence we obtain the regularity of a $Ïƒ$-definite normal form defined on the whole braid group.
