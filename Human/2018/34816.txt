Research on the Security of Blockchain Data: A Survey

With the more and more extensive application of blockchain, blockchain security has been widely concerned by the society and deeply studied by scholars. Moreover, the security of blockchain data directly affects the security of various applications of blockchain. In this survey, we perform a comprehensive classification and summary of the security of blockchain data. First, we present classification of blockchain data attacks. Subsequently, we present the attacks and defenses of blockchain data in terms of privacy, availability, integrity and controllability. Data privacy attacks present data leakage or data obtained by attackers through analysis. Data availability attacks present abnormal or incorrect access to blockchain data. Data integrity attacks present blockchain data being tampered. Data controllability attacks present blockchain data accidentally manipulated by smart contract vulnerability. Finally, we present several important open research directions to identify follow-up studies in this area.
