Experimental Evaluation of Parameterized Algorithms for Graph Separation Problems: Half-Integral Relaxations and Matroid-based Kernelization

In the recent years we have witnessed a rapid development of new algorithmic techniques for parameterized algorithms for graph separation problems. We present experimental evaluation of two cornerstone theoretical results in this area: linear-time branching algorithms guided by half-integral relaxations and kernelization (preprocessing) routines based on representative sets in matroids. A side contribution is a new set of benchmark instances of (unweighted, vertex-deletion) Multiway Cut.
