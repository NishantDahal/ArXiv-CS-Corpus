Energy-Efficiency Gains of Caching for Interference Channels

This paper initiates the study of energy-efficiency gains provided by caching. We focus on the cache-aided Gaussian interference channel in the low-SNR regime. We propose a strategy that creates content overlaps at the transmitter caches to allow for co-operation between the transmitters. This co-operation yields a beamforming gain, which has to be traded off against a multicasting gain. We evaluate the performance of this strategy and show its approximate optimality in both the single-receiver case and the single-transmitter case.
