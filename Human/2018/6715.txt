Efficient V2V Communication Scheme for 5G MmWave Hyper-Connected CAVs

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) require continuous access to sensory data to perform complex high-speed maneuvers and advanced trajectory planning. High priority CAVs are particularly reliant on extended perception horizon facilitated by sensory data exchange between CAVs. Existing technologies such as the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) are ill-equipped to provide advanced cooperative perception service. This creates the need for more sophisticated technologies such as the 5G Millimetre-Waves (mmWaves). In this work, we propose a distributed Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) mmWaves association scheme operating in a heterogeneous manner. Our system utilises the information exchanged within the DSRC frequency band to bootstrap the best CAV pairs formation. Using a Stable Fixtures Matching Game, we form V2V multipoint-to-multipoint links. Compared to more traditional point-to-point links, our system provides almost twice as much sensory data exchange capacity for high priority CAVs while doubling the mmWaves channel utilisation for all the vehicles in the network.
