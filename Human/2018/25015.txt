Extending Mandelbox Fractals with Shape Inversions

The Mandelbox is a recently discovered class of escape-time fractals which use a conditional combination of reflection, spherical inversion, scaling, and translation to transform points under iteration. In this paper we introduce a new extension to Mandelbox fractals which replaces spherical inversion with a more generalized shape inversion. We then explore how this technique can be used to generate new fractals in 2D, 3D, and 4D.
