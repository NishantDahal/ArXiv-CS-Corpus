Entrenamiento de una red neuronal para el reconocimiento de imagenes de lengua de senas capturadas con sensores de profundidad

Due to the growth of the population with hearing problems, devices have been developed that facilitate the inclusion of deaf people in society, using technology as a communication tool, such as vision systems. Then, a solution to this problem is presented using neural networks and autoencoders for the classification of American Sign Language images. As a result, 99.5% accuracy and an error of 0.01684 were obtained for image classification
