Constant-approximation algorithms for highly connected multi-dominating sets in unit disk graphs

Given an undirected graph on a node set $V$ and positive integers $k$ and $m$, a $k$-connected $m$-dominating set ($(k,m)$-CDS) is defined as a subset $S$ of $V$ such that each node in $V \setminus S$ has at least $m$ neighbors in $S$, and a $k$-connected subgraph is induced by $S$. The weighted $(k,m)$-CDS problem is to find a minimum weight $(k,m)$-CDS in a given node-weighted graph. The problem is called the unweighted $(k,m)$-CDS problem if the objective is to minimize the cardinality of a $(k,m)$-CDS. These problems have been actively studied for unit disk graphs, motivated by the application of constructing a virtual backbone in a wireless ad hoc network. However, constant-approximation algorithms are known only for $k \leq 3$ in the unweighted $(k,m)$-CDS problem, and for $(k,m)=(1,1)$ in the weighted $(k,m)$-CDS problem. In this paper, we consider the case in which $m \geq k$, and we present a simple $O(5^k k!)$-approximation algorithm for the unweighted $(k,m)$-CDS problem, and a primal-dual $O(k^2 \log k)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted $(k,m)$-CDS problem. Both algorithms achieve constant approximation factors when $k$ is a fixed constant.
