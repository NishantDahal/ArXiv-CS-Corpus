Optimizing Multi-hop Mechanism for the Long Range Wide Area Network

Long Range (LoRa) is a modem technology for wireless communication in the Internet of Things (IoT), which trades off low data-rate for low power consumption. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has an open specification that determines the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for LoRa networks. This paper contributes a simulation module in Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to evaluate the limitation of LoRaWAN in various metrics. The result shows the performance of LoRaWAN in a simulation environment and a large scale scenario, indicating the feature of flexible propagation range on physical layer, and limited channel capacity on the data-link layer. The feasibility of optimized multi-hop in LoRaWAN is analyzed. Based on the simulation result, a multi-hop mechanism driven by spreading factor is proposed, not only to extend the network coverage but to reduce the channel load. The novel approach takes benefit of the dynamic feature of LoRa and estimates optimized forwarding hops with parameter configuration. The result shows that Time on Air can be significantly decreased.
