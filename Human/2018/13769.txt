Squared chromatic number without claws or large cliques

Let $G$ be a claw-free graph on $n$ vertices with clique number $ω$, and consider the chromatic number $χ(G^2)$ of the square $G^2$ of $G$. Writing $χ'_s(d)$ for the supremum of $χ(L^2)$ over the line graphs $L$ of simple graphs of maximum degree at most $d$, we prove that $χ(G^2)\le χ'_s(ω)$ for $ω\in \{3,4\}$. For $ω=3$, this implies the sharp bound $χ(G^2) \leq 10$. For $ω=4$, this implies $χ(G^2)\leq 22$, which is within $2$ of the conjectured best bound. This work is motivated by a strengthened form of a conjecture of Erdős and Nešetřil.
