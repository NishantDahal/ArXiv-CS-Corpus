Deep Learning-based Intelligent Dual Connectivity for Mobility Management in Dense Network

Ultra-dense network deployment has been proposed as a key technique for achieving capacity goals in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication system. However, the deployment of smaller cells inevitably leads to more frequent handovers, thus making mobility management more challenging and reducing the capacity gains offered by the dense network deployment. In order to fully reap the gains for mobile users in such a network environment, we propose an intelligent dual connectivity mechanism for mobility management through deep learning-based mobility prediction. We first use LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) algorithm, one of deep learning algorithms, to learn every user equipment's (UE's) mobility pattern from its historical trajectories and predict its movement trends in the future. Based on the corresponding prediction results, the network will judge whether a handover is required for the UE. For the handover case, a dual connection will be established for the related UE. Thus, the UE can get the radio signal from two base stations in the handover process. Simulation results verify that the proposed intelligent dual connectivity mechanism can significantly improve the quality of service of mobile users in the handover process while guaranteeing the network energy efficiency.
