Balanced k-means for Parallel Geometric Partitioning

Mesh partitioning is an indispensable tool for efficient parallel numerical simulations. Its goal is to minimize communication between the processes of a simulation while achieving load balance. Established graph-based partitioning tools yield a high solution quality; however, their scalability is limited. Geometric approaches usually scale better, but their solution quality may be unsatisfactory for `non-trivial' mesh topologies.
  In this paper, we present a scalable version of $k$-means that is adapted to yield balanced clusters. Balanced $k$-means constitutes the core of our new partitioning algorithm Geographer. Bootstrapping of initial centers is performed with space-filling curves, leading to fast convergence of the subsequent balanced k-means algorithm.
  Our experiments with up to 16384 MPI processes on numerous benchmark meshes show the following: (i) Geographer produces partitions with a lower communication volume than state-of-the-art geometric partitioners from the Zoltan package; (ii) Geographer scales well on large inputs; (iii) a Delaunay mesh with a few billion vertices and edges can be partitioned in a few seconds.
