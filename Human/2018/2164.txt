Randomised enumeration of small witnesses using a decision oracle

Many combinatorial problems involve determining whether a universe of $n$ elements contains a witness consisting of $k$ elements which have some specified property. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the decision and enumeration versions of such problems: efficient methods are known for transforming a decision algorithm into a search procedure that finds a single witness, but even finding a second witness is not so straightforward in general. We show that, if the decision version of the problem can be solved in time $f(k) \cdot poly(n)$, there is a randomised algorithm which enumerates all witnesses in time $e^{k + o(k)} \cdot f(k) \cdot poly(n) \cdot N$, where $N$ is the total number of witnesses. If the decision version of the problem is solved by a randomised algorithm which may return false negatives, then the same method allows us to output a list of witnesses in which any given witness will be included with high probability. The enumeration algorithm also gives rise to an efficient algorithm to count the total number of witnesses when this number is small.
