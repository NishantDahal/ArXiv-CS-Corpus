On polycyclic codes over a finite chain ring

Galois images of polycyclic codes over a finite chain ring $S$ and their annihilator dual are investigated. The case when a polycyclic codes is Galois-disjoint over the ring $S,$ is characterized and, the trace codes and restrictions of free polycyclic codes over $S$ are also determined givind an analogue of Delsarte theorem among trace map, any S -linear code and its annihilator dual.
