Chart Parsing Multimodal Grammars

The short note describes the chart parser for multimodal type-logical grammars which has been developed in conjunction with the type-logical treebank for French. The chart parser presents an incomplete but fast implementation of proof search for multimodal type-logical grammars using the "deductive parsing" framework. Proofs found can be transformed to natural deduction proofs.
