Creating a New Persian Poet Based on Machine Learning

In this article we describe an application of Machine Learning (ML) and Linguistic Modeling to generate persian poems. In fact we teach machine by reading and learning persian poems to generate fake poems in the same style of the original poems. As two well known poets we used Hafez (1310-1390) and Saadi (1210-1292) poems. First we feed the machine with Hafez poems to generate fake poems with the same style and then we feed the machine with the both Hafez and Saadi poems to generate a new style poems which is combination of these two poets styles with emotional (Hafez) and rational (Saadi) elements. This idea of combination of different styles with ML opens new gates for extending the treasure of past literature of different cultures. Results show with enough memory, processing power and time it is possible to generate reasonable good poems.
