Uplink Performance Analysis in D2D-Enabled mmWave Cellular Networks with Clustered Users

In this paper, an analytical framework is provided to analyze the uplink performance of device-to-device (D2D)-enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks with clustered D2D user equipments (UEs). Locations of cellular UEs are modeled as a Poison Point Process (PPP), while locations of potential D2D UEs are modeled as a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP). Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) outage probabilities are derived for both cellular and D2D links using tools from stochastic geometry. The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated into the outage analysis by employing a flexible mode selection scheme. Also, the effect of beamforming alignment errors on the outage probability is investigated to get insight on the performance in practical scenarios. Moreover, area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the entire network is determined for both underlay and overlay types of sharing. Optimal spectrum partition factor is determined for overlay sharing by considering the optimal weighted proportional fair spectrum partition.
