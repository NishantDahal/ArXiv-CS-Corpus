DialPlate: Enhancing the Detection of Smooth Pursuits Eye Movements Using Linear Regression

We introduce and evaluate a novel approach for detecting smooth pursuit eye movements that increases the number of distinguishable targets and is more robust against false positives. Being natural and calibration-free, Pursuits has been gaining popularity in the past years. At the same time, current implementations show poor performance when more than eight on-screen targets are being used, thus limiting its applicability. Our approach (1) leverages the slope of a regression line, and (2) introduces a minimum signal duration that improves both the new and the traditional detection method. After introducing the approach as well as the implementation, we compare it to the traditional correlation-based Pursuits detection method. We tested the approach up to 24 targets and show that, if accepting a similar error rate, nearly twice as many targets can be distinguished compared to state of the art. For fewer targets, accuracy increases significantly. We believe our approach will enable more robust pursuit-based user interfaces, thus making it valuable for both researchers and practitioners.
