Bounds on the number of 2-level polytopes, cones and configurations

We prove an upper bound of the form $2^{O(d^2 \mathrm{polylog}\,d)}$ on the number of affine (resp. linear) equivalence classes of, by increasing order of generality, 2-level d-polytopes, d-cones and d-configurations. This in particular answers positively a conjecture of Bohn et al. on 2-level polytopes. We obtain our upper bound by relating affine (resp. linear) equivalence classes of 2-level d-polytopes, d-cones and d-configurations to faces of the correlation cone. We complement this with a $2^{Î©(d^2)}$ lower bound, by estimating the number of nonequivalent stable set polytopes of bipartite graphs.
