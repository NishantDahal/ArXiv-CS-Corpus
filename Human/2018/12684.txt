Choice revision on belief bases

In this contribution we explore choice revision, a sort of belief change in which the new information is represented by a set of sentences and the agent could accept some of the sentences while rejecting the others. We propose a generalized version of expansion operation called partial expansion for developing models of choice revision. By using the partial expansion and two multiple contraction operations previously introduced in the literature, we construct two kinds of choice revision on belief bases. For each of them we propose a set of postulates and prove a partial or full representation theorem. Furthermore, we investigate the operations of making up one's mind derived from these two kinds of choice revision and also give the associated representation theorems.
