Towards Low-Latency and Ultra-Reliable Virtual Reality

Virtual Reality (VR) is expected to be one of the killer-applications in 5G networks. However, many technical bottlenecks and challenges need to be overcome to facilitate its wide adoption. In particular, VR requirements in terms of high-throughput, low-latency and reliable communication call for innovative solutions and fundamental research cutting across several disciplines. In view of this, this article discusses the challenges and enablers for ultra-reliable and low-latency VR. Furthermore, in an interactive VR gaming arcade case study, we show that a smart network design that leverages the use of mmWave communication, edge computing and proactive caching can achieve the future vision of VR over wireless.
