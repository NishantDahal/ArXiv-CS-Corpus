Effective throughput of MISO systems over $κ-μ$ shadowed fading channels: MGF based analysis

The effective throughput of multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless communication systems over $κ-μ$ shadowed fading channels is analysed. To obtain exact closed-from expression, the moment generating function (MGF) of the instantaneous signal to noise ratio (SNR) with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) transmit antennas is employed. In addition, a special case of integer values for the fading parameter is performed to simplify the derived expression. The asymptotic behaviour of the effective throughput at high values of SNR is also studied. The Monte Carlo simulations and the numerical results are presented to verify the validation of our analysis.
