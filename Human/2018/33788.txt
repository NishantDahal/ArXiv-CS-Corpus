Polar-like Codes and Asymptotic Tradeoff among Block Length, Code Rate, and Error Probability

A general framework is proposed that includes polar codes over arbitrary channels with arbitrary kernels. The asymptotic tradeoff among block length $N$, code rate $R$, and error probability $P$ is analyzed.
  Given a tradeoff between $N,P$ and a tradeoff between $N,R$, we return an interpolating tradeoff among $N,R,P$ (Theorem 5). $\def\Capacity{\text{Capacity}}$Quantitatively, if $P=\exp(-N^{β^*})$ is possible for some $β^*$ and if $R=\Capacity-N^{1/μ^*}$ is possible for some $1/μ^*$, then $(P,R)=(\exp(-N^{β'}),\Capacity-N^{-1/μ'})$ is possible for some pair $(β',1/μ')$ determined by $β^*$, $1/μ^*$, and auxiliary information. In fancy words, an error exponent regime tradeoff plus a scaling exponent regime tradeoff implies a moderate deviations regime tradeoff.
  The current world records are: [arXiv:1304.4321][arXiv:1501.02444][arXiv:1806.02405] analyzing Arıkan's codes over BEC; [arXiv:1706.02458] analyzing Arıkan's codes over AWGN; and [arXiv:1802.02718][arXiv:1810.04298] analyzing general codes over general channels. An attempt is made to generalize all at once (Section IX).
  As a corollary, a grafted variant of polar coding almost catches up the code rate and error probability of random codes with complexity slightly larger than $N\log N$ over BEC. In particular, $(P,R)=(\exp(-N^{.33}),\Capacity-N^{-.33})$ is possible (Corollary 10). In fact, all points in this triangle are possible $(β',1/μ')$-pairs. $$
