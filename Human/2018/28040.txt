Interface Selection for Power Management in UMTS/WLAN Overlaying Network

The multiple choices of access networks offer different opportunities and overcome the limitations of other technologies. Optimal selection of interface is a big challenge for multiple interfaces supported mobile terminals to make a seamless handover and to optimize the power consumption. Seamless handover, resource management, and CAC to support QoS and multiple interface management to reduce power consumption in mobile terminal are the most important issues for the UMTS/WLAN overlaying network. The access of both interfaces simultaneously can reduce the handover latency and data loss in heterogeneous handover. The MN may maintain one interface connection while other interface can be used for handover process. But the access of both interfaces increases the consumption of power in MN. In this paper we present an efficient interface selection scheme including interface selection algorithms, interface selection mechanism and CAC considering battery power consumption for overlaying networks. MN's battery power level and provision of QoS/QoE in the target interface are considered as important parameters for our interface selection algorithm.
