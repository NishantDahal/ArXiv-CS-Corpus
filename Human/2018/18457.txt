Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization for UAV-Enabled Mobile Relaying

This paper investigates the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem for unmanned aerial vehicle enabled mobile relaying system, where a high-mobility UAV is exploited to assist delivering the confidential information from a ground source to a legitimate ground destination with the direct link blocked, in the presence of a potential eavesdropper. We aim to maximize SEE of the UAV by jointly optimizing the communication scheduling, power allocation, and UAV trajectory over a finite time horizon. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem that is challenging to be solved optimally. To make the problem tractable, we decompose the problem into three subproblems, and propose an efficient iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the subproblems. In addition, two special cases are considered as benchmarks in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the SEE of the UAV, as compared to the benchmarks
