Text-based Passwords Generated From Topological Graphic Passwords

Topological graphic passwords (Topsnut-gpws) are one of graph-type passwords, but differ from the existing graphical passwords, since Topsnut-gpws are saved in computer by algebraic matrices. We focus on the transformation between text-based passwords (TB-paws) and Topsnut-gpws in this article. Several methods for generating TB-paws from Topsnut-gpws are introduced; these methods are based on topological structures and graph coloring/labellings, such that authentications must have two steps: one is topological structure authentication, and another is text-based authentication. Four basic topological structure authentications are introduced and many text-based authentications follow Topsnut-gpws. Our methods are based on algebraic, number theory and graph theory, many of them can be transformed into polynomial algorithms. A new type of matrices for describing Topsnut-gpws is created here, and such matrices can produce TB-paws in complex forms and longer bytes. Estimating the space of TB-paws made by Topsnut-gpws is very important for application. We propose to encrypt dynamic networks and try to face: (1) thousands of nodes and links of dynamic networks; (2) large numbers of Topsnut-gpws generated by machines rather than human's hands. As a try, we apply spanning trees of dynamic networks and graphic groups (Topsnut-groups) to approximate the solutions of these two problems. We present some unknown problems in the end of the article for further research.
