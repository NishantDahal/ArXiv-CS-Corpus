Consistent sets of lines with no colorful incidence

We consider incidences among colored sets of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and examine whether the existence of certain concurrences between lines of $k$ colors force the existence of at least one concurrence between lines of $k+1$ colors. This question is relevant for problems in 3D reconstruction in computer vision.
