Covering many points with a small-area box

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. We show how to find, for a given integer $k>0$, the smallest-area axis-parallel rectangle that covers $k$ points of $P$ in $O(nk^2 \log n+ n\log^2 n)$ time. We also consider the problem of, given a value $α>0$, covering as many points of $P$ as possible with an axis-parallel rectangle of area at most $α$. For this problem we give a probabilistic $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation that works in near-linear time: In $O((n/\varepsilon^4)\log^3 n \log (1/\varepsilon))$ time we find an axis-parallel rectangle of area at most $α$ that, with high probability, covers at least $(1-\varepsilon)\mathrm{κ^*}$ points, where $\mathrm{κ^*}$ is the maximum possible number of points that could be covered.
