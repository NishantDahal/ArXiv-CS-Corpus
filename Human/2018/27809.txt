Probabilistic Clustering Using Maximal Matrix Norm Couplings

In this paper, we present a local information theoretic approach to explicitly learn probabilistic clustering of a discrete random variable. Our formulation yields a convex maximization problem for which it is NP-hard to find the global optimum. In order to algorithmically solve this optimization problem, we propose two relaxations that are solved via gradient ascent and alternating maximization. Experiments on the MSR Sentence Completion Challenge, MovieLens 100K, and Reuters21578 datasets demonstrate that our approach is competitive with existing techniques and worthy of further investigation.
