Unsupervised Machine Commenting with Neural Variational Topic Model

Article comments can provide supplementary opinions and facts for readers, thereby increase the attraction and engagement of articles. Therefore, automatically commenting is helpful in improving the activeness of the community, such as online forums and news websites. Previous work shows that training an automatic commenting system requires large parallel corpora. Although part of articles are naturally paired with the comments on some websites, most articles and comments are unpaired on the Internet. To fully exploit the unpaired data, we completely remove the need for parallel data and propose a novel unsupervised approach to train an automatic article commenting model, relying on nothing but unpaired articles and comments. Our model is based on a retrieval-based commenting framework, which uses news to retrieve comments based on the similarity of their topics. The topic representation is obtained from a neural variational topic model, which is trained in an unsupervised manner. We evaluate our model on a news comment dataset. Experiments show that our proposed topic-based approach significantly outperforms previous lexicon-based models. The model also profits from paired corpora and achieves state-of-the-art performance under semi-supervised scenarios.
