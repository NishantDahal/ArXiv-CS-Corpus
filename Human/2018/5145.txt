Path loss model modification for various gains and directions of antennas

Emerging telecommunication technologies like 5G, green communications, and massive MIMO contribute to the use of directional antennas and beamforming. For this reason, modern propagation models should consider directional antennas with different beam widths, gains and radiation pattern directions. Most of the available propagation models are based on omnidirectional or isotropic antennas. A proposition to solve this problem is an empirical path loss model that considers the different types of antennas. This model assumes that the transmitting and receiving antenna beams are directing each other. In this paper, we propose modifying this model by determining attenuation for any direction of the antenna patterns. For this aim, the multi-elliptic channel model is used.
