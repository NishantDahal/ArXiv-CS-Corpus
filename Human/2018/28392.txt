Towards WARSHIP: Combining Components of Brain-Inspired Computing of RSH for Image Super Resolution

Evolution of deep learning shows that some algorithmic tricks are more durable , while others are not. To the best of our knowledge, we firstly summarize 5 more durable and complete deep learning components for vision, that is, WARSHIP. Moreover, we give a biological overview of WARSHIP, emphasizing brain-inspired computing of WARSHIP. As a step towards WARSHIP, our case study of image super resolution combines 3 components of RSH to deploy a CNN model of WARSHIP-XZNet, which performs a happy medium between speed and performance.
