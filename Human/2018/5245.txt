Terahertz Technologies to Deliver Optical Network Quality of Experience in Wireless Systems Beyond 5G

This article discusses the basic system architecture for terahertz (THz) wireless links with bandwidths of more than 50 GHz into optical networks. New design principles and breakthrough technologies are required in order to demonstrate Tbps data-rates at near zero-latency using the proposed system concept. Specifically, we present the concept of designing the baseband signal processing for both the optical and wireless link and using an end-to-end (E2E) error correction approach for the combined link. We provide two possible electro-optical baseband interface architectures, namely transparent optical-link and digital-link architectures, which are currently under investigation. THz wireless link requirements are given as well as the main principles and research directions for the development of a new generation of transceiver frontends, which will be capable of operating at ultra-high spectral efficiency by employing higher-order modulation schemes. Moreover, we discuss the need for developing a novel THz network information theory framework, which will take into account the channel characteristics and the nature of interference in the THz band. Finally, we highlight the role of pencil-beamforming (PBF), which is required in order to overcome the propagation losses, as well as the physical layer and medium access control challenges.
