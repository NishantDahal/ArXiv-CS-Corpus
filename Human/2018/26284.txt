Conceptual Analysis of Resource Meta-information

It's ease of use and the availability of browsers for various platforms have paved the way for the enormous popularity that the World Wide Web currently enjoys. In the near future, by providing not only easy access to information, but also means for conducting business transactions, the Web could form the base technology for the information superhighway. In such a large distributed information system, resource discovery becomes a critical problem.
  Recent developments in resource discovery systems, such as Harvest and Whois++, provide scalable mechanisms for the identification, location and characterization of networked information resources based upon resource meta-information. However, the Web's vast information space can only be handled effectively, when resources are meaningfully classified into coherent conceptual structures.
  The automatic classification of resource meta-information is at the heart of the WAVE system, which employs methods from the mathematical theory of concept analysis to analyze and interactively explore the vast information space defined by wide area resource discovery services. In this paper we discuss these methods by interpreting various synoptic and summary interchange formats for resource meta-information, such as the Harvest SOIF and the Whois++ urc, in terms of basic ideas from concept analysis. In so doing, we advocate concept analysis as a principled approach to effective resource discovery.
