A Learning Approach to Wi-Fi Access

We show experimentally that workload-based AP-STA associations can improve system throughput significantly. We present a predictive model that guides optimal resource allocations in dense Wi-Fi networks and achieves 72-77% of the optimal throughput with varying training data set sizes using a 3-day trace of real cable modem traffic.
