A Location-based Approach for Distributed Kiosk Design

Electronic kiosk interface design and implementation metrics have been well established. The problem arises when more than one kiosk is utilized in a different location within the same geographic proximity using the same basic informational parameters. This manuscript describes the design implications of a distributed kiosk environment from the standpoint of a field experiment. The log files from 2 kiosks deployed in the same building are analyzed for correlations among kiosk location and information required. The results show that while kiosk systems deployed in primary entrances should have a broad view of pertinent information, kiosks deployed in more remote locations should have information pertinent to that area initially presented to the individual. This research provides both confirmatory evidence and a checklist of implementation decision points for those who wish to implement a distributed kiosk architecture.
