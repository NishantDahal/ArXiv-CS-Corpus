Orbital Petri Nets: A Novel Petri Net Approach

Petri Nets is very interesting tool for studying and simulating different behaviors of information systems. It can be used in different applications based on the appropriate class of Petri Nets whereas it is classical, colored or timed Petri Nets. In this paper we introduce a new approach of Petri Nets called orbital Petri Nets (OPN) for studying the orbital rotating systems within a specific domain. The study investigated and analyzed OPN with highlighting the problem of space debris collision problem as a case study. The mathematical investigation results of two OPN models proved that space debris collision problem can be prevented based on the new method of firing sequence in OPN. By this study, new smart algorithms can be implemented and simulated by orbital Petri Nets for mitigating the space debris collision problem as a next work.
