Optimization and projection of coated structures with orthotropic infill material

The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, we introduce an efficient homogenization-based approach to perform topology optimization of coated structures with orthotropic infill material. By making use of the relaxed design space, we can obtain designs with complex microstructures on a relatively coarse mesh. In the second part of this work, a method is presented to project the homogenization-based designs on a fine but realizable scale. A novel method to adaptively refine the lattice structure is presented to allow for a regular spacing of the infill. Numerical experiments show excellent behavior of the projected designs, which perform almost identical to the homogenization-based designs. Furthermore, a reduction in computational cost of at least an order of magnitude is achieved, compared to a related approach in which the infill is optimized using a density-based approach.
