Memristor Crossbars with 4.5 Terabits-per-Inch-Square Density and Two Nanometer Dimension

Memristor is a promising building block for the next generation nonvolatile random access memory and bio-inspired computing systems. Organizing memristors into high density crossbar arrays, although challenging, is critical to meet the ever-growing high capacity and low energy demands of these applications especially in the big data era. Here, we construct memristor crossbars with a single-layer density up to 4.5 terabits per inch square, an order of magnitude denser than the state- of-the-art 64-layer triple level cell NAND flash technology. The memristors in the crossbars are 2 $\times$ 2 nm$^2$ in size, capable of switching with tens of nano ampere electric current. The densely packed memristor crossbars of extremely small working devices provides a power-efficient solution for high density information storage and processing.
