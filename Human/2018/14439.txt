Visual Content Privacy Leaks on Social Media Networks

With the growth and accessibility of mobile devices and internet, the ease of posting and sharing content on social media networks (SMNs) has increased exponentially. Many users post images that contain "privacy leaks" regarding themselves or someone else. Privacy leaks include any instance in which a transfer of personal identifying visual content is shared on SMNs. Private visual content (images and videos) exposes intimate information that can be detrimental to your finances, personal life, and reputation. Private visual content can include baby faces, credit cards, social security cards, house keys and others. The Hawaii Emergency Agency example provides evidence that visual content privacy leaks can happen on an individual or organization level. We find that monitoring techniques are essential for the improvement of private life and the development of future techniques. More extensive and enduring techniques will allow typical users, organizations, and the government to have a positive social media footprint.
