Joint Design of Convolutional Code and CRC under Serial List Viterbi Decoding

This paper studies the joint design of optimal convolutional codes (CCs) and CRC codes when serial list Viterbi algorithm (S-LVA) is employed in order to achieve the target frame error rate (FER). We first analyze the S-LVA performance with respect to SNR and list size, repsectively, and prove the convergence of the expected number of decoding attempts when SNR goes to the extreme. We then propose the coded channel capacity as the criterion to jointly design optimal CC-CRC pair and optimal list size and show that the optimal list size of S-LVA is always the cardinality of all possible CCs. With the maximum list size, we choose the design metric of optimal CC-CRC pair as the SNR gap to random coding union (RCU) bound and the optimal CC-CRC pair is the one that achieves a target SNR gap with the least complexity. Finally, we show that a weaker CC with a strong optimal CRC code could be as powerful as a strong CC with no CRC code.
