New Quantum MDS codes constructed from Constacyclic codes

Quantum maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes are an important class of quantum codes. In this paper, using constacyclic codes and Hermitain construction, we construct some new quantum MDS codes of the form $q=2am+t$, $n=\frac{q^{2}+1}{a}$. Most of these quantum MDS codes are new in the sense that their parameters are not covered be the codes available in the literature.
