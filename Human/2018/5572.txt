On recovery of sequences from subsequences: the case of non-periodic spectrum gaps

The paper investigates recoverability of sequences from their periodic subsequences and offers some modification of the approach suggested in papers arXiv:1605.00414 and arXiv:1803.02233. It is shown that there exists a class of sequences that is everywhere dense in the class of all square-summable sequences and such that its members can be recovered from their periodic subsequences. This recoverability is associated with certain spectrum degeneracy of a new kind.
