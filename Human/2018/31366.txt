MDBV: Monitoring Data Batch Verification for Survivability of Internet of Vehicles

Along with the development of vehicular sensors and wireless communication technology, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is emerging that can improve traffic efficiency and provide a comfortable driving environment. However, there is still a challenge how to ensure the survivability of IoV. Fortunately, this goal can be achieved by quickly verifying real-time monitoring data to avoid network failure. Aggregate signature is an efficient approach to realize quick data verification quickly. In this paper, we propose a monitoring data batch verification scheme based on an improved certificateless aggregate signature for IoV, named MDBV. The size of aggregated verification message is remain roughly constant even as the increasing number of vehicles in MDBV. Additionally, MDBV is proved to be secure in the random oracle model assuming the intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. In consideration of the network survivability and performance, the proposed MDBV can decrease the computation overhead and is more suitable for IoV.
