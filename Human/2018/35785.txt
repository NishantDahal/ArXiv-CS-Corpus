Coupon Advertising in Online Social Systems: Algorithms and Sampling Techniques

Online social systems have become important platforms for viral marketing where the advertising of products is carried out with the communication of users. After adopting the product, the seed buyers may spread the information to their friends via online messages e.g. posts and tweets. In another issue, electronic coupon system is one of the relevant promotion vehicles that help manufacturers and retailers attract more potential customers. By offering coupons to seed buyers, there is a chance to convince the influential users who are, however, at first not very interested in the product. In this paper, we propose a coupon based online influence model and consider the problem that how to maximize the profit by selecting appropriate seed buyers. The considered problem herein is markedly different from other influence related problems as its objective function is not monotone. We provide an algorithmic analysis and give several algorithms designed with different sampling techniques. In particular, we propose the RA-T and RA-S algorithms which are not only provably effective but also scalable on large datasets. The proposed theoretical results are evaluated by extensive experiments done on large-scale real-world social networks. The analysis of this paper also provides an algorithmic framework for non-monotone submodular maximization problems in social networks.
