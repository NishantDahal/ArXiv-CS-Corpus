A Model of Free Will for Artificial Entities

The impression of free will is the feeling according to which our choices are neither imposed from our inside nor from outside. It is the sense we are the ultimate cause of our acts. In direct opposition with the universal determinism, the existence of free will continues to be discussed. In this paper, free will is linked to a decisional mechanism: an agent is provided with free will if having performed a predictable choice Cp, it can immediately perform another choice Cr in a random way. The intangible feeling of free will is replaced by a decision-making process including a predictable decision-making process immediately followed by an unpredictable decisional one.
