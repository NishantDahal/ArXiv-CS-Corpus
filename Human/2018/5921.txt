A Brief Retrospective Look at the Cayley-Purser Public-key Cryptosystem, 19 Years Later

The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the Cayley-Purser algorithm, which is a public-key cryptosystem proposed by Flannery in 1999. I will present two attacks on it, one of which is apparently new. I will also examine a variant of the Cayley-Purser algorithm that was patented by Slavin in 2008, and show that it is also insecure.
