Supercomputer building is a many sceene, many authors game, comprising a lot of different technologies, manufacturers and ideas. Checking data available in the public database in a systematic way, some general tendencies and limitations can be concluded, both for the past and the future. The feasibility of building exa-scale computers as well as their limitations and utilization are also discussed. The statistical considerations provide a strong support for the conclusions.
