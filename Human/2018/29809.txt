Detecting Token Systems on Ethereum

We propose and compare two approaches to identify smart contracts as token systems by analyzing their public bytecode. The first approach symbolically executes the code in order to detect token systems by their characteristic behavior of updating internal accounts. The second approach serves as a comparison base and exploits the common interface of ERC-20, the most popular token standard. We present quantitative results for the Ethereum blockchain, and validate the effectiveness of both approaches using a set of curated token systems as ground truth. We observe 100% recall for the second approach. Recall rates of 89% (with well explainable missed detections) indicate that the first approach may also be able to identify "hidden" or undocumented token systems that intentionally do not implement the standard. One possible application of the proposed methods is to facilitate regulator' tasks of monitoring and policing the use of token systems and their underlying platforms.
