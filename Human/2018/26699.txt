Optimal Energy-Delay in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks with Interference Channel

In this work, we investigate the capacity allocation problem in the energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with interference channel. For the fixed topologies of data and energy, we formulate the optimization problem when the data flow remains constant on all data links and each sensor node harvests energy only once in a time slot. We focus on the optimal data rates, power allocations and energy transfers between sensor nodes in a time slot. Our goal is to minimize the total delay in the network under two scenarios, i.e., no energy transfer and energy transfer. Furthermore, since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly. By considering the network with relatively high Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), the non-convex optimization problem can be transformed into a convex optimization problem by convex approximation. We attain the properties of optimal solution by Lagrange duality and solve the convex optimization problem by CVX solver. The experimental results demonstrate that the total delay of the energy harvesting WSNs with interference channel is more than that in the orthogonal channel; and the energy transfer can help to decrease the total delay. Moreover, we also discuss the extension of our work.
