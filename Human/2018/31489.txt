Offline Behaviors of Online Friends

In this work we analyze traces of mobility and co-location among a group of nearly 1000 closely interacting individuals. We attempt to reconstruct the Facebook friendship graph, Facebook interaction network, as well as call and SMS networks from longitudinal records of person-to-person offline proximity. We find subtle, yet observable behavioral differences between pairs of people who communicate using each of the different channels and we show that the signal of friendship is strong enough to stand out from the noise of random and schedule-driven offline interactions between familiar strangers. Our study also provides an overview of methods for link inference based on offline behavior and proposes new features to improve the performance of the prediction task.
