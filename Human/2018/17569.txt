Self-Paced Learning with Adaptive Deep Visual Embeddings

Selecting the most appropriate data examples to present a deep neural network (DNN) at different stages of training is an unsolved challenge. Though practitioners typically ignore this problem, a non-trivial data scheduling method may result in a significant improvement in both convergence and generalization performance. In this paper, we introduce Self-Paced Learning with Adaptive Deep Visual Embeddings (SPL-ADVisE), a novel end-to-end training protocol that unites self-paced learning (SPL) and deep metric learning (DML). We leverage the Magnet Loss to train an embedding convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a salient representation space. The student CNN classifier dynamically selects similar instance-level training examples to form a mini-batch, where the easiness from the cross-entropy loss and the true diverseness of examples from the learned metric space serve as sample importance priors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SPL-ADVisE, we use deep CNN architectures for the task of supervised image classification on several coarse- and fine-grained visual recognition datasets. Results show that, across all datasets, the proposed method converges faster and reaches a higher final accuracy than other SPL variants, particularly on fine-grained classes.
