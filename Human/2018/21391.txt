Classifier Ensembles for Dialect and Language Variety Identification

In this paper we present ensemble-based systems for dialect and language variety identification using the datasets made available by the organizers of the VarDial Evaluation Campaign 2018. We present a system developed to discriminate between Flemish and Dutch in subtitles and a system trained to discriminate between four Arabic dialects: Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf, North African, and Modern Standard Arabic in speech broadcasts. Finally, we compare the performance of these two systems with the other systems submitted to the Discriminating between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles (DFS) and the Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) shared tasks at VarDial 2018.
