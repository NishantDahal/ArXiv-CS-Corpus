Coded FFT and Its Communication Overhead

We propose a coded computing strategy and examine communication costs of coded computing algorithms to make distributed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) resilient to errors during the computation. We apply maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to a widely used "Transpose" algorithm for parallel FFT. In the uncoded distributed FFT algorithm, the most expensive step is a single "all-to-all" communication. We compare this with communication overhead of coding in our coded FFT algorithm. We show that by using a systematic MDS code, the communication overhead of coding is negligible in comparison with the communication costs inherent in an uncoded FFT implementation if the number of parity nodes is at most $o(\log K)$, where $K$ is the number of systematic nodes.
