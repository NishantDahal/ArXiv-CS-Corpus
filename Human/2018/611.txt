Green Cell-less Design for RF-Wireless Power Transfer Networks

This paper studies a new concept so-called green cell-less radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) networks. We consider a scenario in which multiple indoor access points (APs) equipped with outdoor energy harvesters are connected with a central control unit via backhaul links. Further, such APs exploit the harnessed green energy to recharge wirelessly indoor devices under the coordination of the control unit. Considering the network, we focus on AP selection and beamforming optimization to maximize the total energy harvesting (EH) rate. The resulting mathematical problem has the form of mixed-integer optimization that is intractable to solve. Thus, we propose an algorithm to tackle this difficulty. Through numerical results, we show the advantages of the cell-less design over the conventional small-cell one to validate our ideas. In particular, the issue on safety requirements of human exposure to RF radiation is discussed. Finally, potential future research is provided.
