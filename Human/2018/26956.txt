Bringing Together Project Simulation and Psychometric Tests: A Business Game Proposal

This article identifies a gap between the existence of a various psychometric tests approaches and other team performance assessment tools (e.g. business and management games). As a response to the lack of tools able to utilize the knowledge about the behaviour patterns expressed in work environment and descriptive business games, the article presents a game proposal. The mechanics of the proposed game should allow for a quantifiable assessment of an individual in the simulated project development environment, making it possible to evaluate not only the team's performance, but the impact of actions of the individual players and their interactions.
