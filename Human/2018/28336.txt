Accuracy of Distance-Based Ranking of Users in the Analysis of NOMA Systems

We characterize the accuracy of analyzing the performance of a NOMA system where users are ranked according to their distances instead of instantaneous channel gains, i.e., product of distance-based path-loss and fading channel gains. Distance-based ranking is analytically tractable and can lead to important insights. However, it may not be appropriate in a multipath fading environment where a near user suffers from severe fading while a far user experiences weak fading. Since the ranking of users in a NOMA system has a direct impact on coverage probability analysis, impact of the traditional distance-based ranking, as opposed to instantaneous signal power-based ranking, needs to be understood. This will enable us to identify scenarios where distance-based ranking, which is easier to implement compared to instantaneous signal power-based ranking, is acceptable for system performance analysis. To this end, in this paper, we derive the probability of the event when distance-based ranking yields the same results as instantaneous signal power-based ranking, which is referred to as the accuracy probability. We characterize the probability of accuracy considering Nakagami-m fading channels and three different spatial distribution models of user locations in NOMA. We illustrate the impact of accuracy probability on uplink and downlink coverage probability.
