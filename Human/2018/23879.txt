Symbolic Music Genre Transfer with CycleGAN

Deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently been applied to style and domain transfer for images, and in the case of VAEs, music. GAN-based models employing several generators and some form of cycle consistency loss have been among the most successful for image domain transfer. In this paper we apply such a model to symbolic music and show the feasibility of our approach for music genre transfer. Evaluations using separate genre classifiers show that the style transfer works well. In order to improve the fidelity of the transformed music, we add additional discriminators that cause the generators to keep the structure of the original music mostly intact, while still achieving strong genre transfer. Visual and audible results further show the potential of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first application of GANs to symbolic music domain transfer.
