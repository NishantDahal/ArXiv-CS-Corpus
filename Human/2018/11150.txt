Maize Haploid Identification via LSTM-CNN and Hyperspectral Imaging Technology

Accurate and fast identification of seed cultivars is crucial to plant breeding, with accelerating breeding of new products and increasing its quality. In our study, the first attempt to design a high-accurate identification model of maize haploid seeds from diploid ones based on optimum waveband selection of the LSTM-CNN algorithm is realized via deep learning and hyperspectral imaging technology, with accuracy reaching 97% in the determining optimum waveband of 1367.6-1526.4nm. The verification of testing another cultivar achieved an accuracy of 93% in the same waveband. The model collected images of 256 wavebands of seeds in the spectral region of 862.9-1704.2nm. The high-noise waveband intervals were found and deleted by the LSTM. The optimum-data waveband intervals were determined by CNN's waveband-based detection. The optimum sample set for network training only accounted for 1/5 of total sample data. The accuracy was significantly higher than the full-waveband modeling or modeling of any other wavebands. Our study demonstrates that the proposed model has outstanding effect on maize haploid identification and it could be generalized to some extent.
