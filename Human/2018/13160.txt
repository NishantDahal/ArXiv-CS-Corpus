Binary linear complementary dual codes

Linear complementary dual codes (or codes with complementary duals) are codes whose intersections with their dual codes are trivial. We study binary linear complementary dual $[n,k]$ codes with the largest minimum weight among all binary linear complementary dual $[n,k]$ codes. We characterize binary linear complementary dual codes with the largest minimum weight for small dimensions. A complete classification of binary linear complementary dual $[n,k]$ codes with the largest minimum weight is also given for $1 \le k \le n \le 16$.
