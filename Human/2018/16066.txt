On Portrait of a Specialist in Open Data

The article is written to identify the requirements for Open Data Specialist. The ability to use and work with open data affects many areas: sociology, urban studies, geography, statistics, public administration, data journalism, etc. It is especially important to develop and implement training courses on open data for non-IT students. Typically, the specialization of these students contains insufficient number of lessons on working with data and with open data. Students (hereinafter - researchers) feel a great need to eliminate "digital illiteracy" and to master the skills of working with open data. The development of a specialty on open data is designed to solve the problem of lack of knowledge and skills in working with open data. In this paper, the authors attempt to generalize the requirements for an expert in open data and offer an overview of information sources on the topic of hiring such specialists. The authors justify the need to create a specialty on open data for non-core students as well. It is supposed that the specialty will be read in English, a non-native language for students.
