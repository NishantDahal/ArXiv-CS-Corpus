Optimal Relaying Beamforming in Multiple Access Broadcast Channel (MABC) Bidirectional Cognitive Radio Networks in Presence of Interferers

In this paper, a general cognitive radio system consisting of a set of users with different level of spectrum access including two primary transceivers and several types of secondary users is considered. It is assumed that two secondary users operate based on an underlay model at the same frequency bandwidth and at the same time as the primary users based on a multiple access broadcast channel (MABC) bidirectional beamforming scheme. Other secondary users provide a relaying service to the primary users in exchange for the opportunity to send their messages towards their own destinations for a fixed portion of the communication cycle. In addition, it is assumed that some interferers are active during the communication cycle and cause interference for the network. Furthermore, it is assumed that only partial channel state information (CSI) between interferers and other nodes in the network is available.
  We provide a robust optimization method against imperfection on the interferers' CSI to maximize the joint primary and secondary {signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)} with the assumption of limited available power at the secondary relays. An amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying scheme is deployed at the secondary relays and the optimal beamforming is obtained using second order convex programming (SOCP) method. The simulation results show the performance of the proposed beamforming method against the existence of interferers, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our robust method against uncertainty in knowledge of interferers' CSIs.
