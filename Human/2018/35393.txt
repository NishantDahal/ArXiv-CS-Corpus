Raster Grid Pathology and the Cure

Blind ptychography is a phase retrieval method using multiple coded diffraction patterns from different, overlapping parts of the unknown extended object illuminated with an unknown window function. The window function is also known as the probe in the optics literature. As such blind ptychography is an inverse problem of simultaneous recovery of the object and the window function given the intensities of the windowed Fourier transform and has a multi-scale set-up in which the probe has an intermediate scale between the pixel scale and the macro-scale of the extended object. Uniqueness problem for blind ptychography is analyzed rigorously for the raster scan (of a constant step size τ) and its variants, in which another scale comes into play: the overlap between adjacent blocks (the shifted windows). The block phases are shown to form an arithmetic progression and the complete characterization of the raster scan ambiguities is given, including: First, the periodic raster grid pathology of degrees of freedom proportional to τ^2 and, second, a non-periodic, arithmetically progressing phase shift from block to block. Finally irregularly perturbed raster scans are shown to remove all ambiguities other than the inherent ambiguities of the scaling factor and the affine phase ambiguity under the minimum requirement of roughly 50% overlap ratio.
