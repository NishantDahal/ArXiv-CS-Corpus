Decentralized Data Storages: Technologies of Construction

The paper presents a comparative overview of decentralized data storages of various types. It is shown that although they have a number of common properties that are typical of all peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, the problems to be solved and, accordingly, the technologies used to build different types of storages differ significantly.
