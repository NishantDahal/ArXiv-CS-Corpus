Code-based Key Encapsulation from McEliece's Cryptosystem

In this paper we show that it is possible to extend the framework of Persichetti's code-based framework and create a secure KEM based on the McEliece protocol. This provides greater flexibility in the application of coding theory as a basis for cryptographic purposes.
