Geometric Algorithms with Limited Workspace: A Survey

In the limited workspace model, we consider algorithms whose input resides in read-only memory and that use only a constant or sublinear amount of writable memory to accomplish their task. We survey recent results in computational geometry that fall into this model and that strive to achieve the lowest possible running time. In addition to discussing the state of the art, we give some illustrative examples and mention open problems for further research.
