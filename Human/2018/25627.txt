Problems and solutions of the Fourth International Students' Olympiad in Cryptography NSUCRYPTO

Mathematical problems and their solutions of the Fourth International Students' Olympiad in cryptography NSUCRYPTO'2017 are presented. We consider problems related to attacks on ciphers and hash functions, cryptographic Boolean functions, the linear branch number, addition chains, error correction codes, etc. We discuss several open problems on algebraic structure of cryptographic functions, useful proof-of-work algorithms, the Boolean hidden shift problem and quantum computings.
