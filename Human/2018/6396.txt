Achieving Low Latency Two-Way Communication by Downlink and Uplink Decoupled Access

In many scenarios, low latency wireless communication assumes two-way connection, such that the node that receives information can swiftly send acknowledgment or other response. In this paper, we address the problem of low latency two-way communication and address it through proposal of a base station (BS) cooperation scheme. The scheme is based on downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) decoupled access (DUDA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the idea of decoupled access is used to reduce latency. We derive the analytical expression for the average latency and verify that the latency expression is valid with outage probability based on stochastic geometry analysis. Both analytical and simulation results show that, with DUDA, the latency can be reduced by approximately 30-60% compared to the traditional coupled access.
