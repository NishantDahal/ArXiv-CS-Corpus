Bitstream-Based JPEG Image Encryption with File-Size Preserving

An encryption scheme of JPEG images in the bitstream domain is proposed. The proposed scheme preserves the JPEG format even after encrypting the images, and the file size of encrypted images is the exact same as that of the original JPEG images. Several methods for encrypting JPEG images in the bitstream domain have been proposed. However, since some marker codes are generated or lost in the encryption process, the file size of JPEG bitstreams is generally changed due to the encryption operations. The proposed method inputs JPEG bitstreams and selectively encrypts the additional bit components of the Huffman code in the bitstreams. This feature allows us to have encrypted images with the same data size as that recoded in the image transmission process, when JPEG images are replaced with the encrypted ones by the hooking, so that the image transmission are successfully carried out after the hooking.
