Problem of Multiple Diacritics Design for Arabic Script

This study focuses on the design of multiple Arabic diacritical marks and to developing a model that generates the stacking of multiples Arabic diacritics in order to integrate it into a system of Arabic composition. The problem concerns the presence of multiple diacritics on a single basic letter. This model is based on the layering composition. The combination of diacritics with letters requires a basic layering to combine any diacritics in the word with their base letter, without having to deal individually and separately each pair of base letter and diacritics.
