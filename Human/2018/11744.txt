An Analysis Scheme for Investigation of Effects of Various Parameters on Signals in Acoustic-Resolution Photoacoustic Microscopy of Mice Brain: a Simulation Study

Photoacoustic spectral analysis is a novel tool for studying various parameters affecting signals in Photoacoustic microscopy. But only observing frequency components of photoacoustic signals doesn't make enough data for a desirable analysis. Thus a hybrid time-domain and frequency-domain analysis scheme has been proposed to investigate effects of various parameters like depth of microscopy, laser focal spot size and contrast agent concentration on Photoacoustic signals.
