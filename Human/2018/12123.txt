Field Trial of Alien Wavelengths on GARR Optical Network

GARR optical network is composed of two separate optical network domains at the national level. With the aim to integrate them we implemented alien wavelengths to deliver high-performance services improving the overall network efficiency. This paper describes the path followed to deploy the alien wavelengths in the GARR operational infrastructure from the planning phase to the production network.
