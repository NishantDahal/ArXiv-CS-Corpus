Throughput Analysis for Relay-Assisted Millimeter-Wave Wireless Networks

In this work, we analyze the throughput of random access multi-user relay-assisted millimeter-wave wireless networks, in which both the destination and the relay have multipacket reception capability. We consider a full-duplex network cooperative relay that stores the successfully received packets in a queue, for which we analyze the performance. Moreover, we study the effects on the network throughput of two different strategies, by which the source nodes transmit either a packet to both the destination and the relay in the same timeslot by using wider beams (broadcast approach) or to only one of these two by using narrower beams (fully directional approach). We consider the inter-beam interference at the receiver and show the optimal strategy with respect to several system parameters, e.g., positions and number of the nodes.
