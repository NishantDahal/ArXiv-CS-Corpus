A Short Note on Collecting Dependently Typed Values

Within dependently typed languages, such as Idris, types can depend on values. This dependency, however, can limit the collection of items in standard containers: all elements must have the same type, and as such their types must contain the same values. We present two dependently typed data structures for collecting dependent types: \texttt{DList} and \texttt{PList}. Use of these new data structures allow for the creation of single succinct inductive ADT whose constructions were previously verbose and split across many data structures.
