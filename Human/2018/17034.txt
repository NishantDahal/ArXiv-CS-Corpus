DesignBIP: A Design Studio for Modeling and Generating Systems with BIP

The Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) framework, rooted in rigorous semantics, allows the construction of systems that are correct-by-design. BIP has been effectively used for the construction and analysis of large systems such as robot controllers and satellite on-board software. Nevertheless, the specification of BIP models is done in a purely textual manner without any code editor support. To facilitate the specification of BIP models, we present DesignBIP, a web-based, collaborative, version-controlled design studio. To promote model scaling and reusability of BIP models, we use a graphical language for modeling parameterized BIP models with rigorous semantics. We present the various services provided by the design studio, including model editors, code editors, consistency checking mechanisms, code generators, and integration with the JavaBIP tool-set.
