Data Analytics Service Composition and Deployment on Edge Devices

Data analytics on edge devices has gained rapid growth in research, industry, and different aspects of our daily life. This topic still faces many challenges such as limited computation resource on edge devices. In this paper, we further identify two main challenges: the composition and deployment of data analytics services on edge devices. We present the Zoo system to address these two challenge: on one hand, it provides simple and concise domain-specific language to enable easy and and type-safe composition of different data analytics services; on the other, it utilises multiple deployment backends, including Docker container, JavaScript, and MirageOS, to accommodate the heterogeneous edge deployment environment. We show the expressiveness of Zoo with a use case, and thoroughly compare the performance of different deployment backends in evaluation.
