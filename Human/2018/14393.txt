Finding Local Minima via Stochastic Nested Variance Reduction

We propose two algorithms that can find local minima faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms in both finite-sum and general stochastic nonconvex optimization. At the core of the proposed algorithms is $\text{One-epoch-SNVRG}^+$ using stochastic nested variance reduction (Zhou et al., 2018a), which outperforms the state-of-the-art variance reduction algorithms such as SCSG (Lei et al., 2017). In particular, for finite-sum optimization problems, the proposed $\text{SNVRG}^{+}+\text{Neon2}^{\text{finite}}$ algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}ε^{-2}+nε_H^{-3}+n^{3/4}ε_H^{-7/2})$ gradient complexity to converge to an $(ε, ε_H)$-second-order stationary point, which outperforms $\text{SVRG}+\text{Neon2}^{\text{finite}}$ (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2017) , the best existing algorithm, in a wide regime. For general stochastic optimization problems, the proposed $\text{SNVRG}^{+}+\text{Neon2}^{\text{online}}$ achieves $\tilde{O}(ε^{-3}+ε_H^{-5}+ε^{-2}ε_H^{-3})$ gradient complexity, which is better than both $\text{SVRG}+\text{Neon2}^{\text{online}}$ (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2017) and Natasha2 (Allen-Zhu, 2017) in certain regimes. Furthermore, we explore the acceleration brought by third-order smoothness of the objective function.
