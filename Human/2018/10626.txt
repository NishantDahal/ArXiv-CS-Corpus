Performance Tradeoffs of Joint Radar-Communication Networks

This letter considers a network where nodes share a wireless channel to work in turn as pulse radars for target detection and as transmitters for data exchange. Radar detection range and network throughput are studied using stochastic geometry tools. We derive closed-form expressions that identify the key tradeoffs between radar and communication operations. Results reveal interesting design hints and stress a marked sensitivity of radar detection to communication interference.
