Proving Parikh's theorem using Chomsky-Schutzenberger theorem

Parikh theorem was originally stated and proved by Rohkit Parikh in MIT research report in 1961. Many different proofs of this classical theorems were produced then; our goal is to give another proof using Chomsky-Schutzenberger representation theorem. We present the proof which doesn't use any formal language theory tool at all except the representation theorem, just some linear algebra.
