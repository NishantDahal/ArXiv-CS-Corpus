Neural Wavetable: a playable wavetable synthesizer using neural networks

We present Neural Wavetable, a proof-of-concept wavetable synthesizer that uses neural networks to generate playable wavetables. The system can produce new, distinct waveforms through the interpolation of traditional wavetables in an autoencoder's latent space. It is available as a VST/AU plugin for use in a Digital Audio Workstation.
