Lab Based Curriculum for CIS and Related Technology

The Computer Information System (CIS) is information and communication technology in support of business processes. In this paper, we present a typical undergraduate computer information system curriculum examining the degree of lab intensity and its effect on the course efficacy. A CIS program is usually part of the school of business as it is in support of business processes. We also explore the differences between a CIS curriculum and other computer related technology courses, such as Information Technology (IT), Computer Science (CS), and Software Engineering (SE). The curriculum is composed of several elements such as content and sequence of subjects, classrooms equipped with computer projection, internet, and local network access, and appropriate computing and software infrastructure. We will focus on the importance and adequacy of labs for the CIS curriculum. The proposed CIS curriculum works for a 4-year as well as a 3-year program. This paper provides a recommendation for local and Federal Accreditation agencies and curriculum committees.
