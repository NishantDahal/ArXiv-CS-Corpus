White or Blue, the Whale gets its Vengeance: A Social Media Analysis of the Blue Whale Challenge

The Blue Whale Challenge is a series of self-harm causing tasks that are propagated via online social media under the disguise of a "game." The list of tasks must be completed in a duration of 50 days and they cause both physical and mental harm to the player. The final task is to commit suicide. The game is supposed to be administered by people called "curators" who incite others to cause self-mutilation and commit suicide. The curators and potential players are known to contact each other on social networking websites and the conversations between them are suspected to take place mainly via direct messages which are difficult to track. Though, in order to find curators, the players make public posts containing certain hashtags/keywords to catch their attention. Even though a lot of these social networks have moderated posts talking about the game, yet some posts manage to pass their filters. Our research focuses on (1) understanding the social media spread of the challenge, (2) spotting the behaviour of the people taking interest in Blue Whale challenge and, (3) analysing demographics of the users who may be involved in playing the game.
