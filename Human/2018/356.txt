Multi-optional Many-sorted Past Present Future structures and its description

The cognitive theory of true conditions (CTTC) is a proposal to describe the model-theoretic semantics of symbolic cognitive architectures and design the implementation of cognitive abilities. The CTTC is formulated mathematically using the multi-optional many-sorted past present future(MMPPF) structures. This article defines mathematically the MMPPF structures and the formal languages proposed to describe them by the CTTC.
