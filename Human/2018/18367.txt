Human Mobility Patterns Modelling using CDRs

The research objectives are exploring characteristics of human mobility patterns, subsequently modelling them mathematically depending on inter-event time and traveled distances parameters using CDRs (Call Detailed Records). The observations are obtained from Armada festival in France. Understanding, modelling and simulating human mobility among urban regions is excitement approach, due to itsimportance in rescue situations for various events either indoor events like evacuation of buildings or outdoor ones like public assemblies,community evacuation in casesemerged during emergency situations, moreover serves urban planning and smart cities.
