An impure solution to the problem of matching fans

We propose an algorithm to solve the problem of matching fans in interaction net implementations of optimal reduction for the pure untyped lambda calculus without use of any additional agent types. The algorithm relies upon a specific interaction nets reduction strategy and involves side effects in one of interaction rules.
