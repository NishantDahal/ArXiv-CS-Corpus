Adaptive Game-Theoretic Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicle Control at Roundabouts

In this paper, we propose a decision making algorithm for autonomous vehicle control at a roundabout intersection. The algorithm is based on a game-theoretic model representing the interactions between the ego vehicle and an opponent vehicle, and adapts to an online estimated driver type of the opponent vehicle. Simulation results are reported.
