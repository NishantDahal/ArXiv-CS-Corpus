Modelling the Time-dependent VRP through Open Data

This paper presents an open data approach to model and solve the vehicle routing problem with time-dependent travel times (TDVRP). The proposed model is based on a multi-layer matrix composed of travel times, replacing the traditional distance matrix. Online cartography services are queried in order to build this matrix. Travel times are obtained for every step in the time discretization. Thus, the model integrates the fact that the travel time between two points is modified during the time horizon. This model is applied to a medium-sized problem in the urban area of Paris using an enhanced Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP). This work intends to build on the current state of the art by proposing a straightforward and open-access method to model and solve the VRP with traffic variability.
