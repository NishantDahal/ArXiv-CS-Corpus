Exploit the Connectivity: Multi-Object Tracking with TrackletNet

Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important and practical task related to both surveillance systems and moving camera applications, such as autonomous driving and robotic vision. However, due to unreliable detection, occlusion and fast camera motion, tracked targets can be easily lost, which makes MOT very challenging. Most recent works treat tracking as a re-identification (Re-ID) task, but how to combine appearance and temporal features is still not well addressed. In this paper, we propose an innovative and effective tracking method called TrackletNet Tracker (TNT) that combines temporal and appearance information together as a unified framework. First, we define a graph model which treats each tracklet as a vertex. The tracklets are generated by appearance similarity with CNN features and intersection-over-union (IOU) with epipolar constraints to compensate camera movement between adjacent frames. Then, for every pair of two tracklets, the similarity is measured by our designed multi-scale TrackletNet. Afterwards, the tracklets are clustered into groups which represent individual object IDs. Our proposed TNT has the ability to handle most of the challenges in MOT, and achieve promising results on MOT16 and MOT17 benchmark datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
