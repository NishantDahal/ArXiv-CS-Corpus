Towards Verifying Semantic Roles Co-occurrence

Semantic role theory considers roles as a small universal set of unanalyzed entities. It means that formally there are no restrictions on role combinations. We argue that the semantic roles co-occur in verb representations. It means that there are hidden restrictions on role combinations. To demonstrate that a practical and evidence-based approach has been built on in-depth analysis of the largest verb database VerbNet. The consequences of this approach are considered.
