High-precision timing and frequency synchronization method for MIMO-OFDM systems in double-selective channels

In this letter, a novel synchronization method for MIMO-OFDM systems is proposed. The new approach has an accurate estimate of both symbol timing and large frequency offest. Simulation results show the excellent robustness of our method in double-selective channel even if the strongest multipath component arrives behind the first path.
