Debunking Fake News One Feature at a Time

Identifying the stance of a news article body with respect to a certain headline is the first step to automated fake news detection. In this paper, we introduce a 2-stage ensemble model to solve the stance detection task. By using only hand-crafted features as input to a gradient boosting classifier, we are able to achieve a score of 9161.5 out of 11651.25 (78.63%) on the official Fake News Challenge (Stage 1) dataset. We identify the most useful features for detecting fake news and discuss how sampling techniques can be used to improve recall accuracy on a highly imbalanced dataset.
