On Division Polynomial PIT and Supersingularity

For an elliptic curve $E$ over a finite field $\F_q$, where $q$ is a prime power, we propose new algorithms for testing the supersingularity of $E$. Our algorithms are based on the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem for the $p$-th division polynomial of $E$. In particular, an efficient algorithm using points of high order on $E$ is given.
