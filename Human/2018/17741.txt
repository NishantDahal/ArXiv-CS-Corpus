Joint Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Community Structures Detection in Signed Networks

Community structures detection in signed network is very important for understanding not only the topology structures of signed networks, but also the functions of them, such as information diffusion, epidemic spreading, etc. In this paper, we develop a joint nonnegative matrix factorization model to detect community structures. In addition, we propose modified partition density to evaluate the quality of community structures. We use it to determine the appropriate number of communities. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated based on both synthetic and real-world networks.
