Wireless Powered Cooperative Relaying using NOMA with Imperfect CSI

The impact of imperfect channel state (CSI) information in an energy harvesting (EH) cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, consisting of a source, two users, and an EH relay is investigated in this paper. The relay is not equipped with a fixed power source and acts as a wireless powered node to help signal transmission to the users. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability of both users are derived under imperfect CSI for two different power allocation strategies namely fixed and dynamic power allocation. Monte Carlo simulations are used to numerically evaluate the effect of imperfect CSI. These results confirm the theoretical outage analysis and show that NOMA can outperform orthogonal multiple access even with imperfect CSI.
