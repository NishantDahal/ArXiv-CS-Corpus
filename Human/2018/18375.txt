Modeling and Analysis of D2D Millimeter-Wave Networks with Poisson Cluster Processes

This paper investigates the performance of millimeter wave (mmWave) communications in clustered device-to-device (D2D) networks. The locations of D2D transceivers are modeled as a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP). In each cluster, devices are equipped with multiple antennas, and the active D2D transmitter (D2D-Tx) utilizes mmWave to serve one of the proximate D2D receivers (D2D-Rxs). Specifically, we introduce three user association strategies: 1) Uniformly distributed D2D-Tx model; 2) Nearest D2D-Tx model; 3) Closest line-of-site (LOS) D2D-Tx model. To characterize the performance of the considered scenarios, we derive new analytical expressions for the coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Additionally, in order to efficiently illustrating the general trends of our system, a closed-form lower bound for the special case interfered by intra-cluster LOS links is derived. We provide Monte Carlo simulations to corroborate the theoretical results and show that: 1) The coverage probability is mainly affected by the intra-cluster interference with LOS links; 2) There exists an optimum number of simultaneously active D2D-Txs in each cluster for maximizing ASE; and 3) Closest LOS model outperforms the other two scenarios but at the cost of extra system overhead.
