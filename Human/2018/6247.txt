  In the current enthusiasm around Data Science and Big Data Analytics, it is important to mention that only theory-guided approaches will truly enable us to fully understand why an algorithm works and how specific results can be explained. It was the goal of this dissertation research to follow this path by demonstrating that a recommender system inspired by human memory theory can have a true impact in the field.
