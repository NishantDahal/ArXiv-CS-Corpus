Analysing the Potential of BLE to Support Dynamic Broadcasting Scenarios

In this paper, we present a novel approach for broadcasting information based on a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) ibeacon technology. We propose a dynamic method that uses a combination of Wi-Fi and BLE technology where every technology plays a part in a user discovery and broadcasting process. In such system, a specific ibeacon device broadcasts the information when a user is in proximity. Using experiments, we conduct a scenario where the system discovers users, disseminates information, and later we use collected data to examine the system performance and capability. The results show that our proposed approach has a promising potential to become a powerful tool in the discovery and broadcasting concept that can be easily implemented and used in business environments.
