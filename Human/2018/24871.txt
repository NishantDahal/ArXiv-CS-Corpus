VOS: a Method for Variational Oversampling of Imbalanced Data

Class imbalanced datasets are common in real-world applications that range from credit card fraud detection to rare disease diagnostics. Several popular classification algorithms assume that classes are approximately balanced, and hence build the accompanying objective function to maximize an overall accuracy rate. In these situations, optimizing the overall accuracy will lead to highly skewed predictions towards the majority class. Moreover, the negative business impact resulting from false positives (positive samples incorrectly classified as negative) can be detrimental. Many methods have been proposed to address the class imbalance problem, including methods such as over-sampling, under-sampling and cost-sensitive methods. In this paper, we consider the over-sampling method, where the aim is to augment the original dataset with synthetically created observations of the minority classes. In particular, inspired by the recent advances in generative modelling techniques (e.g., Variational Inference and Generative Adversarial Networks), we introduce a new oversampling technique based on variational autoencoders. Our experiments show that the new method is superior in augmenting datasets for downstream classification tasks when compared to traditional oversampling methods.
