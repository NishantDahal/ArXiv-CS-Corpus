Attacks and Defenses in Mobile IP: Modeling with Stochastic Game Petri Net

The urging need for seamless connectivity in mobile environment has contributed to the rapid expansion of Mobile IP. Mobile IP uses wireless transmission medium, thereby making it subject to many security threats during various phases of route optimization. Modeling Mobile IP attacks reasonably and efficiently is the basis for defending against those attacks, which requires quantitative analysis and modeling approaches for expressing threat propagation in Mobile IP. In this Paper, we present four well-known Mobile IP attacks, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, bombing attack, redirection attack and replay attack and model them with Stochastic Game Petri Net (SGPN). Furthermore, we propose mixed strategy based defense strategies for the aforementioned attacks and model them with SGPN. Finally, we calculate the Nash Equilibrium of the attacker-defender game and thereby obtain the steady state probability of the vulnerable attack states. We show that, under the optimal strategy, an IDS needs to remain active 72.4%, 70%, 68.4% and 66.6% of the time to restrict the attacker's success rate to 8.5%, 6.4%, 7.2% and 8.3% respectively for the aforementioned attacks, thus performing better than the state-of-the-art approach.
