Temporal graph-based clustering for historical record linkage

Research in the social sciences is increasingly based on large and complex data collections, where individual data sets from different domains are linked and integrated to allow advanced analytics. A popular type of data used in such a context are historical censuses, as well as birth, death, and marriage certificates. Individually, such data sets however limit the types of studies that can be conducted. Specifically, it is impossible to track individuals, families, or households over time. Once such data sets are linked and family trees spanning several decades are available it is possible to, for example, investigate how education, health, mobility, employment, and social status influence each other and the lives of people over two or even more generations. A major challenge is however the accurate linkage of historical data sets which is due to data quality and commonly also the lack of ground truth data being available. Unsupervised techniques need to be employed, which can be based on similarity graphs generated by comparing individual records. In this paper we present initial results from clustering birth records from Scotland where we aim to identify all births of the same mother and group siblings into clusters. We extend an existing clustering technique for record linkage by incorporating temporal constraints that must hold between births by the same mother, and propose a novel greedy temporal clustering technique. Experimental results show improvements over non-temporary approaches, however further work is needed to obtain links of high quality.
