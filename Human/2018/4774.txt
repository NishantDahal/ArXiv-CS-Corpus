A study of coordination logic description and execution for dynamic device coordination services

Recently, IoT technologies have been progressed, and many devices are connected to networks. Previously, IoT services were developed by vertical integration style. But now Open IoT concept has attracted attentions which achieves various IoT services by integrating horizontal separated devices and services. For Open IoT era, we have proposed the Tacit Computing technology to discover the devices with necessary data for users on demand and use them dynamically. Although Tacit Computing can discover and use the device based on the situation, a study of coordination logic description is insufficient when multiple devices are coordinated. In this paper, we study coordination logic description and execution to coordinate multiple devices dynamically. We compare methods with ideas to convert abstract description to specific interface access means at execution time, study merits and demerits and propose an appropriate method.
