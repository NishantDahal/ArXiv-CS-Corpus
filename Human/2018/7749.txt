Modified Apriori Graph Algorithm for Frequent Pattern Mining

Web Usage Mining is an application of Data Mining Techniques to discover interesting usage patterns from web data in order to understand and better serve the needs of web-based applications. The paper proposes an algorithm for finding these usage patterns using a modified version of Apriori Algorithm called Apriori-Graph. These rules will help service providers to predict, which web pages, the user is likely to visit next. This will optimize the website in terms of efficiency, bandwidth and will have positive economic benefits for them. The proposed Apriori Graph Algorithm O((V)(E)) works faster compared to the existing Apriori Algorithm and is well suitable for real-time application.
