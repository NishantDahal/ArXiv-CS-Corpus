A Preliminary Study On Emerging Cloud Computing Security Challenges

Cloud computing is the internet based provisioning of the computing resources, software, and information on demand. Cloud Computing is referred to as one of most recent emerging paradigms of computing utilities. Since Cloud computing is the dominant infrastructure of the shared services over the internet, it is important to be aware of the security risk and the challenges associated with this emerging computing paradigm. This survey provides a brief introduction to the cloud computing, its major characteristics, and service models. It also explores cloud security threats, lists a few security solutions , and proposes a promsing research direction to deal with the evolving security challenges in Cloud computing.
