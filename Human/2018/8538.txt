An Efficient SIMD Implementation of Pseudo-Verlet Lists for Neighbour Interactions in Particle-Based Codes

In particle-based simulations, neighbour finding (i.e finding pairs of particles to interact within a given range) is the most time consuming part of the computation. One of the best such algorithms, which can be used for both Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, is the pseudo-Verlet list algorithm. This algorithm, however, does not vectorise trivially, and hence makes it difficult to exploit SIMD-parallel architectures. In this paper, we present several novel modifications as well as a vectorisation strategy for the algorithm which lead to overall speed-ups over the scalar version of the algorithm of 2.24x for the AVX instruction set (SIMD width of 8), 2.43x for AVX2, and 4.07x for AVX-512 (SIMD width of 16).
