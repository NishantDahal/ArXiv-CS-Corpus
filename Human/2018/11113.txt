Time-accurate Middleware for the Virtualization of Communication Protocols

Communication between devices in avionics systems must be  predictable and deterministic, and data must be delivered  reliably. To help the system architects comply with these  requirements, network protocol standards like ARINC 429 and AFDX  were created. Even though the behaviour of each component in a  network is well defined, it is still necessary to test extensively  every applications before deployment. But physical test benches used  in the aircraft development process are complex and expensive  platforms. In order to limit the need for physical tests, we propose  a time-accurate middleware for virtualizing communication protocols  that can be used to replace physical tests with simulations.  We specified three formal models of AFDX networks that take into  account temporal constraints with different levels of precision. We  also developed a prototype for a network virtualization middleware  based on the AFDX protocol specification that provides an  easy-to-setup environment for testing network  configurations. Finally, we used formal models together with  virtualization in order to define runtime monitors for checking  whether the behavior of the middleware is time-accurate with respect  to a real system.
