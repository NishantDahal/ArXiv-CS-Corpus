Computational paper wrapping transforms non-stretchable 2D devices into wearable and conformable 3D devices

This study starts from the counter-intuitive question of how we can render a conventional stiff, non-stretchable and even brittle material conformable so that it can fully wrap around a curved surface, such as a sphere, without failure. Here, we answer this conundrum by extending geometrical design in computational kirigami (paper cutting and folding) to paper wrapping. Our computational paper wrapping-based approach provides the more robust and reliable fabrication of conformal devices than paper folding approaches. This in turn leads to a significant increase in the applicability of computational kirigami to real-world fabrication. This new computer-aided design transforms 2D-based conventional materials, such as Si and copper, into a variety of targeted conformal structures that can fully wrap the desired 3D structure without plastic deformation or fracture. We further demonstrated that our novel approach enables a pluripotent design platform to transform conventional non-stretchable 2D-based devices, such as electroluminescent lighting and a paper battery, into wearable and conformable 3D curved devices.
