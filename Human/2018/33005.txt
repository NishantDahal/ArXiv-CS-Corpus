Mobile vs. point guards

We study the problem of guarding orthogonal art galleries with horizontal mobile guards (alternatively, vertical) and point guards, using "rectangular vision". We prove a sharp bound on the minimum number of point guards required to cover the gallery in terms of the minimum number of vertical mobile guards and the minimum number of horizontal mobile guards required to cover the gallery. Furthermore, we show that the latter two numbers can be calculated in linear time.
