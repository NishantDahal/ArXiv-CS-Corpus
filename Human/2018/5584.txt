Experimental Molecular Communication Testbed Based on Magnetic Nanoparticles in Duct Flow

Simple and easy to implement testbeds are needed to further advance molecular communication research. To this end, this paper presents an in-vessel molecular communication testbed using magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous suspension as they are also used for drug targeting in biotechnology. The transmitter is realized by an electronic pump for injection via a Y-connector. A second pump provides a background flow for signal propagation. For signal reception, we employ a susceptometer, an electronic device including a coil, where the magnetic particles move through and generate an electrical signal. We present experimental results for the transmission of a binary sequence and the system response following a single injection. For this flow-driven particle transport, we propose a simple parameterized mathematical model for evaluating the system response.
