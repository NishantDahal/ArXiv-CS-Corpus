Machine Learning for QoT Estimation of Unseen Optical Network States

We apply deep graph convolutional neural networks for Quality-of-Transmission estimation of unseen network states capturing, apart from other important impairments, the inter-core crosstalk that is prominent in optical networks operating with multicore fibers.
