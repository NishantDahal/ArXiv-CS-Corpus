Operation Control Protocols in Power Distribution Grids

Future power distribution grids will comprise a large number of components, each potentially able to carry out operations autonomously. Clearly, in order to ensure safe operation of the grid, individual operations must be coordinated among the different components. Since operation safety is a global property, modelling component coordination typically involves reasoning about systems at a global level. In this paper, we propose a language for specifying grid operation control protocols from a global point of view. We show how such global specifications can be used to automatically generate local controllers of individual components, and that the distributed implementation yielded by such controllers operationally corresponds to the global specification. We showcase our development by modelling a fault management scenario in power grids.
