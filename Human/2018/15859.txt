How Content Volume on Landing Pages Influences Consumer Behavior

Does more information elicit users compliance and engagement, or the other way around? This paper explores the relationship between content strategy and user experience (UX). Specifically, we examine how the amount of information provided on marketing web pages, often called landing pages,impact users willingness to provide their e-mail address (a behavior called conversion in marketing terms). We describe the results of two large-scale online experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) conducted in real-world commercial settings. The observed results indicate a negative correlation between the amount of information on a web page and users decision-making and engagement.
