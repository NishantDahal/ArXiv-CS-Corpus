A Conversational Interface to Improve Medication Adherence: Towards AI Support in Patient's Treatment

Medication adherence is of utmost importance for many chronic conditions, regardless of the disease type. Engaging patients in self-tracking their medication is a big challenge. One way to potentially reduce this burden is to use reminders to promote wellness throughout all stages of life and improve medication adherence. Chatbots have proven effectiveness in triggering users to engage in certain activity, such as medication adherence. In this paper, we discuss "Roborto", a chatbot to create an engaging interactive and intelligent environment for patients and assist in positive lifestyle modification. We introduce a way for healthcare providers to track patients adherence and intervene whenever necessary. We describe the health, technical and behavioural approaches to the problem of medication non-adherence and propose a diagnostic and decision support tool. The proposed study will be implemented and validated through a pilot experiment with users to measure the efficacy of the proposed approach.
