Computer Vision for Autonomous Vehicles

In this work, we try to implement Image Processing techniques in the area of autonomous vehicles, both indoor and outdoor. The challenges for both are different and the ways to tackle them vary too. We also showed deep learning makes things easier and precise. We also made base models for all the problems we tackle while building an autonomous car for Indian Institute of Space science and Technology.
