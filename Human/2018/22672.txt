Dynamic Effective Resistances and Approximate Schur Complement on Separable Graphs

We consider the problem of dynamically maintaining (approximate) all-pairs effective resistances in separable graphs, which are those that admit an $n^{c}$-separator theorem for some $c<1$. We give a fully dynamic algorithm that maintains $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations of the all-pairs effective resistances of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ undergoing edge insertions and deletions with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$ worst-case update time and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$ worst-case query time, if $G$ is guaranteed to be $\sqrt{n}$-separable (i.e., it is taken from a class satisfying a $\sqrt{n}$-separator theorem) and its separator can be computed in $\tilde{O}(n)$ time. Our algorithm is built upon a dynamic algorithm for maintaining \emph{approximate Schur complement} that approximately preserves pairwise effective resistances among a set of terminals for separable graphs, which might be of independent interest.
  We complement our result by proving that for any two fixed vertices $s$ and $t$, no incremental or decremental algorithm can maintain the $s-t$ effective resistance for $\sqrt{n}$-separable graphs with worst-case update time $O(n^{1/2-δ})$ and query time $O(n^{1-δ})$ for any $δ>0$, unless the Online Matrix Vector Multiplication (OMv) conjecture is false.
  We further show that for \emph{general} graphs, no incremental or decremental algorithm can maintain the $s-t$ effective resistance problem with worst-case update time $O(n^{1-δ})$ and query-time $O(n^{2-δ})$ for any $δ>0$, unless the OMv conjecture is false.
