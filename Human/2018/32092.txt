Divergence Network: Graphical calculation method of divergence functions

In this paper, we introduce directed networks called `divergence network' in order to perform graphical calculation of divergence functions. By using the divergence networks, we can easily understand the geometric meaning of calculation results and grasp relations among divergence functions intuitively.
