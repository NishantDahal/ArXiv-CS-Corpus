Peerus Review: a tool for scientific experts finding

We propose a tool for experts finding applied to academic data generated by the start-up DSRT in the context of its application Peerus. A user may submit the title, the abstract and optionnally the authors and the journal of publication of a scientific article and the application then returns a list of experts, potential reviewers of the submitted article. The retrieval algorithm is a voting system based on a language modeling technique trained on several millions of scientific papers.
