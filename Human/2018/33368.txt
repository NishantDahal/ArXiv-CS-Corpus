Complex Semidefinite Programming and Max-k-Cut

In a second seminal paper on the application of semidefinite programming to graph partitioning problems, Goemans and Williamson showed how to formulate and round a complex semidefinite program to give what is to date still the best-known approximation guarantee of .836008 for Max-$3$-Cut. (This approximation ratio was also achieved independently by De Klerk et al.) Goemans and Williamson left open the problem of how to apply their techniques to Max-$k$-Cut for general $k$. They point out that it does not seem straightforward or even possible to formulate a good quality complex semidefinite program for the general Max-$k$-Cut problem, which presents a barrier for the further application of their techniques.
  We present a simple rounding algorithm for the standard semidefinite programmming relaxation of Max-$k$-Cut and show that it is equivalent to the rounding of Goemans and Williamson in the case of Max-$3$-Cut. This allows us to transfer the elegant analysis of Goemans and Williamson for Max-3-Cut to Max-$k$-Cut. For $k \geq 4$, the resulting approximation ratios are about $.01$ worse than the best known guarantees. Finally, we present a generalization of our rounding algorithm and conjecture (based on computational observations) that it matches the best-known guarantees of De Klerk et al.
