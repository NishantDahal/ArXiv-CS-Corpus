Skip-Sliding Window Codes

Constrained coding is used widely in digital communication and storage systems. In this paper, we study a generalized sliding window constraint called the skip-sliding window. A skip-sliding window (SSW) code is defined in terms of the length $L$ of a sliding window, skip length $J$, and cost constraint $E$ in each sliding window. Each valid codeword of length $L + kJ$ is determined by $k+1$ windows of length $L$ where window $i$ starts at $(iJ + 1)$th symbol for all non-negative integers $i$ such that $i \leq k$; and the cost constraint $E$ in each window must be satisfied. In this work, two methods are given to enumerate the size of SSW codes and further refinements are made to reduce the enumeration complexity. Using the proposed enumeration methods, the noiseless capacity of binary SSW codes is determined and observations such as greater capacity than other classes of codes are made. Moreover, some noisy capacity bounds are given. SSW coding constraints arise in various applications including simultaneous energy and information transfer.
