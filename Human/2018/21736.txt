Towards Learning Fine-Grained Disentangled Representations from Speech

Learning disentangled representations of high-dimensional data is currently an active research area. However, compared to the field of computer vision, less work has been done for speech processing. In this paper, we provide a review of two representative efforts on this topic and propose the novel concept of fine-grained disentangled speech representation learning.
