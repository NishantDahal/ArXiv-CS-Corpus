Excuse me! Perception of Abrupt Direction Changes Using Body Cues and Paths on Mixed Reality Avatars

We evaluate two methods of signalling abrupt direction changes of a robotic platform using a Mixed Reality avatar. The "Body" method uses gaze, gesture and torso direction to point to upcoming waypoints. The "Path" method visualises the change in direction using an angled path on the ground. We compare these two methods using a controlled user study and show that each method has its strengths depending on the situation. Overall the "Path" method was slightly more accurate in communicating the direction change of the robot but participants overall preferred the "Body" method.
