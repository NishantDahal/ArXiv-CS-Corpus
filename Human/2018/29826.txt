Re-visiting the single-phase flow model for liquid steel ladle stirred by gas

Ladle stirring is an important step of the steelmaking process to homogenize the temperature and the chemical composition of the liquid steel and to remove inclusions before casting. Gas is injected from the bottom of the bath to induce a turbulent flow of the liquid steel. Multiphase modeling of ladle stirring can become computationally expensive, especially when used within optimal flow control problems. This paper focuses therefore on single-phase flow models. It aims at improving the existing models from the literature. Simulations in a 2d axial-symmetrical configuration, as well as, in a real 3d laboratory-scale ladle, are performed. The results obtained with the present model are in a relative good agreement with experimental data and suggest that it can be used as an efficient model in optimal flow control problems.
