An Analysis of Packet Fragmentation Impact in LPWAN

Packet fragmentation has mostly been addressed in the literature when referring to splitting data that does not fit a frame. It has received attention in the IoT community after the 6LoWPAN working group of IETF started studying the fragmentation headers to allow IPv6 1280 B MTU to be sent over IEEE 802.15.4 networks supporting a 127 B MTU. In this paper, and following some of the recent directions taken by the IETF LPWAN WG, an analysis of packet fragmentation in LPWANs has been done. We aim to identify the impact of sending the data in smaller fragments considering the restrictions of industrial duty-cycled networks. The analyzed parameters were the energy consumption, throughput, goodput and end to end delay introduced by fragmentation. The results of our analysis show that packet fragmentation can increase the reliability of the communication in duty-cycle restricted networks. This is of especial relevance when densifying the network. We observed relevant impact in energy consumption and extra latency, and identified the need for acknowledgements from the gateway/sink to exploit some of the benefits raised by fragmentation.
