Image Inpainting Based on a Novel Criminisi Algorithm

In view of the problem of image inpainting error continuation and the deviation of finding best match block, an improved Criminisi algorithm is proposed. The improvement was mainly embodied in two aspects. In the repairing order aspect, we redefine the calculation formula of the priority. In order to solve the problem of error continuation caused by local confidence item updating, the mean value of Manhattan distance is used for replace the confidence item. In the matching strategy aspect, finding the best match block not only depend on the difference of the two pixels, but also consider the matching region. Therefore, Euclidean distance is introduced. Experiments confirm that the improved algorithm can overcome the insufficiencies of the original algorithm. The repairing effect has been improved, and the results have a better visual appearance.
