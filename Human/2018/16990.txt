FESTUNG: A MATLAB / GNU Octave toolbox for the discontinuous Galerkin method. Part II: Advection operator and slope limiting

This is the second in a series of papers on implementing a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as an open source Matlab / GNU Octave toolbox. The intention of this ongoing project is to offer a rapid prototyping package for application development using DG methods. The implementation relies on fully vectorized matrix / vector operations and is comprehensively documented. Particular attention was paid to maintaining a direct mapping between discretization terms and code routines as well as to supporting the full code functionality in GNU Octave. The present work focuses on a two-dimensional time-dependent linear advection equation with space / time-varying coefficients, and provides a general order implementation of several slope limiting schemes for the DG method.
