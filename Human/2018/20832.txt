EmotiW 2018: Audio-Video, Student Engagement and Group-Level Affect Prediction

This paper details the sixth Emotion Recognition in the Wild (EmotiW) challenge. EmotiW 2018 is a grand challenge in the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction 2018, Colorado, USA. The challenge aims at providing a common platform to researchers working in the affective computing community to benchmark their algorithms on `in the wild' data. This year EmotiW contains three sub-challenges: a) Audio-video based emotion recognition; b) Student engagement prediction; and c) Group-level emotion recognition. The databases, protocols and baselines are discussed in detail.
