On the Feasibility of FPGA Acceleration of Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are important tools in life and material sciences since they allow studying chemical and biological processes in detail. However, the inherent scalability problem of particle-particle interactions and the sequential dependency of subsequent time steps render MD computationally intensive and difficult to scale. To this end, specialized FPGA-based accelerators have been repeatedly proposed to ameliorate this problem. However, to date none of the leading MD simulation packages fully support FPGA acceleration and a direct comparison of GPU versus FPGA accelerated codes has remained elusive so far. With this report, we aim at clarifying this issue by comparing measured application performance on GPU-dense compute nodes with performance and cost estimates of a FPGA-based single- node system. Our results show that an FPGA-based system can indeed outperform a similarly configured GPU-based system, but the overall application-level speedup remains in the order of 2x due to software overheads on the host. Considering the price for GPU and FPGA solutions, we observe that GPU-based solutions provide the better cost/performance tradeoff, and hence pure FPGA-based solutions are likely not going to be commercially viable. However, we also note that scaled multi-node systems could potentially benefit from a hybrid composition, where GPUs are used for compute intensive parts and FPGAs for latency and communication sensitive tasks.
