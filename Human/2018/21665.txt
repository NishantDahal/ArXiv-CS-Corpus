A note on partial rejection sampling for the hard disks model in the plane

In this note, we slightly improve the guarantees obtained by Guo and Jerrum for sampling from the hard disks model in the plane via partial rejection sampling. Our proof makes use of the fact that if one spreads apart a collection of disks in the plane, the area of the union of the disks cannot decrease.
