Amnestic Forgery: an Ontology of Conceptual Metaphors

This paper presents Amnestic Forgery, an ontology for metaphor semantics, based on MetaNet, which is inspired by the theory of Conceptual Metaphor. Amnestic Forgery reuses and extends the Framester schema, as an ideal ontology design framework to deal with both semiotic and referential aspects of frames, roles, mappings, and eventually blending. The description of the resource is supplied by a discussion of its applications, with examples taken from metaphor generation, and the referential problems of metaphoric mappings. Both schema and data are available from the Framester SPARQL endpoint.
