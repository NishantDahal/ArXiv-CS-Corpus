Energy-Efficient Wireless Powered Secure Transmission with Cooperative Jamming for Public Transportation

In this paper, wireless power transfer and cooperative jamming (CJ) are combined to enhance physical security in public transportation networks. First, a new secure system model with both fixed and mobile jammers is proposed to guarantee secrecy in the worst-case scenario. All jammers are endowed with energy harvesting (EH) capability. Following this, two CJ based schemes, namely B-CJ-SRM and B-CJ-TPM, are proposed, where SRM and TPM are short for secrecy rate maximization and transmit power minimization, respectively. They respectively maximize the secrecy rate (SR) with transmit power constraint and minimize the transmit power of the BS with SR constraint, by optimizing beamforming vector and artificial noise covariance matrix. To further reduce the complexity of our proposed optimal schemes, their low-complexity (LC) versions, called LC-B-CJ-SRM and LC-B-CJ-TPM are developed. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes, B-CJ-SRM and B-CJ-TPM, achieve significant SR performance improvement over existing zero-forcing and QoSD methods. Additionally, the SR performance of the proposed LC schemes are close to those of their original versions.
