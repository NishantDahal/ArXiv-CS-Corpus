Expressivity in TTS from Semantics and Pragmatics

In this paper we present ongoing work to produce an expressive TTS reader that can be used both in text and dialogue applications. The system called SPARSAR has been used to read (English) poetry so far but it can now be applied to any text. The text is fully analyzed both at phonetic and phonological level, and at syntactic and semantic level. In addition, the system has access to a restricted list of typical pragmatically marked phrases and expressions that are used to convey specific discourse function and speech acts and need specialized intonational contours. The text is transformed into a poem-like structures, where each line corresponds to a Breath Group, semantically and syntactically consistent. Stanzas correspond to paragraph boundaries. Analogical parameters are related to ToBI theoretical indices but their number is doubled. In this paper, we concentrate on short stories and fables.
