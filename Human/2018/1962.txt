On period polynomials of degree $2^m$ and weight distributions of certain irreducible cyclic codes

We explicitly determine the values of reduced cyclotomic periods of order $2^m$, $m\ge 4$, for finite fields of characteristic $p\equiv 3$ or $5\pmod{8}$. These evaluations are applied to obtain explicit factorizations of the corresponding reduced period polynomials. As another application, the weight distributions of certain irreducible cyclic codes are described.
