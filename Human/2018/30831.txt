Modeling car-following behavior on urban expressways in Shanghai: A naturalistic driving study

Five car-following models were calibrated, validated and cross-compared. The intelligent driver model performed best among the evaluated models. Considerable behavioral differences between different drivers were found. Calibrated model parameters may not be numerically equivalent with observed ones.
