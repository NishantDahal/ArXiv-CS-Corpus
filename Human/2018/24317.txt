Automatic Catchphrase Extraction from Legal Case Documents via Scoring using Deep Neural Networks

In this paper, we present a method of automatic catchphrase extracting from legal case documents. We utilize deep neural networks for constructing scoring model of our extraction system. We achieve comparable performance with systems using corpus-wide and citation information which we do not use in our system.
