PyGOM - A Python Package for Simplifying Modelling with Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations

Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are used throughout science where the capture of rates of change in states is sought. While both pieces of commercial and open software exist to study such systems, their efficient and accurate usage frequently requires deep understanding of mathematics and programming. The package we present here, PyGOM, seeks to remove these obstacles for models based on ODE systems. We provide a simple interface for the construction of such systems backed by a comprehensive and easy to use tool--box. This tool--box implements functions to easily perform common operations for ODE systems such as solving, parameter estimation, and stochastic simulation. The package source is freely available and organized in a way that permits easy extension. With both the algebraic and numeric calculations performed automatically (but still accessible), the end user is freed to focus on model development.
