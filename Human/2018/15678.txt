TrollSpot: Detecting misbehavior in commenting platforms

Commenting platforms, such as Disqus, have emerged as a major online communication platform with millions of users and posts. Their popularity has also attracted parasitic and malicious behav- iors, such as trolling and spamming. There has been relatively little research on modeling and safeguarding these platforms. As our key contribution, we develop a systematic approach to detect malicious users on commenting platforms focusing on having: (a) interpretable, and (b) fine-grained classification of malice. Our work has two key novelties: (a) we propose two classifications methods, with one following a two stage approach, which first maps observ- able features to behaviors and then maps these behaviors to user roles, and (b) we use a comprehensive set of 73 features that span four dimensions of information. We use 7 million comments during a 9 month period, and we show that our classification methods can distinguish between benign, and malicious roles (spammers, trollers, and fanatics) with a 0.904 AUC. Our work is a solid step to- wards ensuring that commenting platforms are a safe and pleasant medium for the exchange of ideas.
