Weight Learning in a Probabilistic Extension of Answer Set Programs

LPMLN is a probabilistic extension of answer set programs with the weight scheme derived from that of Markov Logic. Previous work has shown how inference in LPMLN can be achieved. In this paper, we present the concept of weight learning in LPMLN and learning algorithms for LPMLN derived from those for Markov Logic. We also present a prototype implementation that uses answer set solvers for learning as well as some example domains that illustrate distinct features of LPMLN learning. Learning in LPMLN is in accordance with the stable model semantics, thereby it learns parameters for probabilistic extensions of knowledge-rich domains where answer set programming has shown to be useful but limited to the deterministic case, such as reachability analysis and reasoning about actions in dynamic domains. We also apply the method to learn the parameters for probabilistic abductive reasoning about actions.
