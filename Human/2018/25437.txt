Confidence and RISC: How Russian papers indexed in the national citation database Russian Index of Science Citation (RISC) characterize universities and research institutes

The paper analyses Russian Index of Science Citation (RISC), a national citation database. We continue our previous study (Moskaleva et al., 2018) and focus on difference between bibliometric indicators calculated on, so to say, "the best" journals, so called RISC Core, and those which take into account all Russian journals available. Such a difference may show focuses of insitutional actors on different document types, publication strategies etc.
