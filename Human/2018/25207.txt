Adaptive Monitoring: A Systematic Mapping

Context: Adaptive monitoring is a method used in a variety of domains for responding to changing conditions. It has been applied in different ways, from monitoring systems' customization to re-composition, in different application domains. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies analyzing how adaptive monitoring differs or resembles among the existing approaches. Method: We have conducted a systematic mapping study of adaptive monitoring approaches following recommended practices. We have applied automatic search and snowballing sampling on different sources and used rigorous selection criteria to retrieve the final set of papers. Moreover, we have used an existing qualitative analysis method for extracting relevant data from studies. Finally, we have applied data mining techniques for identifying patterns in the solutions. Conclusions: This cross-domain overview of the current state of the art on adaptive monitoring may be a solid and comprehensive baseline for researchers and practitioners in the field. Especially, it may help in identifying opportunities of research, for instance, the need of proposing generic and flexible software engineering solutions for supporting adaptive monitoring in a variety of systems.
