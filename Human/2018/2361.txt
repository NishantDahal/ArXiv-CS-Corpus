Retrieval-Augmented Convolutional Neural Networks for Improved Robustness against Adversarial Examples

We propose a retrieval-augmented convolutional network and propose to train it with local mixup, a novel variant of the recently proposed mixup algorithm. The proposed hybrid architecture combining a convolutional network and an off-the-shelf retrieval engine was designed to mitigate the adverse effect of off-manifold adversarial examples, while the proposed local mixup addresses on-manifold ones by explicitly encouraging the classifier to locally behave linearly on the data manifold. Our evaluation of the proposed approach against five readily-available adversarial attacks on three datasets--CIFAR-10, SVHN and ImageNet--demonstrate the improved robustness compared to the vanilla convolutional network.
