DNA Molecular Storage System: Transferring Digitally Encoded Information through Bacterial Nanonetworks

Since the birth of computer and networks, fuelled by pervasive computing and ubiquitous connectivity, the amount of data stored and transmitted has exponentially grown through the years. Due to this demand, new solutions for storing data are needed, and one promising media is the DNA. This storage solution provides numerous advantages, which includes the ability to store dense information while achieving long-term stability. However, the question as how the data can be retrieved from a DNA-based archive, still remains. In this paper, we aim to address this question by proposing a new storage solution that relies upon molecular communication, and in particular bacterial nanonetworks. Our solution allows digitally encoded information to be stored into non-motile bacteria, which compose an archival architecture of clusters, and to be later retrieved by engineered motile bacteria, whenever reading operations are needed. We conducted extensive simulations, in order to determine the reliability of data retrieval from non-motile storage clusters, placed at different locations. Aiming to assess the feasibility of our solution, we have also conducted wet lab experiments that show how bacteria nanonetworks can effectively retrieve a simple message, such as "Hello World", by conjugation with non-motile bacteria, and finally mobilize towards a final point.
