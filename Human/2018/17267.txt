Learning low dimensional word based linear classifiers using Data Shared Adaptive Bootstrap Aggregated Lasso with application to IMDb data

In this article we propose a new supervised ensemble learning method called Data Shared Adaptive Bootstrap Aggregated (AdaBag) Lasso for capturing low dimensional useful features for word based sentiment analysis and mining problems. The literature on ensemble methods is very rich in both statistics and machine learning. The algorithm is a substantial upgrade of the Data Shared Lasso uplift algorithm. The most significant conceptual addition to the existing literature lies in the final selection of bag of predictors through a special bootstrap aggregation scheme. We apply the algorithm to one simulated data and perform dimension reduction in grouped IMDb data (drama, comedy and horror) to extract reduced set of word features for predicting sentiment ratings of movie reviews demonstrating different aspects. We also compare the performance of the present method with the classical Principal Components with associated Linear Discrimination (PCA-LD) as baseline. There are few limitations in the algorithm. Firstly, the algorithm workflow does not incorporate online sequential data acquisition and it does not use sentence based models which are common in ANN algorithms . Our results produce slightly higher error rate compare to the reported state-of-the-art as a consequence.
