Subspace Support Vector Data Description

This paper proposes a novel method for solving one-class classification problems. The proposed approach, namely Subspace Support Vector Data Description, maps the data to a subspace that is optimized for one-class classification. In that feature space, the optimal hypersphere enclosing the target class is then determined. The method iteratively optimizes the data mapping along with data description in order to define a compact class representation in a low-dimensional feature space. We provide both linear and non-linear mappings for the proposed method. Experiments on 14 publicly available datasets indicate that the proposed Subspace Support Vector Data Description provides better performance compared to baselines and other recently proposed one-class classification methods.
