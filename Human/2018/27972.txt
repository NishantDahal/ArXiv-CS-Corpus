Event Representation through Semantic Roles: Evaluation of Coverage

Semantic role theory is a widely used approach for event representation. Yet, there are multiple indications that semantic role paradigm is necessary but not sufficient to cover all elements of event structure. We conducted an analysis of semantic role representation for events to provide an empirical evidence of insufficiency. The consequence of that is a hybrid role-scalar approach. The results are considered as preliminary in investigation of semantic roles coverage for event representation.
