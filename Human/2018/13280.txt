A Simplified Coding Scheme for the Broadcast Channel With Complementary Receiver Side Information Under Individual Secrecy Constraints

This paper simplifies an existing coding scheme for the two-receiver discrete memoryless broadcast channel with complementary receiver side information where there is a passive eavesdropper and individual secrecy is required. The existing coding scheme is simplified in two steps by replacing Wyner secrecy coding with Carleial-Hellman secrecy coding. The resulting simplified scheme is free from redundant message splits and random components. Not least, the simplified scheme retains the existing achievable individual secrecy rate region. Finally, its construction simplicity helps us gain additional insight on the integration of secrecy techniques into error-correcting coding schemes.
