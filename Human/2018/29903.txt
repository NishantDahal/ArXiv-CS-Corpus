Classifications of quasitrivial semigroups

We investigate classifications of quasitrivial semigroups defined by certain equivalence relations. The subclass of quasitrivial semigroups that preserve a given total ordering is also investigated. In the special case of finite semigroups, we address and solve several related enumeration problems.
