Complete Weight Distribution and MacWilliams Identities for Asymmetric Quantum Codes

In 1997, Shor and Laflamme defined the weight enumerators for quantum error-correcting codes and derived a MacWilliams identity. We extend their work by introducing our double weight enumerators and complete weight enumerators. The MacWilliams identities for these enumerators can be obtained similarly. With the help of MacWilliams identities, we obtain various bounds for asymmetric quantum codes.
