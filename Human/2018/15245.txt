"AIded with emotions" - a new design approach towards affective computer systems

As technologies become more and more pervasive, there is a need for considering the affective dimension of interaction with computer systems to make them more human-like. Current demands for this matter include accurate emotion recognition, reliable emotion modeling, and use of unobtrusive, easily accessible and preferably wearable measurement devices. While AI methods provide many possibilities for better affective information processing, it is not a common scenario for both emotion recognition and modeling to be integrated in the design phase. To address this concern, we propose a new approach based on affective design patterns in the context of video games, together with summary of experiments conducted to test the preliminary hypotheses.
