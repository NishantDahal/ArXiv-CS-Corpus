Neural Generative Models for Global Optimization with Gradients

The aim of global optimization is to find the global optimum of arbitrary classes of functions, possibly highly multimodal ones. In this paper we focus on the subproblem of global optimization for differentiable functions and we propose an Evolutionary Search-inspired solution where we model point search distributions via Generative Neural Networks. This approach enables us to model diverse and complex search distributions based on which we can efficiently explore complicated objective landscapes. In our experiments we show the practical superiority of our algorithm versus classical Evolutionary Search and gradient-based solutions on a benchmark set of multimodal functions, and demonstrate how it can be used to accelerate Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes.
