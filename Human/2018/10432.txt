Minimum distance of Line Orthogonal Grassmann Codes in even characteristic

In this paper we determine the minimum distance of orthogonal line-Grassmann codes for $q$ even. The case $q$ odd was solved in "I. Cardinali, L. Giuzzi, K. Kaipa, A. Pasini, Line Polar Grassmann Codes of Orthogonal Type, J. Pure Applied Algebra."
  We also show that for $q$ even all minimum weight codewords are equivalent and that symplectic line-Grassmann codes are proper subcodes of codimension $2n$ of the orthogonal ones.
