Direction of Arrival Estimation for Nanoscale Sensor Networks

Nanoscale wireless sensor networks (NWSNs) could be within reach soon using graphene-based antennas, which resonate in 0.1-10 terahertz band. To conserve the limited energy available at nanoscale, it is expected that NWSNs will communicate using extremely short pulses on the order of femtoseconds. Accurate estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) for such terahertz pulses will help realize many useful applications for NWSNs. In this paper, using the well-known MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, we study DOA estimation for NWSNs for different energy levels, distances, pulse shapes, and frequencies. Our analyses reveal that the best DOA estimation is achieved with the first order Gaussian pulses, which emit their peak energy at 6 THz. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that MUSIC algorithm is capable of estimating DOA with root mean square error less than one degree from a distance of around 6 meter for pulse energy as little as 1 atto Joule.
