Degree based Topological indices of Hanoi Graph

There are various topological indices for example distance based topological indices and degree based topological indices etc. In QSAR/QSPR study, physiochemical properties and topological indices for example atom bond connectivity index, fourth atom bond connectivity index, Randic connectivity index, sum connectivity index, and so forth are used to characterize the chemical compound. In this paper we computed the edge version of atom bond connectivity index, fourth atom bond connectivity index, Randic connectivity index, sum connectivity index, geometric-arithmetic index and fifth geometric-arithmetic index of Double-wheel graph and Hanoi graph. The results are analyzed and the general formulas are derived for the above mentioned families of graphs.
