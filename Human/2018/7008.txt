Efficient decoding of random errors for quantum expander codes

We show that quantum expander codes, a constant-rate family of quantum LDPC codes, with the quasi-linear time decoding algorithm of Leverrier, Tillich and Zémor can correct a constant fraction of random errors with very high probability. This is the first construction of a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with an efficient decoding algorithm that can correct a linear number of random errors with a negligible failure probability. Finding codes with these properties is also motivated by Gottesman's construction of fault tolerant schemes with constant space overhead.
  In order to obtain this result, we study a notion of $α$-percolation: for a random subset $W$ of vertices of a given graph, we consider the size of the largest connected $α$-subset of $W$, where $X$ is an $α$-subset of $W$ if $|X \cap W| \geq α|X|$.
