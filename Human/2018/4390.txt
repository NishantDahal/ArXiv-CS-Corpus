Sketched Subspace Clustering

The immense amount of daily generated and communicated data presents unique challenges in their processing. Clustering, the grouping of data without the presence of ground-truth labels, is an important tool for drawing inferences from data. Subspace clustering (SC) is a relatively recent method that is able to successfully classify nonlinearly separable data in a multitude of settings. In spite of their high clustering accuracy, SC methods incur prohibitively high computational complexity when processing large volumes of high-dimensional data. Inspired by random sketching approaches for dimensionality reduction, the present paper introduces a randomized scheme for SC, termed Sketch-SC, tailored for large volumes of high-dimensional data. Sketch-SC accelerates the computationally heavy parts of state-of-the-art SC approaches by compressing the data matrix across both dimensions using random projections, thus enabling fast and accurate large-scale SC. Performance analysis as well as extensive numerical tests on real data corroborate the potential of Sketch-SC and its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art scalable SC approaches.
