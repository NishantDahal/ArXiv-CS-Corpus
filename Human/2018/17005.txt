Topology Control of wireless sensor network using Quantum Inspired Genetic algorithm

In this work, an evolving Linked Quantum register has been introduced, which are group vector of binary pair of genes, which in its local proximity represent those nodes that will have high connectivity and keep the energy consumption at low, and which are taken into account for topology control. The register works in higher dimension. Here order-2 Quantum inspired genetic algorithm has been used and also higher order can be used to achieve greater versatility in topology control of nodes. Numerical result has been obtained, analysis is done as how the result has previously been obtained with Quantum genetic algorithm and results are compared too. For future work, factor is hinted which would exploit the algorithm to work in more computational intensive problem.
