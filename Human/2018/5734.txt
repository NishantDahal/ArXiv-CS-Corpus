Reconfiguring spanning and induced subgraphs

Subgraph reconfiguration is a family of problems focusing on the reachability of the solution space in which feasible solutions are subgraphs, represented either as sets of vertices or sets of edges, satisfying a prescribed graph structure property. Although there has been previous work that can be categorized as subgraph reconfiguration, most of the related results appear under the name of the property under consideration; for example, independent set, clique, and matching. In this paper, we systematically clarify the complexity status of subgraph reconfiguration with respect to graph structure properties.
