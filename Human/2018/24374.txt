Hybrid design tools - making of a digitally augmented blackboard

The way that design is being taught is continuously changing under the pressure of the transition from analogical to digital environments. This becomes even more important as the novelty and the alleged superiority of the digital world is used as a marketing tool by competing universities. Even though in some fields of application this approach is desirable, some particular aspects of teaching design and architecture make this transition debatable. The advantages of drawing on blackboards over drawing on whiteboard surfaces in regards of line aesthetic and expression possibilities were previously identified, along with the complementary necessary features for improvement. This study showcases a proof of concept in digitally augmenting a blackboard surface. The system allows the capturing, processing and making real time projections of images over the blackboard surface as trace references. Such a hybrid system, along with providing support for design and architecture related presentations and discussions could also mediate the contradictory relation towards technology that students and teachers have.
