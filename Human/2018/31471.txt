Facial Landmark Detection for Manga Images

The topic of facial landmark detection has been widely covered for pictures of human faces, but it is still a challenge for drawings. Indeed, the proportions and symmetry of standard human faces are not always used for comics or mangas. The personal style of the author, the limitation of colors, etc. makes the landmark detection on faces in drawings a difficult task. Detecting the landmarks on manga images will be useful to provide new services for easily editing the character faces, estimating the character emotions, or generating automatically some animations such as lip or eye movements.
  This paper contains two main contributions: 1) a new landmark annotation model for manga faces, and 2) a deep learning approach to detect these landmarks. We use the "Deep Alignment Network", a multi stage architecture where the first stage makes an initial estimation which gets refined in further stages. The first results show that the proposed method succeed to accurately find the landmarks in more than 80% of the cases.
