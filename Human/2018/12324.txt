Geometric Rounding and Feature Separation in Meshes

Geometric rounding of a mesh is the task of approximating its vertex coordinates by floating point numbers while preserving mesh structure. Geometric rounding allows algorithms of computational geometry to interface with numerical algorithms. We present a practical geometric rounding algorithm for 3D triangle meshes that preserves the topology of the mesh. The basis of the algorithm is a novel strategy: 1) modify the mesh to achieve a feature separation that prevents topology changes when the coordinates change by the rounding unit; and 2) round each vertex coordinate to the closest floating point number. Feature separation is also useful on its own, for example for satisfying minimum separation rules in CAD models. We demonstrate a robust, accurate implementation.
