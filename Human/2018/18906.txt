Lattice based Conceptual Spaces to Explore Cognitive Functionalities for Prosthetic Arm

Upper limb Prosthetic can be viewed as an independent cognitive system in order to develop a conceptual space. In this paper, we provide a detailed analogical reasoning of prosthetic arm to build the conceptual spaces with the help of the theory called geometric framework of conceptual spaces proposed by Gardenfors. Terminologies of conceptual spaces such as concepts, similarities, properties, quality dimensions and prototype are applied for a specific prosthetic system and conceptual space is built for prosthetic arm. Concept lattice traversals are used on the lattice represented conceptual spaces. Cognitive functionalities such as generalization (Similarities) and specialization (Differences) are achieved in the lattice represented conceptual space. This might well prove to design intelligent prosthetics to assist challenged humans. Geometric framework of conceptual spaces holds similar concepts closer in geometric structures in a way similar to concept lattices. Hence, we also propose to use concept lattice to represent concepts of geometric framework of conceptual spaces. Also, we extend our discussion with our insights on conceptual spaces of bidirectional hand prosthetics.
