Automatic Detection of Node-Replication Attack in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks

Recent advances in smart cities applications enforce security threads such as node replication attacks. Such attack is take place when the attacker plants a replicated network node within the network. Vehicular Ad hoc networks are connecting sensors that have limited resources and required the response time to be as low as possible. In this type networks, traditional detection algorithms of node replication attacks are not efficient. In this paper, we propose an initial idea to apply a newly adapted statistical methodology that can detect node replication attacks with high performance as compared to state-of-the-art techniques. We provide a sufficient description of this methodology and a road-map for testing and experiment its performance.
