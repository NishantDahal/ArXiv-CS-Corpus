Measuring network resilience through connection patterns

Networks are at the core of modeling many engineering contexts, mainly in the case of infrastructures and communication systems. The resilience of a network, which is the property of the system capable of absorbing external shocks, is then of paramount relevance in the applications. This paper deals with this topic by advancing a theoretical proposal for measuring the resilience of a network. The proposal is based on the study of the shocks propagation along the patterns of connections among nodes. The theoretical model is tested on the real-world instances of two important airport systems in the US air traffic network; Illinois (including the hub of Chicago) and New York states (with JFK airport).
