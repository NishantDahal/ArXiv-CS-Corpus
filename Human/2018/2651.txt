A New Hybrid Half-Duplex/Full-Duplex Relaying System with Antenna Diversity

The hybrid half-duplex/full-duplex (HD/FD) relaying scheme is an effective paradigm to overcome the negative effects of the self-interference incurred by the full-duplex (FD) mode. However, traditional hybrid HD/FD scheme does not consider the diversity gain incurred by the multiple antennas of the FD node when the system works in the HD mode, leading to the waste of the system resources. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid HD/FD relaying scheme, which utilizes both the antennas of the FD relay node for reception and transmission when the system works in the HD mode. With multiple antennas, the maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission is adopted to process the signals at the relay node. Based on this scheme, we derive the exact closed-form system outage probability and conduct various numerical simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme remarkably improves the system outage performance over the traditional scheme, and demonstrate that the proposed scheme can more effectively alleviate the adverse effects of the residual self-interference.
