Accurate indoor mapping using an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)

An autonomous indoor aerial vehicle requires reliable simul- taneous localization and mapping (SLAM), accurate flight control, and robust path planning for navigation. This paper presents a system level combination of these existing technologies for 2D navigation. An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called URSA (Unmanned Recon and Safety Aircraft) that can autonomously flight and mapping indoors environments with an accuracy of 2 cm was developed. Performance in indoor environments was assessed in terms of mapping and navigation precision.
