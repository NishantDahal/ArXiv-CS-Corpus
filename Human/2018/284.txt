Invariant Checking of NRA Transition Systems via Incremental Reduction to LRA with EUF

Model checking invariant properties of designs, represented as transition systems, with non-linear real arithmetic (NRA), is an important though very hard problem. On the one hand NRA is a hard-to-solve theory; on the other hand most of the powerful model checking techniques lack support for NRA. In this paper, we present a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) approach that leverages linearization techniques from differential calculus to enable the use of mature and efficient model checking algorithms for transition systems on linear real arithmetic (LRA) with uninterpreted functions (EUF). The results of an empirical evaluation confirm the validity and potential of this approach.
