Experimental Demonstration of Geometrically-Shaped Constellations Tailored to the Nonlinear Fibre Channel

A geometrically-shaped 256-QAM constellation, tailored to the nonlinear optical fibre channel, is experimentally demonstrated. The proposed constellation outperforms both uniform and AWGN-tailored 256-QAM, as it is designed to optimise the trade-off between shaping gain, nonlinearity and transceiver impairments.
