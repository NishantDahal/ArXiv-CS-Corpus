A new exact algorithm for solving single machine scheduling problems with learning effects and deteriorating jobs

In this paper, the single machine scheduling problem with deteriorating jobs and learning effects are considered, which is shown in the previous research that the SDR method no longer provides an optimal solution for the problem. In order to solve the problem, a new exact algorithm is proposed. Various test problems are solved to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm using different measures. The results indicate that the algorithm can solve various test problems with small, medium and large sizes in a few seconds with an error around 1% where solving the test problems with more than 15 jobs is almost impossible by examining all possible permutations in both complexity and time aspects.
