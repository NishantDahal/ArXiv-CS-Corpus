Pathological Voice Classification Using Mel-Cepstrum Vectors and Support Vector Machine

Vocal disorders have affected several patients all over the world. Due to the inherent difficulty of diagnosing vocal disorders without sophisticated equipment and trained personnel, a number of patients remain undiagnosed. To alleviate the monetary cost of diagnosis, there has been a recent growth in the use of data analysis to accurately detect and diagnose individuals for a fraction of the cost. We propose a cheap, efficient and accurate model to diagnose whether a patient suffers from one of three vocal disorders on the FEMH 2018 challenge.
