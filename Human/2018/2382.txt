Novel Common Vehicle Information Model (CVIM) for Future Automotive Vehicle Big Data Marketplaces

Even though connectivity services have been introduced in many of the most recent car models, access to vehicle data is currently limited due to its proprietary nature. The European project AutoMat has therefore developed an open Marketplace providing a single point of access for brand-independent vehicle data. Thereby, vehicle sensor data can be leveraged for the design and implementation of entirely new services even beyond trafficrelated applications (such as hyper-local traffic forecasts). This paper presents the architecture for a Vehicle Big Data Marketplace as enabler of cross-sectorial and innovative vehicle data services. Therefore, the novel Common Vehicle Information Model (CVIM) is defined as an open and harmonized data model, allowing the aggregation of brand-independent and generic data sets. Within this work the realization of a prototype CVIM and Marketplace implementation is presented. The two use-cases of local weather prediction and road quality measurements are introduced to show the applicability of the AutoMat concept and prototype to non-automotive application
