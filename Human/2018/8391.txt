An Integrated Development Environment for Planning Domain Modeling

In order to make the task, description of planning domains and problems, more comprehensive for non-experts in planning, the visual representation has been used in planning domain modeling in recent years. However, current knowledge engineering tools with visual modeling, like itSIMPLE (Vaquero et al. 2012) and VIZ (Vodrážka and Chrpa 2010), are less efficient than the traditional method of hand-coding by a PDDL expert using a text editor, and rarely involved in finetuning planning domains depending on the plan validation. Aim at this, we present an integrated development environment KAVI for planning domain modeling inspired by itSIMPLE and VIZ. KAVI using an abstract domain knowledge base to improve the efficiency of planning domain visual modeling. By integrating planners and a plan validator, KAVI proposes a method to fine-tune planning domains based on the plan validation.
