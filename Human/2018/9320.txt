Improved Approximation for Tree Augmentation: Saving by Rewiring

The Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP) is a fundamental network design problem in which we are given a tree and a set of additional edges, also called \emph{links}. The task is to find a set of links, of minimum size, whose addition to the tree leads to a $2$-edge-connected graph. A long line of results on TAP culminated in the previously best known approximation guarantee of $1.5$ achieved by a combinatorial approach due to Kortsarz and Nutov [ACM Transactions on Algorithms 2016], and also by an SDP-based approach by Cheriyan and Gao [Algorithmica 2017]. Moreover, an elegant LP-based $(1.5+ε)$-approximation has also been found very recently by Fiorini, Groß, Könemann, and Sanitá [SODA 2018]. In this paper, we show that an approximation factor below $1.5$ can be achieved, by presenting a $1.458$-approximation that is based on several new techniques.
