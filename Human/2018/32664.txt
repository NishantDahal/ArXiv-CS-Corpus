Max-Min Rates in Self-backhauled Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks

This paper considers the following question for viable wide-area millimeter wave cellular networks. What is the maximum extended coverage area of a single fiber site using multi-hop relaying, while achieving a minimum target per user data rate? We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the minimum end-to-end per user data rate, and exploit unique features of millimeter wave deployments to yield a tractable solution. The mesh network is modeled as a $k-$ring urban-canyon type deployment, where $k$ is the number of hops back to the fiber site. The total number of relays per fiber site grows as $k^2$. We consider both integrated access-backhaul (IAB) and orthogonal access-backhaul (OAB) resource allocation strategies, as well as both half and full duplex base stations (BSs). With a few validated simplifications, our results are given as simple closed-form expressions that are easy to evaluate even for large networks. Several design guidelines are provided, including on the choice of routing and scheduling strategy, the maximum allowable self-interference in full duplex relays and role of dual connectivity to reduce load imbalance across BSs. For example, we show that for certain load conditions there is very little gain to IAB (as considered for 5G) as opposed to tunable OAB (using separate spectrum for access and backhaul links); the latter being significantly simpler to implement.
