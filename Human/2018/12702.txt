audEERING's approach to the One-Minute-Gradual Emotion Challenge

This paper describes audEERING's submissions as well as additional evaluations for the One-Minute-Gradual (OMG) emotion recognition challenge. We provide the results for audio and video processing on subject (in)dependent evaluations. On the provided Development set, we achieved 0.343 Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) for arousal (from audio) and .401 for valence (from video).
