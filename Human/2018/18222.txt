Wireless Powered Communication Networks: TDD or FDD?

In this paper, we compare two common modes of duplexing in wireless powered communication networks (WPCN); namely TDD and FDD. So far, TDD has been the most widely used duplexing technique due to its simplicity. Yet, TDD does not allow the energy transmitter to function continuously, which means to deliver the same amount of energy as that in FDD, the transmitter has to have a higher maximum transmit power. On the other hand, when regulations for power spectral density limits are not restrictive, using FDD may lead to higher throughput than that of TDD by allocating less bandwidth to energy and therefore leaving more bandwidth for data. Hence, the best duplexing technique to choose for a specific problem needs careful examination and evaluation.
