Synthetic Perfusion Maps: Imaging Perfusion Deficits in DSC-MRI with Deep Learning

In this work, we present a novel convolutional neural net- work based method for perfusion map generation in dynamic suscepti- bility contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging. The proposed architecture is trained end-to-end and solely relies on raw perfusion data for inference. We used a dataset of 151 acute ischemic stroke cases for evaluation. Our method generates perfusion maps that are comparable to the target maps used for clinical routine, while being model-free, fast, and less noisy.
