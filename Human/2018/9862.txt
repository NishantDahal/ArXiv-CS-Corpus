Data-mining the Foundational Patents of Photovoltaic Materials: An application of Patent Citation Spectroscopy

We apply Patent Citation Spectroscopy (PCS)--originally developed as Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy for studying landmarks and milestones in scientific literature--to patent literature classified into the nine Y-subclasses of the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) that describe material photovoltaic technologies. For this study we extended the routine with the option to use the advanced search queries at PatentsView. On the basis of two normalizations of the longitudinal distribution of the publication years of the patents cited by the retrieved patents, the routine (at http://www.leydesdorff.net/comins/pcs/index.html) provides a best guess of the foundational patent for the subject specified in the string. In five of the nine cases, we found corroborating evidence for the foundational character of the patent indicated by the routine.
