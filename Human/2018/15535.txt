In Ictu Oculi: Exposing AI Generated Fake Face Videos by Detecting Eye Blinking

The new developments in deep generative networks have significantly improve the quality and efficiency in generating realistically-looking fake face videos. In this work, we describe a new method to expose fake face videos generated with neural networks. Our method is based on detection of eye blinking in the videos, which is a physiological signal that is not well presented in the synthesized fake videos. Our method is tested over benchmarks of eye-blinking detection datasets and also show promising performance on detecting videos generated with DeepFake.
