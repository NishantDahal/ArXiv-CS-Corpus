A System for Efficient Communication between Patients and Pharmacies

When studying human-technology interaction systems, researchers thrive to achieve intuitiveness and facilitate the people's life through a thoughtful and in-depth study of several components of the application system that supports some particular business communication with customers. Particularly in the healthcare field, some requirements such as clarity, transparency, efficiency, and speed in transmitting information to patients and or healthcare professionals might mean an important increase in the well-being of the patient and productivity of the healthcare professional. In this work, the authors study the difficulties patients frequently have when communicating with pharmacists. In addition to a statistical study of a survey conducted with more than two hundred frequent pharmacy customers, we propose an IT solution for better communication between patients and pharmacists.
