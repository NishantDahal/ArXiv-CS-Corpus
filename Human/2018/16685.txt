Recovering sparse graphs

We construct a fixed parameter algorithm parameterized by d and k that takes as an input a graph G' obtained from a d-degenerate graph G by complementing on at most k arbitrary subsets of the vertex set of G and outputs a graph H such that G and H agree on all but f(d,k) vertices.
  Our work is motivated by the first order model checking in graph classes that are first order interpretable in classes of sparse graphs. We derive as a corollary that if G_0 is a graph class with bounded expansion, then the first order model checking is fixed parameter tractable in the class of all graphs that can obtained from a graph G from G_0 by complementing on at most k arbitrary subsets of the vertex set of G; this implies an earlier result that the first order model checking is fixed parameter tractable in graph classes interpretable in classes of graphs with bounded maximum degree.
