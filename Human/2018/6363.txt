Decision-making processes in the Cognitive Theory of True Conditions

The Cognitive Theory of True Conditions (CTTC) is a proposal to design the implementation of cognitive abilities and to describe the model-theoretic semantics of symbolic cognitive architectures. The CTTC is formulated mathematically using the multi-optional many-sorted past present future(MMPPF) structures. This article discussed how decision-making processes are described in the CTTC.
