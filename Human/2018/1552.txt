Bisymmetric and quasitrivial operations: characterizations and enumerations

We investigate the class of bisymmetric and quasitrivial binary operations on a given set $X$ and provide various characterizations of this class as well as the subclass of bisymmetric, quasitrivial, and order-preserving binary operations. We also determine explicitly the sizes of these classes when the set $X$ is finite.
