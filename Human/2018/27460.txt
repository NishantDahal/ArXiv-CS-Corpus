SCPNet: Spatial-Channel Parallelism Network for Joint Holistic and Partial Person Re-Identification

Holistic person re-identification (ReID) has received extensive study in the past few years and achieves impressive progress. However, persons are often occluded by obstacles or other persons in practical scenarios, which makes partial person re-identification non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a spatial-channel parallelism network (SCPNet) in which each channel in the ReID feature pays attention to a given spatial part of the body. The spatial-channel corresponding relationship supervises the network to learn discriminative feature for both holistic and partial person re-identification. The single model trained on four holistic ReID datasets achieves competitive accuracy on these four datasets, as well as outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two partial ReID datasets without training.
