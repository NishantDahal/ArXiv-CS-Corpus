Proceedings First Workshop on Architectures, Languages and Paradigms for IoT

The 1st workshop on Architectures, Languages and Paradigms for IoT (ALP4IoT 2017), was held in Turin on September 19th, 2017. ALP4IoT was a satellite event of the 13th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2017). The workshop aimed at critically reviewing the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice of formal techniques and software methods for the IoT, presenting open problems and challenges and triggering a discussion among the participants with different views and backgrounds. The Internet of Things is ushering a dramatic increase in number and variety of interconnected and smart objects. Communication capabilities and computational power are growingly embedded in everyday devices, including personal smart devices, public displays, cars, drones, and electronic tags. This state of the things opens an unprecedented range of research opportunities: the inherent distribution, mobility, situatedness, and heterogeneity of such devices call for proper scientific understanding of the foundations of such systems as well as for novel software methods. The workshop solicited original contributions on architectures, languages, paradigms, and techniques with potential practical and theoretical impact on software systems targeting the IoT, welcoming inter-disciplinary approaches.
