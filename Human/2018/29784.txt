The SWAG Algorithm; a Mathematical Approach that Outperforms Traditional Deep Learning. Theory and Implementation

The performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is influenced by weight initialization, the nature of activation functions, and their architecture. There is a wide range of activation functions that are traditionally used to train a neural network, e.g. sigmoid, tanh, and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). A widespread practice is to use the same type of activation function in all neurons in a given layer. In this manuscript, we present a type of neural network in which the activation functions in every layer form a polynomial basis; we name this method SWAG after the initials of the last names of the authors. We tested SWAG on three complex highly non-linear functions as well as the MNIST handwriting data set. SWAG outperforms and converges faster than the state of the art performance in fully connected neural networks. Given the low computational complexity of SWAG, and the fact that it was capable of solving problems current architectures cannot, it has the potential to change the way that we approach deep learning.
