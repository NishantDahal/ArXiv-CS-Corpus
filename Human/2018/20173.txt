Cerebral Signal Instantaneous Parameters Estimation MATLAB Toolbox - User Guide Version 2.3

This document is meant to help individuals use the Cerebral Signal Phase Analysis toolbox which implements different methods for estimating the instantaneous phase and frequency of a signal and calculating some related popular quantities.The toolbox -- which is distributed under the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE as a set of MATLAB routines -- can be downloaded at the address http://oset.ir/category.php?dir=Tools.The purpose of this toolbox is to calculate the instantaneous phase and frequency sequences of cerebral signals (EEG, MEG, etc.) and some related popular features and quantities in brain studies and Neuroscience such as Phase Shift, Phase Resetting, Phase Locking Value (PLV), Phase Difference and more, to help researchers in these fields.
