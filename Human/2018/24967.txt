Scalable Load Balancing Algorithms in Networked Systems

A fundamental challenge in large-scale networked systems viz., data centers and cloud networks is to distribute tasks to a pool of servers, using minimal instantaneous state information, while providing excellent delay performance. In this thesis we design and analyze load balancing algorithms that aim to achieve a highly efficient distribution of tasks, optimize server utilization, and minimize communication overhead.
