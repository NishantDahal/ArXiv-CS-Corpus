A SwarmESB Based Architecture for an European Healthcare Insurance System in Compliance with GDPR

With the everlasting development of technology and society, data privacy has proven to grow into a pressing issue. The bureaucratic state system seems to expand the number of personal documents required for any kind of request. Therefore, it becomes obvious that the number of people having access to information that should be private is on the rise as well. This paper offers an alternative cloud integration solution centered on user data privacy, its main purpose being to help software services providers and public institutions to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation. Throughout this proposal we describe how data confidentiality can be achieved by transitioning complex human procedures into a coordinated and decoupled swarm system, whose core lies within the "Privacy by Design" principles.
