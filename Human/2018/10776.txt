Core Conflictual Relationship: Text Mining to Discover What and When

Following detailed presentation of the Core Conflictual Relationship Theme (CCRT), there is the objective of relevant methods for what has been described as verbalization and visualization of data. Such is also termed data mining and text mining, and knowledge discovery in data. The Correspondence Analysis methodology, also termed Geometric Data Analysis, is shown in a case study to be comprehensive and revealing. Computational efficiency depends on how the analysis process is structured. For both illustrative and revealing aspects of the case study here, relatively extensive dream reports are used. This Geometric Data Analysis confirms the validity of CCRT method.
