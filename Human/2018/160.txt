Quantized Constant Envelope Precoding with PSK and QAM Signaling

Coarsely quantized massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems are gaining more interest due to their power efficiency. We present a new precoding technique to mitigate the Multi-User Interference (MUI) and the quantization distortions in a downlink Multi-User (MU) MIMO system with coarsely Quantized Constant Envelope (QCE) signals at the transmitter. The transmit signal vector is optimized for every desired received vector taking into account the QCE constraint. The optimization is based on maximizing the safety margin to the decision thresholds of the receiver constellation modulation. Simulation results show a significant gain in terms of the uncoded Bit Error Ratio (BER) compared to the existing linear precoding techniques.
