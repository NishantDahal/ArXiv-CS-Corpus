On critical and maximal digraphs

This paper is devoted to the study of directed graphs with extremal properties relative to certain metric functionals. We characterize up to isomorphism critical digraphs with infinite values of diameter, quasi-diameter, radius and quasi-radius. Moreover, maximal digraphs with finite values of radius and quasi-diameter are studied.
