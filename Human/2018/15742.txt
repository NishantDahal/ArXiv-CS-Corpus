Blocking time under basic priority inheritance: Polynomial bound and exact computation

The Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP) is arguably the best-known protocol for resource sharing under real-time constraints. Its importance in modern applications is undisputed. Nevertheless, because jobs may be blocked under PIP for a variety of reasons, determining a job's maximum blocking time could be difficult, and thus far no exact method has been proposed that does it. Existing analysis methods are inefficient, inaccurate, and of limited applicability. This article proposes a new characterization of the problem, thus allowing a polynomial method for bounding the blocking time, and an exact, optimally efficient method for blocking time computation under priority inheritance that have a general applicability.
