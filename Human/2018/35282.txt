Hallucinating very low-resolution and obscured face images

Most of the face hallucination methods are designed for complete inputs. They will not work well if the inputs are very tiny or contaminated by large occlusion. Inspired by this fact, we propose an obscured face hallucination network(OFHNet). The OFHNet consists of four parts: an inpainting network, an upsampling network, a discriminative network, and a fixed facial landmark detection network. The inpainting network restores the low-resolution(LR) obscured face images. The following upsampling network is to upsample the output of inpainting network. In order to ensure the generated high-resolution(HR) face images more photo-realistic, we utilize the discriminative network and the facial landmark detection network to better the result of upsampling network. In addition, we present a semantic structure loss, which makes the generated HR face images more pleasing. Extensive experiments show that our framework can restore the appealing HR face images from 1/4 missing area LR face images with a challenging scaling factor of 8x.
