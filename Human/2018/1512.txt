O(lgN) Line Clipping Algorithm in E2

A new O(lg N) line clipping algorithm in E2 against a convex window is presented. The main advantage of the presented algorithm is the principal acceleration of the line clipping problem solution. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with others shows a significant improvement in run-time. Experimental results for selected known algorithms are also shown.
