Email Classification into Relevant Category Using Neural Networks

In the real world, many online shopping websites or service provider have single email-id where customers can send their query, concern etc. At the back-end service provider receive million of emails every week, how they can identify which email is belonged of a particular department? This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model that is used to solve this problem and experiments are carried out on user personal Gmail emails datasets. This problem can be generalised as typical Text Classification or Categorization.
