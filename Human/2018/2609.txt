Sounderfeit: Cloning a Physical Model with Conditional Adversarial Autoencoders

An adversarial autoencoder conditioned on known parameters of a physical modeling bowed string synthesizer is evaluated for use in parameter estimation and resynthesis tasks. Latent dimensions are provided to capture variance not explained by the conditional parameters. Results are compared with and without the adversarial training, and a system capable of "copying" a given parameter-signal bidirectional relationship is examined. A real-time synthesis system built on a generative, conditioned and regularized neural network is presented, allowing to construct engaging sound synthesizers based purely on recorded data.
