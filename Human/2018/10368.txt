On the Comparison of Context-Free Grammars

In this paper we consider the problem of context-free grammars comparison from the analysis point of view. We show that the problem can be reduced to numerical solution of systems of nonlinear matrix equations. The approach presented here forms a basis for probabilistic comparison algorithms oriented to automatic assessment of of student's answers in computer science.
