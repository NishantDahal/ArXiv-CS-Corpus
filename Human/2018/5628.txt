Gallai's path decomposition conjecture for triangle-free planar graphs

A path decomposition of a graph $G$ is a collection of edge-disjoint paths of $G$ that covers the edge set of $G$. Gallai (1968) conjectured that every connected graph on $n$ vertices admits a path decomposition of cardinality at most $\lfloor (n+1)/2\rfloor$. Gallai's Conjecture has been verified for many classes of graphs. In particular, Lov√°sz (1968) verified this conjecture for graphs with at most one vertex with even degree, and Pyber (1996) verified it for graphs in which every cycle contains a vertex with odd degree. Recently, Bonamy and Perrett (2016) verified Gallai's Conjecture for graphs with maximum degree at most $5$, and Botler et al. (2017) verified it for graphs with treewidth at most $3$. In this paper, we verify Gallai's Conjecture for triangle-free planar graphs.
