Thermodynamic Properties of Molecular Communication

In this paper, we consider the energy cost of communicating using molecular communication. In a simplified scenario, we show that the energy bound in Landauer's principle can be achieved, implying that molecular communication can approach fundamental thermodynamic limits.
