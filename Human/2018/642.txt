IoT Security Techniques Based on Machine Learning

Internet of things (IoT) that integrate a variety of devices into networks to provide advanced and intelligent services have to protect user privacy and address attacks such as spoofing attacks, denial of service attacks, jamming and eavesdropping. In this article, we investigate the attack model for IoT systems, and review the IoT security solutions based on machine learning techniques including supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. We focus on the machine learning based IoT authentication, access control, secure offloading and malware detection schemes to protect data privacy. In this article, we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed to implement these machine learning based security schemes in practical IoT systems.
