Dynamic Spectrum Sensing Through Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization

In this paper, a novel optimization algorithm, called the acceleration-aided particle swarm optimization (AAPSO), is proposed for reliable dynamic spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. In A-APSO, the acceleration variable of the particles in the swarm is also considered in the search space of the optimization problem. We show that the proposed A-APSO based spectrum sensing technique is more efficient in terms of performance than the corresponding one based on the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm.
