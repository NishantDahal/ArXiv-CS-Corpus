Optimal QoS Constraint Service Composition in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

In recent year's computational capability of the mobile nodes have been greatly improved. The mobile nodes have the capability of running different applications. Implementation of services in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) increases the flexibility of using mobile devices for running a wide variety of applications. Single service cannot satisfy the user needs. The complex needs of the users can be satisfied by the service composition. Service composition means, combining the atomic services into a complex service. In this paper we propose QoS constraint service composition in MANETs. We considered both service QoS parameters as well node parameters. Response time and throughput as parameters for services and energy and hop count as node parameters. These four QoS parameters are optimized using a mathematical model Hammerstein model to generate a single output. Based on generated output, max valued (optimal) services are considered in service composition path. The simulation results shown that, our proposed method outperforms than the traditional AODV method of service composition.
