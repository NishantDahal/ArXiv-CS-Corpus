An Easy & Collaborative RDF Data Entry Method using the Spreadsheet Metaphor

Spreadsheets are widely used by knowledge workers, especially in the industrial sector. Their methodology enables a well understood, easy and fast possibility to enter data. As filling out a spreadsheet is more accessible to common knowledge workers than defining RDF statements, in this paper, we propose an easy-to-use, zero-configuration, web-based spreadsheet editor that simultaneously transfers spreadsheet entries into RDF statements. It enables various kinds of users to easily create semantic data whether they are RDF experts or novices. The typical scenario we address focuses on creating instance data starting with an empty knowledge base that is filled incrementally. In a user study, participants were able to create more statements in shorter time, having similar or even significantly outperforming quality, compared to other approaches.
