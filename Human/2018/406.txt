Data is the Fuel of Organizations: Opportunities and Challenges in Afghanistan

In this paper, the author at first briefly outlines the value of data in organizations and the opportunities and challenges in Afghanistan. Then the author takes the Kankor (National University Entrance Exam) data, particularly names of participants, locations, high schools and higher education institutions into account and explains how these data, that organizations in Afghanistan do not use for anything, can be useful in several cases and areas. The application of these data is shown through cases such as Auto filling missing values, identifying names of people, locations, and institutions from unstructured text, generating fake data to benchmark the database and web application performance and appearance, comparing and matching high school data with Kankor data, producing the top-n male and female names very common in Afghanistan or province-wise, and the data mining application in education and higher education institutions.
