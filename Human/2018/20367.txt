On the Composability of Statistically Secure Random Oblivious Transfer

We show that stand-alone statistically secure random oblivious transfer protocols based on two-party stateless primitives are statistically universally composable. I.e. they are simulatable secure with an unlimited adversary, an unlimited simulator and an unlimited environment machine. Our result implies that several previous oblivious transfer protocols in the literature which were proven secure under weaker, non-composable definitions of security can actually be used in arbitrary statistically secure applications without lowering the security.
