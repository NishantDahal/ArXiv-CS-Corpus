Enhanced string factoring from alphabet orderings

In this note we consider the concept of alphabet ordering in the context of string factoring. We propose a greedy-type algorithm which produces Lyndon factorizations with small numbers of factors along with a modification for large numbers of factors. For the technique we introduce the Exponent Parikh vector. Applications and research directions derived from circ-UMFFs are discussed.
