MIMO Channel Information Feedback Using Deep Recurrent Network

In a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is essential for performance improvement. Recent convolutional neural network (NN) based techniques show competitive ability in realizing CSI compression and feedback. By introducing a new NN architecture, we enhance the accuracy of quantized CSI feedback in MIMO communications. The proposed NN architecture invokes a module named long short-term memory (LSTM) which admits the NN to benefit from exploiting temporal and frequency correlations of wireless channels. Compromising performance with complexity, we further modify the NN architecture with a significantly reduced number of parameters to be trained. Finally, experiments show that the proposed NN architectures achieve better performance in terms of both CSI compression and recovery accuracy.
