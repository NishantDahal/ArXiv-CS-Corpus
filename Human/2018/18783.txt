An Image Encryption Algorithm Based on Chaotic Maps and Discrete Linear Chirp Transform

In this paper, a novel image encryption algorithm, which involves a chaotic block image scrambling followed by a two-dimensional (2-D) discrete linear chirp transform, is proposed. The definition of the 2-D discrete linear chirp transform is introduced and then it is used to construct the basis of the novel encryption algorithm. Finally, security analysis are performed to show the quality of the encryption process using different metrics.
