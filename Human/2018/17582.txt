ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Deep Encoder-Decoder Network

This paper summarizes our method and validation results for part 1 of the ISBI Challenge 2018. Our algorithm makes use of deep encoder-decoder network and novel skin lesion data augmentation to segment the challenge objective. Besides, we also propose an effective testing strategy by applying multi-model comparison.
