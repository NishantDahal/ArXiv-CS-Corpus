A comprehensive study of Game Theory applications for smart grids, demand side management programs, and transportation networks

Game theory is a powerful analytical tool for modeling decision makers strategies, behaviors and interactions. Act and decisions of a decision maker can benefit or negatively impact other decision makers interests. Game theory has been broadly used in economics, politics and engineering field. For example, game theory can model decision making procedure of different companies competing with each other to maximize their profit. Here, we present a brief introduction of game theory formulation and its applications. The focus of the chapter is non-cooperative Stackelberg game model and its applications in solving power system related problems. These applications include but not limited to; expanding transmission network, improving power system reliability, containing market power in the electricity market, solving power system dispatch, executing demand response and allocating resource in a wireless system. Finally, this chapter elaborates on solving a game theory problem through an example.
