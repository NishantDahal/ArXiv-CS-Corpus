Automatic generation of ground truth for the evaluation of obstacle detection and tracking techniques

As automated vehicles are getting closer to becoming a reality, it will become mandatory to be able to characterise the performance of their obstacle detection systems. This validation process requires large amounts of ground-truth data, which is currently generated by manually annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to generate ground-truth kinematics datasets for specific objects in real-world scenes. Our procedure requires no annotation whatsoever, human intervention being limited to sensors calibration. We present the recording platform which was exploited to acquire the reference data and a detailed and thorough analytical study of the propagation of errors in our procedure. This allows us to provide detailed precision metrics for each and every data item in our datasets. Finally some visualisations of the acquired data are given.
