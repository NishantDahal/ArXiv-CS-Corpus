Reversible Truly Concurrent Process Algebra

We design a reversible version of truly concurrent process algebra CTC which is called RCTC. It has good properties modulo several kinds of strongly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations and weakly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations. These properties include monoid laws, static laws, new expansion law for strongly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations, Ï„laws for weakly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations, and congruences for strongly and weakly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations.
