Security Vulnerabilities Against Fingerprint Biometric System

The biometric system is an automatic identification and authentication system that uses unique biological traits, such as fingerprint, face, iris, voice, retina, etc. of an individual. Of all these systems, fingerprint biometric system is the most widely used because of its low cost, high matching speed, and relatively high matching accuracy. Due to the high efficiency of fingerprint biometric system in verifying a legitimate user, numerous government and private organizations are using this system for security purpose. This paper provides an overview of the fingerprint biometric system and gives details about various current security aspects related to the system. The security concerns that we address include multiple attacks on the system, associated threat models, biometric cryptosystems, current issues, challenges, opportunities, and open problems that exist in present day fingerprint biometric systems
