Basic concepts and tools for the Toki Pona minimal and constructed language: description of the language and main issues; analysis of the vocabulary; text synthesis and syntax highlighting; Wordnet synsets

A minimal constructed language (conlang) is useful for experiments and comfortable for making tools. The Toki Pona (TP) conlang is minimal both in the vocabulary (with only 14 letters and 124 lemmas) and in the (about) 10 syntax rules. The language is useful for being a used and somewhat established minimal conlang with at least hundreds of fluent speakers. This article exposes current concepts and resources for TP, and makes available Python (and Vim) scripted routines for the analysis of the language, synthesis of texts, syntax highlighting schemes, and the achievement of a preliminary TP Wordnet. Focus is on the analysis of the basic vocabulary, as corpus analyses were found. The synthesis is based on sentence templates, relates to context by keeping track of used words, and renders larger texts by using a fixed number of phonemes (e.g. for poems) and number of sentences, words and letters (e.g. for paragraphs). Syntax highlighting reflects morphosyntactic classes given in the official dictionary and different solutions are described and implemented in the well-established Vim text editor. The tentative TP Wordnet is made available in three patterns of relations between synsets and word lemmas. In summary, this text holds potentially novel conceptualizations about, and tools and results in analyzing, synthesizing and syntax highlighting the TP language.
