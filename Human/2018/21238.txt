QoE-Aware Resource Allocation for Small Cells

In this paper, we study the problem of Quality of Experience (QoE) aware resource allocation in wireless systems. In particular, we consider application-aware joint Bandwidth-Power allocation for a small cell. We optimize a QoE metric for multi-user video streaming in a small cell that maintains a trade-off between maximizing the playback rate of each user and ensuring proportional fairness (PF) among users. We formulate the application-driven joint bandwidth-power allocation as a non-convex optimization problem. However, we develop a polynomial complexity algorithm, and we show that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal solution of the proposed optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed QoE-aware algorithm significantly improves the average QoE. Moreover, it outperforms the weighted sum rate allocation which is the state-of-the-art physical resource allocation scheme.
