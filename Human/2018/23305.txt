Blockchain and Smart-contracts Modeled in a SwarmESB Ecosystem

Blockchain has emerged as a trusted and secure distributed ledger for transactions while also being decentralised, distributed and its legitimacy not guaranteed by a trusted authority. Since the appearance of Bitcoin, Blockchain has known many implementations based on P2P architectures. This paper presents how the blockchain and smart contracts technologies can be integrated into the SwarmESB ecosystem. SwarmESB is a framework that helps building distributed applications, which benefit from privacy and scalability features. Our proposal will present the flexibility in building not only microservices based applications, but also decen-tralised applications employing blockchain and smart-contracts by modeling a sample Dapp.
