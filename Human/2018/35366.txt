Error estimation at the information reconciliation stage of quantum key distribution

Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a practical solution for secure communication between two distinct parties via a quantum channel and an authentic public channel. In this work, we consider different approaches to the quantum bit error rate (QBER) estimation at the information reconciliation stage of the post-processing procedure. For reconciliation schemes employing low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, we develop a novel syndrome-based QBER estimation algorithm. The algorithm suggested is suitable for irregular LDPC codes and takes into account punctured and shortened bits. Testing our approach in a real QKD setup, we show that an approach combining the proposed algorithm with conventional QBER estimation techniques allows one to improve the accuracy of the QBER estimation.
