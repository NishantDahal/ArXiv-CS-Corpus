Selected Qualitative Spatio-temporal Calculi Developed for Constraint Reasoning: A Review

In this article a few of the qualitative spatio-temporal knowledge representation techniques developed by the constraint reasoning community within artificial intelligence are reviewed. The objective is to provide a broad exposure to any other interested group who may utilize these representations. The author has a particular interest in applying these calculi (in a broad sense) in topological data analysis, as these schemes are highly qualitative in nature.
