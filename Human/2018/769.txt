Using Sat solvers for synchronization issues in non-deterministic automata

We approach the problem of computing a $D_{3}$-synchronizing word of minimum length for a given nondeterministic automaton via its encoding as an instance of SAT and invoking a SAT solver. We also present some experimental results.
