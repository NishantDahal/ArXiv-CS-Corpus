Block-optimized Variable Bit Rate Neural Image Compression

In this work, we propose an end-to-end block-based auto-encoder system for image compression. We introduce novel contributions to neural-network based image compression, mainly in achieving binarization simulation, variable bit rates with multiple networks, entropy-friendly representations, inference-stage code optimization and performance-improving normalization layers in the auto-encoder. We evaluate and show the incremental performance increase of each of our contributions.
