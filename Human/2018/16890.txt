AP-initiated Multi-User Transmissions in IEEE 802.11ax WLANs

Next-generation 802.11ax WLANs will make extensive use of multi-user communications in both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) directions to achieve high and efficient spectrum utilization in scenarios with many user stations per access point. It will become possible with the support of multi-user (MU) multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) transmissions. In this paper, we first overview the novel characteristics introduced by IEEE 802.11ax to implement AP-initiated OFDMA and MU-MIMO transmissions in both downlink and uplink directions. Namely, we describe the changes made at the physical layer and at the medium access control layer to support OFDMA, the use of \emph{trigger frames} to schedule uplink multi-user transmissions, and the new \emph{multi-user RTS/CTS mechanism} to protect large multi-user transmissions from collisions. Then, in order to study the achievable throughput of an 802.11ax network, we use both mathematical analysis and simulations to numerically quantify the benefits of MU transmissions and the impact of 802.11ax overheads on the WLAN saturation throughput. Results show the advantages of MU transmissions in scenarios with many user stations, also providing some novel insights on the conditions in which 802.11ax WLANs are able to maximize their performance, such as the existence of an optimal number of active user stations in terms of throughput, or the need to provide strict prioritization to AP-initiated MU transmissions to avoid collisions with user stations.
