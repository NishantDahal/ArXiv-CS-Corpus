Automatic Exploration of Machine Learning Experiments on OpenML

Understanding the influence of hyperparameters on the performance of a machine learning algorithm is an important scientific topic in itself and can help to improve automatic hyperparameter tuning procedures. Unfortunately, experimental meta data for this purpose is still rare. This paper presents a large, free and open dataset addressing this problem, containing results on 38 OpenML data sets, six different machine learning algorithms and many different hyperparameter configurations. Results where generated by an automated random sampling strategy, termed the OpenML Random Bot. Each algorithm was cross-validated up to 20.000 times per dataset with different hyperparameters settings, resulting in a meta dataset of around 2.5 million experiments overall.
