Multi-layer Kernel Ridge Regression for One-class Classification

In this paper, a multi-layer architecture (in a hierarchical fashion) by stacking various Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) based Auto-Encoder for one-class classification is proposed and is referred as MKOC. MKOC has many layers of Auto-Encoders to project the input features into new feature space and the last layer was regression based one class classifier. The Auto-Encoders use an unsupervised approach of learning and the final layer uses semi-supervised (trained by only positive samples) approach of learning. The proposed MKOC is experimentally evaluated on 15 publicly available benchmark datasets. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach over 11 existing state-of-the-art kernel-based one-class classifiers. Friedman test is also performed to verify the statistical significance of the claim of the superiority of the proposed one-class classifiers over the existing state-of-the-art methods.
