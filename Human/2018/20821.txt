Enhancing Cellular Performance through Device-to-Device Distributed MIMO

The integration of local device-to-device (D2D) communications and cellular connections has been intensively studied to satisfy co-existing D2D and cellular communication demand. In future cellular networks, there will be numerous standby users possessing D2D communication capabilities in close proximity to each other. Considering that these standby users do not necessarily request D2D communications all the time, in this paper we propose a hybrid D2D-cellular scheme to make use of these standby users and to improve the rate performance for cellular users. More specifically, through D2D links, a virtual antenna array can be formed by sharing antennas across different terminals to realize the diversity gain of MIMO channels. This paper considers the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) links to enable high data rate D2D communications. We then design an orthogonal D2D multiple access protocol and formulate the optimization problem of joint cellular and D2D resource allocation for downlink transmissions using the proposed scheme. We obtain a closed-form solution for D2D resource allocation, which reveals useful insights for practical system design. Numerical results from extensive system-level simulations demonstrate that the rate performance of cellular users is significantly improved.
