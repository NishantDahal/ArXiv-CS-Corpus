Interleaved Training and Training-Based Transmission Design for Hybrid Massive Antenna Downlink

In this paper, we study the beam-based training design jointly with the transmission design for hybrid massive antenna single-user (SU) and multiple-user (MU) systems where outage probability is adopted as the performance measure. For SU systems, we propose an interleaved training design to concatenate the feedback and training procedures, thus making the training length adaptive to the channel realization. Exact analytical expressions are derived for the average training length and the outage probability of the proposed interleaved training. For MU systems, we propose a joint design for the beam-based interleaved training, beam assignment, and MU data transmissions. Two solutions for the beam assignment are provided with different complexity-performance tradeoff. Analytical results and simulations show that for both SU and MU systems, the proposed joint training and transmission designs achieve the same outage performance as the traditional full-training scheme but with significant saving in the training overhead.
