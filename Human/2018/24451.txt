Arbitrarily Varying Remote Sources

We study a lossy source coding problem for an arbitrarily varying remote source (AVRS) which was proposed in a prior work. An AVRS transmits symbols, each generated in an independent and identically distributed manner, which are sought to be estimated at the decoder. These symbols are remotely generated, and the encoder and decoder observe noise corrupted versions received through a two-output noisy channel. This channel is an arbitrarily varying channel controlled by a jamming adversary. We assume that the adversary knows the coding scheme as well as the source data non-causally, and hence, can employ malicious jamming strategies correlated to them. Our interest lies in studying the rate distortion function for codes with a stochastic encoder, i.e, when the encoder can privately randomize while the decoder is deterministic. We provide upper and lower bounds on this rate distortion function.
