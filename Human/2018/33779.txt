Toward Intelligent Network Optimization in Wireless Networking: An Auto-learning Framework

In wireless communication systems (WCSs), the network optimization problems (NOPs) play an important role in maximizing system performances by setting appropriate network configurations. When dealing with NOPs by using conventional optimization methodologies, there exist the following three problems: human intervention, model invalid, and high computation complexity. As such, in this article we propose an auto-learning framework (ALF) to achieve intelligent and automatic network optimization by using machine learning (ML) techniques. We review the basic concepts of ML techniques, and propose their rudimentary employment models in WCSs, including automatic model construction, experience replay, efficient trial-and-error, RL-driven gaming, complexity reduction, and solution recommendation. We hope these proposals can provide new insights and motivations in future researches for dealing with NOPs in WCSs by using ML techniques.
