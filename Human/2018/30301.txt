Approximate Multi-Matroid Intersection via Iterative Refinement

We introduce a new iterative rounding technique to round a point in a matroid polytope subject to further matroid constraints. This technique returns an independent set in one matroid with limited violations of the other ones. On top of the classical steps of iterative relaxation approaches, we iteratively refine/split involved matroid constraints to obtain a more restrictive constraint system, that is amenable to iterative relaxation techniques. Hence, throughout the iterations, we both tighten constraints and later relax them by dropping constrains under certain conditions. Due to the refinement step, we can deal with considerably more general constraint classes than existing iterative relaxation/rounding methods, which typically round on one matroid polytope with additional simple cardinality constraints that do not overlap too much.
  We show how our rounding method, combined with an application of a matroid intersection algorithm, yields the first $2$-approximation for finding a maximum-weight common independent set in $3$ matroids. Moreover, our $2$-approximation is LP-based, and settles the integrality gap for the natural relaxation of the problem. Prior to our work, no better upper bound than $3$ was known for the integrality gap, which followed from the greedy algorithm. We also discuss various other applications of our techniques, including an extension that allows us to handle a mixture of matroid and knapsack constraints.
