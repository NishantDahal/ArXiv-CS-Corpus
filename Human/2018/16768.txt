Vision and Challenges for Knowledge Centric Networking (KCN)

In the creation of a smart future information society, Internet of Things (IoT) and Content Centric Networking (CCN) break two key barriers for both the front-end sensing and back-end networking. However, we still observe the missing piece of the research that dominates the current networking traffic control and system management, e.g., lacking of the knowledge penetrated into both sensing and networking to glue them holistically. In this paper, we envision to leverage emerging machine learning or deep learning techniques to create aspects of knowledge for facilitating the designs. In particular, we can extract knowledge from collected data to facilitate reduced data volume, enhanced system intelligence and interactivity, improved service quality, communication with better controllability and lower cost. We name such a knowledge-oriented traffic control and networking management paradigm as the Knowledge Centric Networking (KCN). This paper presents KCN rationale, KCN benefits, related works and research opportunities.
