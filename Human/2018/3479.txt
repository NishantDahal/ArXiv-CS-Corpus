Mode Selection and Spectrum Partition for D2D Inband Communications: A Physical Layer Security Perspective

This paper investigates from the physical layer security (PLS) perspective the fundamental issues of mode selection and spectrum partition in cellular networks with inband device-to-device (D2D) communication. We consider a mode selection scheme allowing each D2D pair to probabilistically switch between the underlay and overlay modes, and also a spectrum partition scheme where the system spectrum is orthogonally partitioned between cellular and overlay D2D communications. We first develop a general theoretical framework to model both the secrecy outage/secrecy capacity performance of cellular users and outage/capacity performance of D2D pairs, and to conduct performance optimization to identify the optimal mode selection and spectrum partition for secrecy capacity maximization and secrecy outage probability minimization. A case study is then provided to demonstrate the application of our theoretical framework for performance modeling and optimization, and also to illustrate the impacts of mode selection and spectrum partition on the PLS performances of inband D2D communications.
