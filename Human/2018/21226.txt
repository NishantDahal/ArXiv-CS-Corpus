Multicast With Prioritized Delivery: How Fresh is Your Data?

We consider a multicast network in which real-time status updates generated by a source are replicated and sent to multiple interested receiving nodes through independent links. The receiving nodes are divided into two groups: one priority group consists of $k$ nodes that require the reception of every update packet, the other non-priority group consists of all other nodes without the delivery requirement. Using age of information as a freshness metric, we analyze the time-averaged age at both priority and non-priority nodes. For shifted-exponential link delay distributions, the average age at a priority node is lower than that at a non-priority node due to the delivery guarantee. However, this advantage for priority nodes disappears if the link delay is exponential distributed. Both groups of nodes have the same time-averaged age, which implies that the guaranteed delivery of updates has no effect the time-averaged freshness.
