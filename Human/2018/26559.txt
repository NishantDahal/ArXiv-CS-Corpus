Formal Proofs of Tarjan's Algorithm in Why3, Coq, and Isabelle

Comparing provers on a formalization of the same problem is always a valuable exercise. In this paper, we present the formal proof of correctness of a non-trivial algorithm from graph theory that was carried out in three proof assistants: Why3, Coq, and Isabelle.
