Microcontroller Based Robotic Arm Development for Library Management System

With the advancement of robotics, automation in various industries and processes has become widespread. This project aims to introduce library automation system, which addresses the fulfillment of the objectives of automatic retrieval of queued books, arrangement of returned books on the racks as well as automated updating of the library database. The proposed system is based on the Arduino microcontroller and python programming Microcontroller based robotic arms are used to fetch books from or return books to the different shelves in the library. The library database is also updated after completion of an action. The uniqueness of the proposed system lies in the fact that it can be applied to any existing library and is capable of handling individual books rather than a bulk. The system aims to bring new dimensions to the concept of library automation.
