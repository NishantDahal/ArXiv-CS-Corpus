On strong alt-induced codes

Strong alt-induced codes, a particular case of alt-induced codes, has been introduced and considered by D. L. Van and the author in earlier papers. In this note, an algorithm to check whether a regular code is strong alt-induced or not is proposed, and the embedding problem for the classes of prefix (suffix, bifix) strong alt-induced codes in both the finite and regular case is also exhibited.
