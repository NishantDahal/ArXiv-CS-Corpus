FQAM-FBMC Design and Its Application to Machine Type Communication

In this paper, we propose a novel waveform design which efficiently combines two air interface components: Frequency and Quadrature-Amplitude Modulation (FQAM) and Filter Bank Multicarrier (FBMC). The proposed approach takes the unique characteristics of FQAM into consideration and exploits the design of prototype filters for FBMC to effectively avoid self-interference between adjacent subcarriers in the complex domain, thus providing improved performance compared with conventional solutions in terms of self-interference, spectrum confinement and complexity with negligible rate loss.
