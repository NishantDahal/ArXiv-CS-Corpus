FBI-Pose: Towards Bridging the Gap between 2D Images and 3D Human Poses using Forward-or-Backward Information

Although significant advances have been made in the area of human poses estimation from images using deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet), it remains a big challenge to perform 3D pose inference in-the-wild. This is due to the difficulty to obtain 3D pose groundtruth for outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle this problem by exploiting the information of each bone indicating if it is forward or backward with respect to the view of the camera(we term it Forwardor-Backward Information abbreviated as FBI). Our method firstly trains a ConvNet with two branches which maps an image of a human to both the 2D joint locations and the FBI of bones. These information is further fed into a deep regression network to predict the 3D positions of joints. To support the training, we also develop an annotation user interface and labeled such FBI for around 12K in-the-wild images which are randomly selected from MPII (a public dataset of 2D pose annotation). Our experimental results on the standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
