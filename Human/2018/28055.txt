AutOTranS: an Autonomous Open World Transportation System

Tasks in outdoor open world environments are now ripe for automation with mobile manipulators. The dynamic, unstructured and unknown environments associated with such tasks -- a prime example would be collecting roadside trash -- makes them particularly challenging. In this paper we present an approach to solving the problem of picking up, transporting, and dropping off novel objects outdoors. Our solution integrates a navigation system, a grasp detection and planning system, and a custom task planner. We perform experiments that demonstrate that the system can be used to transport a wide class of novel objects (trash bags, general garbage, gardening tools and fruits) in unstructured settings outdoors with a relatively high end-to-end success rate of 85%.
