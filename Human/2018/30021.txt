GRSUS: Gerenciamento De Recursos De Saúde, Um Estudo Sob A Ótica Da Portaria GM/MS 1631/2015 No Estado do Pará

Investments in public health had an increase of about R$ 20 bi in recent years. Even with the dynamism of the Unique Health System (SUS), only after 13 years the criteria and parameters for the planning and programming of health services have been updated. The calculations for health resources division are complex due to the nature of the SUS administrative organization, which has three administrative levels. Despite providing the criteria and parameters for the calculations, it was not provided any information system that would automate this process and provide reliable information for decision making. In order to fill such gap, this paper presents a system for health resource management from the perspective of GM/MS 1631/2015 ordinance. The tool has been validated using as case studies two municipalities in the interior of the state of Pará. The results were promising, with latent market potential, being possible to simulate various scenarios for a medium and long-term predictions.
