An Algorithm for Reducing Approximate Nearest Neighbor to Approximate Near Neighbor with O(logn) Query Time

This paper proposes a new algorithm for reducing Approximate Nearest Neighbor problem to Approximate Near Neighbor problem. The advantage of this algorithm is that it achieves O(log n) query time. As a reduction problem, the uery time complexity is the times of invoking the algorithm for Approximate Near Neighbor problem. All former algorithms for the same reduction need polylog(n) query time. A box split method proposed by Vaidya is used in our paper to achieve the O(log n) query time complexity.
