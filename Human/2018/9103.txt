What's (Not) Validating Network Paths: A Survey

Validating network paths taken by packets is critical for a secure Internet architecture. Any feasible solution must both enforce packet forwarding along endhost-specified paths and verify whether packets have taken those paths. However, neither enforcement nor verification is supported by the current Internet. Due likely to a long-standing confusion between routing and forwarding, only limited solutions for path validation exist in the literature. This survey article aims to reinvigorate research in to the significant and essential topic of path validation. It crystallizes not only how path validation works but also where seemingly qualified solutions fall short. The analyses explore future research directions in path validation toward improving security, privacy, and efficiency.
