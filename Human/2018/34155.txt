Evaluation of an open-source implementation of the SRP-PHAT algorithm within the 2018 LOCATA challenge

This short paper presents an efficient, flexible implementation of the SRP-PHAT multichannel sound source localization method. The method is evaluated on the single-source tasks of the LOCATA 2018 development dataset, and an associated Matlab toolbox is made available online.
