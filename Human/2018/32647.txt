A Two-stage Approach to Estimate CFO and Channel with One-bit ADCs

In this letter, we propose a two-stage approach to estimate the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and channel with one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Firstly, a simple metric which is only a function of the CFO is proposed, and the CFO is estimated via solving the one-dimensional optimization problem. Secondly, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm combined with expectation maximization (EM) method is utilized to estimate the channel. In order to provide a benchmark of our proposed algorithm in terms of the CFO estimation, the corresponding Cram√©r-Rao bound (CRB) is derived. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach when applied to the general Gaussian channel and mmWave channel.
