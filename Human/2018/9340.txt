A Guide of Fingerprint Based Radio Emitter Localization using Multiple Sensors

Location information is essential to varieties of applications. It is one of the most important context to be detected by wireless distributed sensors, which is a key technology in Internet-of-Things. Fingerprint-based methods, which compare location unique fingerprints collected beforehand with the fingerprint measured from the target, have attracted much attention recently in both of academia and industry. They have been successfully used for many location-based applications.From the viewpoint of practical applications, in this paper, four different typical approaches of fingerprint-based radio emitter localization system are introduced with four different representative applications: localization of LTE smart phone used for anti-cheating in exams, indoor localization of Wi-Fi terminals, localized light control in BEMS using location information of occupants, and illegal radio localization in outdoor environments. Based on the different practical application scenarios, different solutions, which are designed to enhance the localization performance, are discussed in detail. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to give a guideline for readers about fingerprint-based localization system in terms of fingerprint selection, hardware architecture design and algorithm enhancement
