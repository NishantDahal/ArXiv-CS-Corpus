Not quite unreasonable effectiveness of machine learning algorithms

State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms demonstrate close to absolute performance in selected challenges. We provide arguments that the reason can be in low variability of the samples and high effectiveness in learning typical patterns. Due to this fact, standard performance metrics do not reveal model capacity and new metrics are required for the better understanding of state-of-the-art.
