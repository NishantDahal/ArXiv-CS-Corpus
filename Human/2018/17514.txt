Practical Implementation of Link Adaptation with Dual Polarized Modulation

The use of dual polarization in mobile satellite systems is very promising for increasing the channel capacity. Polarized Modulation is proposed in this paper for use in practical systems, by providing simple equations for computing its capacity and featuring a link adaptation algorithm. This scheme shows remarkable gains in the spectral efficiency when compared with single polarization and other multi-antenna techniques such as V-BLAST. Polarized Modulation is a particular instance of more general Index Modulations, which are being considered for 5G networks. Thus, the proposed link adaptation algorithm could find synergies with current activities for future terrestrial networks.
