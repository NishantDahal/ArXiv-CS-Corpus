Secure Generators of q-valued Pseudo-Random Sequences on Arithmetic Polynomials

A technique for controlling errors in the functioning of nodes for the formation of $q$-valued pseudo-random sequences (PRS) operating under both random errors and errors generated through intentional attack by an attacker is provided, in which systems of characteristic equations are realized by arithmetic polynomials that allow the calculation process to be parallelized and, in turn, allow the use of redundant modular codes device.
