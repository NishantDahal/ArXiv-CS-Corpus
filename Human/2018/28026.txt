Trace Quotient with Sparsity Priors for Learning Low Dimensional Image Representations

This work studies the problem of learning appropriate low dimensional image representations. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, which leverages two classic representation learning paradigms, i.e., sparse representation and the trace quotient criterion. The former is a well-known powerful tool to identify underlying self-explanatory factors of data, while the latter is known for disentangling underlying low dimensional discriminative factors in data. Our developed solutions disentangle sparse representations of images by employing the trace quotient criterion. We construct a unified cost function, coined as the SPARse LOW dimensional representation (SparLow) function, for jointly learning both a sparsifying dictionary and a dimensionality reduction transformation. The SparLow function is widely applicable for developing various algorithms in three classic machine learning scenarios, namely, unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning. In order to develop efficient joint learning algorithms for maximizing the SparLow function, we deploy a framework of sparse coding with appropriate convex priors to ensure the sparse representations to be locally differentiable. Moreover, we develop an efficient geometric conjugate gradient algorithm to maximize the SparLow function on its underlying Riemannian manifold. Performance of the proposed SparLow algorithmic framework is investigated on several image processing tasks, such as 3D data visualization, face/digit recognition, and object/scene categorization.
