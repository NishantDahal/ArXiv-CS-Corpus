Experimental Verification of Rate Flexibility and Probabilistic Shaping by 4D Signaling

The rate flexibility and probabilistic shaping gain of $4$-dimensional signaling is experimentally tested for short-reach, unrepeated transmission. A rate granularity of 0.5 bits/QAM symbol is achieved with a distribution matcher based on a simple look-up table.
