Inverse Problems in Asteroseismology

Asteroseismology allows us to probe the internal structure of stars through their global modes of oscillation. Thanks to missions such as the NASA Kepler space observatory, we now have high-quality asteroseismic data for nearly 100 solar-type stars. In this thesis, new techniques to measure the ages, masses, and radii of stars are presented, as well as a way to infer their internal structure.
