Data Security and Privacy Protection Data Security and Privacy Protection in Public Cloud

This paper discusses about the challenges, advantages and shortcomings of existing solutions in data security and privacy in public cloud computing. As in cloud computing, oceans of data will be stored. Data stored in public cloud would face both outside attacks and inside attacks since public cloud provider themselves are untrusted. Conventional encryption could be used for storage, however most data in cloud needs further computation. Decryption before computation will cause large overheads for data operation and lots of inconvenience. Thus, efficient methods to protect data security as well as privacy for large amount of data in cloud are necessary.
  In the paper, different mechanisms to protect data security and privacy in public cloud are discussed. A data security and privacy enabled multi-cloud architecture is proposed.
