Primal path algorithm for compositional data analysis

Compositional data have two unique characteristics compared to typical multivariate data: the observed values are nonnegative and their summand is exactly one. To reflect these characteristics, a specific regularized regression model with linear constraints is commonly used. However, linear constraints incur additional computational time, which becomes severe in high-dimensional cases. As such, we propose an efficient solution path algorithm for a $l_1$ regularized regression with compositional data. The algorithm is then extended to a classification model with compositional predictors. We also compare its computational speed with that of previously developed algorithms and apply the proposed algorithm to analyze human gut microbiome data.
