Algebraic Expression of Subjective Spatial and Temporal Patterns

Universal learning machine is a theory trying to study machine learning from mathematical point of view. The outside world is reflected inside an universal learning machine according to pattern of incoming data. This is subjective pattern of learning machine. In [2,4], we discussed subjective spatial pattern, and established a powerful tool -- X-form, which is an algebraic expression for subjective spatial pattern. However, as the initial stage of study, there we only discussed spatial pattern. Here, we will discuss spatial and temporal patterns, and algebraic expression for them.
