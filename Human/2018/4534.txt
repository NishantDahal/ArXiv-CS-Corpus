Characterizing Asymptotic Randomization in Abelian Cellular Automata

Abelian cellular automata (CA) are CA which are group endomorphisms of the full group shift when endowing the alphabet with an abelian group structure. A CA randomizes an initial probability measure if its iterated images weak *-converge towards the uniform Bernoulli measure (the Haar measure in this setting). We are interested in structural phenomena, i.e. randomization for a wide class of initial measures (under some mixing hypotheses). First, we prove that an abelian CA randomizes in Ces{Ã }ro mean if and only if it has no soliton, i.e. a finite configuration whose time evolution remains bounded in space. This characterization generalizes previously known sufficient conditions for abelian CA with scalar or commuting coefficients. Second, we exhibit examples of strong randomizers, i.e. abelian CA randomizing in simple convergence; this is the first proof of this behaviour to our knowledge. We show however that no CA with commuting coefficients can be strongly randomizing. Finally, we show that some abelian CA achieve partial randomization without being randomizing: the distribution of short finite words tends to the uniform distribution up to some threshold, but this convergence fails for larger words. Again this phenomenon cannot happen for abelian CA with commuting coefficients.
