Deep Embedding Kernel

In this paper, we propose a novel supervised learning method that is called Deep Embedding Kernel (DEK). DEK combines the advantages of deep learning and kernel methods in a unified framework. More specifically, DEK is a learnable kernel represented by a newly designed deep architecture. Compared with pre-defined kernels, this kernel can be explicitly trained to map data to an optimized high-level feature space where data may have favorable features toward the application. Compared with typical deep learning using SoftMax or logistic regression as the top layer, DEK is expected to be more generalizable to new data. Experimental results show that DEK has superior performance than typical machine learning methods in identity detection, classification, regression, dimension reduction, and transfer learning.
