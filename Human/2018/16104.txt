An Efficient Secure Distributed Cloud Storage for Append-only Data

Cloud computing enables users (clients) to outsource large volume of their data to cloud servers. Secure distributed cloud storage schemes ensure that multiple servers store these data in a reliable and untampered fashion. We propose an idea to construct such a scheme for static data by encoding data blocks (using error-correcting codes) and then attaching authentication information (tags) to these encoded blocks. We identify some challenges while extending this idea to accommodate append-only data. Then, we propose our secure distributed cloud storage scheme for append-only data that addresses the challenges efficiently. The main advantage of our scheme is that it enables the servers to update the parity blocks themselves. Moreover, the client need not download any data (or parity) block to update the tags of the modified parity blocks residing on the servers. Finally, we analyze the security and performance of our scheme.
