Impulsive Control for G-AIMD Dynamics with Relaxed and Hard Constraints

Motivated by various applications from Internet congestion control to power control in smart grids and electric vehicle charging, we study Generalized Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (G-AIMD) dynamics under impulsive control in continuous time with the time average alpha-fairness criterion. We first show that the control under relaxed constraints can be described by a threshold. Then, we propose a Whittle-type index heuristic for the hard constraint problem. We prove that in the homogeneous case the index policy is asymptotically optimal when the number of users is large.
