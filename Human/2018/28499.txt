Natural measures of alignment

Natural coordinate system will be proposed. In this coordinate system alignment procedure of a device and a detector can be easily performed. This approach is generalization of previous specific formulas in the field of calibration and provide top level description of the procedure. A basic example application to linac therapy plan is also provided.
