Multimodal Co-Training for Selecting Good Examples from Webly Labeled Video

We tackle the problem of learning concept classifiers from videos on the web without using manually labeled data. Although metadata attached to videos (e.g., video titles, descriptions) can be of help collecting training data for the target concept, the collected data is often very noisy. The main challenge is therefore how to select good examples from noisy training data. Previous approaches firstly learn easy examples that are unlikely to be noise and then gradually learn more complex examples. However, hard examples that are much different from easy ones are never learned. In this paper, we propose an approach called multimodal co-training (MMCo) for selecting good examples from noisy training data. MMCo jointly learns classifiers for multiple modalities that complement each other to select good examples. Since MMCo selects examples by consensus of multimodal classifiers, a hard example for one modality can still be used as a training example by exploiting the power of the other modalities. The algorithm is very simple and easily implemented but yields consistent and significant boosts in example selection and classification performance on the FCVID and YouTube8M benchmarks.
