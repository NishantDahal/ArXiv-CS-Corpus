fMRI: preprocessing, classification and pattern recognition

As machine learning continues to gain momentum in the neuroscience community, we witness the emergence of novel applications such as diagnostics, characterization, and treatment outcome prediction for psychiatric and neurological disorders, for instance, epilepsy and depression. Systematic research into these mental disorders increasingly involves drawing clinical conclusions on the basis of data-driven approaches; to this end, structural and functional neuroimaging serve as key source modalities. Identification of informative neuroimaging markers requires establishing a comprehensive preparation pipeline for data which may be severely corrupted by artifactual signal fluctuations. In this work, we review a large body of literature to provide ample evidence for the advantages of pattern recognition approaches in clinical applications, overview advanced graph-based pattern recognition approaches, and propose a noise-aware neuroimaging data processing pipeline. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide results from a pilot study, which show a significant improvement in classification accuracy, indicating a promising research direction.
