Semantic Single-Image Dehazing

Single-image haze-removal is challenging due to limited information contained in one single image. Previous solutions largely rely on handcrafted priors to compensate for this deficiency. Recent convolutional neural network (CNN) models have been used to learn haze-related priors but they ultimately work as advanced image filters. In this paper we propose a novel semantic ap- proach towards single image haze removal. Unlike existing methods, we infer color priors based on extracted semantic features. We argue that semantic context can be exploited to give informative cues for (a) learning color prior on clean image and (b) estimating ambient illumination. This design allowed our model to recover clean images from challenging cases with strong ambiguity, e.g. saturated illumination color and sky regions in image. In experiments, we validate our ap- proach upon synthetic and real hazy images, where our method showed superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting semantic information facilitates the haze removal task.
