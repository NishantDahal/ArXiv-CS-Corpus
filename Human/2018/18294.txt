Analysis of social media content and search behavior related to seasonal topics using the sociophysics approach

We studied the time interval between posting social media content and search action related to seasonal topics. The analysis was performed using a mathematical model of the search behavior as in the theory of sociophysics. As seasonal topics, the word cherry blossom was considered for spring, bikini for summer, autumn leaves for fall, and skiing for winter. We examined the influence of blogs and Twitter posts given the search behavior and found a time deviation of interest on these topics.
