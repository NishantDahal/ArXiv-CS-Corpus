Dynamic monopolies for interval graphs with bounded thresholds

For a graph $G$ and an integer-valued threshold function $τ$ on its vertex set, a dynamic monopoly is a set of vertices of $G$ such that iteratively adding to it vertices $u$ of $G$ that have at least $τ(u)$ neighbors in it eventually yields the vertex set of $G$. We show that the problem of finding a dynamic monopoly of minimum order can be solved in polynomial time for interval graphs with bounded threshold functions, but is NP-hard for chordal graphs allowing unbounded threshold functions.
