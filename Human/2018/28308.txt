Designing Anti-Jamming Receivers for NR-DCSK Systems Utilizing ICA, WPD, and VMD Methods

In this work, we consider an advanced noise reduction differential chaotic shift keying (NR-DCSK) system in which a single antenna source communicates with a single antenna destination under the attack of a single antenna jammer. We devote our efforts to design a novel anti-jamming (AJ) receiver for the considered system. Particularly, we propose a variational mode decomposition-independent component analysis-wavelet packet decomposition-based (VMD-ICA-WPD-based) structure, in which the VMD method is firstly exploited to generate multiple signals from the single received one. Secondly, the ICA method is applied to coarsely separate chaotic and jamming signals. After that, the WPD method is used to finely estimate and mitigate jamming signals that exist on all outputs of the ICA method. Finally, an inverse ICA procedure is carried out, followed by a summation, and the outcome is passed through the conventional correlation-based receiver for recovering the transmitted information. Simulation results show that the proposed receiver provides significant system performance enhancement compared to that given by the conventional correlation-based receiver with WPD, i.e. 8 dB gain at BER =0.03 and Eb/N0 = 20 dB.
