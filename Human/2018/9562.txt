Learning-Based Task Offloading for Vehicular Cloud Computing Systems

Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is proposed to effectively utilize and share the computing and storage resources on vehicles. However, due to the mobility of vehicles, the network topology, the wireless channel states and the available computing resources vary rapidly and are difficult to predict. In this work, we develop a learning-based task offloading framework using the multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory, which enables vehicles to learn the potential task offloading performance of its neighboring vehicles with excessive computing resources, namely service vehicles (SeVs), and minimizes the average offloading delay. We propose an adaptive volatile upper confidence bound (AVUCB) algorithm and augment it with load-awareness and occurrence-awareness, by redesigning the utility function of the classic MAB algorithms. The proposed AVUCB algorithm can effectively adapt to the dynamic vehicular environment, balance the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in the learning process, and converge fast to the optimal SeV with theoretical performance guarantee. Simulations under both synthetic scenario and a realistic highway scenario are carried out, showing that the proposed algorithm achieves close-to-optimal delay performance.
