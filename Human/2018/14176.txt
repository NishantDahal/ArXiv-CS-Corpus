Scientometric analysis of Condensed Matter Physics journal

The paper is dedicated to 25th anniversary of Condensed Matter Physics journal (CMP). It contains the results of comprehensive analysis of different journal-related data. CMP co-authorship relationships are studied analysing the collaboration network. Its cumulative statical and dynamical properties as well as the structure are discussed. The international contribution to the journal is assessed using the authors' affiliation data. The network of the countries collaborating within CMP is considered. Another kind of network is used to investigate the topical spectrum: two PACS indices assigned to one paper are connected by link here. The structure of the most significant interdisciplinary connections is analysed. Finally, the download statistics and the corresponding records of the papers' citations are used to discuss the journal's impact.
