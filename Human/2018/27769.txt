Which Generation Shows the Most Prudent Data Sharing Behaviour?

We report from a study performed in ten European countries, where we asked about attitudes and behaviour towards data sharing behaviour. We looked into the differences between members of age groups. We find that there are more similarities than differences between the age groups, with the exception of young people more often tending to use fake information for privacy reasons. When analysing whether users change privacy settings as an indicator of awareness, we find that both the younger and the older users have lower awareness than the members of the middle-aged. The use of learning and practising tools seems the right way to increase the privacy and data sharing awareness of citizen.
