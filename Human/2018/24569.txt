Does network quality matter? A field study of mobile user satisfaction

Mobile quality of experience and user satisfaction are growing research topics. However, the relationship between a user's satisfaction with network quality and the networks real performance in the field remains unexplored. This paper is the first to study both network and non-network predictors of user satisfaction in the wild. We report findings from a large sample (2224 users over 12 months) combining both questionnaires and network measurements. We found that minimum download goodput and device type predict satisfaction with network availability. Whereas for network speed, only download factors predicted satisfaction. We observe that users integrate over many measurements and exhibit a known peak-end effect in their ratings. These results can inform modeling efforts in quality of experience and user satisfaction.
