NumtaDB - Assembled Bengali Handwritten Digits

To benchmark Bengali digit recognition algorithms, a large publicly available dataset is required which is free from biases originating from geographical location, gender, and age. With this aim in mind, NumtaDB, a dataset consisting of more than 85,000 images of hand-written Bengali digits, has been assembled. This paper documents the collection and curation process of numerals along with the salient statistics of the dataset.
