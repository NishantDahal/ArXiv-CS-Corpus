An Algorithmic Framework to Control Bias in Bandit-based Personalization

Personalization is pervasive in the online space as it leads to higher efficiency and revenue by allowing the most relevant content to be served to each user. However, recent studies suggest that personalization methods can propagate societal or systemic biases and polarize opinions; this has led to calls for regulatory mechanisms and algorithms to combat bias and inequality. Algorithmically, bandit optimization has enjoyed great success in learning user preferences and personalizing content or feeds accordingly. We propose an algorithmic framework that allows for the possibility to control bias or discrimination in such bandit-based personalization. Our model allows for the specification of general fairness constraints on the sensitive types of the content that can be displayed to a user. The challenge, however, is to come up with a scalable and low regret algorithm for the constrained optimization problem that arises. Our main technical contribution is a provably fast and low-regret algorithm for the fairness-constrained bandit optimization problem. Our proofs crucially leverage the special structure of our problem. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets show that our algorithmic framework can control bias with only a minor loss to revenue.
