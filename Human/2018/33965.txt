A Fast Combination of AES Encryption and LZ4 Compression Algorithms

From a long time ago, beside encryption of data and making it secure, compression packing it was also important that could make transmission of data faster. In the past years need for improvement of encryption and compression for a fast and easy transmission is more necessary. In this paper, a new method for combination of LZ4 combination and AES encryption algorithms for a fast and easy packing, securing and compressing of data is presented. Choose of these two algorithms was for some special features of them about aim of this paper. This paper also is introducing a method for Parallelism of compression and encryption in a special way for improvement of speed and security of data.
