Learned Primal-dual Reconstruction

We propose the Learned Primal-Dual algorithm for tomographic reconstruction. The algorithm accounts for a (possibly non-linear) forward operator in a deep neural network by unrolling a proximal primal-dual optimization method, but where the proximal operators have been replaced with convolutional neural networks. The algorithm is trained end-to-end, working directly from raw measured data and it does not depend on any initial reconstruction such as FBP.
  We compare performance of the proposed method on low dose CT reconstruction against FBP, TV, and deep learning based post-processing of FBP. For the Shepp-Logan phantom we obtain >6dB PSNR improvement against all compared methods. For human phantoms the corresponding improvement is 6.6dB over TV and 2.2dB over learned post-processing along with a substantial improvement in the SSIM. Finally, our algorithm involves only ten forward-back-projection computations, making the method feasible for time critical clinical applications.
