Network Centrality Analysis of Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway System

Nowadays, Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway System (TUSRS) is going to be completed by eight lines and 149 stations. This complex transportation system contains 168 links between each station pairs and 20 cross-section and Y-branch stations among all eight lines. In this study, we considered TUSRS as a complex network and undertook several analyzes based on graph theory. Examining e.g. centrality measures, we identified central stations within TUSRS. This analysis could be useful for redistributing strategy of the overcrowded stations and improving the organization of maintaining system. These findings are also promising for better designing the systems of tomorrow in other metropolitan areas in Iran.
