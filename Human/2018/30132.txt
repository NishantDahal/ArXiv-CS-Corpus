The dry history of liquid computers

A liquid can be used to represent signals, actuate mechanical computing devices and to modify signals via chemical reactions. We give a brief overview of liquid based computing devices developed over hundreds of years. These include hydraulic calculators, fluidic computers, micro-fluidic devices, droplets, liquid marbles and reaction-diffusion chemical computers.
