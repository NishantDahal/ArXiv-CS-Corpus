Generative Adversarial Forests for Better Conditioned Adversarial Learning

In recent times, many of the breakthroughs in various vision-related tasks have revolved around improving learning of deep models; these methods have ranged from network architectural improvements such as Residual Networks, to various forms of regularisation such as Batch Normalisation. In essence, many of these techniques revolve around better conditioning, allowing for deeper and deeper models to be successfully learned. In this paper, we look towards better conditioning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in an unsupervised learning setting. Our method embeds the powerful discriminating capabilities of a decision forest into the discriminator of a GAN. This results in a better conditioned model which learns in an extremely stable way. We demonstrate empirical results which show both clear qualitative and quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of our approach, gaining significant performance improvements over several popular GAN-based approaches on the Oxford Flowers and Aligned Celebrity Faces datasets.
