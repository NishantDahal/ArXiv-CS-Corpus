Formal Verification of a Programmable Hypersurface

A metasurface is a surface that consists of artificial material, called metamaterial, with configurable electromagnetic properties. This paper presents work in progress on the design and formal verification of a programmable metasurface, the Hypersurface, as part of the requirements of the VISORSURF research program (HORIZON 2020 FET-OPEN). The Hypersurface design is concerned with the development of a network of switch controllers that are responsible for configuring the metamaterial. The design of the Hypersurface, however, has demanding requirements that need to be delivered within a context of limited resources. This paper shares the experience of a rigorous design procedure for the Hypersurface network, that involves iterations between designing a network and its protocols and the formal evaluation of each design. Formal evaluation has provided results that, so far, drive the development team in a more robust design and overall aid in reducing the cost of the Hypersurface manufacturing. This paper presents work in progress on the design and formal verification of a programmable Hypersurface as part of the requirements of the VISORSURF research programme (HORIZON 2020 FET-OPEN).
