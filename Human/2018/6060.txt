Living with technology

Our use of IT has, broadly speaking, until recently evolved around work-oriented tasks. This is or, indeed, has been changing. IT has moved beyond the workplace and into leisure, entertainment, games and our homes. It has in short moved into our everyday life. My retired father and oldest daughter use it. Use is no longer delineated but seeps into and get intervowen with a number of my activities: while paying for my groceries, planning this summer vacation and so forth.
