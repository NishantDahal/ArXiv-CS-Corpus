Cluster-Based Learning from Weakly Labeled Bags in Digital Pathology

To alleviate the burden of gathering detailed expert annotations when training deep neural networks, we propose a weakly supervised learning approach to recognize metastases in microscopic images of breast lymph nodes. We describe an alternative training loss which clusters weakly labeled bags in latent space to inform relevance of patch-instances during training of a convolutional neural network. We evaluate our method on the Camelyon dataset which contains high-resolution digital slides of breast lymph nodes, where labels are provided at the image-level and only subsets of patches are made available during training.
