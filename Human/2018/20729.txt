NavigationNet: A Large-scale Interactive Indoor Navigation Dataset

Indoor navigation aims at performing navigation within buildings. In scenes like home and factory, most intelligent mobile devices require an functionality of routing to guide itself precisely through indoor scenes to complete various tasks in order to serve human. In most scenarios, we expected an intelligent device capable of navigating itself in unseen environment. Although several solutions have been proposed to deal with this issue, they usually require pre-installed beacons or a map pre-built with SLAM, which means that they are not capable of working in novel environments. To address this, we proposed NavigationNet, a computer vision dataset and benchmark to allow the utilization of deep reinforcement learning on scene-understanding-based indoor navigation. We also proposed and formalized several typical indoor routing problems that are suitable for deep reinforcement learning.
