The Arbitrarily Varying Relay Channel

We study the arbitrarily varying relay channel, and establish the cutset bound and partial decode-forward bound on the random code capacity. We further determine the random code capacity for special cases. Then, we consider conditions under which the deterministic code capacity is determined as well.
