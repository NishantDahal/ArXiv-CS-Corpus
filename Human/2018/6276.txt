Semantical Equivalence of the Control Flow Graph and the Program Dependence Graph

The program dependence graph (PDG) represents data and control dependence between statements in a program. This paper presents an operational semantics of program dependence graphs. Since PDGs exclude artificial order of statements that resides in sequential programs, executions of PDGs are not unique. However, we identified a class of PDGs that have unique final states of executions, called deterministic PDGs. We prove that the operational semantics of control flow graphs is equivalent to that of deterministic PDGs. The class of deterministic PDGs properly include PDGs obtained from well-structured programs. Thus, our operational semantics of PDGs is more general than that of PDGs for well-structured programs, which are already established in literature.
