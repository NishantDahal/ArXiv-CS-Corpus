Eigenlogic in the spirit of George Boole

This work presents an operational and geometric approach to logic. It starts from the multilinear elective decomposition of binary logical functions in the original form introduced by George Boole. A justification on historical grounds is presented bridging Boole's theory and the use of his arithmetical logical functions with the axioms of Boolean algebra using sets and quantum logic. It is shown that this algebraic polynomial formulation can be naturally extended to operators in finite vector spaces. Logical operators will appear as commuting projection operators and the truth values, which take the binary values {0,1}, are the respective eigenvalues. In this view the solution of a logical proposition resulting from the operation on a combination of arguments will appear as a selection where the outcome can only be one of the eigenvalues. In this way propositional logic can be formalized in linear algebra by using elective developments which correspond here to combinations of tensored elementary projection operators. The original and principal motivation of this work is for applications in the new field of quantum information, differences are outlined with more traditional quantum logic approaches.
