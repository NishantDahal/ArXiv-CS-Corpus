On the computational complexity of MSTD sets

We outline a general algorithm for verifying whether a subset of the integers is a more sum than differences (MSTD) set, also known as sum dominated sets, and give estimates on its computational complexity. We conclude with some numerical results on large MSTD sets and MSTD subsets of $[1,N]\cap \mathbb Z$ for $N$ up to 160.
