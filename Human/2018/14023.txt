Detecting, Understanding and Supporting Everyday Learning in Web Search

Web search is among the most ubiquitous online activities, commonly used to acquire new knowledge and to satisfy learning-related objectives through informational search sessions. The importance of learning as an outcome of web search has been recognized widely, leading to a variety of research at the intersection of information retrieval, human computer interaction and learning-oriented sciences. Given the lack of explicit information, understanding of users and their learning needs has to be derived from their search behavior and resource interactions. In this paper, we introduce the involved research challenges and survey related work on the detection of learning needs, understanding of users, e.g. with respect to their knowledge state, learning tasks and learning progress throughout a search session as well as the actual consideration of learning needs throughout the retrieval and ranking process. In addition, we summarise our own research contributing to the aforementioned tasks and describe our research agenda in this context.
