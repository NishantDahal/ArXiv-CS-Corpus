Standard Cell Library Design and Optimization Methodology for ASAP7 PDK

Standard cell libraries are the foundation for the entire backend design and optimization flow in modern application-specific integrated circuit designs. At 7nm technology node and beyond, standard cell library design and optimization is becoming increasingly difficult due to extremely complex design constraints, as described in the ASAP7 process design kit (PDK). Notable complexities include discrete transistor sizing due to FinFETs, complicated design rules from lithography and restrictive layout space from modern standard cell architectures. The design methodology presented in this paper enables efficient and high-quality standard cell library design and optimization with the ASAP7 PDK. The key techniques include exhaustive transistor sizing for cell timing optimization, transistor placement with generalized Euler paths and back-end design prototyping for library-level explorations.
