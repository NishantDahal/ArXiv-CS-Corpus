Challenges in Network Management of Encrypted Traffic

This paper summarizes the challenges identified at the MAMI Management and Measurement Summit (M3S) for network management with the increased deployment of encrypted traffic based on a set of use cases and deployed techniques (for network monitoring, performance enhancing proxies, firewalling as well as network-supported DDoS protection and migration), and provides recommendations for future use cases and the development of new protocols and mechanisms. In summary, network architecture and protocol design efforts should 1) provide for independent measurability when observations may be contested, 2) support different security associations at different layers, and 3) replace transparent middleboxes with middlebox transparency in order to increase visibility, rebalance control and enable cooperation.
