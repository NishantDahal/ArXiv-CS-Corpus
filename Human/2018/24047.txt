Deep Textured 3D Reconstruction of Human Bodies

Recovering textured 3D models of non-rigid human body shapes is challenging due to self-occlusions caused by complex body poses and shapes, clothing obstructions, lack of surface texture, background clutter, sparse set of cameras with non-overlapping fields of view, etc. Further, a calibration-free environment adds additional complexity to both - reconstruction and texture recovery. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based solution for textured 3D reconstruction of human body shapes from a single view RGB image. This is achieved by first recovering the volumetric grid of the non-rigid human body given a single view RGB image followed by orthographic texture view synthesis using the respective depth projection of the reconstructed (volumetric) shape and input RGB image. We propose to co-learn the depth information readily available with affordable RGBD sensors (e.g., Kinect) while showing multiple views of the same object during the training phase. We show superior reconstruction performance in terms of quantitative and qualitative results, on both, publicly available datasets (by simulating the depth channel with virtual Kinect) as well as real RGBD data collected with our calibrated multi Kinect setup.
