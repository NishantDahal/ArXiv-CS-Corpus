Honey Authentication with Machine Learning Augmented Bright-Field Microscopy

Honey has been collected and used by humankind as both a food and medicine for thousands of years. However, in the modern economy, honey has become subject to mislabelling and adulteration making it the third most faked food product in the world. The international scale of fraudulent honey has had both economic and environmental ramifications. In this paper, we propose a novel method of identifying fraudulent honey using machine learning augmented microscopy.
