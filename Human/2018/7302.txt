Stability conditions for a discrete-time decentralised medium access algorithm

We consider a stochastic queueing system modelling the behaviour of a wireless network with nodes employing a discrete-time version of the standard decentralised medium access algorithm. The system is {\em unsaturated} -- each node receives an exogenous flow of packets at the rate $λ$ packets per time slot. Each packet takes one slot to transmit, but neighboring nodes cannot transmit simultaneously. The algorithm we study is {\em standard} in that: a node with empty queue does {\em not} compete for medium access; the access procedure by a node does {\em not} depend on its queue length, as long as it is non-zero. Two system topologies are considered, with nodes arranged in a circle and in a line. We prove that, for either topology, the system is stochastically stable under condition $λ< 2/5$. This result is intuitive for the circle topology as the throughput each node receives in a saturated system (with infinite queues) is equal to the so called {\em parking constant}, which is larger than $2/5$. (The latter fact, however, does not help to prove our result.) The result is not intuitive at all for the line topology as in a saturated system some nodes receive a throughput lower than $2/5$.
