Human Trajectories Characteristics

Communication devices (mobile networks, social media platforms) are produced digital traces for their users either voluntarily or not. This type of collective data can give powerful indications on their effect on urban systems design and development. For understanding the collective human behavior of urban city, the modeling techniques could be used. In this study the most important feature of human mobility is considered, which is the radius of gyration . This parameter is used to measure how (far /frequent) the individuals are shift inside specific observed region.
