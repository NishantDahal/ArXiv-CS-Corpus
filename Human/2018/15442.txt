Driving by the Elderly and their Awareness of their Driving Difficulties (Hebrew)

In the past twenty years the number of elderly drivers has increased for two reasons. one is the higher proportion of elderly in the population, and the other is the rise in the share of the elderly who drive. This paper examines the features of their driving and the level of their awareness of problems relating to it, by analysis preference survey that included interviews with 205 drivers aged between 70 and 80. The interviewees exhibited a level of optimism and self confidence in their driving that is out of line with the real situation. There is also a discrepancy between how their driving is viewed by others and their own assessment, and between their self assessment and their assessment of the driving of other elderly drivers, which they rate lower than their own. they attributed great importance to safety feature in cars, although they did not think that they themselves needed them, and most elderly drivers did not think there was any reason that they should stop driving, despite suggestions from family members and others that they should do so. A declared preference survey was undertaken to assess the degree of difficulty elderly drivers attribute to driving conditions. It was found that they are concerned mainly about weather condition, driving at night, and long journeys. Worry about night driving was most marked among women, the oldest drivers, and those who drove less frequently. In light of the findings, imposing greater responsibility on the health system should be considered. Consideration should also be given to issuing partial licenses to the elderly for daytime driving only, or restricted to certain weather conditions, dependent on their medical condition. Such flexibility will enable the elderly to maintain their life style and independence for a longer period on the one hand, and on the other, will minimize the risks to themselves and other.
