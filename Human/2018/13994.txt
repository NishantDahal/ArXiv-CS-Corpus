Gruut: A Fully-Decentralized P2P Public Ledger

Owing to Satoshi Nakamoto's brilliant idea, a P2P public ledger is shown to be implementable in anonymous network. Any Internet user can then join the anonymous network and contribute to the P2P public ledger by providing their computing power or proof-of-work. The proof-of-work is a clever implementation of one-CPU-one-vote by anonymous participants, and it protects the Bitcoin ledger from illegal modification. To compensate the nodes for their work, a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin is issued and given to nodes. However, the very nature of anonymity of the ledger and the cryptocurrency prevent the technology from being used in fiat money economy. Cryptocurrencies are not traceable even if they are used for money laundering or tax evasion, and the value of cryptocurrencies is not stable but fluctuates wildly. In this white paper, we introduce Gruut, a P2P ledger to implement a universal financial platform for fiat money. For this purpose, we introduce a new consensus algorithm called `proof-of-population,' which is one instance of `proof of public collaboration.' It can be used for multiple purposes; as a P2P ledger for banks, as a powerful tool for payment, including micropayment, and as a tool for any type of financial transactions. Even better, it distributes the profit obtained from transaction fee, currently dominated by a third party, to peers that cannot be centralized. Energy requirements of Gruut are so low that it is possible to run our software on a smartphone or on a personal computer without a graphic card.
