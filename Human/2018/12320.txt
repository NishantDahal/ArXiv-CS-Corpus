Continuous-time integral dynamics for monotone aggregative games with coupling constraints

We consider continuous-time equilibrium seeking in monotone aggregative games with coupling constraints. We propose semi-decentralized integral dynamics and prove their global convergence to a variational generalized aggregative or Nash equilibrium. The proof is based on Lyapunov arguments and invariance techniques for differential inclusions.
