Quantum Money from Modular Forms

We present a new idea for a class of public key quantum money protocols where the bills are joint eigenstates of systems of commuting unitary operators. We show that this system is secure against black box attacks, and propose an implementation where our operators are obtained as Hecke operators on spaces of modular forms.
