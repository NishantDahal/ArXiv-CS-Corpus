Bipartite graph analysis as an alternative to reveal clusterization in complex systems

We demonstrate how analysis of co-clustering in bipartite networks may be used as a bridge to connect, compare and complement clustering results about community structure in two different spaces: single-mode bipartite network projections. As a case study we consider scientific knowledge, which is represented as a complex bipartite network of articles and related concepts. Connecting clusters of articles and clusters of concepts via article-to-concept bipartite co-clustering, we demonstrate how concept features (e.g. subject classes) may be inferred from the article ones.
