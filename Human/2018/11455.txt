DFCV: A Novel Approach for Message Dissemination in Connected Vehicles using Dynamic Fog

Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing road safety. Routing of messages in VANET is challenging due to packet delays arising from high mobility of vehicles, frequently changing topology, and high density of vehicles, leading to frequent route breakages and packet losses. Previous researchers have used either mobility in vehicular fog computing or cloud computing to solve the routing issue, but they suffer from large packet delays and frequent packet losses. We propose Dynamic Fog for Connected Vehicles (DFCV), a fog computing based scheme which dynamically creates, increments and destroys fog nodes depending on the communication needs. The novelty of DFCV lies in providing lower delays and guaranteed message delivery at high vehicular densities. Simulations were conducted using hybrid simulation consisting of ns-2, SUMO, and Cloudsim. Results show that DFCV ensures efficient resource utilization, lower packet delays and losses at high vehicle densities.
