Recent Progress on Graph Partitioning Problems Using Evolutionary Computation

The graph partitioning problem (GPP) is a representative combinatorial optimization problem which is NP-hard. Currently, various approaches to solve GPP have been introduced. Among these, the GPP solution using evolutionary computation (EC) is an effective approach. There has not been any survey on the research applying EC to GPP since 2011. In this survey, we introduce various attempts to apply EC to GPP made in the recent seven years.
