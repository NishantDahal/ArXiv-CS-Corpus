Solving Non-smooth Constrained Programs with Lower Complexity than $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$: A Primal-Dual Homotopy Smoothing Approach

We propose a new primal-dual homotopy smoothing algorithm for a linearly constrained convex program, where neither the primal nor the dual function has to be smooth or strongly convex. The best known iteration complexity solving such a non-smooth problem is $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$. In this paper, we show that by leveraging a local error bound condition on the dual function, the proposed algorithm can achieve a better primal convergence time of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-2/(2+β)}\log_2(\varepsilon^{-1})\right)$, where $β\in(0,1]$ is a local error bound parameter. As an example application of the general algorithm, we show that the distributed geometric median problem, which can be formulated as a constrained convex program, has its dual function non-smooth but satisfying the aforementioned local error bound condition with $β=1/2$, therefore enjoying a convergence time of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-4/5}\log_2(\varepsilon^{-1})\right)$. This result improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ convergence time bound achieved by existing distributed optimization algorithms. Simulation experiments also demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm.
