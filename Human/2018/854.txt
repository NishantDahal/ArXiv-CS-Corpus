Uncertainty Quantification For A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine With Dynamic Rotor Eccentricity

The influence of dynamic eccentricity on the harmonic spectrum of the torque of a permanent magnet synchronous machine is studied. The spectrum is calculated by an energy balance method. Uncertainty quantification is applied by using generalized Polynomial Chaos and Monte Carlo. It is found that the displacement of the rotor impacts the spectrum of the torque the most.
