Quantum particle in a split box: Excitations to the ground state

We discuss two different approaches for splitting the wavefunction of a single-particle-box (SPB) into two equal parts. Adiabatic insertion of a barrier in the center of a SPB in order to make two compartments which each have probability 1/2 to find the particle in it is one of the key steps for a Szilard engine. However, any asymmetry between the volume of the compartments due to an off-center insertion of the barrier results in a particle that is fully localized in the larger compartment, in the adiabatic limit. We show that rather than exactly splitting the eigenfunctions in half by a symmetric barrier, one can use a non-adiabatic insertion of an asymmetric barrier to induce excitations to the first excited state of the full box. As the barrier height goes to infinity the excited state of the full box becomes the ground state of one of the new boxes. Thus, we can achieve close to exact splitting of the probability between the two compartments using the more realistic non-adiabatic, not perfectly centered barrier, rather than the idealized adiabatic and central barrier normally assumed.
