Fundamental Tradeoffs in Communication and Trajectory Design for UAV-Enabled Wireless Network

The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial communication platforms is of high practical value for future wireless systems such as 5G, especially for swift and on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Compared to traditional terrestrial base stations (BSs) in cellular network, UAV-mounted aerial BSs possess stronger line-of-sight (LoS) links with the ground users due to their high altitude as well as high and flexible mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space, which can be exploited to enhance the communication performance. On the other hand, unlike terrestrial BSs that have reliable power supply, aerial BSs in practice have limited on-board energy, but require significant propulsion energy to stay airborne and support high mobility. Motivated by the above new considerations, this article aims to revisit some fundamental tradeoffs in UAV-enabled communication and trajectory design. Specifically, it is shown that communication throughput, delay, and (propulsion) energy consumption can be traded off among each other by adopting different UAV trajectory designs, which sheds new light on their traditional tradeoffs in terrestrial communication. Promising directions for future research are also discussed.
