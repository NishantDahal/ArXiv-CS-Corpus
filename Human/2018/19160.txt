Mammography Dual View Mass Correspondence

Standard breast cancer screening involves the acquisition of two mammography X-ray projections for each breast. Typically, a comparison of both views supports the challenging task of tumor detection and localization. We introduce a deep learning, patch-based Siamese network for lesion matching in dual-view mammography. Our locally-fitted approach generates a joint patch pair representation and comparison with a shared configuration between the two views. We performed a comprehensive set of experiments with the network on standard datasets, among them the large Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). We analyzed the effect of transfer learning with the network between different types of datasets and compared the network-based matching to using Euclidean distance by template matching. Finally, we evaluated the contribution of the matching network in a full detection pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate the promise of improved detection accuracy using our approach.
