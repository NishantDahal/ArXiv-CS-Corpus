Performance Comparison of Contemporary DNN Watermarking Techniques

DNNs shall be considered as the intellectual property (IP) of the model builder due to the impeding cost of designing/training a highly accurate model. Research attempts have been made to protect the authorship of the trained model and prevent IP infringement using DNN watermarking techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive performance comparison of the state-of-the-art DNN watermarking methodologies according to the essential requisites for an effective watermarking technique. We identify the pros and cons of each scheme and provide insights into the underlying rationale. Empirical results corroborate that DeepSigns framework proposed in [4] has the best overall performance in terms of the evaluation metrics. Our comparison facilitates the development of pending watermarking approaches and enables the model owner to deploy the watermarking scheme that satisfying her requirements.
