Unsupervised Online Multitask Learning of Behavioral Sentence Embeddings

Unsupervised learning has been an attractive method for easily deriving meaningful data representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data. These representations, or embeddings, often yield superior results in many tasks, whether used directly or as features in subsequent training stages. However, the quality of the embeddings is highly dependent on the assumed knowledge in the unlabeled data and how the system extracts information without supervision. Domain portability is also very limited in unsupervised learning, often requiring re-training on other in-domain corpora to achieve robustness. In this work we present a multitask paradigm for unsupervised contextual learning of behavioral interactions which addresses unsupervised domain adaption. We introduce an online multitask objective into unsupervised learning and show that sentence embeddings generated through this process increases performance of affective tasks.
