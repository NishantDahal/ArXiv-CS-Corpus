The paradigm of complexity. Contributions for hypertext's formal approaches

This article argues for a return to formal approaches of hypertext and builds on the paradigm of complexity to develop the idea of "hypermediator website". A hypermediator website is an intermediate device between a digitalization of book culture and a "real" hypertext writing. If our thinking on the hypermediator website joined the hypertext's notions and the databases, it differs by the relationship reader-device no longer based on information search query but using the visualization of the information.
