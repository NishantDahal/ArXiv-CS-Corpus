The Hamming and Golay Number-Theoretic Transforms

New number-theoretic transforms are derived from known linear block codes over finite fields. In particular, two new such transforms are built from perfect codes, namely the \textit {Hamming number-theoretic transform} and the \textit {Golay number-theoretic transform}. A few properties of these new transforms are presented.
