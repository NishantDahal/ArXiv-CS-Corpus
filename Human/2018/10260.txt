Line Hermitian Grassmann Codes and their Parameters

In this paper we introduce and study line Hermitian Grassmann codes as those subcodes of the Grassmann codes associated to the $2$-Grassmannian of a Hermitian polar space defined over a finite field of square order.
  In particular, we determine their parameters and characterize the words of minimum weight.
