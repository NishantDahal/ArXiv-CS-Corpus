Convolutional Neural Networks based Intra Prediction for HEVC

Traditional intra prediction methods for HEVC rely on using the nearest reference lines for predicting a block, which ignore much richer context between the current block and its neighboring blocks and therefore cause inaccurate prediction especially when weak spatial correlation exists between the current block and the reference lines. To overcome this problem, in this paper, an intra prediction convolutional neural network (IPCNN) is proposed for intra prediction, which exploits the rich context of the current block and therefore is capable of improving the accuracy of predicting the current block. Meanwhile, the predictions of the three nearest blocks can also be refined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that directly applies CNNs to intra prediction for HEVC. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of applying CNNs to intra prediction and achieved significant performance improvement compared to traditional intra prediction methods.
