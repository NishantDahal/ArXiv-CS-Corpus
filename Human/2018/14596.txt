An Analytics Tool for Exploring Scientific Software and Related Publications

Scientific software is one of the key elements for reproducible research. However, classic publications and related scientific software are typically not (sufficiently) linked, and it lacks tools to jointly explore these artefacts. In this paper, we report on our work on developing an analytics tool for jointly exploring software and publications. The presented prototype, a concept for automatic code discovery, and two use cases demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of the proposal.
