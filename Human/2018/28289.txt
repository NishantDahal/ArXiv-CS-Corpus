COMIT - Cryptographically-secure Off-chain Multi-asset Instant Transaction Network

Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009 we have seen a great push towards public and private blockchains. In order to avoid fragmentation, a global network connecting all these blockchains is envisioned. Just like the Internet facilitates communication and the transfer of information, we propose a system, similar in size and reach for payments and transactions: A cryptographically-secure off-chain multi-asset instant transaction network (COMIT) can connect and exchange any asset on any blockchain to any other blockchain using a cross-chain routing protocol (CRP). COMIT is a super blockchain network that allows for instant transactions which are enforced using off-chain smart contracts. It leverages Payment Channels and Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) across chains to solve the problem of double spending attacks without requiring a settlement onto the underlying blockchains. COMIT's connectivity is provided by Liquidity Providers (LP), who operate on one or more blockchains, acting as payment hubs and nodes on a single chain and market makers in a decentralized network for cross-chain asset conversions. This paper lays out how COMIT works, the benefits for Users, Liquidity Providers and Businesses; and how this does not only accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology, but furthermore allows for an integration with the traditional banking system.
