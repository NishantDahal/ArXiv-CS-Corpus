Design of Low Complexity GFDM Transceiver

In this work, we propose a novel low complexity Generalised Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) transceiver design. GFDM modulation matrix is factorized into FFT matrices and a diagonal matrix to design low complexity GFDM transmitter. Factorization of GFDM modulation matrix is used to derive low complexity Matched Filter (MF), Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) based novel low complexity self-interference equalizers. A two-stage receiver is proposed for multipath fading channel in which channel equalization is followed by our proposed low-complexity self-interference equalizers. Unlike other known low complexity GFDM transceivers, our proposed transceiver attains low complexity for arbitrary number of time and frequency slots. The complexity of our proposed transceiver is log-linear with a number of transmitted symbols and achieves 3 to 300 times lower complexity compared to the existing structures without incurring any performance loss. Our proposed Unbiased-MMSE receiver outperforms our proposed ZF receiver without any significant increase in complexity especially in the case of large number of time slots. In a nutshell, our proposed transceiver enables low complexity flexible GFDM transceiver implementation.
