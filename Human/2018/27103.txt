ComNet: Combination of Deep Learning and Expert Knowledge in OFDM Receivers

In this article, we propose a model-driven deep learning (DL) approach that combines DL with the expert knowledge to replace the existing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver in wireless communications. Different from the data-driven fully connected deep neural network (FC-DNN) method, we adopt the block-by-block signal processing method that divides the receiver into channel estimation subnet and signal detection subnet. Each subnet is constructed by a DNN and uses the existing simple and traditional solution as initialization. The proposed model-driven DL receiver offers more accurate channel estimation comparing with the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) method and exhibits higher data recovery accuracy comparing with the existing methods and FC-DNN. Simulation results further demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and its superiority to the FC-DNN approach in the computational complexities or the memory usage.
