Sequences with Low Correlation

Pseudorandom sequences are used extensively in communications and remote sensing. Correlation provides one measure of pseudorandomness, and low correlation is an important factor determining the performance of digital sequences in applications. We consider the problem of constructing pairs $(f,g)$ of sequences such that both $f$ and $g$ have low mean square autocorrelation and $f$ and $g$ have low mean square mutual crosscorrelation. We focus on aperiodic correlation of binary sequences, and review recent contributions along with some historical context.
