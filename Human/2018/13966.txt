The Satisfiability Problem for Unbounded Fragments of Probabilistic CTL

We investigate the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problem for probabilistic computation-tree logic (PCTL) where operators are not restricted by any step bounds. We establish decidability for several fragments containing quantitative operators and pinpoint the difficulties arising in more complex fragments where the decidability remains open.
