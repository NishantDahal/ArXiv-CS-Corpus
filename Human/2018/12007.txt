Lighting the Way to a Smart World: Lattice-Based Cryptography for Internet of Things

The Ukraine power grid cyberattacks remind us that the smart Internet of Things (IoT) can help us control our light-bulbs, but if under attacks it might also take us into darkness. Nowadays, many literatures have tried to address the concerns on IoT security, but few of them take into consideration the sever threats to IoT coming from the advances of quantum computing. As a promising candidate for the future post-quantum cryptography standard, lattice-based cryptography enjoys the advantages of strong security guarantees and high efficiency, which make it extremely suitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we summarize the advantages of lattice-based cryptography and the state of art of their implementations for IoT devices.
