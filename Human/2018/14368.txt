A Note on Digitization of Real-Time Models and Logics

Digitization provides a sound and complete method to reduce the problem of verifying whether a real-time system satisfies a property under dense-time semantics to whether the same real-time system satisfies the property over discrete-time. This is a brief overview of digitization of real-time models and logics covering known results, value, limitations, and alternatives.
