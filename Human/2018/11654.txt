Performance Analysis and Optimization of Cooperative Full-Duplex D2D Communication Underlaying Cellular Networks

This paper investigates the cooperative full-duplex device-to-device (D2D) communication underlaying cellular network, where the cellular user (CU) acts as a full-duplex relay to assist the D2D communication. To simultaneously support D2D relaying and uplink transmission, superposition coding and successive interference cancellation are adopted at the CU and the D2D receiver, respectively. The achievable rate region and joint outage probability are derived to characterize the performance of the considered system. An optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to maximize the minimum achievable rate. Besides, by analyzing the upper bound of the joint outage probability, we study a suboptimal power allocation to improve the outage performance. The simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis and the advantages of the proposed power allocation schemes.
