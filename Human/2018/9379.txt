A Fast Fragmentation Algorithm For Data Protection In a Multi-Cloud Environment

Data fragmentation and dispersal over multiple clouds is a way of data protection against honest-but-curious storage or service providers. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for data fragmentation that is particularly well adapted to be used in a multi-cloud environment. An empirical security analysis was performed on data sets provided by a large enterprise and shows that the scheme achieves good data protection. A performance comparison with published related works demonstrates it can be more than twice faster than the fastest of the relevant fragmentation techniques, while producing reasonable storage overhead.
