Revealing cracks inside conductive bodies by electric surface measurements

An algorithm is introduced for using electrical surface measurements to detect and monitor cracks inside a two-dimensional conductive body. The technique is based on transforming the probing functions of the classical enclosure method by the Kelvin transform. The transform makes it possible to use virtual discs for probing the interior of the body using electric measurements performed on a flat surface. Theoretical results are presented to enable probing of the full domain to create a profile indicating cracks in the domain. Feasibility of the method is demonstrated with a simulated model of attaching metal sheets together by resistance spot welding.
