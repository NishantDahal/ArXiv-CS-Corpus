VR IQA NET: Deep Virtual Reality Image Quality Assessment using Adversarial Learning

In this paper, we propose a novel virtual reality image quality assessment (VR IQA) with adversarial learning for omnidirectional images. To take into account the characteristics of the omnidirectional image, we devise deep networks including novel quality score predictor and human perception guider. The proposed quality score predictor automatically predicts the quality score of distorted image using the latent spatial and position feature. The proposed human perception guider criticizes the predicted quality score of the predictor with the human perceptual score using adversarial learning. For evaluation, we conducted extensive subjective experiments with omnidirectional image dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed VR IQA metric outperforms the 2-D IQA and the state-of-the-arts VR IQA.
