Directional Modulation: A Secure Solution to 5G and Beyond Mobile Networks

Directional modulation (DM), as an efficient secure transmission way, offers security through its directive property and is suitable for line-of-propagation (LoP) channels such as millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), satellite communication, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and smart transportation. If the direction angle of the desired received is known, the desired channel gain vector is obtainable. Thus, in advance, the DM transmitter knows the values of directional angles of desired user and eavesdropper, or their direction of arrival (DOAs) because the beamforming vector of confidential messages and artificial noise (AN) projection matrix is mainly determined by directional angles of desired user and eavesdropper. For a DM transceiver, working as a receiver, the first step is to measure the DOAs of desired user and eavesdropper. Then, in the second step, using the measured DOAs, the beamforming vector of confidential messages and AN projection matrix is designed. In this paper, we describe the DOA measurement methods, power allocation, and beamforming in DM networks. A machine learning-based DOA measurement method is proposed to make a substantial SR performance gain compared to single-snapshot measurement without machine learning for a given null-space projection beamforming scheme. However, for a conventional DM network, there still exists a serious secure issue: the eavesdropper moves inside the main beam of the desired user and may intercept the confidential messages intended to the desired users because the beamforming vector of confidential messages and AN projection matrix are only angle-dependence. To address this problem, we present a new concept of secure and precise transmission, where the transmit waveform has two-dimensional even three-dimensional dependence by using DM, random frequency selection, and phase alignment at DM transmitter.
