Building a Knowledge Graph from Natural Language Definitions for Interpretable Text Entailment Recognition

Natural language definitions of terms can serve as a rich source of knowledge, but structuring them into a comprehensible semantic model is essential to enable them to be used in semantic interpretation tasks. We propose a method and provide a set of tools for automatically building a graph world knowledge base from natural language definitions. Adopting a conceptual model composed of a set of semantic roles for dictionary definitions, we trained a classifier for automatically labeling definitions, preparing the data to be later converted to a graph representation. WordNetGraph, a knowledge graph built out of noun and verb WordNet definitions according to this methodology, was successfully used in an interpretable text entailment recognition approach which uses paths in this graph to provide clear justifications for entailment decisions.
