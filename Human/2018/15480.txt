An Explicit Construction of Systematic MDS Codes with Small Sub-packetization for All-Node Repair

An explicit construction of systematic MDS codes, called HashTag+ codes, with arbitrary sub-packetization level for all-node repair is proposed. It is shown that even for small sub-packetization levels, HashTag+ codes achieve the optimal MSR point for repair of any parity node, while the repair bandwidth for a single systematic node depends on the sub-packetization level. Compared to other codes in the literature, HashTag+ codes provide from 20% to 40% savings in the average amount of data accessed and transferred during repair.
