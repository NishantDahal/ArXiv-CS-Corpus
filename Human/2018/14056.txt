Automatic Rank Selection for High-Speed Convolutional Neural Network

Low-rank decomposition plays a central role in accelerating convolutional neural network (CNN), and the rank of decomposed kernel-tensor is a key parameter that determines the complexity and accuracy of a neural network. In this paper, we define rank selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and propose a methodology to minimize network complexity while maintaining the desired accuracy. Combinatorial optimization is not feasible due to search space limitations. To restrict the search space and obtain the optimal rank, we define the space constraint parameters with a boundary condition. We also propose a linearly-approximated accuracy function to predict the fine-tuned accuracy of the optimized CNN model during the cost reduction. Experimental results on AlexNet and VGG-16 show that the proposed rank selection algorithm satisfies the accuracy constraint. Our method combined with truncated-SVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of inference and training time at almost the same accuracy.
