Ontology based Approach for Precision Agriculture

In this paper, we propose a framework of knowledge for an agriculture ontology which can be used for the purpose of smart agriculture systems. This ontology not only includes basic concepts in the agricultural domain but also contains geographical, IoT, business subdomains, and other knowledge extracted from various datasets. With this ontology, any users can easily understand agricultural data links between them collected from many different data resources. In our experiment, we also import country, sub-country and disease entities into this ontology as basic entities for building agricultural linked datasets later.
