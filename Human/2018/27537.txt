Small One-Dimensional Euclidean Preference Profiles

We characterize one-dimensional Euclidean preference profiles with a small number of alternatives and voters. In particular, we show the following.
  1. Every preference profile with up to two voters is one-dimensional Euclidean if and only if it is single-peaked.
  2. Every preference profile with up to five alternatives is one-dimensional Euclidean if and only if it is single-peaked and single-crossing.
  By [12], we thus obtain that the smallest single-peaked and single-crossing preference profiles that are not one-dimensional Euclidean consist of three voters and six alternatives.
