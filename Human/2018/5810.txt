Performance and Impairment Modelling for Hardware Components in Millimetre-wave Transceivers

This invited paper details some of the hardware modelling and impairment analysis carried out in the EU mmMAGIC project. The modelling work includes handset and Access Point antenna arrays, where specific millimeter-wave challenges are addressed. In power amplifier related analysis, statistical and behavioural modelling approaches are discussed. Phase Noise, regarded as a main impairment in millimeter-wave, is captured under two models and some analysis into to the impact of phase noise is also provided.
