Punctuation Prediction Model for Conversational Speech

An ASR system usually does not predict any punctuation or capitalization. Lack of punctuation causes problems in result presentation and confuses both the human reader andoff-the-shelf natural language processing algorithms. To overcome these limitations, we train two variants of Deep Neural Network (DNN) sequence labelling models - a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict the punctuation. The models are trained on the Fisher corpus which includes punctuation annotation. In our experiments, we combine time-aligned and punctuated Fisher corpus transcripts using a sequence alignment algorithm. The neural networks are trained on Common Web Crawl GloVe embedding of the words in Fisher transcripts aligned with conversation side indicators and word time infomation. The CNNs yield a better precision and BLSTMs tend to have better recall. While BLSTMs make fewer mistakes overall, the punctuation predicted by the CNN is more accurate - especially in the case of question marks. Our results constitute significant evidence that the distribution of words in time, as well as pre-trained embeddings, can be useful in the punctuation prediction task.
