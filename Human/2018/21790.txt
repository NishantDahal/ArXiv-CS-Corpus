Unsupervised/Semi-supervised Deep Learning for Low-dose CT Enhancement

Recently, deep learning(DL) methods have been proposed for the low-dose computed tomography(LdCT) enhancement, and obtain good trade-off between computational efficiency and image quality. Most of them need large number of pre-collected ground-truth/high-dose sinograms with less noise, and train the network in a supervised end-to-end manner. This may bring major limitations on these methods because the number of such low-dose/high-dose training sinogram pairs would affect the network's capability and sometimes the ground-truth sinograms are hard to be obtained in large scale. Since large number of low-dose ones are relatively easy to obtain, it should be critical to make these sources play roles in network training in an unsupervised learning manner. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised DL method for LdCT enhancement that incorporates unlabeled LdCT sinograms directly into the network training. The proposed method effectively considers the structure characteristics and noise distribution in the measured LdCT sinogram, and then learns the proper gradient of the LdCT sinogram in a pure unsupervised manner. Similar to the labeled ground-truth, the gradient information in an unlabeled LdCT sinogram can be used for sufficient network training. The experiments on the patient data show effectiveness of the proposed method.
