A Neural Network Lattice Decoding Algorithm

Neural network decoding algorithms are recently introduced by Nachmani et al. to decode high-density parity-check (HDPC) codes. In contrast with iterative decoding algorithms such as sum-product or min-sum algorithms in which the weight of each edge is set to $1$, in the neural network decoding algorithms, the weight of every edge depends on its impact in the transmitted codeword. In this paper, we provide a novel \emph{feed-forward neural network lattice decoding algorithm} suitable to decode lattices constructed based on Construction A, whose underlying codes have HDPC matrices. We first establish the concept of feed-forward neural network for HDPC codes and improve their decoding algorithms compared to Nachmani et al. We then apply our proposed decoder for a Construction A lattice with HDPC underlying code, for which the well-known iterative decoding algorithms show poor performances. The main advantage of our proposed algorithm is that instead of assigning and training weights for all edges, which turns out to be time-consuming especially for high-density parity-check matrices, we concentrate on edges which are present in most of $4$-cycles and removing them gives a girth-$6$ Tanner graph. This approach, by slight modifications using updated LLRs instead of initial ones, simultaneously accelerates the training process and improves the error performance of our proposed decoding algorithm.
