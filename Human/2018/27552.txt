Fault Adaptive Routing in Metasurface Controller Networks

HyperSurfaces are a merge of structurally reconfigurable metasurfaces whose electromagnetic properties can be changed via a software interface, using an embedded miniaturized network of controllers, thus enabling novel capabilities in wireless communications. Resource constraints associated with the development of a hardware testbed of this breakthrough technology necessitate network controller architectures different from traditional regular Network-on-Chip architectures. The Manhattan-like topology chosen to realize the controller network in the testbed under development is irregular, with restricted local path selection options, operating in an asynchronous fashion. These characteristics render traditional fault-tolerant routing mechanisms inadequate. In this paper, we present work in progress towards the development of fault-tolerant routing mechanisms for the chosen architecture. We present two XY-based approaches which have been developed aiming to offer reliable data delivery in the presence of faults. The first approach aims to avoid loops while the second one attempts to maximize the success delivery probabilities. Their effectiveness is demonstrated via simulations conducted on a custom developed simulator.
