The Future is Unlicensed: Coexistence in the Unlicensed Spectrum for 5G

5G has to fulfill the requirements of ultra-dense, scalable, and customizable networks such as IoT while increasing spectrum and energy efficiency. Given the diversity of envisaged applications and scenarios, one crucial property for 5G New Radio (NR) is flexibility: flexible UL/DL allocation, bandwidths, or scalable transmission time interval, and most importantly operation at different frequency bands. In particular, 5G should exploit the spectral opportunities in the unlicensed spectrum for expanding network capacity when and where needed. However, unlicensed bands pose the challenge of "coexisting networks", which mostly lack the means of communication for negotiation and coordination. This deficiency is further exacerbated by the heterogeneity, massive connectivity, and ubiquity of IoT systems and applications. Therefore, 5G needs to provide mechanisms to coexist and even converge in the unlicensed bands. In that regard, WiFi, as the most prominent wireless technology in the unlicensed bands, is both a key enabler for boosting 5G capacity and competitor of 5G cellular networks for the shared unlicensed spectrum. In this work, we describe spectrum sharing in 5G and present key coexistence solutions, mostly in the context of WiFi. We also highlight the role of machine learning which is envisaged to be critical for reaching coexistence and convergence goals by providing the necessary intelligence and adaptation mechanisms.
