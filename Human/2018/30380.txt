On-off Switched Interference Alignment for Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff Improvement in the 2-User X-Network with Two Antennas

To improve diversity gain in an interference channel and hence to maximize diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT), we propose on-off switched interference alignment (IA) where IA is intermittently utilized by switching IA on/off. For on-off switching, either IA with symbol extension or IA with Alamouti coding is adopted in this paper. Deriving and analyzing DMT of the proposed schemes, we reveal that the intermittent utilization of IA with simultaneous non-unique decoding can improve DMT in the 2-user X-channel with two antennas. Both the proposed schemes are shown to achieve diversity gain of 4 and DoF per user of $\frac{4}{3}$. In particular, the on-off switched IA with Alamouti coding, to the best of our knowledge, surpasses any other existing schemes for the 2-user X-channel with two antennas and nearly approaches the ideal DMT.
