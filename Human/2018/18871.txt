Feature Assisted bi-directional LSTM Model for Protein-Protein Interaction Identification from Biomedical Texts

Knowledge about protein-protein interactions is essential in understanding the biological processes such as metabolic pathways, DNA replication, and transcription etc. However, a majority of the existing Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) systems are dependent primarily on the scientific literature, which is yet not accessible as a structured database. Thus, efficient information extraction systems are required for identifying PPI information from the large collection of biomedical texts. Most of the existing systems model the PPI extraction task as a classification problem and are tailored to the handcrafted feature set including domain dependent features. In this paper, we present a novel method based on deep bidirectional long short-term memory (B-LSTM) technique that exploits word sequences and dependency path related information to identify PPI information from text. This model leverages joint modeling of proteins and relations in a single unified framework, which we name as Shortest Dependency Path B-LSTM (sdpLSTM) model. We perform experiments on two popular benchmark PPI datasets, namely AiMed & BioInfer. The evaluation shows the F1-score values of 86.45% and 77.35% on AiMed and BioInfer, respectively. Comparisons with the existing systems show that our proposed approach attains state-of-the-art performance.
