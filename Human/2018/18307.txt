GreyFiber: A System for Providing Flexible Access to Wide-Area Connectivity

Access to fiber-optic connectivity in the Internet is traditionally offered either via lit circuits or dark fiber. Economic (capex vs. opex) and operational considerations (latency, capacity) dictate the choice between these two offerings, but neither may effectively address the specific needs of modern-day enterprises or service providers over a range of use scenarios. In this paper, we describe a new approach for fiber-optic connectivity in the Internet that we call GreyFiber. The core idea of GreyFiber is to offer flexible access to fiber-optic paths between end points (e.g., datacenters or colocation facilities) over a range of timescales. We identify and discuss operational issues and systems challenges that need to be addressed to make GreyFiber a viable and realistic option for offering flexible access to infrastructure (similar to cloud computing). We investigate the efficacy of GreyFiber with a prototype implementation deployed in the GENI and CloudLab testbeds. Our scaling experiments show that 50 circuits can be provisioned within a minute. We also show that backup paths can be provisioned 28 times faster than an OSPF-based solution during failure/maintenance events. Our experiments also examine GreyFiber overhead demands and show that the time spent in circuit creation is dependent on the network infrastructure, indicating avenues for future improvements.
