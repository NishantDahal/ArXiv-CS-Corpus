On the Reconstruction of Static and Dynamic Discrete Structures

We study inverse problems of reconstructing static and dynamic discrete structures from tomographic data (with a special focus on the `classical' task of reconstructing finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$). The main emphasis is on recent mathematical developments and new applications, which emerge in scientific areas such as physics and materials science, but also in inner mathematical fields such as number theory, optimization, and imaging. Along with a concise introduction to the field of discrete tomography, we give pointers to related aspects of computerized tomography in order to contrast the worlds of continuous and discrete inverse problems.
