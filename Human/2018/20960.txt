Statistical QoS provisioning for MTC Networks under Finite Blocklength

This paper analyzes the effective capacity of delay constrained machine type communication (MTC) networks operating in the finite blocklength regime. First, we derive a closed-form mathematical approximation for the effective capacity in quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. We characterize the optimum error probability to maximize the concave effective capacity function with reliability constraint and study the effect of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) variations for different delay constraints. The trade off between reliability and effective capacity maximization reveals that we can achieve higher reliability with limited sacrifice in effective capacity specially when the number of machines is small. Our analysis reveals that SINR variations have less impact on effective capacity for strict delay constrained networks. We present an exemplary scenario for massive MTC access to analyze the interference effect proposing three methods to restore the effective capacity for a certain node which are power control, graceful degradation of delay constraint and joint compensation. Joint compensation combines both power control and graceful degradation of delay constraint, where we perform maximization of an objective function whose parameters are determined according to delay and SINR priorities. Our results show that networks with stringent delay constraints favor power controlled compensation and compensation is generally performed at higher costs for shorter packets.
