Smart Stamp Duty

Blockchain technology has enjoyed a massive adoption in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Following the success, many people have started to explore the possibility of implementing blockchain technology in different fields. We propose smart stamp duty, a system which can revolutionize the way stamp duty is managed and paid. The smart stamp duty offers significant improvements on the convenience when paying stamp duty. At the same time, the blockchain technology also provides the auditability of the transaction data. Smart stamp duty enables the expansion of the existing electronic stamp duty application to retail level as well as allows the taxpayers to pay the stamp duty of their electronic documents. Our proposed system also enables the taxpayers to print their electronic documents without losing the paid electronic-based stamps.
