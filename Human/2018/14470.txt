COZMO-A New Lightweight Stream Cipher

This paper deals with the merger of the two lightweight stream ciphers: A5by1 and Trivium. The idea is to make the key stream generation more secure and to remove the attacks of the individual algorithms. The bits generated by the Trivium cipher will act as the input of the A5by1 cipher. The registers used in the A5by1 cipher will be filled by the output bits of the Trivium cipher. The three registers will then be connected to generate an output which will be our required key stream.
