Turbulucid: A Python Package for Post-Processing of Fluid Flow Simulations

A Python package for post-processing of plane two-dimensional data from computational fluid dynamics simulations is presented. The package, called turbulucid, provides means for scripted, reproducible analysis of large simulation campaigns and includes routines for both data extraction and visualization. For the former, the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is used, allowing for post-processing of simulations performed on unstructured meshes. For visualization, several matplotlib-based functions for creating highly customizable, publication-quality plots are provided. To demonstrate turbulucid's functionality it is here applied to post-processing a simulation of a flow over a backward-facing step. The implementation and architecture of the package are also discussed, as well as its reuse potential.
