Dual Connectivity Support in 5G Networks: An SDN based approach

Dual Connectivity (DC) is one of the key techniques to harness the potential of heterogeneous cellular networks. However, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced disparate mechanisms for DC support in different Radio Access Technologies (RATs), bringing complexity to the network nodes in a Multi-RAT Radio Access Network (RAN). Moreover, DC support requires an exchange of high volume of control information between these network nodes. To address these issues, in this paper an SDN based architecture for Multi-RAT RAN is proposed. The proposed architecture brings simplicity to the network interactions, allows flexibility in the network and helps the network in performing load balancing and mobility management functions effectively. We also demonstrate a reduction in the control signaling and an improvement in system performance compared to legacy architecture.
