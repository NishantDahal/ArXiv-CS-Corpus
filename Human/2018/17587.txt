CaricatureShop: Personalized and Photorealistic Caricature Sketching

In this paper, we propose the first sketching system for interactively personalized and photorealistic face caricaturing. Input an image of a human face, the users can create caricature photos by manipulating its facial feature curves. Our system firstly performs exaggeration on the recovered 3D face model according to the edited sketches, which is conducted by assigning the laplacian of each vertex a scaling factor. To construct the mapping between 2D sketches and a vertex-wise scaling field, a novel deep learning architecture is developed. With the obtained 3D caricature model, two images are generated, one obtained by applying 2D warping guided by the underlying 3D mesh deformation and the other obtained by re-rendering the deformed 3D textured model. These two images are then seamlessly integrated to produce our final output. Due to the severely stretching of meshes, the rendered texture is of blurry appearances. A deep learning approach is exploited to infer the missing details for enhancing these blurry regions. Moreover, a relighting operation is invented to further improve the photorealism of the result. Both quantitative and qualitative experiment results validated the efficiency of our sketching system and the superiority of our proposed techniques against existing methods.
