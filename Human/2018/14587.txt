Approximation by filter functions

In this exploratory article, we draw attention to the common formal ground among various estimators such as the belief functions of evidence theory and their relatives, approximation quality of rough set theory, and contextual probability. The unifying concept will be a general filter function composed of a basic probability and a weighting which varies according to the problem at hand. To compare the various filter functions we conclude with a simulation study with an example from the area of item response theory.
