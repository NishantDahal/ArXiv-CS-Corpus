Service-based Fog architecture without DNS redirection

The heterogeneous and distributed nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the need for extremely fast and fine-grained service provisioning in 5/5+G architectures and beyond. To meet these needs, it is critical to enable efficient and flexible computation and networking fabrics, that can be rapidly reconfigured to meet the computation and communication tasks at hand. In this article, we propose a novel Fog Computing architecture that translates IoT communications into service transactions, provisioned over a fast and efficient networking fabric. Service matching is provided by a network function designed using principles from Information-Centric Networks (ICN) research, routing edge requests directly to the nearest service points without expensive and slow DNS redirects. The proposed Fog substrate reduces the networking complexity and overhead while being architecturally simple. We evaluate the architecture through a comparison with how Fog might be established over existing networking fabrics and quantify the performance benefits. Evaluation results illustrate the superiority of the proposed architecture in reducing the required backhaul capacity and the path length.
