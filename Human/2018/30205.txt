Green Communication with Geolocation

Green communications is the practice of selecting energy efficient communications, networking technologies and products. This process is followed by minimizing resource use whenever possible in all branches of communications. In this day and age, green communication is vital to the footprint we leave on this planet as we move into a completely digital age. One such communication tool is Message Queue Transport Telemetry or MQTT which is an open source publisher/subscriber standard for M2M (Machine to Machine) communication. It is well known for its low energy and bandwidth footprint and thus makes it highly suitable for Green Internet of Things (IoT) messaging situations where power usage is at a premium or in mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers. It is a perfect tool for the green communication age upon us and more specifically Green IoT. One problem however with the original MQTT protocol is that it is lacking the ability to broadcast geolocation. In today's age of IoT however, it has become more pertinent to have geolocation as part of the protocol. In this paper, we add geolocation to the MQTT protocol and offer a revised version, which we call MQTTg. We describe the protocol here and show where we are able to embed geolocation successfully. We also offer a glimpse into an Android OS application we are developing for Open Source use.
