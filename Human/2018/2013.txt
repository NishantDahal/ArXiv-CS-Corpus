Combining and Steganography of 3D Face Textures

One of the serious issues in communication between people is hiding information from others, and the best way for this, is deceiving them. Since nowadays face images are mostly used in three dimensional format, in this paper we are going to steganography 3D face images, detecting which by curious people will be impossible. As in detecting face only its texture is important, we separate texture from shape matrices, for eliminating half of the extra information, steganography is done only for face texture, and for reconstructing 3D face, we can use any other shape. Moreover, we will indicate that, by using two textures, how two 3D faces can be combined. For a complete description of the process, first, 2D faces are used as an input for building 3D faces, and then 3D textures are hidden within other images.
