On-Chip Optical Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) that employ the method of convolving input images with filter-kernels for object recognition and classification purposes. In this paper, we propose a photonics circuit architecture which could consume a fraction of energy per inference compared with state of the art electronics.
