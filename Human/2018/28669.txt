Constructing Trustworthy and Safe Communities on a Blockchain-Enabled Social Credits System

The emergence of big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is reshaping the world. While the technological revolution improves the quality of our life, new concerns are triggered. The superhuman capability enables AI to outperform human workers in many data- and/or computing-intensive tasks. Also, digital superpowers are showing arrogance towards individuals, which erodes the trust foundation of the society. In this position paper, we suggest to construct trustworthy and safe communities based on a BLockchain-Enabled Social credits System (BLESS) that rewards the residents who commit in socially beneficial activities. Human being's true value lies in serving other people. The BLESS system is considered as an efficient approach to promote the value and dignity in efforts focused on enhancing our communities and regulating business and private behaviors. The BLESS system leverages the decentralized architecture of the blockchain network, which not only allows grassroots individuals to participate rating process of a social credit system (SCS), but also provides tamper proof of transaction data in the trustless network environment. The anonymity in blockchain records also protects individuals from being targeted in the fight against powerful enterprises. Smart contract enabled authentication and authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized entity from accessing the credit system. The BLESS scheme is promising to offer a secure, transparent and decentralized SCS.
