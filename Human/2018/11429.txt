Task and Energy Aware Node Placement in Wirelessly Rechargeable WSNs

In this paper, we present a novel problem of optimal placement of sensor nodes in wirelessly rechargeable Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) wrt. a charging requirement constraint and a task utility requirement constraint. We call this problem Task and Energy Aware Node Placement (TENP) problem. We have devised an algorithm to solve the TENP problem. Our theoretical analysis shows that the devised algorithm is an incomplete but tractable method for solving TENP. We have performed an empirical evaluation of the devised algorithm for three different version of TENP in various experimental settings. The experimental results reveal numbers of interesting insights on the relationship between sensor node placement, charge harvest, and task utility.
