Biology is a constructive physics

Yuri Manin's approach to Zipf's law (Kolmogorov complexity as energy) is applied to investigation of biological evolution. Model of constructive statistical mechanics where complexity is a contribution to energy is proposed to model genomics. Scaling laws in genomics are discussed in relation to Zipf's law. This gives a model of Eugene Koonin's Third Evolutionary Synthesis (physical model which should describe scaling in genomics).
