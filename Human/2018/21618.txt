Ensemble Kalman Inversion: A Derivative-Free Technique For Machine Learning Tasks

The standard probabilistic perspective on machine learning gives rise to empirical risk-minimization tasks that are frequently solved by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and variants thereof. We present a formulation of these tasks as classical inverse or filtering problems and, furthermore, we propose an efficient, gradient-free algorithm for finding a solution to these problems using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). Applications of our approach include offline and online supervised learning with deep neural networks, as well as graph-based semi-supervised learning. The essence of the EKI procedure is an ensemble based approximate gradient descent in which derivatives are replaced by differences from within the ensemble. We suggest several modifications to the basic method, derived from empirically successful heuristics developed in the context of SGD. Numerical results demonstrate wide applicability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
