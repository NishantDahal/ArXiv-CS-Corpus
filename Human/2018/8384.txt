Now you see me: evaluating performance in long-term visual tracking

We propose a new long-term tracking performance evaluation methodology and present a new challenging dataset of carefully selected sequences with many target disappearances. We perform an extensive evaluation of six long-term and nine short-term state-of-the-art trackers, using new performance measures, suitable for evaluating long-term tracking - tracking precision, recall and F-score. The evaluation shows that a good model update strategy and the capability of image-wide re-detection are critical for long-term tracking performance. We integrated the methodology in the VOT toolkit to automate experimental analysis and benchmarking and to facilitate the development of long-term trackers.
