A note on regular subgroups of the automorphism group of the linear Hadamard code

We consider the regular subgroups of the automorphism group of the linear Hadamard code. These subgroups correspond to the regular subgroups of $GA(r,2)$, w.t.r action on the vectors of $F_2^{r}$, where $n=2^r-1 $ is the length of the Hamadard code. We show that the dihedral group $D_{2^{r-1}}$ is a regular subgroup of $GA(r,2)$ only when $r=3$. Following the approach of \cite{M} we study the regular subgroups of the Hamming code obtained from the regular subgroups of the automorphism group of the Hadamard code of length 15.
