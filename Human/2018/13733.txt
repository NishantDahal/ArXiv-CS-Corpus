On Coloring Random Subgraphs of a Fixed Graph

Given an arbitrary graph $G$ we study the chromatic number of a random subgraph $G_{1/2}$ obtained from $G$ by removing each edge independently with probability $1/2$. Studying $χ(G_{1/2})$ has been suggested by Bukh~\cite{Bukh}, who asked whether $\mathbb{E}[χ(G_{1/2})] \geq Ω( χ(G)/\log(χ(G)))$ holds for all graphs $G$. In this paper we show that for any graph $G$ with chromatic number $k = χ(G)$ and for all $d \leq k^{1/3}$ it holds that $\Pr[χ(G_{1/2}) \leq d] < \exp \left(- Ω\left(\frac{k(k-d^3)}{d^3}\right)\right)$. In particular, $\Pr[G_{1/2} \text{ is bipartite}] < \exp \left(- Ω\left(k^2 \right)\right)$. The later bound is tight up to a constant in $Ω(\cdot)$, and is attained when $G$ is the complete graph on $k$ vertices.
  As a technical lemma, that may be of independent interest, we prove that if in \emph{any} $d^3$ coloring of the vertices of $G$ there are at least $t$ monochromatic edges, then $\Pr[χ(G_{1/2}) \leq d] < e^{- Ω\left(t\right)}$.
  We also prove that for any graph $G$ with chromatic number $k = χ(G)$ and independence number $α(G) \leq O(n/k)$ it holds that $\mathbb{E}[χ(G_{1/2})] \geq Ω\left( k/\log(k) \right)$. This gives a positive answer to the question of Bukh for a large family of graphs.
