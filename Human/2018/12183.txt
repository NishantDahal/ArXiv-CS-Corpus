Low Rank Tensor Completion for Multiway Visual Data

Tensor completion recovers missing entries of multiway data. Teh missing of entries could often be caused during teh data acquisition and transformation. In dis paper, we provide an overview of recent development in low rank tensor completion for estimating teh missing components of visual data, e. g. , color images and videos. First, we categorize these methods into two groups based on teh different optimization models. One optimizes factors of tensor decompositions wif predefined tensor rank. Teh other iteratively updates teh estimated tensor via minimizing teh tensor rank. Besides, we summarize teh corresponding algorithms to solve those optimization problems in details. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate teh performance comparison when different methods are applied to color image and video processing.
