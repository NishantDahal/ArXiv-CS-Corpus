Comparative study of Discrete Wavelet Transforms and Wavelet Tensor Train decomposition to feature extraction of FTIR data of medicinal plants

Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra of samples from 7 plant species were used to explore the influence of preprocessing and feature extraction on efficiency of machine learning algorithms. Wavelet Tensor Train (WTT) and Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) were compared as feature extraction techniques for FTIR data of medicinal plants. Various combinations of signal processing steps showed different behavior when applied to classification and clustering tasks. Best results for WTT and DWT found through grid search were similar, significantly improving quality of clustering as well as classification accuracy for tuned logistic regression in comparison to original spectra. Unlike DWT, WTT has only one parameter to be tuned (rank), making it a more versatile and easier to use as a data processing tool in various signal processing applications.
