Intersection Approach Advisory Through Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication Using Signal Phase and Timing Information at Signalized Intersection

Advancement in connected vehicle technology has created opportunities for researchers to develop safety critical and assistive applications for drivers. These applications do not only ensure drivers' safety and assistance services but also benefit the environment by reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emission. An intersection approach advisory system, which is one of the connected vehicle applications, utilizes the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology for V2X communications and National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol (NTCIP) protocol reading SPaT data to provide intersection related information to drivers. In this paper, we discuss such a system that provides drivers the live signal information and recommends speeds through visual and auditory means in a less distractive way to make informed decisions before reaching to an intersection for different traffic scenarios. We also discuss the in-depth analysis of the implementation issues and challenges of such a system.
