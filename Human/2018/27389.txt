Recognizing Partial Biometric Patterns

Biometric recognition on partial captured targets is challenging, where only several partial observations of objects are available for matching. In this area, deep learning based methods are widely applied to match these partial captured objects caused by occlusions, variations of postures or just partial out of view in person re-identification and partial face recognition. However, most current methods are not able to identify an individual in case that some parts of the object are not obtainable, while the rest are specialized to certain constrained scenarios. To this end, we propose a robust general framework for arbitrary biometric matching scenarios without the limitations of alignment as well as the size of inputs. We introduce a feature post-processing step to handle the feature maps from FCN and a dictionary learning based Spatial Feature Reconstruction (SFR) to match different sized feature maps in this work. Moreover, the batch hard triplet loss function is applied to optimize the model. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by the results from experiments on three person re-identification datasets (Market1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC-reID), two partial person datasets (Partial REID and Partial iLIDS) and two partial face datasets (CASIA-NIR-Distance and Partial LFW), on which state-of-the-art performance is ensured in comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released online and can be found on the website: https://github.com/lingxiao-he/Partial-Person-ReID.
