Creativity and Artificial Intelligence: A Digital Art Perspective

This paper describes the application of artificial intelligence to the creation of digital art. AI is a computational paradigm that codifies intelligence into machines. There are generally three types of artificial intelligence and these are machine learning, evolutionary programming and soft computing. Machine learning is the statistical approach to building intelligent systems. Evolutionary programming is the use of natural evolutionary systems to design intelligent machines. Some of the evolutionary programming systems include genetic algorithm which is inspired by the principles of evolution and swarm optimization which is inspired by the swarming of birds, fish, ants etc. Soft computing includes techniques such as agent based modelling and fuzzy logic. Opportunities on the applications of these to digital art are explored.
