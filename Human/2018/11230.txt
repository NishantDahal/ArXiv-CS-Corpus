A syllogistic system for propositions with intermediate quantifiers

This paper describes a formalism that subsumes Peterson's intermediate quantifier syllogistic system, and extends the ideas by van Eijck on Aristotle's logic. Syllogisms are expressed in a concise form making use of and extending the Monotonicity Calculus. Contradictory and contrary relationships are added so that deduction can derive propositions expressing a form of negation.
