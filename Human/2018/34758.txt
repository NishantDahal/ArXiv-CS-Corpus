A Converse Bound for Cache-Aided Interference Networks

In this paper, an interference network with arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers is studied, where each transmitter is equipped with a finite size cache. We obtain an information-theoretic lower bound on both the peak normalized delivery time (NDT), and the \textit{expected} NDT of cache-aided interference networks with uniform content popularity. For the peak NDT, we show that our lower bound is strictly tighter than the bound in the literature for small cache sizes. Moreover, we show that the feasibility region on the expected NDT is bigger than that of the peak NDT.
