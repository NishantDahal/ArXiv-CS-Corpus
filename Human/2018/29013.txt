A class of repeated-root constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]/\langle u^e\rangle$ of Type $2$

Let $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$ be a finite field of cardinality $p^m$ where $p$ is an odd prime, $n$ be a positive integer satisfying ${\rm gcd}(n,p)=1$, and denote $R=\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]/\langle u^e\rangle$ where $e\geq 4$ be an even integer. Let $δ,α\in \mathbb{F}_{p^m}^{\times}$. Then the class of $(δ+αu^2)$-constacyclic codes over $R$ is a significant subclass of constacyclic codes over $R$ of Type 2. For any integer $k\geq 1$, an explicit representation and a complete description for all distinct $(δ+αu^2)$-constacyclic codes over $R$ of length $np^k$ and their dual codes are given. Moreover, formulas for the number of codewords in each code and the number of all such codes are provided respectively. In particular, all distinct $(δ+αu^2)$-contacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}[u]/\langle u^{e}\rangle$ of length $p^k$ and their dual codes are presented precisely.
