Hierarchical Transfer Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

In this paper, we address the issue of how to enhance the generalization performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the early learning stage for image classification. This is motivated by real-time applications that require the generalization performance of CNN to be satisfactory within limited training time. In order to achieve this, a novel hierarchical transfer CNN framework is proposed. It consists of a group of shallow CNNs and a cloud CNN, where the shallow CNNs are trained firstly and then the first layers of the trained shallow CNNs are used to initialize the first layer of the cloud CNN. This method will boost the generalization performance of the cloud CNN significantly, especially during the early stage of training. Experiments using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets are performed to examine the proposed method. Results demonstrate the improvement of testing accuracy is 12% on average and as much as 20% for the CIFAR-10 case while 5% testing accuracy improvement for the ImageNet case during the early stage of learning. It is also shown that universal improvements of testing accuracy are obtained across different settings of dropout and number of shallow CNNs.
