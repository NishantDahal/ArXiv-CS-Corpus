DeepNeuro: an open-source deep learning toolbox for neuroimaging

Translating neural networks from theory to clinical practice has unique challenges, specifically in the field of neuroimaging. In this paper, we present DeepNeuro, a deep learning framework that is best-suited to putting deep learning algorithms for neuroimaging in practical usage with a minimum of friction. We show how this framework can be used to both design and train neural network architectures, as well as modify state-of-the-art architectures in a flexible and intuitive way. We display the pre- and postprocessing functions common in the medical imaging community that DeepNeuro offers to ensure consistent performance of networks across variable users, institutions, and scanners. And we show how pipelines created in DeepNeuro can be concisely packaged into shareable Docker containers and command-line interfaces using DeepNeuro's pipeline resources.
