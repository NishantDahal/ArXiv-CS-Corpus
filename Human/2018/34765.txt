IoT-Based Secure Embedded Scheme for Insulin Pump Data Acquisition and Monitoring

This paper introduces an Internet of Things (IoT)-based data acquisition and monitoring scheme for insulin pumps. The proposed work employs embedded system hardware (Keil LPC1768-board) for data acquisition and monitoring. The hardware is used as an abstract layer between the insulin pump and the cloud. Diabetes data are secured before they are sent to the cloud for storage. Each patient's record is digitally signed using a secure hash algorithm mechanism. The proposed work will protect the patient's records from being breached from unauthorized entities, and authenticates them from improper modifications. The design is tested and verified using $Î¼$Vision studio, the Keil board mentioned above, and an ALARIS 8100 infusion pump. Moreover, a test case for a real cloud example is presented with the help of the Center of Computationally Assisted System and Technology. This center provided the infrastructure service to test our work.
