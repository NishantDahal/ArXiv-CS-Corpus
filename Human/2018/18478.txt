On error representation in exact-decisions number types

Accuracy-driven computation is a strategy widely used in exact-decisions number types for robust geometric algorithms. This work provides an overview on the usage of error bounds in accuracy-driven computation, compares different approaches on the representation and computation of these error bounds and points out some caveats. The stated claims are supported by experiments.
