Aggregation and Resource Scheduling in Machine-type Communication Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach

Data aggregation is a promising approach to enable massive machine-type communication (mMTC). This paper focuses on the aggregation phase where a massive number of machine-type devices (MTDs) transmit to aggregators. By using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) principles, we allow several MTDs to share the same orthogonal channel in our proposed hybrid access scheme. We develop an analytical framework based on stochastic geometry to investigate the system performance in terms of average success probability and average number of simultaneously served MTDs, under imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the aggregators, for two scheduling schemes: random resource scheduling (RRS) and channel-aware resource scheduling (CRS). We identify the power constraints on the MTDs sharing the same channel to attain a fair coexistence with purely orthogonal multiple access (OMA) setups, then power control coefficients are found so that these MTDs perform with similar reliability. We show that under high access demand, the hybrid scheme with CRS outperforms the OMA setup by simultaneously serving more MTDs with reduced power consumption.
