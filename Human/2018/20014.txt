Fuzzy Galois connections on fuzzy sets

In fairly elementary terms this paper presents how the theory of preordered fuzzy sets, more precisely quantale-valued preorders on quantale-valued fuzzy sets, is established under the guidance of enriched category theory. Motivated by several key results from the theory of quantaloid-enriched categories, this paper develops all needed ingredients purely in order-theoretic languages for the readership of fuzzy set theorists, with particular attention paid to fuzzy Galois connections between preordered fuzzy sets.
