An Overview Of Some Semantic And Syntactic Complexity Classes

We review some semantic and syntactic complexity classes that were introduced to better understand the relationship between complexity classes P and NP. We also define several new complexity classes, some of which are associated with Mersenne numbers, and show their location in the complexity hierarchy.
