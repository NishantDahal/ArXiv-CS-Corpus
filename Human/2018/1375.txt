The Impact of Mobility Model in the Optimal placement of Sensor Nodes in Wireless Body Sensor Network

Power and energy consumption is a fundamental issue in Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) since nodes must operate properly and autonomously for a certain period of time without battery replacement or change. This is due to the fact that the sensors in BSNs are either implanted in the body or are in very near position to the body. Thus, the duration of replacing the batteries should be of utmost importance. Most of the existing researches suggested the development of a more improved battery cells or developing an energy aware routing protocol to tackle the energy consumption in WBSN. But this is not the case as most energy consumption in WBSN occur as a result of mobility in routing and sensor node placement. Therefore, improving the battery cells might not solve the energy consumption in WBSN.
