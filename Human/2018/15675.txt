Another Proof of Cuckoo hashing with New Variants

We show a new proof for the load of obtained by a Cuckoo Hashing data structure. Our proof is arguably simpler than previous proofs and allows for new generalizations. The proof first appeared in Pinkas et. al. \cite{PSWW19} in the context of a protocol for private set intersection. We present it here separately to improve its readability.
