Proceedings 14th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic

This volume contains the proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2017), which was held July 3-7, 2017 at the LUX Cinema Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and was hosted by Radboud University. QPL is a conference that brings together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas, with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to the study of physical behaviour in general. This conference also welcomes work that applies structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields (including computer science).
