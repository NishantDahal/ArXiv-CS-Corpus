Optimal Harvest-or-Transmit Strategy for Energy Harvesting Underlay Cognitive Radio Network

An underlay cognitive radio network with energy harvesting is considered which operates in slotted fashion. The primary user (PU) transmits with a constant power in each slot, while the secondary user (SU) either harvests energy from primary's transmission or transmits its data. We propose an optimal offline harvest-or-transmit strategy where in each slot, SU takes a decision whether to harvest energy or transmit its data limiting interference at the primary receiver. We aim to maximize the achievable rate of SU under energy causality and interference constraints. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program and the optimal harvest-or-transmit policy is obtained using generalized Benders decomposition algorithm. Through simulations, we analyze the effects of various system parameters and interference constraint at the primary receiver on the optimal policy.
