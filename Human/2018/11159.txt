Perspectives of Using Oscillators for Computing and Signal Processing

It is an intriguing concept to use oscillators as fundamental building blocks of electronic computers. The idea is not new, but is currently subject to intense research as a part of the quest for 'beyond Moore' electronic devices. In this paper we give an engineering-minded survey of oscillator-based computing architectures, with the goal of understanding their promise and limitations for next-generation computing. We will mostly discuss non-Boolean, neurally-inspired computing concepts and put the emphasis on hardware and on circuits where the oscillators are realized from emerging, nanoscale building blocks. Despite all the promise that oscillatory computing holds, existing literature gives very few clear-cut arguments about the possible benefits of using oscillators in place of other analog nonlinear circuit elements. In this survey we will argue for finding the rationale of using oscillatory building blocks and call for benchmarking studies that compare oscillatory computing circuits to level-based (analog) implementations.
