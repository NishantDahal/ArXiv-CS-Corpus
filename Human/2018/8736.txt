Fast Optimal Bandwidth Selection for RBF Kernel using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space Operators for Kernel Based Classifiers

Kernel based methods have shown effective performance in many remote sensing classification tasks. However their performance significantly depend on its hyper-parameters. The conventional technique to estimate the parameter comes with high computational complexity. Thus, the objective of this letter is to propose an fast and efficient method to select the bandwidth parameter of the Gaussian kernel in the kernel based classification methods. The proposed method is developed based on the operators in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and it is evaluated on Support vector machines and PerTurbo classification method. Experiments conducted with hyperspectral datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-art method in terms in computational time and classification performance.
