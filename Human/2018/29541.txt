Analytic combinatorics of connected graphs

We enumerate the connected graphs that contain a number of edges growing linearly with respect to the number of vertices. So far, only the first term of the asymptotics and a bound on the error were known. Using analytic combinatorics, ie generating function manipulations, we derive a formula for the coefficients of the complete asymptotic expansion. The same result is derived for connected multigraphs.
