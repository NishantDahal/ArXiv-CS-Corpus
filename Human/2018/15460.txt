Base Station Switch-off with Mutual Repulsion in 5G Massive MIMO Networks

When small cells are densely deployed in the fifth generation (5G) cellular networks, switching off a part of base stations (BSs) is a practical approach for saving energy consumption considering the variation of traffic load. The small cell network with the massive multi-input multi-output (massive MIMO) system is analyzed in this paper due to the dense deployment and low power consumption. Based on the BS switch-off strategy with distance constraints, the energy and coverage efficiency are investigated to illustrate the performance of the BS switch-off strategy. Simulation results indicate that the energy efficiency and coverage efficiency of the proposed strategy are better than the random strategy. The energy efficiency increases with the BS intensity and the minimal distance, and a maximum coverage efficiency can be achieved with the increase of the BS intensity and the minimum distance. In this case, the optimal BS switch-off strategy can be designed under this work in the actual scene.
