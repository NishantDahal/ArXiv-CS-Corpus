New entanglement-assisted MDS quantum codes from constacyclic codes

Construction of good quantum codes via classical codes is an important task for quantum information and quantum computing. In this work, by virtue of a decomposition of the defining set of constacyclic codes we have constructed eight new classes of entanglement-assisted quantum maximum distance separable codes.
