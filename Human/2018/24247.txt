Lightweight Synchronization Algorithm with Self-Calibration for Industrial LORA Sensor Networks

Wireless sensor and actuator networks are gaining momentum in the era of Industrial Internet of Things IIoT. The usage of the close-loop data from sensors in the manufacturing chain is extending the common monitoring scenario of the Wireless Sensors Networks WSN where data were just logged. In this paper we present an accurate timing synchronization for TDMA implemented on the state of art IoT radio, such as LoRa, that is a good solution in industrial environments for its high robustness. Experimental results show how it is possible to modulate the drift correction and keep the synchronization error within the requirements.
