Causal Inference for Early Detection of Pathogenic Social Media Accounts

Pathogenic social media accounts such as terrorist supporters exploit communities of supporters for conducting attacks on social media. Early detection of PSM accounts is crucial as they are likely to be key users in making a harmful message "viral". This paper overviews my recent doctoral work on utilizing causal inference to identify PSM accounts within a short time frame around their activity. The proposed scheme (1) assigns time-decay causality scores to users, (2) applies a community detection-based algorithm to group of users sharing similar causality scores and finally (3) deploys a classification algorithm to classify accounts. Unlike existing techniques that require network structure, cascade path, or content, our scheme relies solely on action log of users.
