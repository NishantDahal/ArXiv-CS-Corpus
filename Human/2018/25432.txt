Generalized Bregman and Jensen divergences which include some f-divergences

In this paper, we introduce new classes of divergences by extending the definitions of the Bregman divergence and the skew Jensen divergence. These new divergence classes (g-Bregman divergence and skew g-Jensen divergence) satisfy some properties similar to the Bregman or skew Jensen divergence. We show these g-divergences include divergences which belong to a class of f-divergence (the Hellinger distance, the chi-square divergence and the alpha-divergence in addition to the Kullback-Leibler divergence). Moreover, we derive an inequality between the g-Bregman divergence and the skew g-Jensen divergence and show this inequality is a generalization of Lin's inequality.
