A Review of Homomorphic Encryption Libraries for Secure Computation

In this paper we provide a survey of various libraries for homomorphic encryption. We describe key features and trade-offs that should be considered while choosing the right approach for secure computation. We then present a comparison of six commonly available Homomorphic Encryption libraries - SEAL, HElib, TFHE, Paillier, ELGamal and RSA across these identified features. Support for different languages and real-life applications are also elucidated.
