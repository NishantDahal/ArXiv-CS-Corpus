Time-Aware and Corpus-Specific Entity Relatedness

Entity relatedness has emerged as an important feature in a plethora of applications such as information retrieval, entity recommendation and entity linking. Given an entity, for instance a person or an organization, entity relatedness measures can be exploited for generating a list of highly-related entities. However, the relation of an entity to some other entity depends on several factors, with time and context being two of the most important ones (where, in our case, context is determined by a particular corpus). For example, the entities related to the International Monetary Fund are different now compared to some years ago, while these entities also may highly differ in the context of a USA news portal compared to a Greek news portal. In this paper, we propose a simple but flexible model for entity relatedness which considers time and entity aware word embeddings by exploiting the underlying corpus. The proposed model does not require external knowledge and is language independent, which makes it widely useful in a variety of applications.
