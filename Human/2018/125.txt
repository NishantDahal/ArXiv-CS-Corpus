A QCA Layout Design Methodology. Part I

Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) as a nanoscale transistor-less device technology offers distinguishing advantages over the limitations of CMOS circuits. While more than 2 decades of design progress have been achieved with QCA, a comprehensive composition approach for the layout design in this technology is needed. In this study, the Priority-Phased Decomposition-Driven (PPDD) QCA logic design methodology is proposed. In this methodology, after partitioning combinational and sequential circuits into primary-level priority blocks including 2:1 MUX and XOR gates, and secondary-level priority blocks comprising multi-input majority gates, there are three streamlined approaches which are developed to compose the desired QCA circuit using blocks from each priority level.
