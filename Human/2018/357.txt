Towards Per-user Flexible Management in 5G

Flexible management is one of the key components of next-generation 5G networks. Currently, many approaches focus on network functionality (services) and translate it afterward into end-user requirements, which slightly constrains the flexibility for both management and end users. Furthermore, moving the intelligence of the network towards the edge (i.e. the users) has already proven its benefits, such as computational offloading, lower latency and higher bandwidth utilization. In this article, we try to move management as close as possible to final users, providing per-user flexibility and unique user to service paths, enabling custom paths adapted for each user requirements instead of users adapting to service requirements. To validate our ideas, we work on two different use cases, implemented as proof-of-concepts in the ONOS platform. From the results obtained we conclude that there is still work to be done regarding the integration of SDN in the radio access and evolved packet core functions to provide the desired flexibility.
