An Average of the Human Ear Canal: Recovering Acoustical Properties via Shape Analysis

Humans are highly dependent on the ability to process audio in order to interact through conversation and navigate from sound. For this, the shape of the ear acts as a mechanical audio filter. The anatomy of the outer human ear canal to approximately 15-20 mm beyond the Tragus is well described because of its importance for customized hearing aid production. This is however not the case for the part of the ear canal that is embedded in the skull, until the typanic membrane. Due to the sensitivity of the outer ear, this part, referred to as the bony part, has only been described in a few population studies and only ex-vivo. We present a study of the entire ear canal including the bony part and the tympanic membrane. We form an average ear canal from a number of MRI scans using standard image registration methods. We show that the obtained representation is realistic in the sense that it has acoustical properties almost identical to a real ear.
