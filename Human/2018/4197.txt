Reshaping Cellular Networks for the Sky: Major Factors and Feasibility

This paper studies the feasibility of supporting drone operations using existent cellular infrastructure. We propose an analytical framework that includes the effects of base station (BS) height and antenna radiation pattern, drone antenna directivity and various propagation environments. With this framework, we derive an exact expression for the coverage probability of ground and drone users through a practical cell association strategy. Our results show that a carefully designed network can control the radiated interference that is received by the drones, and therefore guarantees a satisfactory quality of service. Moreover, as the network density grows the increasing level of interference can be partially managed by lowering the drone flying altitude. However, even at optimal conditions the drone coverage performance converges to zero considerably fast, suggesting that ultra-dense networks might be poor candidates for serving aerial users.
