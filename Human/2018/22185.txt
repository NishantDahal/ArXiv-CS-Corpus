Almost Envy Freeness and Welfare Efficiency in Fair Division with Goods or Bads

We consider two models of fair division with indivisible items: one for goods and one for bads. For goods, we study two generalized envy freeness proxies (EF1 and EFX for goods) and three common welfare (utilitarian, egalitarian and Nash) efficiency notions. For bads, we study two generalized envy freeness proxies (1EF and XEF for goods) and two less common diswelfare (egalitarian and Nash) efficiency notions. Some existing algorithms for goods do not work for bads. We thus propose several new algorithms for the model with bads. Our new algorithms exhibit many nice properties. For example, with additive identical valuations, an allocation that maximizes the egalitarian diswelfare or Nash diswelfare is XEF and PE. Finally, we also give simple and tractable cases when these envy freeness proxies and welfare efficiency are attainable in combination (e.g. binary valuations, house allocations).
