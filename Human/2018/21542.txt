Fooling Polytopes

We give a pseudorandom generator that fools $m$-facet polytopes over $\{0,1\}^n$ with seed length $\mathrm{polylog}(m) \cdot \log n$. The previous best seed length had superlinear dependence on $m$. An immediate consequence is a deterministic quasipolynomial time algorithm for approximating the number of solutions to any $\{0,1\}$-integer program.
