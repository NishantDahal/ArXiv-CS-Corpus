A Novel IoT Architecture based on 5G-IoT and Next Generation Technologies

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a crucial component of Industry 4.0. Due to growing demands of customers, the current IoT architecture will not be reliable and responsive for next generation IoT applications and upcoming services. In this paper, the next generation IoT architecture based on new technologies is proposed in which the requirements of future applications, services, and generated data are addressed. Particularly, this architecture consists of Nano-chip, millimeter Wave (mmWave), Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet), device-todevice (D2D) communication, 5G-IoT, Machine-Type Communication (MTC), Wireless Network Function virtualization (WNFV), Wireless Software Defined Networks (WSDN), Advanced Spectrum Sharing and Interference Management (Advanced SSIM), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Data Analytics and Big Data. This combination of technologies is able to satisfy requirements of new applications. The proposed novel architecture is modular, efficient, agile, scalable, simple, and it is able to satisfy the high amount of data and application demands.
