A tight lower bound for the hardness of clutters

A {\it clutter} (or {\it antichain} or {\it Sperner family}) $L$ is a pair $(V,E)$, where $V$ is a finite set and $E$ is a family of subsets of $V$ none of which is a subset of another. Normally, the elements of $V$ are called {\it vertices} of $L$, and the elements of $E$ are called {\it edges} of $L$. A subset $s_e$ of an edge $e$ of a clutter is {\it recognizing} for $e$, if $s_e$ is not a subset of another edge. The {\it hardness} of an edge $e$ of a clutter is the ratio of the size of $e\textrm{'s}$ smallest recognizing subset to the size of $e$. The hardness of a clutter is the maximum hardness of its edges. In this short note we prove a lower bound for the hardness of an arbitrary clutter. Our bound is asymptotically best-possible in a sense that there is an infinite sequence of clutters attaining our bound.
