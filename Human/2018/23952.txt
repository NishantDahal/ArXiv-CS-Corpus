The Aqualoc Dataset: Towards Real-Time Underwater Localization from a Visual-Inertial-Pressure Acquisition System

This paper presents a new underwater dataset acquired from a visual-inertial-pressure acquisition system and meant to be used to benchmark visual odometry, visual SLAM and multi-sensors SLAM solutions. The dataset is publicly available and contains ground-truth trajectories for evaluation.
