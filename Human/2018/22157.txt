Jumping champions and prime gaps using information-theoretic tools

We study the spacing of the primes using methods from information theory. In information theory, the equivalence of continuous and discrete representations of information is established by Shannon sampling theory. Here, we use Shannon sampling methods to construct continuous functions whose varying bandwidth follows the distribution of the prime numbers. The Fourier transforms of these signals spike at frequently occurring spacings between the primes. We find prominent spikes, in particular, at the primorials. Previously, the primorials have been conjectured to be the most frequent gaps between subsequent primes, the so-called "jumping champions". Here, we find a foreshadowing of the primorial's role as jumping champions in the sense that Fourier spikes for the primorials arise much earlier on the number axis than where the primorials in question are expected to reign as jumping champions.
