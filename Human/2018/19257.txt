Simplified Active Calibration

We present a new mathematical formulation to estimate the intrinsic parameters of a camera in active or robotic platforms. We show that the focal lengths can be estimated using only one point correspondence that relates images taken before and after a degenerate rotation of the camera. The estimated focal lengths are then treated as known parameters to obtain a linear set of equations to calculate the principal point. Assuming that the principal point is close to the image center, the accuracy of the linear equations are increased by integrating the image center into the formulation. We extensively evaluate the formulations on a simulated camera, 3D scenes and real-world images. Our error analysis over simulated and real images indicates that the proposed Simplified Active Calibration method estimates the parameters of a camera with low error rates that can be used as an initial guess for further non-linear refinement procedures. Simplified Active Calibration can be employed in real-time environments for automatic calibrations given the proposed closed-form solutions.
