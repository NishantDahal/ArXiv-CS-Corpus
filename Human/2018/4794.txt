Hybrid Cell Outage Compensation in 5G Networks: Sky-Ground Approach

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enabled communications is a novel and attractive area of research in cellular communications. It provides several degrees of freedom in time, space and it can be used for multiple purposes. This is why wide deployment of UAVs has the potential to be integrated in the upcoming 5G standard. In this paper, we present a novel cell outage compensation (COC) framework to mitigate the effect of the failure of any outdoor Base Station (BS) in 5G networks. Within our framework, the outage compensation is done with the assistance of sky BSs (UAVs) and Ground BSs (GBSs). An optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize the energy of the Drone BSs (DBSs) and GBSs involved in the healing process which accordingly will minimize the number of DBSs and determine their optimal 2D positions. In addition, the DBSs will mainly heal the users that the GBS cannot heal due to capacity issues. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid approach outperforms the conventional COC approach. Moreover, all users receive the minimum quality of service in addition to minimizing the UAVs' consumed energy.
