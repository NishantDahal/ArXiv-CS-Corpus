A Computational Study of the Role of Tonal Tension in Expressive Piano Performance

Expressive variations of tempo and dynamics are an important aspect of music performances, involving a variety of underlying factors. Previous work has showed a relation between such expressive variations (in particular expressive tempo) and perceptual characteristics derived from the musical score, such as musical expectations, and perceived tension. In this work we use a computational approach to study the role of three measures of tonal tension proposed by Herremans and Chew (2016) in the prediction of expressive performances of classical piano music. These features capture tonal relationships of the music represented in Chew's spiral array model, a three dimensional representation of pitch classes, chords and keys constructed in such a way that spatial proximity represents close tonal relationships. We use non-linear sequential models (recurrent neural networks) to assess the contribution of these features to the prediction of expressive dynamics and expressive tempo using a dataset of Mozart piano sonatas performed by a professional concert pianist. Experiments of models trained with and without tonal tension features show that tonal tension helps predict change of tempo and dynamics more than absolute tempo and dynamics values. Furthermore, the improvement is stronger for dynamics than for tempo.
