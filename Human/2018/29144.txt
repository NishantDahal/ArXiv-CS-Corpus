On Natural Deduction for Herbrand Constructive Logics III: The Strange Case of the Intuitionistic Logic of Constant Domains

The logic of constant domains is intuitionistic logic extended with the  so-called forall-shift axiom, a classically valid statement which implies  the excluded middle over decidable formulas. Surprisingly, this logic is constructive and so far this has been proved by  cut-elimination for ad-hoc sequent calculi. Here we use the methods of  natural deduction and Curry-Howard correspondence to provide a simple computational interpretation of the logic.
