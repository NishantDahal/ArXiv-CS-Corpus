A Limitation of V-Matrix based Methods

To estimate the conditional probability functions based on the direct problem setting, V-matrix based method was proposed. We construct V-matrix based constrained quadratic programming problems for which the inequality constraints are inconsistent. In particular, we would like to present that the constrained quadratic optimization problem for conditional probability estimation using V-matrix method may not have a consistent solution always.
