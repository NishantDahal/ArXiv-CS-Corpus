Parity-Check Polar Coding for 5G and Beyond

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Polar coding solution that integrates reliability calculation, rate matching and parity-check coding. Judging a channel coding design from the industry's viewpoint, there are two primary concerns: (i) low-complexity implementation in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and (ii) superior \& stable performance under a wide range of code lengths and rates. The former provides cost- \& power-efficiency which are vital to any commercial system; the latter ensures flexible and robust services. Our design respects both criteria. It demonstrates better performance than existing schemes in literature, but requires only a fraction of implementation cost. With easily-reproducible code construction for arbitrary code rates and lengths, we are able to report "1-bit" fine-granularity simulation results for thousands of cases. The released results can serve as a baseline for future optimization of Polar codes.
