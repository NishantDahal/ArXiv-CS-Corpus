Optimization-in-the-Loop for Energy-Efficient 5G

We consider the problem of energy-efficient network management in 5G systems, where backhaul and fronthaul nodes have both networking and computational capabilities. We devise an optimization model accounting for the main features of 5G backhaul and fronthaul, and jointly solve the problems of (i) node switch on/off, (ii) VNF placement, and (iii) traffic routing. We implement an optimization module within an application on top of an SDN controller and NFV orchestrator, thus enabling swift, high-quality decisions based on current network conditions. Finally, we validate and test our scheme with real-world power consumption, network topology and traffic demand, assessing its performance as well as the relative importance of the main contributions to the total power consumption of the system.
