Exploring Media Bias and Toxicity in South Asian Political Discourse

Media outlets and political campaigners recognise social media as a means for widely disseminating news and opinions. In particular, Twitter is used by political groups all over the world to spread political messages, engage their supporters, drive election campaigns, and challenge their critics. Further, news agencies, many of which aim to give an impression of balance, are often of a particular political persuasion which is reflected in the content they produce. Driven by the potential for political and media organisations to influence public opinion, our aim is to quantify the nature of political discourse by these organisations through their use of social media. In this study, we analyse the sentiments, toxicity, and bias exhibited by the most prominent Pakistani and Indian political parties and media houses, and the pattern by which these political parties utilise Twitter. We found that media bias and toxicity exist in the political discourse of these two developing nations.
