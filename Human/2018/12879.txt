Realistic Multimedia Tools based on Physical Models: II. The Binary 3D Renderer (B3dR)

The present article reports on the second tool of a custom-built toolkit intended to train astronomers into simulating and visualizing the composite 3D structure of winds from hot close double stars by implementing a technique which is similar to multi-directional medical tomography. The flagships of the toolkit are the Spectrum Analyzer and Animator (SA 2 ) and the Binary 3D Renderer (B3dR). Following application of the first tool, SA 2 as detailed in paper I, the composite wind structure of the binary has been recovered and the B3dR is subsequently employed to visualize the results and simulate the revolution of the entire system (stars, winds and wind-interaction effects) around the common centre of mass. The B3dR thus repackages the end product of a lengthy physical modeling process to generate realistic multimedia content and enable the presentation of the 3D system from the point of view of an observer on Earth as well as from any other observer location in the Galaxy.
