Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Uniform Interpolation

In [7] and [8], Iemhoff introduced a connection between the existence of a terminating sequent calculi of a certain kind and the uniform interpolation property of the super-intuitionistic logic that the calculus captures. In this paper, we will generalize this relationship to also cover the substructural setting on the one hand and a much more powerful class of rules on the other. The resulted relationship then provides a uniform method to establish uniform interpolation property for the logics $\mathbf{FL_e}$, $\mathbf{FL_{ew}}$, $\mathbf{CFL_e}$, $\mathbf{CFL_{ew}}$, $\mathbf{IPC}$, $\mathbf{CPC}$ and their $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{KD}$-type modal extensions. More interestingly though, on the negative side, we will show that no extension of $\mathbf{FL_e}$ can enjoy a certain natural type of terminating sequent calculus unless it has the uniform interpolation property. It excludes almost all super-intutionistic logics and the logics $\mathbf{K4}$ and $\mathbf{S4}$ from having such a reasonable calculus.
