Binary Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm for One-bit Compressed Sensing

In this letter, a binary sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) algorithm is proposed to slove the one-bit compressed sensing (CS) problem in both single measurement vector (SMV) and multiple measurement vectors (MMVs). By utilising the Bussgang-like decomposition, the one-bit CS problem can be approximated as a standard linear model. Consequently, the standard SBL algorithm can be naturally incorporated. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BSBL algorithm.
