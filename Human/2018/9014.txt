A web service based on RESTful API and JSON Schema/JSON Meta Schema to construct knowledge graphs

Data visualisation assists domain experts in understanding their data and helps them make critical decisions. Enhancing their cognitive insight essentially relies on the capability of combining domain-specific semantic information with concepts extracted out of the data and visualizing the resulting networks. Data scientists have the challenge of providing tools able to handle the overall network lifecycle. In this paper, we present how the combination of two powerful technologies namely the REST architecture style and JSON Schema/JSON Meta Schema enable data scientists to use a RESTful web service that permits the construction of knowledge graphs, one of the preferred representations of large and semantically rich networks.
