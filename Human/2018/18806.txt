Methodic of joint using the tools of automation of lexical and parsing analysis in the process of teaching the programming theory of future informatics teachers

The place and role of parsing analysis in formation of professional informatics competences of future informatics teachers is determined. Separated automation tools for lexical (lex) and syntax (yacc) analysis invariant to the programming language used. The expediency of using functional programming languages Scheme and SML is shown for learning how to develop compilers in the course of programming theory. The example of the MosML dialect illustrates the main components of the methodic of joint using the tools of automation of lexical and parsing analysis in the process of teaching the programming theory of future informatics teachers. The main conclusions and recommendations: 1) the considered example of the expanded calculator can be refined by changing the grammar, in particular - for the introduction of conditional and cyclic constructions; 2) the proposed scheme can be used to implement the interpreter of any formal language with an arbitrary typing method - the appropriate examples of study will be subsets of procedural languages Basic and C and functional languages Scheme and SML: provided the addition of the machine code generation phase, this provides an opportunity to demonstrate the full development cycle for programming language compiler.
