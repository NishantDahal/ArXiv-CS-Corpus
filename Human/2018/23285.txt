A Note on Spectral Clustering and SVD of Graph Data

Spectral clustering and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are both widely used technique for analyzing graph data. In this note, I will present their connections using simple linear algebra, aiming to provide some in-depth understanding for future research.
