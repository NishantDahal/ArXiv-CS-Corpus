The Effective Geometry Monte Carlo Algorithm: Applications to Molecular Communication

In this work, we address the systematic biases and random errors stemming from finite step sizes encountered in diffusion simulations. We introduce the Effective Geometry Monte Carlo (EG-MC) simulation algorithm which modifies the geometry of the receiver. We motivate our approach in a 1D toy model and then apply our findings to a spherical absorbing receiver in a 3D unbounded environment. We show that with minimal computational cost, the impulse response of this receiver can be precisely simulated using EG-MC. Afterwards, we demonstrate the accuracy of our simulations and give tight constraints on the single free parameter in EG-MC. Finally, we comment on the range of applicability of our results. While we present the EG-MC algorithm for the specific case of molecular diffusion, we believe that analogous methods with effective geometry manipulations can be utilized to approach a variety of problems in other branches of physics such as condensed matter physics and cosmological large scale structure simulations.
