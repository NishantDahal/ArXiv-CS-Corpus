Opportunistic Scheduling in Underlay Cognitive Radio based Systems: User Selection Probability Analysis

In this paper, an underlay cognitive radio (CR) system is considered with multiple cognitive or secondary users contending to transmit their information to the cognitive destination (e.g., eNodeB) using the spectral resource of a primary user. The novel closed-form expressions are derived for the selection probabilities of cognitive users with opportunistic scheduling wherein an optimal metric is employed for opportunistic transmission. The analytical results corroborated by the Monte Carlo simulations, can be used to demonstrate the fairness achieved in opportunistic scheduling. It is shown that the fairness in terms of equal chance for transmission amongst all cognitive users can only be seen for the scenarios when the fraction of distances between the cognitive transmitter and cognitive receiver, and cognitive transmitter and primary receiver is identical for each of the cognitive transmitters.
