D2.3 Power models, energy models and libraries for energy-efficient concurrent data structures and algorithms

This deliverable reports the results of the power models, energy models and libraries for energy-efficient concurrent data structures and algorithms as available by project month 30 of Work Package 2 (WP2). It reports i) the latest results of Task 2.2-2.4 on providing programming abstractions and libraries for developing energy-efficient data structures and algorithms and ii) the improved results of Task 2.1 on investigating and modeling the trade-off between energy and performance of concurrent data structures and algorithms. The work has been conducted on two main EXCESS platforms: Intel platforms with recent Intel multicore CPUs and Movidius Myriad platforms.
