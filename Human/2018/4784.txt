A Neuronal Planar Modeling for Handwriting Signature based on Automatic Segmentation

This paper deals with offline handwriting signature verification.We propose a planar neuronal model of signature image. Planarmodelsare generally based on delimiting homogenous zones ofimages; we propose in this paper an automatic segmentationapproach into bands of signature images. Signature image ismodeled by a planar neuronal model with horizontal secondarymodels and a verticalprincipal model. The proposed methodhas been tested on two databases. The first is the one we havecollected; it includes 6000 signaturescorresponding to 60writers. The second is the public GPDS-300 database including16200 signature corresponding to 300 persons. The achievedresults are promising.
