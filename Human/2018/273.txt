Received Signal Strength for Randomly Distributed Molecular Nanonodes

We consider nanonodes randomly distributed in a circular area and characterize the received signal strength when a pair of these nodes employ molecular communication. Two communication methods are investigated, namely free diffusion and diffusion with drift. Since the nodes are randomly distributed, the distance between them can be represented as a random variable, which results in a stochastic process representation of the received signal strength. We derive the probability density function of this process for both molecular communication methods. Specifically for the case of free diffusion we also derive the cumulative distribution function, which can be used to derive transmission success probabilities. The presented work constitutes a first step towards the characterization of the signal to noise ratio in the considered setting for a number of molecular communication methods.
