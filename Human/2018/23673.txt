Computing with P Systems

P systems are computing conceptual computing devices that are at least as powerful as Turing machines. However, until recently it was not known how one can encode any recursive function as a P~system. Here we propose a new encoding of recursive as P~systems with graph-like structure, which is the main difference with previous documented attempts. The consequence of this and other such efforts is that they provide a solid ground for the implementation of real programming languages in existing hardware.
