Low Complexity Secure Code (LCSC) Design for Big Data in Cloud Storage Systems

In the era of big data, reducing the computational complexity of servers in data centers will be an important goal. We propose Low Complexity Secure Codes (LCSCs) that are specifically designed to provide information theoretic security in cloud distributed storage systems. Unlike traditional coding schemes that are designed for error correction capabilities, these codes are only designed to provide security with low decoding complexity. These sparse codes are able to provide (asymptotic) perfect secrecy similar to Shannon cipher. The simultaneous promise of low decoding complexity and perfect secrecy make these codes very desirable for cloud storage systems with large amount of data. The design is particularly suitable for large size archival data such as movies and pictures. The complexity of these codes are compared with traditional encryption techniques.
