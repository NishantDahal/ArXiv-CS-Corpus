End-to-end Multimodal Emotion and Gender Recognition with Dynamic Joint Loss Weights

Multi-task learning is a method for improving the generalizability of multiple tasks. In order to perform multiple classification tasks with one neural network model, the losses of each task should be combined. Previous studies have mostly focused on multiple prediction tasks using joint loss with static weights for training models, choosing the weights between tasks without making sufficient considerations by setting them uniformly or empirically. In this study, we propose a method to calculate joint loss using dynamic weights to improve the total performance, instead of the individual performance, of tasks. We apply this method to design an end-to-end multimodal emotion and gender recognition model using audio and video data. This approach provides proper weights for the loss of each task when the training process ends. In our experiments, emotion and gender recognition with the proposed method yielded a lower joint loss, which is computed as the negative log-likelihood, than using static weights for joint loss. Moreover, our proposed model has better generalizability than other models. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to demonstrate the strength of using dynamic weights for joint loss for maximizing overall performance in emotion and gender recognition tasks.
