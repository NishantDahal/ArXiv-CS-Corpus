Swarm Robots Inspired by Friendship Formation Process

Swarm robotic systems are systems in which multiple robots having simple functionality perform tasks through their cooperation, and are advantageous in that they can exhibit non-trivial macroscopic functions such as adaptability, fault tolerance, and scalability. We previously proposed a simple model of swarm formation inspired by friendship formation process in human society, and demonstrated via simulation that various non-trivial patterns emerge. In this study, we examine the applicability of the proposed model to a swarm robotic system. As a first step, we developed five robots and demonstrated via real-world experiments that the simulation results can be largely reproduced.
