Pluralize: a Trustworthy Framework for High-Level Smart Contract-Draft

The paper presents Pluralize a formal logical framework able to extend the execution of blockchain transactions to events coming from external oracles, like external time, sensor data, human-made declarations, etc. These events are by essence non-reliable, since transaction execution can be triggered by information whose veracity cannot be established by the blockchain. To overcome this problem, the language features a first-order logic and an authority algebra to allow formal reasoning and establish accountability of agents for blockchain-enabled transactions. We provide an accountability model that allows to formally prove the accountability of agents by a formal proof locally executable by each agent of the blockchain.
