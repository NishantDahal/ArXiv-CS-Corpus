An Automated System for Checking Lithography Friendliness of Standard Cells

At advanced process nodes, lithography weakpoints can exist in physical layouts of integrated circuit designs even if the layouts pass design rule checking (DRC). Existence of lithography weakpoints in a physical layout can cause manufacturability issues, which in turn can result in yield losses. In our experiments, we have found that specific standard cells have tendencies to create lithography weakpoints after their cell instances are placed and routed, even though each of these cells does not contain any lithography weakpoint before performing placement and routing. In addition, our experiments have shown that abutted standard cell instances can induce lithography weakpoints. Therefore, in this paper, we propose methodologies that are used in a novel software system for checking standard cells in terms of the aforementioned lithography issues. Specifically, the software system is capable of detecting and sorting problematic standard cells which are prone to generate lithography weakpoints, as well as reporting standard cells that should not be abutted. Methodologies proposed in this paper allow us to reduce or even prevent the generation of undesirable lithography weakpoints during the physical synthesis phase of designing a digital integrated circuit.
