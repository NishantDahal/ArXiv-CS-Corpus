"Why Should I Trust Interactive Learners?" Explaining Interactive Queries of Classifiers to Users

Although interactive learning puts the user into the loop, the learner remains mostly a black box for the user. Understanding the reasons behind queries and predictions is important when assessing how the learner works and, in turn, trust. Consequently, we propose the novel framework of explanatory interactive learning: in each step, the learner explains its interactive query to the user, and she queries of any active classifier for visualizing explanations of the corresponding predictions. We demonstrate that this can boost the predictive and explanatory powers of and the trust into the learned model, using text (e.g. SVMs) and image classification (e.g. neural networks) experiments as well as a user study.
