Fast Node Cardinality Estimation and Cognitive MAC Protocol Design for Heterogeneous Machine-to-Machine Networks

Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks are an emerging technology with applications in numerous areas including smart grids, smart cities, vehicular telematics, and healthcare. In this paper, we design two estimation protocols for rapidly obtaining separate estimates of the number of active nodes of each traffic type in a heterogeneous M2M network with $T$ types of M2M nodes (e.g., those that send emergency, periodic, normal type data etc), where $T \geq 2$ is an arbitrary integer. One of these protocols, Method I, is a simple scheme, and the other, Method II, is more sophisticated and performs better than Method I. Also, we design a medium access control (MAC) protocol that supports multi-channel operation for a heterogeneous M2M network with an arbitrary number of types of M2M nodes, operating as a secondary network using Cognitive Radio technology. Our Cognitive MAC protocol uses the proposed node cardinality estimation protocols to rapidly estimate the number of active nodes of each type in every time frame; these estimates are used to find the optimal contention probabilities to be used in the MAC protocol. We compute a closed form expression for the expected number of time slots required by Method I to execute as well as a simple upper bound on it. Also, we mathematically analyze the performance of the Cognitive MAC protocol and obtain expressions for the expected number of successful contentions per frame and the expected amount of energy consumed. Finally, we evaluate the performances of our proposed estimation protocols and Cognitive MAC protocol using simulations.
