A notion of stability for k-means clustering

In this paper, we define and study a new notion of stability for the $k$-means clustering scheme building upon the notion of quantization of a probability measure. We connect this notion of stability to a geometric feature of the underlying distribution of the data, named absolute margin condition, inspired by recent works on the subject.
