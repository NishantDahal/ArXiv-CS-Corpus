A Taxonomy of Malicious Traffic for Intrusion Detection Systems

With the increasing number of network threats it is essential to have a knowledge of existing and new network threats in order to design better intrusion detection systems. In this paper we propose a taxonomy for classifying network attacks in a consistent way, allowing security researchers to focus their efforts on creating accurate intrusion detection systems and targeted datasets.
