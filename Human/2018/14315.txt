The Internet of Things: Secure Distributed Inference

The growth in the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) poses major challenges in security. The integrity and trustworthiness of data and data analytics are increasingly important concerns in IoT applications. These are compounded by the highly distributed nature of IoT devices, making it infeasible to prevent attacks and intrusions on all data sources. Adversaries may hijack devices and compromise their data. As a result, reactive countermeasures, such as intrusion detection and resilient analytics, become vital components of security. This paper overviews algorithms for secure distributed inference in IoT.
