A Novel Indoor Mobile Localization System Based on Optical Camera Communication

Localizing smartphones in indoor environments offers excellent opportunities for e-commerce. In this paper, we propose a localization technique for smartphones in indoor environments. This technique can calculate the coordinates of a smartphone using existing illumination infrastructure with light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The system can locate smartphones without further modification of the existing LED light infrastructure. Smartphones do not have fixed position and they may move frequently anywhere in an environment. Our algorithm uses multiple (i.e., more than two) LED lights simultaneously. The smartphone gets the LED-IDs from the LED lights that are within the field of view (FOV) of the smartphone's camera. These LED-IDs contain the coordinate information of the LED lights. Concurrently, the pixel area on the image sensor (IS) of projected image changes with the relative motion between the smartphone and each LED light which allows the algorithm to calculate the distance from the smartphone to that LED.
