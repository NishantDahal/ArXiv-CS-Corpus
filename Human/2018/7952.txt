Age-Optimal Trajectory Planning for UAV-Assisted Data Collection

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided data collection is a new and promising application in many practical scenarios. In this work, we study the age-optimal trajectory planning problem in UAV-enabled wireless sensor networks, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from the ground sensor nodes (SNs). The age of information (AoI) collected from each SN is characterized by the data uploading time and the time elapsed since the UAV leaves this SN. We attempt to design two age-optimal trajectories, referred to as the Max-AoI-optimal and Ave-AoI-optimal trajectories, respectively. The Max-AoI-optimal trajectory planning is to minimize the age of the `oldest' sensed information among the SNs. The Ave-AoI-optimal trajectory planning is to minimize the average AoI of all the SNs. Then, we show that each age-optimal flight trajectory corresponds to a shortest Hamiltonian path in the wireless sensor network where the distance between any two SNs represents the amount of inter-visit time. The dynamic programming (DP) method and genetic algorithm (GA) are adopted to find the two different age-optimal trajectories. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and show how the UAV's trajectory is affected by the two AoI metrics.
