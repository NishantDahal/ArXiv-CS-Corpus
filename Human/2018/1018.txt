Breaking Mignotte's Sequence Based Secret Sharing Scheme Using SMT Solver

The secret sharing schemes are the important tools in cryptography that are used as building blocks in many secured protocols. It is a method used for distributing a secret among the participants in a manner that only the threshold number of participants together can recover the secret and the remaining set of participants cannot get any information about the secret. Secret sharing schemes are absolute for storing highly sensitive and important information. In a secret sharing scheme, a secret is divided into several shares. These shares are then distributed to the participants one each and thus only the threshold (t) number of participants can recover the secret. In this paper we have used Mignotte's Sequence based Secret Sharing for distribution of shares to the participants. A (k, m) Mignotte's sequence is a sequence of pair wise co-prime positive integers. We have proposed a new method for reconstruction of secret even with t-1 shares using the SMT solver.
