Effect of correlations on routing and modeling of Time Varying Communication Networks

Most of the real world networks are complex as well as evolving. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of network topology on the dynamics of traffic and congestion in the network. To account this problem, we have designed a time-varying network model where a new node will join a node in the existing network with probability proportional to its degree and disassortativity with its neighbors. Betweenness centrality (BC) plays an important role to find the influential node and user's shortest route in the network. As shortest route comprised of hub nodes and chances of congestion is more on these nodes. Hence, BC-BC correlation is used to find user's route. A connection between two hub nodes reduces the data forwarding capacity of connecting link with higher probability. If a node shows disassortativity with its neighbors then it may forward more packets and may be chosen for routing. Furthermore, user's optimal data sending rate as well as critical packet generation rate of the proposed model is calculated and shown improved results in comparison than the classical scale-free network model.
