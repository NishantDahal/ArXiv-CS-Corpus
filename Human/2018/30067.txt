Investigation of Nonlinear Communication Channel with Small Dispersion via Stochastic Correlator Approach

We consider the optical fiber channel modelled by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with additive white Gaussian noise and with large signal-to-noise ratio. For the small dispersion case we present the approach to analyze the stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Taking into account the averaging procedure (frequency filtering) of the output signal detector we find the first corrections in small dispersion parameter to the correlators of the input signal recovered by the backward propagation. These correlators are the important ingredients for the calculation of the channel capacity and the optimal input signal distribution. We assert that the information channel characteristics essentially depend on the procedures of the output signal filtering and the recovery of the transmitted signal.
