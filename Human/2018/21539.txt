An Entropy Analysis based Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Network in Vehicles

Dozens of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can be found on modern vehicles for safety and driving assistance. These ECUs also introduce new security vulnerabilities as recent attacks have been reported by plugging the in-vehicle system or through wireless access. In this paper, we focus on the security of the Controller Area Network (CAN), which is a standard for communication among ECUs. CAN bus by design does not have sufficient security features to protect it from insider or outsider attacks. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most effective ways to enhance vehicle security on the insecure CAN bus protocol. We propose a new IDS based on the entropy of the identifier bits in CAN messages. The key observation is that all the known CAN message injection attacks need to alter the CAN ID bits and analyzing the entropy of such bits can be an effective way to detect those attacks. We collected real CAN messages from a vehicle (2016 Ford Fusion) and performed simulated message injection attacks. The experimental results showed that our entropy based IDS can successfully detect all the injection attacks without disrupting the communication on CAN.
