A Verifiable Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme for Cloud Computing Security

Performing smart computations in a context of cloud computing and big data is highly appreciated today. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a smart category of encryption schemes that allows working with the data in its encrypted form. It permits us to preserve confidentiality of our sensible data and to benefit from cloud computing powers. Currently, it has been demonstrated by many existing schemes that the theory is feasible but the efficiency needs to be dramatically improved in order to make it usable for real applications. One subtle difficulty is how to efficiently handle the noise. This paper aims to introduce an efficient and verifiable FHE based on a new mathematic structure that is noise free.
