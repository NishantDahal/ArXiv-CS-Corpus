Une approche pour mieux appr{é}hender l'alt{é}rit{é} en SIC

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims: to facilitate the building of teams relying on notions of skills, of motivation or of potential; identify the requested upgrade effort to improve his own knowledge and join a team; or create more suitable devices for a target population. The whole forms a toolbox that seems appropriate to facilitate better recognition of otherness.
