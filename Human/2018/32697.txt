A 0.086-mm$^2$ 12.7-pJ/SOP 64k-Synapse 256-Neuron Online-Learning Digital Spiking Neuromorphic Processor in 28nm CMOS

Shifting computing architectures from von Neumann to event-based spiking neural networks (SNNs) uncovers new opportunities for low-power processing of sensory data in applications such as vision or sensorimotor control. Exploring roads toward cognitive SNNs requires the design of compact, low-power and versatile experimentation platforms with the key requirement of online learning in order to adapt and learn new features in uncontrolled environments. However, embedding online learning in SNNs is currently hindered by high incurred complexity and area overheads. In this work, we present ODIN, a 0.086-mm$^2$ 64k-synapse 256-neuron online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor in 28nm FDSOI CMOS achieving a minimum energy per synaptic operation (SOP) of 12.7pJ. It leverages an efficient implementation of the spike-driven synaptic plasticity (SDSP) learning rule for high-density embedded online learning with only 0.68$Î¼$m$^2$ per 4-bit synapse. Neurons can be independently configured as a standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model or as a custom phenomenological model that emulates the 20 Izhikevich behaviors found in biological spiking neurons. Using a single presentation of 6k 16$\times$16 MNIST training images to a single-layer fully-connected 10-neuron network with on-chip SDSP-based learning, ODIN achieves a classification accuracy of 84.5% while consuming only 15nJ/inference at 0.55V using rank order coding. ODIN thus enables further developments toward cognitive neuromorphic devices for low-power, adaptive and low-cost processing.
