Using Inclusion Diagrams as an Alternative to Venn Diagrams to Determine the Validity of Categorical Syllogisms

Inclusion diagrams are introduced as an alternative to using Venn diagrams to determine the validity of categorical syllogisms, and are used here for the analysis of diverse categorical syllogisms. As a preliminary example of a possible generalization of the use of inclusion diagrams, consideration is given also to an argument that includes more than two premises and more than three terms, the classic major, middle and minor terms in categorical syllogisms.
