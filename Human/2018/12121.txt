Enabling Cross-Event Optimization in Discrete-Event Simulation Through Compile-Time Event Batching

A discrete-event simulation (DES) involves the execution of a sequence of event handlers dynamically scheduled at runtime. As a consequence, a priori knowledge of the control flow of the overall simulation program is limited. In particular, powerful optimizations supported by modern compilers can only be applied on the scope of individual event handlers, which frequently involve only a few lines of code. We propose a method that extends the scope for compiler optimizations in discrete-event simulations by generating batches of multiple events that are subjected to compiler optimizations as contiguous procedures. A runtime mechanism executes suitable batches at negligible overhead. Our method does not require any compiler extensions and introduces only minor additional effort during model development. The feasibility and potential performance gains of the approach are illustrated on the example of an idealized proof-ofconcept model. We believe that the applicability of the approach extends to general event-driven programs.
