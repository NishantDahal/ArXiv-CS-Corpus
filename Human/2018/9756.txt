Multimodal Registration of Retinal Images Using Domain-Specific Landmarks and Vessel Enhancement

The analysis of different image modalities is frequently performed in ophthalmology as it provides complementary information for the diagnosis and follow-up of relevant diseases, like hypertension or diabetes. This work presents a hybrid method for the multimodal registration of color fundus retinography and fluorescein angiography. The proposed method combines a feature-based approach, using domain-specific landmarks, with an intensity-based approach that employs a domain-adapted similarity metric. The methodology is tested on a dataset of 59 image pairs containing both healthy and pathological cases. The results show a satisfactory performance of the proposed combined approach in this multimodal scenario, improving the registration accuracy achieved by the feature-based and the intensity-based approaches.
