Bounds and Constructions for Multi-Symbol Duplication Error Correcting Codes

In this paper, we study codes correcting $t$ duplications of $\ell$ consecutive symbols. These errors are known as tandem duplication errors, where a sequence of symbols is repeated and inserted directly after its original occurrence. Using sphere packing arguments, we derive non-asymptotic upper bounds on the cardinality of codes that correct such errors for any choice of parameters. Based on the fact that a code correcting insertions of $t$ zero-blocks can be used to correct $t$ tandem duplications, we construct codes for tandem duplication errors. We compare the cardinalities of these codes with their sphere packing upper bounds. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the derived codes and bounds, which yields insights about the tandem duplication channel.
