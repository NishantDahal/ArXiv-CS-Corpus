Developing a K-ary malware using Blockchain

Cyberattacks are nowadays moving rapidly. They are customized, multi-vector, staged in multiple flows and targeted. Moreover, new hacking playgrounds appeared to reach mobile network, modern architectures and smart cities. For that purpose, malware use different entry points and plug-ins. In addition, they are now deploying several techniques for obfuscation, camouflage and analysis resistance. On the other hand, antiviral protections are positioning innovative approaches exposing malicious indicators and anomalies, revealing assumptions of the limitations of the anti-antiviral mechanisms. Primarily, this paper exposes a state of art in computer virology and then introduces a new concept to create undetectable malware based on the blockchain technology. It summarizes techniques adopted by malicious software to avoid functionalities implemented for viral detection and presents the implementation of new viral techniques that leverage the blockchain network.
