AuthStore: Password-based Authentication and Encrypted Data Storage in Untrusted Environments

Passwords are widely used for client to server authentication as well as for encrypting data stored in untrusted environments, such as cloud storage. Both, authentication and encrypted cloud storage, are usually discussed in isolation. In this work, we propose AuthStore, a flexible authentication framework that allows users to securely reuse passwords for authentication as well as for encrypted cloud storage at a single or multiple service providers. Users can configure how secure passwords are protected using password stretching techniques. We present a compact password-authenticated key exchange protocol (CompactPAKE) that integrates the retrieval of password stretching parameters. A parameter attack is described and we show how existing solutions suffer from this attack. Furthermore, we introduce a password manager that supports CompactPAKE.
