Local Articulation Points in Complex Networks

An articulation point (AP) is any node whose removal increases the number of connected components of a graph. There is no doubt that this kind of node which occupies a non-ignorable fraction of real-world networks plays a key role in ensuring the connectivity. However, we should not thus neglect the impacts of non-APs nodes. In this paper, we define a local AP (LAP) whose removal will increase the number of connected components within its r-step neighborhood. Through investigating the fraction of LAPs in forty-five real networks, we find a critical proportion s_cr, which is equal to 0.5 (s=r/D, D is the diameter of a network), and this result can also be turned out in ER networks. In addition, we present a unique advantage of LAPs in dismantling networks under the process of targeted attack, compared with APs, which provide another way of thinking to improve the calculation efficiency of APs and design better-targeted attack strategy of network destruction.
