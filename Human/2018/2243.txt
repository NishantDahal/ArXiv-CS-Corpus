Fast and robust misalignment correction of Fourier ptychographic microscopy

Fourier ptychographi cmicroscopy(FPM) is a newly developed computational imaging technique that can provide gigapixel images with both high resolution (HR) and wide field of view (FOV). However, the positional misalignment of the LED array induces a degradation of the reconstruction, especially in the regions away from the optical axis. In this paper, we propose a robust and fast method to correct the LED misalignment of FPM, termed as misalignment correction for FPM (mcFPM). Although different regions in the FOV have different sensitivity to the LED misalignment, the experimental results show that mcFPM is robust to eliminate the degradation in each region. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, mcFPM is much faster.
