Creating New Language and Voice Components for the Updated MaryTTS Text-to-Speech Synthesis Platform

We present a new workflow to create components for the MaryTTS text-to-speech synthesis platform, which is popular with researchers and developers, extending it to support new languages and custom synthetic voices. This workflow replaces the previous toolkit with an efficient, flexible process that leverages modern build automation and cloud-hosted infrastructure. Moreover, it is compatible with the updated MaryTTS architecture, enabling new features and state-of-the-art paradigms such as synthesis based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Like MaryTTS itself, the new tools are free, open source software (FOSS), and promote the use of open data.
