A Novel A Priori Simulation Algorithm for Absorbing Receivers in Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Systems

A novel a priori Monte Carlo (APMC) algorithm is proposed to accurately simulate the molecules absorbed at spherical receiver(s) with low computational complexity in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems. It is demonstrated that the APMC algorithm achieves high simulation efficiency since by using this algorithm, the fraction of molecules absorbed for a relatively large time step length precisely matches the analytical result. Therefore, the APMC algorithm overcomes the shortcoming of the existing refined Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm which enables accurate simulation for a relatively small time step length only. Moreover, for the RMC algorithm, an expression is proposed to quickly predict the simulation accuracy as a function of the time step length and system parameters, which facilitates the choice of simulation time step for a given system. Furthermore, a rejection threshold is proposed for both the RMC and APMC algorithms to significantly save computational complexity while causing an extremely small loss in accuracy.
