Revisiting the generalized Łoś-Tarski theorem

We present a new proof of the generalized Łoś-Tarski theorem ($\mathsf{GLT}(k)$) introduced in [1], over arbitrary structures. Instead of using $λ$-saturation as in [1], we construct just the "required saturation" directly using ascending chains of structures. We also strengthen the failure of $\mathsf{GLT}(k)$ in the finite shown in [2], by strengthening the failure of the Łoś-Tarski theorem in this context. In particular, we prove that not just universal sentences, but for each fixed $k$, even $Σ^0_2$ sentences containing $k$ existential quantifiers fail to capture hereditariness in the finite. We conclude with two problems as future directions, concerning the Łoś-Tarski theorem and $\mathsf{GLT}(k)$, both in the context of all finite structures.
