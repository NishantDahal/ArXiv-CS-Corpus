English-Catalan Neural Machine Translation in the Biomedical Domain through the cascade approach

This paper describes the methodology followed to build a neural machine translation system in the biomedical domain for the English-Catalan language pair. This task can be considered a low-resourced task from the point of view of the domain and the language pair. To face this task, this paper reports experiments on a cascade pivot strategy through Spanish for the neural machine translation using the English-Spanish SCIELO and Spanish-Catalan El Peri√≥dico database. To test the final performance of the system, we have created a new test data set for English-Catalan in the biomedical domain which is freely available on request.
