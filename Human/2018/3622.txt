On Decision Support for Remote Industrial Facilities using the Collaborative Engineering Framework

Means to support collaboration for remote industrial facilities such as mining are an important topic, especially in Australia, where major mining sites can be more than a thousand kilometers from population centres. Software-based collaboration and maintenance solutions can help to reduce costs associated with these remote facilities. In this paper, we report on our collaborative engineering project providing a decision support solution tailored for Australian needs. We present two application examples: one related to incident handling in industrial automation, the other one in the area of smart energy systems.
