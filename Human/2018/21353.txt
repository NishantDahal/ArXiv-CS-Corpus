A prototypical Skin Cancer Information System

Skin cancer is a common problem in Australia and indeed around the world. Within the domain of e-Health, there appears to be no satisfactory clinical software that follows the flow of a normal skin cancer examination. This paper introduces a system that was specifically designed, coded and implemented to store patient health records as a means of registering the diagnoses of skin cancer along with the treatment. The information system was intended to be web-based, and connect to remote database servers. The implemented system was designed to incorporate features such as inserting procedural details, generating forms and reports with interactive interfaces, yet be relatively unsophisticated to use. We expect the system once fully implemented and on line, will aid in Australia's e-Health industry, delivering more accurate information to doctors and patients in an effort to combat issues involving skin cancer. Other parameters discussed are the need for data encryption of medical records and the role such a system can play in medical information.
