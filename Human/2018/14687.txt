When Is the Achievable Rate Region Convex in Two-User Massive MIMO Systems?

This letter investigates the achievable rate region in Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with two users, with focus on the i.i.d.~Rayleigh fading and line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios. If the rate region is convex, spatial multiplexing is preferable to orthogonal scheduling, while the opposite is true for non-convex regions. We prove that the uplink and downlink rate regions with i.i.d.~Rayleigh fading are convex, while the convexity in LoS depends on parameters such as angular user separation, number of antennas, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
