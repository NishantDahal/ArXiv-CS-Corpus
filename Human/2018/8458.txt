Short Term Electric Load Forecast with Artificial Neural Networks

This paper presents issues regarding short term electric load forecasting using feedforward and Elman recurrent neural networks. The study cases were developed using measured data representing electrical energy consume from Banat area. There were considered 35 different types of structure for both feedforward and recurrent network cases. For each type of neural network structure were performed many trainings and best solution was selected. The issue of forecasting the load on short term is essential in the effective energetic consume management in an open market environment.
