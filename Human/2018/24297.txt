Dushnik-Miller dimension of d-dimensional tilings with boxes

Planar graphs are the graphs with Dushnik-Miller dimension at most three (W. Schnyder, Planar graphs and poset dimension, Order 5, 323-343, 1989). Consider the intersection graph of interior disjoint axis parallel rectangles in the plane. It is known that if at most three rectangles intersect on a point, then this intersection graph is planar, that is it has Dushnik-Miller dimension at most three. This paper aims at generalizing this from the plane to $R^d$ by considering tilings of $R^d$ with axis parallel boxes, where at most $d+1$ boxes intersect on a point. Such tilings induce simplicial complexes and we will show that those simplicial complexes have Dushnik-Miller dimension at most $d+1$.
