VECTORS: Video communication through opportunistic relays and scalable video coding

Crowd-sourced video distribution is frequently of interest in the local vicinity. In this paper, we propose a novel design to transfer such content over opportunistic networks with adaptive quality encoding to achieve reasonable delay bounds. The video segments are transmitted between source and destination in a delay tolerant manner using the Nearby Connections Android library. This implementation can be applied to multiple domains, including farm monitoring, wildlife, and environmental tracking, disaster response scenarios, etc. In this work, we present the design of an opportunistic contact based system, and we discuss basic results for the trial runs within our institute.
