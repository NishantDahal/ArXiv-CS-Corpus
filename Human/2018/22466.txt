Blockchain to Improve Security, Knowledge and Collaboration Inter-Agent Communication over Restrict Domains of the Internet Infrastructure

This paper describes the deployment and implementation of a blockchain to improve the security, knowledge, intelligence and collaboration during the inter-agent communication processes in restrict domains of the Internet Infrastructure. It is a work that proposes the application of a blockchain, platform independent, on a particular model of agents, but that can be used in similar proposals, once the results on the specific model were satisfactory.
