Toward a Thinking Microscope: Deep Learning in Optical Microscopy and Image Reconstruction

We discuss recently emerging applications of the state-of-art deep learning methods on optical microscopy and microscopic image reconstruction, which enable new transformations among different modes and modalities of microscopic imaging, driven entirely by image data. We believe that deep learning will fundamentally change both the hardware and image reconstruction methods used in optical microscopy in a holistic manner.
