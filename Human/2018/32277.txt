Towards Secure Infrastructure-based Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control

Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a pivotal vehicular application that would allow transportation field to achieve its goals of increased traffic throughput and roadway capacity. This application is of paramount interest to the vehicular technology community with a large body of literature dedicated to research within different aspects of CACC, including but not limited to security with CACC. Of all available literature, the overwhelming focus in on CACC utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. In this work, we assert that a qualitative increase in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) involvement has the potential to add greater value to CACC. In this study, we developed a strategy for detection of a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on a CACC platoon where the system edge in the vehicular network plays a central role in attack detection. The proposed security strategy is substantiated with a simulation-based evaluation using the ns-3 discrete event network simulator. Empirical evidence obtained through simulation-based results illustrate successful detection of the DoS attack at four different levels of attack severity using this security strategy.
