A Frequency-Domain Characterization of Optimal Error Covariance for the Kalman-Bucy Filter

In this paper, we discover that the trace of the division of the optimal output estimation error covariance over the noise covariance attained by the Kalman-Bucy filter can be explicitly expressed in terms of the plant dynamics and noise statistics in a frequency-domain integral characterization. Towards this end, we examine the algebraic Riccati equation associated with Kalman-Bucy filtering using analytic function theory and relate it to the Bode integral. Our approach features an alternative, frequency-domain framework for analyzing algebraic Riccati equations and reduces to various existing related results.
