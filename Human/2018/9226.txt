TCP Decoupling for Next Generation Communication System

In traditional networks, interfaces of network nodes are duplex. But, emerging communication technologies such as visible light communication, millimeter-wave communications, can only provide a unidirectional interface when cost is limited. It's urgent to find effective solutions to utilize such new unidirectional communication skills. Decoupling implies separating one single resource to two independent resources. This idea can be applied at physical layer, link layer, network layer, even transport layer. TCP decoupling is an end to end solution provided at transport layer. With decoupled TCP, two distinct unidirectional path can be created to meet the requirements of reliable information transfer. However, it is not an easy task to decouple a bidirectional logical path at transport layer. In this paper, we dwell on the idea of TCP decoupling. Advantages of decoupling at transport layer are analyzed also. In addition, an experiment is carried out to figure out how to implement a decouple TCP. Our results show decoupling at transport layer is possible and the modified protocol is available.
