Detect, Quantify, and Incorporate Dataset Bias: A Neuroimaging Analysis on 12,207 Individuals

Neuroimaging datasets keep growing in size to address increasingly complex medical questions. However, even the largest datasets today alone are too small for training complex models or for finding genome wide associations. A solution is to grow the sample size by merging data across several datasets. However, bias in datasets complicates this approach and includes additional sources of variation in the data instead. In this work, we combine 15 large neuroimaging datasets to study bias. First, we detect bias by demonstrating that scans can be correctly assigned to a dataset with 73.3% accuracy. Next, we introduce metrics to quantify the compatibility across datasets and to create embeddings of neuroimaging sites. Finally, we incorporate the presence of bias for the selection of a training set for predicting autism. For the quantification of the dataset bias, we introduce two metrics: the Bhattacharyya distance between datasets and the age prediction error. The presented embedding of neuroimaging sites provides an interesting new visualization about the similarity of different sites. This could be used to guide the merging of data sources, while limiting the introduction of unwanted variation. Finally, we demonstrate a clear performance increase when incorporating dataset bias for training set selection in autism prediction. Overall, we believe that the growing amount of neuroimaging data necessitates to incorporate data-driven methods for quantifying dataset bias in future analyses.
