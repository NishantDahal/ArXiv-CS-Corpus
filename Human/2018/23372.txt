Towards a classification of Lindenmayer systems

In this paper we will attempt to classify Lindenmayer systems based on properties of sets of rules and the kind of strings those rules generate. This classification will be referred to as a parametrization of the L-space: the L-space is the phase space in which all possible L-developments are represented. This space is infinite, because there is no halting algorithm for L-grammars; but it is also subjected to hard conditions, because there are grammars and developments which are not possible states of an L-system: a very well-known example is the space of normal grammars. Just as the space of normal grammars is parametrized into Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, and Unrestricted (with proper containment relations holding among them; see Chomsky, 1959: Theorem 1), we contend here that the L-space is a very rich landscape of grammars which cluster into kinds that are not mutually translatable.
