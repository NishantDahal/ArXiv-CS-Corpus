Robust Resource Allocation for MISO Cognitive Radio Networks Under Two Practical Non-Linear Energy Harvesting Models

To achieve a good tradeoff between the consumed power and the harvested power, a robust resource optimization problem is studied in a multiple-input single-output cognitive radio network with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer under imperfect channel state information. Unlike most of the existing works that assume an ideal linear energy harvesting (EH) model, we assume two practical non-linear EH models. In order to solve the resulting challenging non-convex problem, we propose an algorithm based on successive convex approximation and prove that a rank-one solution is obtained in each iteration of the proposed algorithm. Our simulation results quantify the effect of the sensitivity threshold of the EH circuit on the harvested power.
