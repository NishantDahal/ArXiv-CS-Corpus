Performance and Programming Effort Trade-offs of Android Persistence Frameworks

A fundamental building block of a mobile application is the ability to persist program data between different invocations. Referred to as \emph{persistence}, this functionality is commonly implemented by means of persistence frameworks. Without a clear understanding of the energy consumption, execution time, and programming effort of popular Android persistence frameworks, mobile developers lack guidelines for selecting frameworks for their applications. To bridge this knowledge gap, we report on the results of a systematic study of the performance and programming effort trade-offs of eight Android persistence frameworks, and provide practical recommendations for mobile application developers.
