Facial Recognition with Encoded Local Projections

Encoded Local Projections (ELP) is a recently introduced dense sampling image descriptor which uses projections in small neighbourhoods to construct a histogram/descriptor for the entire image. ELP has shown to be as accurate as other state-of-the-art features in searching medical images while being time and resource efficient. This paper attempts for the first time to utilize ELP descriptor as primary features for facial recognition and compare the results with LBP histogram on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. We have evaluated descriptors by comparing the chi-squared distance of each image descriptor versus all others as well as training Support Vector Machines (SVM) with each feature vector. In both cases, the results of ELP were better than LBP in the same sub-image configuration.
