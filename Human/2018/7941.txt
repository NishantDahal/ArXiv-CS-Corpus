Der Trusted Connector im Industrial Data Space

Digitalization affects all industrial domains and causes disruption of various business models. Especially in domains such as logistics and manufacturing, inter-connected devices and near-realtime exchange of sensor data across enterprises allows to speed up processes, reduce costs and respond to customer's needs. However, the advent of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) also raises challenges with respect to security and privacy of sensitive and personal data that is created by sensors and processed by services hosted in different administrative domains. The Industrial Data Space initiative addresses these challenges and proposes a secure edge gateway platform named "Trusted Connector". In this report, we introduce the main security building blocks of the Trusted Connector and point out how they help protecting business-critical data and preserving the user's privacy.
