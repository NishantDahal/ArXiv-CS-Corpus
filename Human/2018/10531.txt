Data-Dependent Clock Gating approach for Low Power Sequential System

Power dissipation in the sequential systems of modern CPU integrated chips (CPU-IC viz., Silicon Chip) is in discussion since the last decade. Researchers have been cultivating many low power design methods to choose the best potential candidate for reducing both static and dynamic power of a chip. Though, clock gating (CG) has been an accepted technique to control dynamic power dissipation, question still loiters on its credibility to handle the static power of the system. Therefore in this paper, we have revisited the popular CG schemes and found out some scope of improvisation to support the simultaneous reduction of static and dynamic power dissipation. Our proposed CG is simulated for 90nm CMOS using Cadence Virtuoso and has been tested on a conventional Master-Slave Flip-flop at 5GHz clock with a power supply of 1.1Volt. This assignment clearly depicts its supremacy in terms of power and timing metrics in comparison to the implementation of existing CG schemes.
