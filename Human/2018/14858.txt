QoE Enhancement Schemes for Video in Converged OFDMA Wireless Networks and EPONs

Bandwidth requirements of both wireless and wired clients in access networks continue to increase rapidly, primarily due to the growth of video traffic. Application awareness can be utilized in access networks to optimize quality of experience (QoE) of end clients. In this study, we utilize information at the client-side application (e.g., video resolution) to achieve superior resource allocation that improves user QoE. We emphasize optimizing QoE of the system rather than quality of service (QoS), as user satisfaction directly relies on QoE and optimizing QoS does not necessarily optimize QoE, as shown in this study. We propose application-aware resource-allocation schemes on an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), which supports wireless (utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiple access) and wired clients running video-conference applications. Numerical results show that the application-aware resource-allocation schemes improve QoE for video-conference applications for wired and wireless clients.
