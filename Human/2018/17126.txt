EIQIS: Toward an Event-Oriented Indexable and Queryable Intelligent Surveillance System

Edge computing provides the ability to link distributor users for multimedia content, while retaining the power of significant data storage and access at a centralized computer. Two requirements of significance include: what information show be processed at the edge and how the content should be stored. Answers to these questions require a combination of query-based search, access, and response as well as indexed-based processing, storage, and distribution. A measure of intelligence is not what is known, but is recalled, hence, future edge intelligence must provide recalled information for dynamic response. In this paper, a novel event-oriented indexable and queryable intelligent surveillance (EIQIS) system is introduced leveraging the on-site edge devices to collect the information sensed in format of frames and extracts useful features to enhance situation awareness. The design principles are discussed and a preliminary proof-of-concept prototype is built that validated the feasibility of the proposed idea.
