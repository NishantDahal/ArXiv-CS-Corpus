Effect of correlation on the traffic capacity of Time Varying Communication Network

The network topology and the routing strategy are major factors to affect the traffic dynamics of the network. In this work, we aim to design an optimal time-varying network structure and an efficient route is allocated to each user in the network. The network topology is designed by considering addition, removal, and rewiring of links. At each time instants, a new node connects with an existing node based on the degree and correlation with its neighbor. Traffic congestion is handled by rewiring of some congested links along with the removal of the anti-preferential and correlated links. Centrality plays an important role to find the most important node in the network. The more a node is central, the more it can be used for the shortest route of the user pairs and it can be congested due to a large number of data coming from its neighborhood. Therefore, routes of the users are selected such that the sum of the centrality of the nodes appearing in the user's route is minimum. Thereafter, we analyze the network structure by using various network properties such as the clustering coefficient, centrality, average shortest path, rich club coefficient, average packet travel time and order parameter.
