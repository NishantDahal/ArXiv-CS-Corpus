Indirect Influences, Links Ranking, and Deconstruction of Networks

The PWP map was introduced by the second author as a tool for ranking nodes in networks. In this work we extend this technique so that it can be used to rank links as well. Applying the Girvan-Newman algorithm a ranking method on links induces a deconstruction method for networks, therefore we obtain new methods for finding clustering and core-periphery structures on networks.
