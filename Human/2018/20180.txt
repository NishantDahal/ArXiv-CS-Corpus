On Mathematical structures on pairwise comparisons matrices with coefficients in a group arising from quantum gravity

We describe the mathematical properties of pairwise comparisons matrices with coefficients in an arbitrary group. We provide a vocabulary adapted for the description of main algebraic properties of inconsistency maps, describe an example where the use of a non abelian group is necessary. Algebraic, topological, geometric and probabilistic aspects are considered.
