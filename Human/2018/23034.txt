Edge-isoperimetric inequalities for the symmetric product of graphs

The $k$-th symmetric product of a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ with edge set $E$ is a graph with vertices as $k$-sets of $V$, where two $k$-sets are connected by an edge if and only if their symmetric difference is an edge in $E$. Using the isoperimetric properties of the vertex-induced subgraphs of $G$ and Sobolev inequalities on graphs, we obtain various edge-isoperimetric inequalities pertaining to the symmetric product of certain families of finite and infinite graphs.
