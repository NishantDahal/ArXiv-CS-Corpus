Memoryless Determinacy of Infinite Parity Games: Another Simple Proof

In 1998 Zielonka simplified the proofs of memoryless determinacy of infinite parity games. In 2018 Haddad simplified some proofs of memoryless determinacy of finite parity games. This article adapts Haddad's technique for infinite parity games. Two proofs are given, a shorter one and a more constructive one. None of them uses Zielonka's traps and attractors.
