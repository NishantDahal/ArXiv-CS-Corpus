Fully Homomorphic Image Processing

Fully homomorphic encryption has allowed devices to outsource computation to third parties while preserving the secrecy of the data being computed on. Many images contain sensitive information and are commonly sent to cloud services to encode images for different devices. We implement image processing homomorphically that ensures secrecy of the image while also providing reasonable overhead. We first present some previous related work, as well as the fully homomorphic encryption scheme we use. Then, we introduce our schemes for JPEG encoding and decoding, as well as schemes for bilinear and bicubic image resizing, as well as some data and analysis of our homomorphic schemes. Finally, we outline several issues with the homomorphic evaluation of proprietary algorithms, and how a third party can gain information on the algorithm through noise.
