RGB Video Based Tennis Action Recognition Using a Deep Historical Long Short-Term Memory

Action recognition has attracted increasing attention from RGB input in computer vision partially due to potential applications on somatic simulation and statistics of sport such as virtual tennis game and tennis techniques and tactics analysis by video. Recently, deep learning based methods have achieved promising performance for action recognition. In this paper, we propose weighted Long Short-Term Memory adopted with convolutional neural network representations for three dimensional tennis shots recognition. First, the local two-dimensional convolutional neural network spatial representations are extracted from each video frame individually using a pre-trained Inception network. Then, a weighted Long Short-Term Memory decoder is introduced to take the output state at time t and the historical embedding feature at time t-1 to generate feature vector using a score weighting scheme. Finally, we use the adopted CNN and weighted LSTM to map the original visual features into a vector space to generate the spatial-temporal semantical description of visual sequences and classify the action video content. Experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method using only simple raw RGB video can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art baselines for tennis shot recognition.
