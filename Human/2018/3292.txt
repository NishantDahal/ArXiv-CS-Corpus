Towards self-adaptable robots: from programming to training machines

We argue that hardware modularity plays a key role in the convergence of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We introduce a new approach for building robots that leads to more adaptable and capable machines. We present the concept of a self-adaptable robot that makes use of hardware modularity and AI techniques to reduce the effort and time required to be built. We demonstrate in simulation and with a real robot how, rather than programming, training produces behaviors in the robot that generalize fast and produce robust outputs in the presence of noise. In particular, we advocate for mammals.
