Reductive property of new fuzzy reasoning method based on distance measure

Firstly in this paper we propose a new criterion function for evaluation of the reductive property about the fuzzy reasoning result for fuzzy modus ponens and fuzzy modus tollens. Secondly unlike fuzzy reasoning methods based on the similarity measure, we propose a new fuzzy reasoning method based on distance measure. Thirdly the reductive property for 5 fuzzy reasoning methods are checked with respect to fuzzy modus ponens and fuzzy modus tollens. Through the experiment, we show that proposed method is better than the previous methods in accordance with human thinking.
