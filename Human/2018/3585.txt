Büchi-Kamp Theorems for 1-clock ATA

This paper investigates Kamp-like and Büchi-like theorems for 1-clock Alternating Timed Automata (1-ATA) and its natural subclasses. A notion of 1-ATA with loop-free-resets is defined. This automaton class is shown to be expressively equivalent to the temporal logic $\regmtl$ which is $\mathsf{MTL[F_I]}$ extended with a regular expression guarded modality. Moreover, a subclass of future timed MSO with k-variable-connectivity property is introduced as logic $\qkmso$. In a Kamp-like result, it is shown that $\regmtl$ is expressively equivalent to $\qkmso$. As our second result, we define a notion of conjunctive-disjunctive 1-clock ATA ($\wf$ 1-ATA). We show that $\wf$ 1-ATA with loop-free-resets are expressively equivalent to the sublogic $\F\regmtl$ of $\regmtl$. Moreover $\F\regmtl$ is expressively equivalent to $\qtwomso$, the two-variable connected fragment of $\qkmso$. The full class of 1-ATA is shown to be expressively equivalent to $\regmtl$ extended with fixed point operators.
