Becker's conjecture on Mahler functions

In 1994, Becker conjectured that if $F(z)$ is a $k$-regular power series, then there exists a $k$-regular rational function $R(z)$ such that $F(z)/R(z)$ satisfies a Mahler-type functional equation with polynomial coefficients where the initial coefficient satisfies $a_0(z)=1$. In this paper, we prove Becker's conjecture in the best-possible form; we show that the rational function $R(z)$ can be taken to be a polynomial $z^γQ(z)$ for some explicit non-negative integer $γ$ and such that $1/Q(z)$ is $k$-regular.
