Multiview Learning of Weighted Majority Vote by Bregman Divergence Minimization

We tackle the issue of classifier combinations when observations have multiple views. Our method jointly learns view-specific weighted majority vote classifiers (i.e. for each view) over a set of base voters, and a second weighted majority vote classifier over the set of these view-specific weighted majority vote classifiers. We show that the empirical risk minimization of the final majority vote given a multiview training set can be cast as the minimization of Bregman divergences. This allows us to derive a parallel-update optimization algorithm for learning our multiview model. We empirically study our algorithm with a particular focus on the impact of the training set size on the multiview learning results. The experiments show that our approach is able to overcome the lack of labeled information.
