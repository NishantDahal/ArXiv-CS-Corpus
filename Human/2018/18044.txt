A Framework for Moment Invariants

For more than half a century, moments have attracted lot ot interest in the pattern recognition community.The moments of a distribution (an object) provide several of its characteristics as center of gravity, orientation, disparity, volume. Moments can be used to define invariant characteristics to some transformations that an object can undergo, commonly called moment invariants. This work provides a simple and systematic formalism to compute geometric moment invariants in n-dimensional space.
