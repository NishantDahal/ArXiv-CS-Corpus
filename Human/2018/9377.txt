Energy-efficiency evaluation of Intel KNL for HPC workloads

Energy consumption is increasingly becoming a limiting factor to the design of faster large-scale parallel systems, and development of energy-efficient and energy-aware applications is today a relevant issue for HPC code-developer communities. In this work we focus on energy performance of the Knights Landing (KNL) Xeon Phi, the latest many-core architecture processor introduced by Intel into the HPC market. We take into account the 64-core Xeon Phi 7230, and analyze its energy performance using both the on-chip MCDRAM and the regular DDR4 system memory as main storage for the application data-domain. As a benchmark application we use a Lattice Boltzmann code heavily optimized for this architecture and implemented using different memory data layouts to store its lattice. We assessthen the energy consumption using different memory data-layouts, kind of memory (DDR4 or MCDRAM) and number of threads per core.
