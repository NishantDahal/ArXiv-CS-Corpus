Organic Computing as Chance for Interwoven Systems

Systems are growing into more complex ones for developing and maintaining. Existing systems which do not have much in common on the first look are connected, due to the technical progress, even if it was never intended that way. It is an upcoming challenge to handle these large-scale and complex systems. A solution must be found to manage these "Interwoven Systems". Therefore it is discussed where approaches of "Organic Computing" can help, to handle some of these upcoming challenges.
