2D/3D Megavoltage Image Registration Using Convolutional Neural Networks

We presented a 2D/3D MV image registration method based on a Convolutional Neural Network. Most of the traditional image registration method intensity-based, which use optimization algorithms to maximize the similarity between to images. Although these methods can achieve good results for kilovoltage images, the same does not occur for megavoltage images due to the lower image quality. Also, these methods most of the times do not present a good capture range. To deal with this problem, we propose the use of Convolutional Neural Network. The experiments were performed using a dataset of 50 brain images. The results showed to be promising compared to traditional image registration methods.
