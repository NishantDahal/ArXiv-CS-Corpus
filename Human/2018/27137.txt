Joint Receiver Design for Internet of Things

Internet of things (IoT) is an ever-growing network of objects that connect, collect and exchange data. To achieve the mission of connecting everything, physical layer communication is of indispensable importance. In this work, we propose a new receiver tailored for the characteristics of IoT communications. Specifically, our design is suitable for sporadic transmissions of small-to-medium sized packets in IoT applications. With joint design in the new receiver, strong reliability is guaranteed and power saving is expected.
