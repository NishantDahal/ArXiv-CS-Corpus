A Structure-aware Online Learning Algorithm for Markov Decision Processes

To overcome the curse of dimensionality and curse of modeling in Dynamic Programming (DP) methods for solving classical Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are popular. In this paper, we consider an infinite-horizon average reward MDP problem and prove the optimality of the threshold policy under certain conditions. Traditional RL techniques do not exploit the threshold nature of optimal policy while learning. In this paper, we propose a new RL algorithm which utilizes the known threshold structure of the optimal policy while learning by reducing the feasible policy space. We establish that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal policy. It provides a significant improvement in convergence speed and computational and storage complexity over traditional RL algorithms. The proposed technique can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems that include energy efficient data transmission and management of queues. We exhibit the improvement in convergence speed of the proposed algorithm over other RL algorithms through simulations.
