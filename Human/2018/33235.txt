State-of-the-Art Economic Load Dispatch of Power Systems Using Particle Swarm Optimization

Metaheuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has emerged as one of the most promising optimization techniques in solving highly constrained non-linear and non-convex optimization problems in different areas of electrical engineering. Economic operation of the power system is one of the most important areas of electrical engineering where PSO has been used efficiently in solving various issues of practical systems. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of research works in solving various aspects of economic load dispatch (ELD) problems of power system engineering using different types of PSO algorithms is presented. Five important areas of ELD problems have been identified, and the papers published in the general area of ELD using PSO have been classified into these five sections. These five areas are (i) single objective economic load dispatch, (ii) dynamic economic load dispatch, (iii) economic load dispatch with non-conventional sources, (iv) multi-objective environmental/economic dispatch, and (v) economic load dispatch of microgrids. At the end of each category, a table is provided which describes the main features of the papers in brief. The promising future works are given at the conclusion of the review.
