ALMN: Deep Embedding Learning with Geometrical Virtual Point Generating

Deep embedding learning becomes more attractive for discriminative feature learning, but many methods still require hard-class mining, which is computationally complex and performance-sensitive. To this end, we propose Adaptive Large Margin N-Pair loss (ALMN) to address the aforementioned issues. Instead of exploring hard example-mining strategy, we introduce the concept of large margin constraint. This constraint aims at encouraging local-adaptive large angular decision margin among dissimilar samples in multimodal feature space so as to significantly encourage intraclass compactness and interclass separability. And it is mainly achieved by a simple yet novel geometrical Virtual Point Generating (VPG) method, which converts artificially setting a fixed margin into automatically generating a boundary training sample in feature space and is an open question. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several popular datasets for image retrieval and clustering tasks.
