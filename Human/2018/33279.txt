QoS-aware Full-duplex Concurrent Scheduling for Millimeter Wave Wireless Backhaul Networks

The development of self-interference (SI) cancelation technology makes full-duplex (FD) communication possible. Considering the quality of service (QoS) of flows in small cells densely deployed scenario with limited time slot (TS) resources, this paper introduces the FD communication into the concurrent scheduling problem of millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless backhaul network. We propose a QoS-aware FD concurrent scheduling algorithm to maximize the number of flows with their QoS requirements satisfied. Based on the contention graph, the algorithm makes full use of the FD condition. Both residual self-interference (RSI) and multi-user interference (MUI) are considered. Besides, it also fully considers the QoS requirements of flows and ensures the flows can be transmitted at high rates. Extensive simulations at 60GHz demonstrate that with high SI cancelation level and appropriate contention threshold, the proposed FD algorithm can achieve superior performance in terms of the number of flows with their QoS requirements satisfied and the system throughput compared with other stateof-of-the-art schemes.
