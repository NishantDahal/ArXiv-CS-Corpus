Generating Contradictory, Neutral, and Entailing Sentences

Learning distributed sentence representations remains an interesting problem in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We want to learn a model that approximates the conditional latent space over the representations of a logical antecedent of the given statement. In our paper, we propose an approach to generating sentences, conditioned on an input sentence and a logical inference label. We do this by modeling the different possibilities for the output sentence as a distribution over the latent representation, which we train using an adversarial objective. We evaluate the model using two state-of-the-art models for the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) task, and measure the BLEU scores against the actual sentences as a probe for the diversity of sentences produced by our model. The experiment results show that, given our framework, we have clear ways to improve the quality and diversity of generated sentences.
