Maximum Throughput Scheduling for Multi-connectivity in Millimeter-Wave Networks

Multi-connectivity is emerging as promising solution to provide reliable communications and seamless connectivity at the millimeter-wave frequency range. Due to the obstacles that cause frequent interruptions at such high frequency range, connectivity to multiple cells can drastically increase the network performance in terms of throughput and reliability by coordination among the network elements. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the link scheduling optimization that maximizes the network throughput for multi-connectivity in millimeter-wave cellular networks. The considered approach exploits a centralized architecture, fast link switching, proactive context preparation and data forwarding between millimeter-wave access points and the users. The proposed algorithm is able to numerically approach the global optimum and to quantify the potential gain of multi-connectivity in millimeter-wave cellular networks.
