A new approach of contextual recommendation based on the method of Hierarchical Analysis of Processes

Recommender systems are able to estimate the user's interest for resource given from some relative information to others similar users and to propriety of the resource. In this Memory, we introduced a new contextual recommendation approach based on the AHP Process Hierarchical Analysis method. This work consisted in making a bibliographic study on the works having proposed systems of recommendation based on the context of the users in the field of films. The goal is to design and develop a new approach to recommending movies based on user context. And we relied on methods of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and more precisely the method of Hierarchical Process Analysis (AHP) for context integration in the recommendation process.
