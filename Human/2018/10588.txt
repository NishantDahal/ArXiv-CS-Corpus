An Improved Active Disturbance Rejection Control for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot with Mismatched Disturbances and Uncertainties

In this paper a new strategy based on disturbance and uncertainty (DU) estimation and attenuation technique is proposed and tested on the nonlinear kinematic model of the differential drive mobile robot (DDMR). The proposed technique is an improved version of the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) strategy suggested by J. Han. The ADRC is used to actively reject disturbances caused by the unknown exogenous signals and the matched uncertainties of the system model, which are lumped all together and attributed as a total disturbance. In this work, the considered system is assumed to be affine and the total disturbance and the input are considered to be on different channels. To deal with the mismatched disturbances and uncertainties, the total disturbance has been converted into a matched one. Then, based on the improved ADRC (IADRC), the dynamic performance of the DDMR has been enhanced by estimating the total disturbance and canceling it from the system. Through digital simulations, different performance measures are applied, and they all indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IADRC by almost removing the chattering phenomenon and providing a high immunity in the closed-loop system against torque disturbance.
