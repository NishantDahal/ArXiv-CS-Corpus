Hate Speech Detection from Code-mixed Hindi-English Tweets Using Deep Learning Models

This paper reports an increment to the state-of-the-art in hate speech detection for English-Hindi code-mixed tweets. We compare three typical deep learning models using domain-specific embeddings. On experimenting with a benchmark dataset of English-Hindi code-mixed tweets, we observe that using domain-specific embeddings results in an improved representation of target groups, and an improved F-score.
