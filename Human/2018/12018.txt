Video Processing on the Edge for Multimedia IoT Systems

In this article, we first survey the current situation of video processing on the edge for multimedia Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) systems in three typical scenarios, i.e., smart cities, satellite networks, and Internet-of-Vehicles. By summarizing a general model of the edge video processing, the importance of developing an edge computing platform is highlighted. Then, we give a method of implementing cooperative video processing on an edge computing platform based on light-weighted virtualization technologies. Performance evaluation is conducted and some insightful observations can be obtained. Moreover, we summarize challenges and opportunities of realizing effective edge video processing for M-IoT systems.
