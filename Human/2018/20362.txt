Color Image Encryption Based on Chaotic Block Permutation and XOR Operation

In this paper, chaotic block image permutation and XOR operation are performed to achieve image encryption. The studied method of encryption makes use of chaotic systems properties for secure and speed image encryption. Firstly, the original image is divided into blocks of equal size. Then, two chaotic maps are used to generate two key streams which are permuted among themselves to produce one key steam. The image blocks are then shuffled using part of key stream. Finally, scrambled image is diffused by XOR operation with the key stream to get the encrypted image. The experimental results of several performance analyses about the pixel correlation, various statistical analysis, information entropy analysis, differential analysis, the key space and key sensitivity analysis, show that the algorithm can resist several know attacks effectively and has the advantages of large key space, high security, and high speed, assuring safety performance and secure image encryption.
