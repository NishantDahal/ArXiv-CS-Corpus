Securing Behavior-based Opinion Spam Detection

Reviews spams are prevalent in e-commerce to manipulate product ranking and customers decisions maliciously. While spams generated based on simple spamming strategy can be detected effectively, hardened spammers can evade regular detectors via more advanced spamming strategies. Previous work gave more attention to evasion against text and graph-based detectors, but evasions against behavior-based detectors are largely ignored, leading to vulnerabilities in spam detection systems. Since real evasion data are scarce, we first propose EMERAL (Evasion via Maximum Entropy and Rating sAmpLing) to generate evasive spams to certain existing detectors. EMERAL can simulate spammers with different goals and levels of knowledge about the detectors, targeting at different stages of the life cycle of target products. We show that in the evasion-defense dynamic, only a few evasion types are meaningful to the spammers, and any spammer will not be able to evade too many detection signals at the same time. We reveal that some evasions are quite insidious and can fail all detection signals. We then propose DETER (Defense via Evasion generaTion using EmeRal), based on model re-training on diverse evasive samples generated by EMERAL. Experiments confirm that DETER is more accurate in detecting both suspicious time window and individual spamming reviews. In terms of security, DETER is versatile enough to be vaccinated against diverse and unexpected evasions, is agnostic about evasion strategy and can be released without privacy concern.
