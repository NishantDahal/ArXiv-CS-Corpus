Fantom: A scalable framework for asynchronous distributed systems

We describe \emph{Fantom}, a framework for asynchronous distributed systems. \emph{Fantom} is based on the Lachesis Protocol~\cite{lachesis01}, which uses asynchronous event transmission for practical Byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) to create a leaderless, scalable, asynchronous Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
  We further optimize the \emph{Lachesis Protocol} by introducing a permission-less network for dynamic participation. Root selection cost is further optimized by the introduction of an n-row flag table, as well as optimizing path selection by introducing domination relationships.
  We propose an alternative framework for distributed ledgers, based on asynchronous partially ordered sets with logical time ordering instead of blockchains.
  This paper builds upon the original proposed family of \emph{Lachesis-class} consensus protocols. We formalize our proofs into a model that can be applied to abstract asynchronous distributed system.
