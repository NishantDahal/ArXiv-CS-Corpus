Strong Subgraph Connectivity of Digraphs: A Survey

In this survey we overview known results on the strong subgraph $k$-connectivity and strong subgraph $k$-arc-connectivity of digraphs. After an introductory section, the paper is divided into four sections: basic results, algorithms and complexity, sharp bounds for strong subgraph $k$-(arc-)connectivity, minimally strong subgraph $(k, \ell)$-(arc-) connected digraphs. This survey contains several conjectures and open problems for further study.
