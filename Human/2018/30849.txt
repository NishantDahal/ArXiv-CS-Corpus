Effect of data reduction on sequence-to-sequence neural TTS

Recent speech synthesis systems based on sampling from autoregressive neural networks models can generate speech almost undistinguishable from human recordings. However, these models require large amounts of data. This paper shows that the lack of data from one speaker can be compensated with data from other speakers. The naturalness of Tacotron2-like models trained on a blend of 5k utterances from 7 speakers is better than that of speaker dependent models trained on 15k utterances, but in terms of stability multi-speaker models are always more stable. We also demonstrate that models mixing only 1250 utterances from a target speaker with 5k utterances from another 6 speakers can produce significantly better quality than state-of-the-art DNN-guided unit selection systems trained on more than 10 times the data from the target speaker.
