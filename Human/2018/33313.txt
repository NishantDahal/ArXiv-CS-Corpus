Blind proxy voting

A secret ballot mechanism that enables voting in absence is proposed. It amends standard vote collection methods that use ballot box as anonymizer, adding the option for absent voters to vote by a proxy blinded to the content of the ballot paper. Votes are cast under unique and hidden identification numbers generated solely for the purpose of that election. Voters prepare their ballot papers from scratch and submit them to the tallying authority in two parts via separate routes, each part being meaningless without the other.
