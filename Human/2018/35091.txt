Twists and Turns in the US-North Korea Dialogue: Key Figure Dynamic Network Analysis using News Articles

In this paper, we present a method for analyzing a dynamic network of key figures in the U.S.-North Korea relations during the first two quarters of 2018. Our method constructs key figure networks from U.S. news articles on North Korean issues by taking co-occurrence of people's names in an article as a domain-relevant social link. We call a group of people that co-occur repeatedly in the same domain (news articles on North Korean issues in our case) "key figures" and their social networks "key figure networks." We analyze block-structure changes of key figure networks in the U.S.-North Korea relations using a Bayesian hidden Markov multilinear tensor model. The results of our analysis show that block structure changes in the key figure network in the U.S.-North Korea relations predict important game-changing moments in the U.S.-North Korea relations in the first two quarters of 2018.
