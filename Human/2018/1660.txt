User Scheduling for Millimeter Wave MIMO Communications with Low-Resolution ADCs

In millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, we investigate uplink user scheduling when a basestation employs low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with a large number of antennas. To reduce power consumption in the receiver, low-resolution ADCs can be a potential solution for mmWave systems in which many antennas are likely to be deployed to compensate for the large path loss. Due to quantization error, we show that the channel structure in the beamspace, in addition to the channel magnitude and beamspace orthogonality, plays a key role in maximizing the achievable rates of scheduled users. Consequently, we derive the optimal criteria with respect to the channel structure in the beamspace that maximizes the uplink sum rate for multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with a zero-forcing receiver. Leveraging the derived criteria, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm for mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs. Numerical results validate that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional user scheduling methods in terms of the sum rate.
