Computing basepoints of linear series in the plane

We present an algorithm for detecting basepoints of linear series of curves in the plane. Moreover, we give an algorithm for constructing a linear series of curves in the plane for given basepoints. The underlying method of these algorithms is the classical procedure of blowing up points in the plane. We motivate the algorithmic version of this procedure with several applications.
