Sketching for Sequential Change-Point Detection

We study sequential change-point detection procedures based on linear sketches of high-dimensional signal vectors using generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistics. The GLR statistics allow for an unknown post-change mean that represents an anomaly or novelty. We consider both fixed and time-varying projections, derive theoretical approximations to two fundamental performance metrics: the average run length (ARL) and the expected detection delay (EDD); these approximations are shown to be highly accurate by numerical simulations. We further characterize the relative performance measure of the sketching procedure compared to that without sketching and show that there can be little performance loss when the signal strength is sufficiently large, and enough number of sketches are used. Finally, we demonstrate the good performance of sketching procedures using simulation and real-data examples on solar flare detection and failure detection in power networks.
