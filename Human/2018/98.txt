Towards Efficient Dynamic Virtual Network Embedding Strategy for Cloud IoT Networks

Network Virtualization is one of the most promising technologies for future networking and considered as a critical IT resource that connects distributed, virtualized Cloud Computing services and different components such as storage, servers and application. Network Virtualization allows multiple virtual networks to coexist on same shared physical infrastructure simultaneously. One of the crucial keys in Network Virtualization is Virtual Network Embedding, which provides a method to allocate physical substrate resources to virtual network requests. In this paper, we investigate Virtual Network Embedding strategies and related issues for resource allocation of an Internet Provider(InP) to efficiently embed virtual networks that are requested by Virtual Network Operators(VNOs) who share the same infrastructure provided by the InP. In order to achieve that goal, we design a heuristic Virtual Network Embedding algorithm that simultaneously embeds virtual nodes and virtual links of each virtual network request onto physic infrastructure. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme improves significantly the performance of Virtual Network Embedding by enhancing the long-term average revenue as well as acceptance ratio and resource utilization of virtual network requests compared to prior algorithms.
