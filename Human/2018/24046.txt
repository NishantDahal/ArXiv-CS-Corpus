Joint User Association and Resource Allocation Optimization for Ultra Reliable Low Latency HetNets

Ensuring ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) is necessary for enabling delay critical applications in 5G HetNets. We propose a joint user to BS association and resource optimization method that is attractive for URLLC in HetNets with Cellular Base Stations (CBSs) and Small Cell Base Stations (SBSs), while also reducing energy and bandwidth consumption. In our scheme, CBSs share portions of the available spectrum with SBSs, and they in exchange, provide data service to the users in their coverage area. We first show that the CBSs optimal resource allocation (ORA) problem is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large number of users. Then, to reduce its time complexity, we propose a relaxed heuristic method (RHM) which breaks down the original ORA problem into a heuristic user association (HUA) algorithm and a convex resource allocation (CRA) optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic method decreases the time complexity of finding the optimal solution for CBS's significantly, thereby benefiting URLLC. It also helps the CBSs to save energy by offloading users to SBSs. In our simulations, the spectrum access delay for cellular users is reduced by 93\% and the energy consumption is reduced by 33\%, while maintaining the full service rate.
