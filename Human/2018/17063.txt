Identifying Financial Institutions by Transaction Signatures

Financial data aggregators and Personal Financial Management (PFM) services are software products that help individuals manage personal finances by collecting information from multiple accounts at various Financial Institutes (FIs), presenting data in a coherent and concentrated way, and highlighting insights and suggestions. Money transfers consist of two sides and a direction. From the perspective of a financial data aggregator, an incoming transaction consists of a date, an amount, and a description string, but not the explicit identity of the sending FI. In this paper we investigate supervised learning based methods to infer the identity of the sending FI from the description string of a money transfer transaction, using a blend of traditional and RNN based NLP methods. Our approach is based on the observation that the textual description field associated with a transactions is subjected to various types of normalizations and standardizations, resulting in unique patterns that identify the issuer. We compare multiple methods using a large real-word dataset of over $10$ million transactions.
