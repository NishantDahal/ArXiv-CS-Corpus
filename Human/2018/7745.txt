Extracting the Most Weighted Throughput in UAV Empowered Wireless Systems With Nonlinear Energy Harvester

With the maturity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, this work investigates the integration of UAV into wireless communication systems. Since the UAV is powered by a capacity-limited battery, this work proposes to use the radio energy harvesting technology at the UAV in order to extend the lifetime of UAV empowered base station. To extract the most weighted throughput of UAV empowered wireless systems, the dirty paper coding scheme and information-theoretic uplink-downlink channel duality are exploited to propose an extracting the most weighted throughput algorithm. Numerical results are used to verify the proposed algorithm.
