An Optimal Itinerary Generation in a Configuration Space of Large Intellectual Agent Groups with Linear Logic

A group of intelligent agents which fulfill a set of tasks in parallel is represented first by the tensor multiplication of corresponding processes in a linear logic game category. An optimal itinerary in the configuration space of the group states is defined as a play with maximal total reward in the category. New moments also are: the reward is represented as a degree of certainty (visibility) of an agent goal, and the system goals are chosen by the greatest value corresponding to these processes in the system goal lattice.
