Erratum for "On oriented cliques with respect to push operation"

An error is spotted in the statement of Theorem~1.3 of our published article titled "On oriented cliques with respect to push operation" (Discrete Applied Mathematics 2017). The theorem provided an exhaustive list of 16 minimal (up to spanning subgraph inclusion) underlying planar push cliques. The error was that, one of the 16 graphs from the above list was missing an arc. We correct the error and restate the corrected statement in this article. We also point out the reason for the error and comment that the error occurred due to a mistake in a particular lemma. We present the corrected proof of that particular lemma as well. Moreover, a few counts were wrongly reported due to the above mentioned error. So we update our reported counts after correction in this article.
