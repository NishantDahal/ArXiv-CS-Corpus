Simple example of weak modal logic based on intuitionistic core

In this paper we present simple example of propositional logic which has one modal operator and is based on intuitionistic core. This system is very weak in modal sense - e.g. rules of regularity or monotonicity do not hold. It has complete semantics composed of possible worlds equipped with neighborhoods and pre-order relation. We discuss certain restrictions imposed on those structures. Also, we present characterization of axiom 4 known from logic S4.
