On the number of semi-magic squares of order 6

We present an exact method for counting semi-magic squares of order 6. Some theoretical investigations about the number of them and a probabilistic method are presented. Our calculations show that there are exactly $94\,590\,660\,245\,399\,996\,601\,600$ such squares up to reflections and rotations.
