Boosted Convolutional Neural Networks for Motor Imagery EEG Decoding with Multiwavelet-based Time-Frequency Conditional Granger Causality Analysis

Decoding EEG signals of different mental states is a challenging task for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to nonstationarity of perceptual decision processes. This paper presents a novel boosted convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) decoding scheme for motor imagery (MI) EEG signals assisted by the multiwavelet-based time-frequency (TF) causality analysis. Specifically, multiwavelet basis functions are first combined with Geweke spectral measure to obtain high-resolution TF-conditional Granger causality (CGC) representations, where a regularized orthogonal forward regression (ROFR) algorithm is adopted to detect a parsimonious model with good generalization performance. The causality images for network input preserving time, frequency and location information of connectivity are then designed based on the TF-CGC distributions of alpha band multichannel EEG signals. Further constructed boosted ConvNets by using spatio-temporal convolutions as well as advances in deep learning including cropping and boosting methods, to extract discriminative causality features and classify MI tasks. Our proposed approach outperforms the competition winner algorithm with 12.15% increase in average accuracy and 74.02% decrease in associated inter subject standard deviation for the same binary classification on BCI competition-IV dataset-IIa. Experiment results indicate that the boosted ConvNets with causality images works well in decoding MI-EEG signals and provides a promising framework for developing MI-BCI systems.
