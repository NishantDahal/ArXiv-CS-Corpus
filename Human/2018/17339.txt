Characters Detection on Namecard with faster RCNN

We apply Faster R-CNN to the detection of characters in namecard, in order to solve the problem of a small amount of data and the inbalance between different class, we designed the data augmentation and the 'fake' data generalizer to generate more data for the training of network. Without using data augmentation, the average IoU in correct samples could be no less than 80% and the mAP result of 80% was also achieved with Faster R-CNN. By applying the data augmentation, the variance of mAP is decreased and both of the IoU and mAP score has increased a little.
