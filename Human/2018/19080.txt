Stochastic Constraint Optimization using Propagation on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams

A number of problems in relational Artificial Intelligence can be viewed as Stochastic Constraint Optimization Problems (SCOPs). These are constraint optimization problems that involve objectives or constraints with a stochastic component. Building on the recently proposed language SC-ProbLog for modeling SCOPs, we propose a new method for solving these problems. Earlier methods used Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) techniques to create Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), which were decomposed into smaller constraints in order to exploit existing constraint programming (CP) solvers. We argue that this approach has as drawback that a decomposed representation of an OBDD does not guarantee domain consistency during search, and hence limits the efficiency of the solver. For the specific case of monotonic distributions, we suggest an alternative method for using CP in SCOP, based on the development of a new propagator; we show that this propagator is linear in the size of the OBDD, and has the potential to be more efficient than the decomposition method, as it maintains domain consistency.
