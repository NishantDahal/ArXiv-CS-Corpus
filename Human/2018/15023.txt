Base Station Cooperation in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks: Performance Enhancement of Cell-Edge Users

Millimeter wave (mmWave) signals are much more sensitive to blockage, which results in a significant increase of the outage probability, especially for the users at the edge of the cells. In this paper, we exploit the technique of base station (BS) cooperation to improve the performance of the cell-edge users in the downlink transmission of mmWave cellular networks. We design two cooperative schemes, which are referred to as fixed-number BS cooperation (FNC) scheme and fixed-region BS cooperation (FRC) scheme, respectively. In FNC scheme, the cooperative BSs consist of the M nearest BSs around the served cell-edge users, and in FRC scheme, the cooperative BSs include all the BSs located within a given region. We derive the expressions for the average rate and outage probability of a typical cell-edge user located at the origin based on the stochastic geometry framework. To reduce the computational complexity of our analytical results for the outage probability, we further propose a Gamma approximation based method to provide approximations with satisfying accuracy. Our analytical results incorporate the critical characteristics of mmWave channels, i.e., the blockage effects, the different path loss of LOS and NLOS links and the highly directional antenna arrays. Simulation results show that the performance of the cell-edge users is greatly improved when mmWave networks are combined with the technique of BS cooperation.
