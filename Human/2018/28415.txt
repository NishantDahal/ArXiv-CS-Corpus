Timely Lossless Source Coding for Randomly Arriving Symbols

We consider a real-time streaming source coding system in which an encoder observes a sequence of randomly arriving symbols from an i.i.d. source, and feeds binary codewords to a FIFO buffer that outputs one bit per time unit to a decoder. Each source symbol represents a status update by the source, and the timeliness of the system is quantified by the age of information (AoI), defined as the time difference between the present time and the generation time of the most up-to-date symbol at the output of the decoder. When the FIFO buffer is allowed to be empty, we propose an optimal prefix-free lossless coding scheme that minimizes the average peak age based on the analysis of discrete-time Geo/G/1 queue. For more practical scenarios in which a special codeword is reserved for indicating an empty buffer, we propose an encoding scheme that assigns a codeword to the empty buffer state based on an estimate of the buffer idle time.
