On Minimum Connecting Transition Sets in Graphs

A forbidden transition graph is a graph defined together with a set of permitted transitions i.e. unordered pair of adjacent edges that one may use consecutively in a walk in the graph. In this paper, we look for the smallest set of transitions needed to be able to go from any vertex of the given graph to any other. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and study approximation algorithms. We develop theoretical tools that help to study this problem.
