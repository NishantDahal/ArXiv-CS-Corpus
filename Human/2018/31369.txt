VDAS: Verifiable Data Aggregation Scheme for Internet of Things

Along with the miniaturization of various types of sensors, a mass of intelligent terminals are gaining stronger sensing capability, which raises a deeper perception and better prospect of Internet of Things (IoT). With big sensing data, IoT provides lots of convenient services for the monitoring and management of smart cities and people's daily lives. However, there are still many security challenges influencing the further development of IoT, one of which is how to quickly verify the big data obtained from IoT terminals. Aggregate signature is an efficient approach to perform big data authentication. It can effectively reduce the computation and communication overheads. In this paper, utilizing these features, we construct a verifiable data aggregation scheme for Internet of Things, named VDAS, based on an improved certificateless aggregate signature algorithm. In VDAS, the length of the aggregated authentication message is independent of the number of IoT terminals. Then, we prove that VDAS is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen message attacks assuming that the computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Additionally, the proposed VDAS achieves a better trade-off on the computation overheads between the resource-constrained IoT terminals and the data center.
