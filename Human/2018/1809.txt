Organised crime, as well as individual criminals, is benefiting from the protection of private browsers provide to those who would carry out illegal activity, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, the online exchange of child-abuse material, etc. The protection afforded to users of the Epic Privacy Browser illustrates these benefits. This browser is currently in use in approximately 180 countries worldwide. This paper outlines the location and type of evidence available through live and post-mortem state analyses of the Epic Privacy Browser. This study identifies the manner in which the browser functions during use, where evidence can be recovered after use, as well as the tools and effective presentation of the recovered material.
