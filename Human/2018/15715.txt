Concept-Oriented Deep Learning

Concepts are the foundation of human deep learning, understanding, and knowledge integration and transfer. We propose concept-oriented deep learning (CODL) which extends (machine) deep learning with concept representations and conceptual understanding capability. CODL addresses some of the major limitations of deep learning: interpretability, transferability, contextual adaptation, and requirement for lots of labeled training data. We discuss the major aspects of CODL including concept graph, concept representations, concept exemplars, and concept representation learning systems supporting incremental and continual learning.
