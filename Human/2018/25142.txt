Saving Lives at Sea with UAV-assisted Wireless Networks

In this paper, we investigate traits and trade-offs of a system combining UAVs with BS or C-RAN for extending the terrestrial wireless coverage over the sea in emergency situations. Results for an over the sea deployment link budget show the trade-off between power consumption and throughput to meet the Search and Rescue targets.
