Uniform Interpolation for Propositional and Modal Team Logics

In this paper we consider Modal Team Logic, a generalization of Classical Modal Logic in which it is possible to describe dependence phenomena between data. We prove that most known fragment of Full Modal Team Logic allow the elimination of the so called "existential bisimulation quantifiers", where the existence of a certain set is made modulo bisimulation. As a consequence, we prove that these fragments enjoy the Uniform Interpolation Property.
