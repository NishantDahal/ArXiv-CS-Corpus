Hilbert quasi-polynomial for order domains and application to coding theory

We present an application of Hilbert quasi-polynomials to order domains, allowing the effective check of the second order-domain condition in a direct way. We also provide an improved algorithm for the computation of the related Hilbert quasi-polynomials. This allows to identify order domain codes more easily.
