Slugbot: An Application of a Novel and Scalable Open Domain Socialbot Framework

In this paper we introduce a novel, open domain socialbot for the Amazon Alexa Prize competition, aimed at carrying on friendly conversations with users on a variety of topics. We present our modular system, highlighting our different data sources and how we use the human mind as a model for data management. Additionally we build and employ natural language understanding and information retrieval tools and APIs to expand our knowledge bases. We describe our semistructured, scalable framework for crafting topic-specific dialogue flows, and give details on our dialogue management schemes and scoring mechanisms. Finally we briefly evaluate the performance of our system and observe the challenges that an open domain socialbot faces.
