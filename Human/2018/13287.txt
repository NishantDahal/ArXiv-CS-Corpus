Open-Access Full-Duplex Wireless in the ORBIT Testbed

In order to support experimentation with full-duplex (FD) wireless, we recently integrated an open-access FD transceiver in the ORBIT testbed. In this report, we present the design and implementation of the FD transceiver and interfaces, and provide examples and guidelines for experimentation. In particular, an ORBIT node with a National Instruments (NI)/Ettus Research Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 software-defined radio (SDR) was equipped with the Columbia FlexICoN Gen-1 customized RF self-interference (SI) canceller box. The RF canceller box includes an RF SI canceller that is implemented using discrete components on a printed circuit board (PCB) and achieves 40dB RF SI cancellation across 5MHz bandwidth. We provide an FD transceiver baseline program and present two example FD experiments where 90dB and 85dB overall SI cancellation is achieved for a simple waveform and PSK modulated signals across both the RF and digital domains. We also discuss potential FD wireless experiments that can be conducted based on the implemented open-access FD transceiver and baseline program.
