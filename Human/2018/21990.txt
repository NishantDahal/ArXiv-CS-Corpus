Statistics on Open Access Books Available through the Directory of Open Access Books

Open Access (OA) books available through the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) are investigated and the number of titles, the distribution of subjects, languages, publishers, publication years, licensing patterns, etc., are clarified. Their chronological changes are also shown. The sample comprised 10,866 OA books, which were available through the DOAB as of February 24, 2018. The results show that OA books are increasing in number at an accelerating rate. As for distribution of subjects, Social Sciences ("H" in the Library of Congress Classification [LCC] codes), Science ("Q" in LCC) and World History and History of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, etc. ("D" in LCC) are the most popular. As for languages, English, French, and German are the most popular. As for publishers, Frontiers Media SA, Presses universitaires de Rennes, and ANU Press are the most popular. Many books are newly published ones, but older books, published in or before 1999, also began to be available recently. As for the licensing patterns, "CC by-nc-nd" and "CC by" are the most popular. Considering these tendencies, libraries should begin to utilize OA books.
