Motion and Cooperative Transportation Planning for Multi-Agent Systems under Temporal Logic Formulas

This paper presents a hybrid control framework for the motion planning of a multi-agent system including N robotic agents and M objects, under high level goals expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. In particular, we design control protocols that allow the transition of the agents as well as the cooperative transportation of the objects by the agents, among predefined regions of interest in the workspace. This allows to abstract the coupled behavior of the agents and the objects as a finite transition system and to design a high-level multi-agent plan that satisfies the agents' and the objects' specifications, given as temporal logic formulas. Simulation results verify the proposed framework.
