Free software in electronic learning future teachers of mathematics, physics and computer science

Popularity of the use of free software in the IT industry is much higher than its popular use in educational activities. Disadvantages of free software and problems of its implementation in the educational process is a limiting factor for its use in the education system, however, openness, accessibility and functionality are the main factors for the introduction of free software in the educational process.
