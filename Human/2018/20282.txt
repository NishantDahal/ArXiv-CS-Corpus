Resource and Competence (Internal) View vs. Environment and Market (External) View when defining a Business

Startups is a popular phenomenon that has a significant impact on global economy growth, innovation and society development. However, there is still insufficient understanding about startups, particularly, how to start a new business in the relation to consequent performance. Toward this knowledge, we have performed an empirical study regarding the differences between a Resource and Competence View (Internal) vs Environment and Market View (External) when defining a Business. 701 entrepreneurs have reflected on their startups on nine classes of Resources (values, vision, personal objectives, employees and partners, buildings and rental contracts, cash and credit, patents, IPR's and brands, products and services and finally revenues and grants) and three elements of the Business Mission ("KeyContribution", "KeyMarket" and "Distinction"). It seems to be a tendency to favour the Internal View over the External View. This tendency is clearer in Stable Economies (Europe) than in Emerging Economies (South Africa). There seems to be a co-variation between the tendency to favour the Internal View and the tendency to focus on adding Resources. Finally, we found that an order-based analysis seems to explain the differences between the two views better than a number-based method.
