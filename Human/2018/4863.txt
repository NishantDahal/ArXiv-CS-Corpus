POMDP Model Learning for Human Robot Collaboration

Recent years have seen human robot collaboration (HRC) quickly emerged as a hot research area at the intersection of control, robotics, and psychology. While most of the existing work in HRC focused on either low-level human-aware motion planning or HRC interface design, we are particularly interested in a formal design of HRC with respect to high-level complex missions, where it is of critical importance to obtain an accurate and meanwhile tractable human model. Instead of assuming the human model is given, we ask whether it is reasonable to learn human models from observed perception data, such as the gesture, eye movements, head motions of the human in concern. As our initial step, we adopt a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model in this work as mounting evidences have suggested Markovian properties of human behaviors from psychology studies. In addition, POMDP provides a general modeling framework for sequential decision making where states are hidden and actions have stochastic outcomes. Distinct from the majority of POMDP model learning literature, we do not assume that the state, the transition structure or the bound of the number of states in POMDP model is given. Instead, we use a Bayesian non-parametric learning approach to decide the potential human states from data. Then we adopt an approach inspired by probably approximately correct (PAC) learning to obtain not only an estimation of the transition probability but also a confidence interval associated to the estimation. Then, the performance of applying the control policy derived from the estimated model is guaranteed to be sufficiently close to the true model. Finally, data collected from a driver-assistance test-bed are used to train the model, which illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed learning method.
