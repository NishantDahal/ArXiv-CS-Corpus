Reliable graph-based collaborative ranking

GRank is a recent graph-based recommendation approach the uses a novel heterogeneous information network to model users' priorities and analyze it to directly infer a recommendation list. Unfortunately, GRank neglects the semantics behind different types of paths in the network and during the process, it may use unreliable paths that are inconsistent with the general idea of similarity in neighborhood collaborative ranking. That negligence undermines the reliability of the recommendation list generated by GRank. This paper seeks to present a novel framework for reliable graph-based collaborative ranking, called ReGRank, that ranks items based on reliable recommendation paths that are in harmony with the semantics behind different approaches in neighborhood collaborative ranking. To our knowledge, ReGRank is the first unified framework for neighborhood collaborative ranking that in addition to traditional user-based collaborative ranking, can also be adapted for preference-based and representative-based collaborative ranking as well. Experimental results show that ReGRank significantly improves the state-of-the art neighborhood and graph-based collaborative ranking algorithms.
