Vector Learning for Cross Domain Representations

Recently, generative adversarial networks have gained a lot of popularity for image generation tasks. However, such models are associated with complex learning mechanisms and demand very large relevant datasets. This work borrows concepts from image and video captioning models to form an image generative framework. The model is trained in a similar fashion as recurrent captioning model and uses the learned weights for image generation. This is done in an inverse direction, where the input is a caption and the output is an image. The vector representation of the sentence and frames are extracted from an encoder-decoder model which is initially trained on similar sentence and image pairs. Our model conditions image generation on a natural language caption. We leverage a sequence-to-sequence model to generate synthetic captions that have the same meaning for having a robust image generation. One key advantage of our method is that the traditional image captioning datasets can be used for synthetic sentence paraphrases. Results indicate that images generated through multiple captions are better at capturing the semantic meaning of the family of captions.
