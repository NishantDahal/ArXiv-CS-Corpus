Multi-Terminal Codes Using Constrained-Random-Number Generators

A general multi-terminal source code and a general multi-terminal channel code are presented. Constrained-random-number generators with sparse matrices, which are building blocks for the code construction, are used in the construction of both encoders and decoders. Achievable regions for source coding and channel coding are derived in terms of entropy functions, where the capacity region for channel coding provides an alternative to the region of [Somekh-Baruch and Verd√∫, ISIT2006].
