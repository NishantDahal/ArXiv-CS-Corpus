An Iterative Boundary Random Walks Algorithm for Interactive Image Segmentation

The interactive image segmentation algorithm can provide an intelligent ways to understand the intention of user input. Many interactive methods have the problem of that ask for large number of user input. To efficient produce intuitive segmentation under limited user input is important for industrial application. In this paper, we reveal a positive feedback system on image segmentation to show the pixels of self-learning. Two approaches, iterative random walks and boundary random walks, are proposed for segmentation potential, which is the key step in feedback system. Experiment results on image segmentation indicates that proposed algorithms can obtain more efficient input to random walks. And higher segmentation performance can be obtained by applying the iterative boundary random walks algorithm.
