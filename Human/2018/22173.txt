SlimNets: An Exploration of Deep Model Compression and Acceleration

Deep neural networks have achieved increasingly accurate results on a wide variety of complex tasks. However, much of this improvement is due to the growing use and availability of computational resources (e.g use of GPUs, more layers, more parameters, etc). Most state-of-the-art deep networks, despite performing well, over-parameterize approximate functions and take a significant amount of time to train. With increased focus on deploying deep neural networks on resource constrained devices like smart phones, there has been a push to evaluate why these models are so resource hungry and how they can be made more efficient. This work evaluates and compares three distinct methods for deep model compression and acceleration: weight pruning, low rank factorization, and knowledge distillation. Comparisons on VGG nets trained on CIFAR10 show that each of the models on their own are effective, but that the true power lies in combining them. We show that by combining pruning and knowledge distillation methods we can create a compressed network 85 times smaller than the original, all while retaining 96% of the original model's accuracy.
