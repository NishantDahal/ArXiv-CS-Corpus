A Generic Information and Consent Framework for the IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) raises specific issues in terms of information and consent, which makes the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  challenging in this context. In this report, we propose a generic framework for information and consent in the IoT which is protective both for data subjects and for data controllers. We present a high level description of the framework, illustrate its generality through several technical solutions and case studies, and sketch a prototype implementation.
