A Framework for Wasserstein-1-Type Metrics

We propose a unifying framework for generalising the Wasserstein-1 metric to a discrepancy measure between nonnegative measures of different mass. This generalization inherits the convexity and computational efficiency from the Wasserstein-1 metric, and it includes several previous approaches from the literature as special cases. For various specific instances of the generalized Wasserstein-1 metric we furthermore demonstrate their usefulness in applications by numerical experiments.
