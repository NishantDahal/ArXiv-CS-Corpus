Compressive Time-of-Flight 3D Imaging Using Block-Structured Sensing Matrices

Spatially and temporally highly resolved depth information enables numerous applications including human-machine interaction in gaming or safety functions in the automotive industry. In this paper, we address this issue using Time-of-flight (ToF) 3D cameras which are compact devices providing highly resolved depth information. Practical restrictions often require to reduce the amount of data to be read-out and transmitted. Using standard ToF cameras, this can only be achieved by lowering the spatial or temporal resolution. To overcome such a limitation, we propose a compressive ToF camera design using block-structured sensing matrices that allows to reduce the amount of data while keeping high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose the use of efficient reconstruction algorithms based on l^1-minimization and TV-regularization. The reconstruction methods are applied to data captured by a real ToF camera system and evaluated in terms of reconstruction quality and computational effort. For both, l^1-minimization and TV-regularization, we use a local as well as a global reconstruction strategy. For all considered instances, global TV-regularization turns out to clearly perform best in terms of evaluation metrics including the PSNR.
