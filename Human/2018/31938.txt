Alert Correlation Algorithms: A Survey and Taxonomy

Alert correlation is a system which receives alerts from heterogeneous Intrusion Detection Systems and reduces false alerts, detects high level patterns of attacks, increases the meaning of occurred incidents, predicts the future states of attacks, and detects root cause of attacks. To reach these goals, many algorithms have been introduced in the world with many advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we are trying to present a comprehensive survey on already proposed alert correlation algorithms. The approach of this survey is mainly focused on algorithms in correlation engines which can work in enterprise and practical networks. Having this aim in mind, many features related to accuracy, functionality, and computation power are introduced and all algorithm categories are assessed with these features. The result of this survey shows that each category of algorithms has its own strengths and an ideal correlation frameworks should be carried the strength feature of each category.
