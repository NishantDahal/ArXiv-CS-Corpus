Graph-Based Algorithm for a User-Aware SaaS Approach: Computing Optimal Distribution

As a tool to exploit economies of scale, Software as a Service cloud models promote Multi-Tenancy which is the notion of sharing instances among a large group of tenants. However, Multi-Tenancy only satisfies requirements that are common to all tenants as well as the fact that tenants themselves hesitate about sharing. In a try to solve this problem, the present paper propose a User-Aware approach for Software as a Service models using Rich-Variant Components. The main contribution of this approach is a framework summarized in a graph-based algorithm enabling deduction of an optimal distribution of instances on application's tenants. To illustrate and evaluate the framework, the approach is applied on a Software as a Service Application for private school management.
