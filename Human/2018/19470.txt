An efficient Moving Morphable Component (MMC)-based approach for multi-resolution topology optimization

In the present work, a highly efficient Moving Morphable Component (MMC) based approach for multi-resolution topology optimization is proposed. In this approach, high-resolution optimization results can be obtained with much less number of degrees of freedoms (DOFs) and design variables since the finite element analysis model and the design optimization model are totally decoupled in the MMC-based problem formulation. This is achieved by introducing super-elements for structural response analysis and adopting a domain decomposition strategy to preserve the topology complexity of optimized structures. Both two-and three-dimensional numerical results demonstrate that substantial computational efforts can be saved with use of the proposed approach.
