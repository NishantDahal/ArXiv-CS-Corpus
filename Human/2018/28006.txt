Actor-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Multichannel Access

We consider the dynamic multichannel access problem, which can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We first propose a model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning based framework to explore the sensing policy. To evaluate the performance of the proposed sensing policy and the framework's tolerance against uncertainty, we test the framework in scenarios with different channel switching patterns and consider different switching probabilities. Then, we consider a time-varying environment to identify the adaptive ability of the proposed framework. Additionally, we provide comparisons with the Deep-Q network (DQN) based framework proposed in [1], in terms of both average reward and the time efficiency.
