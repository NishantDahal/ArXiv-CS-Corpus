Gelly-Scheduling: Distributed Graph Processing for Network Service Placement in Community Networks

Community networks (CNs) have seen an increase in the last fifteen years. Their members contact nodes which operate Internet proxies, web servers, user file storage and video streaming services, to name a few. Detecting communities of nodes with properties (such as co-location) and assessing node eligibility for service placement is thus a key-factor in optimizing the experience of users. We present a novel solution for the problem of service placement as a two-phase approach, based on: 1) community finding using a scalable graph label propagation technique and 2) a decentralized election procedure to address the multi-objective challenge of optimizing service placement in CNs. Herein we: i) highlight the applicability of leader election heuristics which are important for service placement in community networks and scheduler-dependent scenarios; ii) present a parallel and distributed solution designed as a scalable alternative for the problem of service placement, which has mostly seen computational approaches based on centralization and sequential execution.
