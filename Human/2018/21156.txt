On Energy Efficiency of Networks for Composable Datacentre Infrastructures

This paper evaluates the optimal scale of datacentre (DC) resource disaggregation for composable DC infrastructures and investigates the impact of present day silicon photonics technologies on the energy efficiency of different composable DC infrastructures. We formulated a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to this end. Our results show that present day silicon photonics technologies enable better network energy efficiency for rack-scale composable DCs compared to pod-scale composable DCs despite reported similarities in CPU and memory resource power consumption.
