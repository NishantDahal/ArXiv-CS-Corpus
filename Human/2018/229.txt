Interactive Generative Adversarial Networks for Facial Expression Generation in Dyadic Interactions

A social interaction is a social exchange between two or more individuals,where individuals modify and adjust their behaviors in response to their interaction partners. Our social interactions are one of most fundamental aspects of our lives and can profoundly affect our mood, both positively and negatively. With growing interest in virtual reality and avatar-mediated interactions,it is desirable to make these interactions natural and human like to promote positive effect in the interactions and applications such as intelligent tutoring systems, automated interview systems and e-learning. In this paper, we propose a method to generate facial behaviors for an agent. These behaviors include facial expressions and head pose and they are generated considering the users affective state. Our models learn semantically meaningful representations of the face and generate appropriate and temporally smooth facial behaviors in dyadic interactions.
