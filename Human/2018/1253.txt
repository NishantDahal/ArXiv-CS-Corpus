Neural Networks for Information Retrieval

Machine learning plays a role in many aspects of modern IR systems, and deep learning is applied in all of them. The fast pace of modern-day research has given rise to many approaches to many IR problems. The amount of information available can be overwhelming both for junior students and for experienced researchers looking for new research topics and directions. The aim of this full-day tutorial is to give a clear overview of current tried-and-trusted neural methods in IR and how they benefit IR.
