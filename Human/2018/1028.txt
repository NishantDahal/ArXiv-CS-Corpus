Graphene-Based terahertz antennas for area-constrained applications

Terahertz technology has made significant advances in the fields of spectroscopy, imaging and, more recently, wireless communications. In the latter, the use of this frequency band between 0.1 and 10 THz becomes extremely attractive due to the abundance of bandwidth and the potential for low area and power footprints, yet challenging given the large propagation losses and the lack of mature devices and circuits for terahertz operation. Maturity issues aside, this combination of features renders terahertz wireless communications desirable for highly integrated applications where area may be a decisive metric.
