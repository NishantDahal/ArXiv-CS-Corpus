Joint MMSE Transceiver Design for Downlink Heterogeneous Network

In this paper, we propose a minimum mean square error (MMSE) based transceiver design scheme for a downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-tier heterogeneous network with general linear equality per-cell power constraints. Three practical channel models with both perfect and imperfect channel state information are used in simulations. In each channel model, we consider two system configurations, two data transmission schemes and two cellular cooperation scenarios. Our study shows that the proposed MMSE scheme is more flexible than interference alignment (IA) based scheme. For the cases where the IA-type scheme is applicable, the proposed scheme generally outperforms IA-type scheme in terms of average sum rate and bit error rate (BER), but is computationally more complex than the IA-type scheme.
