Charge-based superconducting digital logic family using quantum phase-slip junctions

Superconducting digital computing systems, primarily involving Josephson junctions are actively being pursued as high performance and low energy dissipating alternatives to CMOS-based technologies for petascale and exascale computers, although several challenges still exist in overcoming barriers to practically implement these technologies. In this paper, we present an alternative superconducting logic structure: quantized charge-based logic circuits using quantum phase-slip junctions, which have been identified as dual devices to Josephson junctions. Basic principles of logic implementation using quantum phase-slips are presented in simulations with the help of a SPICE model that has been developed for the quantum phase-slip structures. Circuit elements that form the building blocks for complex logic circuit design are introduced. Two different logic gate designs: OR gate and XOR gate are presented to demonstrate the usage of the building blocks introduced.
