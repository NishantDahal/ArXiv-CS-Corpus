Characterizing QoS Parameters and Application of Soft-QoS Scheme for 3G Wireless Networks

In wireless communication systems, Quality of Service (QoS) is one of the most important issues from both the users and operators point of view. All the parameters related to QoS are not same important for all users and applications. The satisfaction level of different users also does not depend on same QoS parameters. In this paper, we discuss the QoS parameters and then propose a priority order of QoS parameters based on protocol layers and service applications. We present the relation among the QoS parameters those influence the performance of other QoS parameters and, finally, we demonstrate the numerical analysis results for our proposed soft-QoS scheme to reduce the dropped call rate which is the most important QoS parameter for all types of services
