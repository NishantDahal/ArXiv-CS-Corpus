Machine Learning Guidance and Proof Certification for Connection Tableaux

Connection calculi allow for very compact implementations of goal-directed proof search. We give an overview of our work related to connection tableaux calculi: First, we show optimised functional implementations of clausal and nonclausal proof search, including a consistent Skolemisation procedure for machine learning. Then, we show two guidance methods based on machine learning, namely reordering of proof steps with Naive Bayesian probablities, and expansion of a proof search tree with Monte Carlo Tree Search. Finally, we give a translation of connection proofs to LK, enabling proof certification and automatic proof search in interactive theorem provers.
