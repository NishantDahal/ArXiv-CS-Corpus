"Press Space to Fire": Automatic Video Game Tutorial Generation

We propose the problem of tutorial generation for games, i.e. to generate tutorials which can teach players to play games, as an AI problem. This problem can be approached in several ways, including generating natural language descriptions of game rules, generating instructive game levels, and generating demonstrations of how to play a game using agents that play in a human-like manner. We further argue that the General Video Game AI framework provides a useful testbed for addressing this problem.
