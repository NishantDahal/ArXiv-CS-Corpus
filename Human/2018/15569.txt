Progressive Simplification of Polygonal Curves

Simplifying polygonal curves at different levels of detail is an important problem with many applications. Existing geometric optimization algorithms are only capable of minimizing the complexity of a simplified curve for a single level of detail. We present an $O(n^3m)$-time algorithm that takes a polygonal curve of n vertices and produces a set of consistent simplifications for m scales while minimizing the cumulative simplification complexity. This algorithm is compatible with distance measures such as the Hausdorff, the Fr√©chet and area-based distances, and enables simplification for continuous scaling in $O(n^5)$ time. To speed up this algorithm in practice, we present new techniques for constructing and representing so-called shortcut graphs. Experimental evaluation of these techniques on trajectory data reveals a significant improvement of using shortcut graphs for progressive and non-progressive curve simplification, both in terms of running time and memory usage.
