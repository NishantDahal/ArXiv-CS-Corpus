Palindromes in starlike trees

In this note, we obtain an upper bound on the maximum number of distinct non-empty palindromes in starlike trees. This bound implies, in particular, that there are at most $4n$ distinct non-empty palindromes in a starlike tree with three branches each of length $n$. For such starlike trees labelled with a binary alphabet, we sharpen the upper bound to $4n-1$ and conjecture that the actual maximum is $4n-2$. It is intriguing that this simple conjecture seems difficult to prove, in contrast to the straightforward proof of the bound.
