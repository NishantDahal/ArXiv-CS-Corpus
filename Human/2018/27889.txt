Incremental SAT Library Integration Using Abstract Stobjs

We describe an effort to soundly use off-the-shelf incremental SAT solvers within ACL2 by modeling the behavior of a SAT solver library as an abstract stobj.  The interface allows ACL2 programs to use incremental SAT solvers, and the abstract stobj model allows us to reason about the behavior of an incremental SAT library so as to show that algorithms implemented using it are correct, as long as the library is bug-free.
