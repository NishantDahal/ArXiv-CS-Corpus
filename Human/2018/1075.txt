Assessment of SFSDP Cooperative Localization Algorithm for WLAN Environment

Cooperative localization for indoor WiFi networks have received little attention thus far. Many cooperative location algorithms exist for Wireless Sensor Network Applications but their suitability for WiFi based networks has not been studied. In this paper the performance of the Sparse Finite Semi Definite Program (SFSDP) has been examined using real measurements data and under different indoor conditions. Effects of other network parameters such as varying number of anchors and blind nodes are also included.
