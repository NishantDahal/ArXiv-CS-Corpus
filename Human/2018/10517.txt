ROBOTIKANDO: a Web Tool for Supporting Teacher Practicing Robotics in Kindergarten

This paper describes ROBOTIKANDO, a web application for supporting both kindergarten teachers in planning educational robotics activities and educational robotics experts who would like to share their knowledge and experience. ROBOTIKANDO has been designed and implemented following a co-design process, which devised a conceptual map aiming to connect educational robotics and kindergarten education principles. As future work, we are planning a longitudinal evaluation with Preschools teachers. Moreover, we are thinking of extending the application to teachers of primary and secondary schools.
