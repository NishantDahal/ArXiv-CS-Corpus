Visual Weather Temperature Prediction

In this paper, we attempt to employ convolutional recurrent neural networks for weather temperature estimation using only image data. We study ambient temperature estimation based on deep neural networks in two scenarios a) estimating temperature of a single outdoor image, and b) predicting temperature of the last image in an image sequence. In the first scenario, visual features are extracted by a convolutional neural network trained on a large-scale image dataset. We demonstrate that promising performance can be obtained, and analyze how volume of training data influences performance. In the second scenario, we consider the temporal evolution of visual appearance, and construct a recurrent neural network to predict the temperature of the last image in a given image sequence. We obtain better prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art models. Further, we investigate how performance varies when information is extracted from different scene regions, and when images are captured in different daytime hours. Our approach further reinforces the idea of using only visual information for cost efficient weather prediction in the future.
