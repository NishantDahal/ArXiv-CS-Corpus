Social Algorithms

This article concerns the review of a special class of swarm intelligence based algorithms for solving optimization problems and these algorithms can be referred to as social algorithms. Social algorithms use multiple agents and the social interactions to design rules for algorithms so as to mimic certain successful characteristics of the social/biological systems such as ants, bees, bats, birds and animals.
