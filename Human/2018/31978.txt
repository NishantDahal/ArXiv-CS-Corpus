Cooperative Spectrum Sharing Between D2D Users and Edge-Users: A Matching Theory Perspective

The device-to-device (D2D) communication theoretically provides both the cellular traffic offloading and convenient content delivery directly among proximity users. However, in practice, no matter in underlay or overlay mode, the employment of D2D may impair the performance of the cellular links. Therefore, it is important to design a spectrum sharing scheme, under which the performance of both links can be improved simultaneously. In this paper, we consider the cell-edge user (CEU) scenario, where both sides have the demand to improve the quality of experience or service. Therefore, CEUs and D2D users both have intentions to form pairs, namely, CEU-D2D pairs, to cooperate mutually. Different from the conventional equilibrium point evaluation, the stable matching between D2D users and CEUs are formulated under matching theory framework instead. For each CEU-D2D pair, a two-stage pricing-based Stackelberg game is modeled to describe the willingness to cooperate, where the win-win goal is reached finally.
