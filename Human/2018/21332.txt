Energy-Efficient Multi-View Video Transmission with View Synthesis-Enabled Multicast

Multi-view videos (MVVs) provide immersive viewing experience, at the cost of heavy load to wireless networks. Except for further improving viewing experience, view synthesis can create multicast opportunities for efficient transmission of MVVs in multiuser wireless networks, which has not been recognized in existing literature. In this paper, we would like to exploit view synthesis-enabled multicast opportunities for energy-efficient MVV transmission in a multiuser wireless network. Specifically, we first establish a mathematical model to characterize the impact of view synthesis on multicast opportunities and energy consumption. Then, we consider the optimization of view selection, transmission time and power allocation to minimize the weighted sum energy consumption for view transmission and synthesis, which is a challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. We propose an algorithm to obtain an optimal solution with reduced computational complexity by exploiting optimality properties. To further reduce computational complexity, we also propose two low-complexity algorithms to obtain two suboptimal solutions, based on continuous relaxation and Difference of Convex (DC) programming, respectively. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed solutions.
