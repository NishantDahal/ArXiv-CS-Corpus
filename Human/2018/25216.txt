PEP Analysis of Selective Decode and Forward Protocol over Keyhole Fading

We provide a closed form upper bound formulation for the average pairwise-error probability (PEP) of selective decode and forward (SDF) cooperation protocol for a keyhole (pinhole) channel condition. We have employed orthogonal space-time block-code scheme (OSTBC) in conjunction with multi-antenna (MIMO) technology. We have used moment generating function (MGF) based approach for deriving the upper bound of PEP. PEP expression provides information regarding the performance of the wireless system with respect to the channel conditions. We have included simulation results which confirm the analytical results of our proposed upper bound. Simulation results show that due to keyhole effect performance of wireless system degrades.
