Delivery-Secrecy Tradeoff for Cache-Enabled Stochastic Networks: Content Placement Optimization

Wireless caching has been widely recognized as a promising technique for efficient content delivery. In this paper, by taking different file secrecy levels into consideration, physical-layer security oriented content placement is optimized in a stochastic cache-enabled cellular network. We propose an analytical framework to investigate the nontrivial file delivery-secrecy tradeoff. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expressions for the file hit and secrecy probabilities. The global optimal probabilistic content placement policy is then analytically derived in terms of hit probability maximization under file secrecy constraints. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our analytical findings and show that the targeted file secrecy levels are crucial in balancing the file delivery-secrecy tradeoff.
