Repairing Multiple Failures for Scalar MDS Codes

In distributed storage, erasure codes -- like Reed-Solomon Codes -- are often employed to provide reliability. In this setting, it is desirable to be able to repair one or more failed nodes while minimizing the repair bandwidth. In this work, motivated by Reed-Solomon codes, we study the problem of repairing multiple failed nodes in a scalar MDS code. We extend the framework of (Guruswami and Wootters, 2017) to give a framework for constructing repair schemes for multiple failures in general scalar MDS codes, in the centralized repair model. We then specialize our framework to Reed-Solomon codes, and extend and improve upon recent results of (Dau et al., 2017).
