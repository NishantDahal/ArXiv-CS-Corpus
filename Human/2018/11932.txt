On Neighbourhood Zagreb index of product graphs

There is powerful relation between the chemical behaviour of chemical compounds and their molecular structures. Topological indices defined on these chemical molecular structures are capable to predict physical properties, chemical reactivity and biological activity. In this article, a new topological index named as Neighbourhood Zagreb index $(M_N)$ is presented. Here the chemical importance of this newly introduced index is studied and some explicit results for this index of different product graphs such as Cartesian, Tensor and Wreath product is derived. Some of these results are applied to obtain the Neighbourhood Zagreb index of several chemically important graphs and nano-structures.
