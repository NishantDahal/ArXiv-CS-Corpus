An exploration of algorithmic discrimination in data and classification

Algorithmic discrimination is an important aspect when data is used for predictive purposes. This paper analyzes the relationships between discrimination and classification, data set partitioning, and decision models, as well as correlation. The paper uses real world data sets to demonstrate the existence of discrimination and the independence between the discrimination of data sets and the discrimination of classification models.
