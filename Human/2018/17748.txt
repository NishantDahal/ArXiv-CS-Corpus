Mutual Influences in Interwoven Systems and their detection in the context of Organic Computing

Technical systems have evolved over time into large and complex Interwoven Systems consisting of several to a huge number of (possibly heterogeneous) subsystems that have interdependencies. The resultant mutual influences among subsystems have made them so complex that they are no longer manageable by humans and it is assumed to intensify rapidly. Identifying such mutual influences is the first step towards mastering the complexity of such systems. This paper presents mutual influences in Interwoven Systems by describing real-world examples and a methodology to detect them in the context of Organic Computing. The methodology is evaluated with the help of an example. Further, a taxonomy of Organic Computing applications helpful for selecting suitable methods for detecting hidden mutual influences is described briefly.
