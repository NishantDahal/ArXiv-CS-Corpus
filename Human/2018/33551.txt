A Comprehensive View on Quality Characteristics of the IoT Solutions

Categorization of quality characteristics helps in a more effective structuring of the testing process and in the determination of properties, which can be verified in the system under test. In the emerging area of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, several individual attempts have been made to summarize these aspects, but the previous work is rather heterogenic and focuses on specific subareas. Hence, we consolidated the quality characteristics into one unified view, which specifically emphasizes the aspects of security, privacy, reliability and usability, as these aspects are of often quoted as major challenges in the quality of contemporary IoT systems. The consolidated view also covers other areas of system quality, which are relevant for IoT system testing and quality assurance. In the paper, we also discuss relevant synonyms of particular quality characteristics as presented in the literature or being used in the current industry praxis. The consolidated view uses two levels of characteristics to maintain a suitable level of granularity and specificity in the discussed quality characteristics.
