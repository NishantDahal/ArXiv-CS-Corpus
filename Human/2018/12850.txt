Cooperative system of emission source localization based on SDF

Efficient and precise location of emission sources in an urbanized environment is very important in electronic warfare. Therefore, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for such tasks. In this paper, we present the cooperation of several UAVs creating a wireless sensor network (WSN) that locates the emission source. In the proposed WSN, the location is based on spectrum sensing and the signal Doppler frequency method. The paper presents the concept of the system. Simulation studies are used to assess the efficiency of the cooperative WSN. In this case, the location effectiveness for the WSN is compared to the single UAV.
