Alpha-rooting color image enhancement method by two-side 2-D quaternion discrete Fourier transform followed by spatial transformation

In this paper a quaternion approach of enhancement method is proposed in which color in the image is considered as a single entity. This new method is referred as the alpha-rooting method of color image enhancement by the two-dimensional quaternion discrete Fourier transform (2-D QDFT) followed by a spatial transformation. The results of the proposed color image enhancement method are compared with its counterpart channel-by-channel enhancement algorithm by the 2-D DFT. The image enhancements are quantified to the enhancement measure that is based on visual perception referred as the color enhancement measure estimation (CEME). The preliminary experiment results show that the quaternion approach of image enhancement is an effective color image enhancement technique.
