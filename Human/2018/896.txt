On the effect of blockage objects in dense MIMO SWIPT networks

Simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) is characterised by the ambiguous role of multi-user interference. In short, the beneficial effect of multi-user interference on RF energy harvesting is obtained at the price of a reduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs between the achievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor environments, this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to blockage objects like walls. Hence, a couple of fundamental questions arise. How much must the network elements be densified to counteract the blockage attenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy trade-off? In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled network in the attempt to shed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined with the help of a stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred to as power heads) are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are generated through a Manhattan Poisson Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of the signal attenuation and the multi-user interference is studied to obtain the Joint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information rate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function of the frequency of walls to emphasise the cross-dependences between the deployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue.
