Peekaboo - Where are the Objects? Structure Adjusting Superpixels

This paper addresses the search for a fast and meaningful image segmentation in the context of $k$-means clustering. The proposed method builds on a widely-used local version of Lloyd's algorithm, called Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). We propose an algorithm which extends SLIC to dynamically adjust the local search, adopting superpixel resolution dynamically to structure existent in the image, and thus provides for more meaningful superpixels in the same linear runtime as standard SLIC. The proposed method is evaluated against state-of-the-art techniques and improved boundary adherence and undersegmentation error are observed, whilst still remaining among the fastest algorithms which are tested.
