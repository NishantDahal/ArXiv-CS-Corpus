DeepEmo: Learning and Enriching Pattern-Based Emotion Representations

We propose a graph-based mechanism to extract rich-emotion bearing patterns, which fosters a deeper analysis of online emotional expressions, from a corpus. The patterns are then enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Moreover, we conduct analysis on the emotion-oriented patterns to demonstrate its applicability and to explore its properties. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed techniques outperform most state-of-the-art emotion recognition techniques.
