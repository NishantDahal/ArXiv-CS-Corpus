The nested materiality of environmental monitoring

Present knowledge about the marine ecosystem on the Norwegian Continental Shelf towards the Arctic is sparse. These areas are vast, remote and subject to harsh weather conditions. We report from a three-year case study of an ongoing effort for real-time, subsea environmental monitoring by an oil and gas operator. The facts about the subsea environment are anything but neutral; they are intrinsically caught up with the material means by which they are known. The marine ecosystem is monitored through a network of sensors, communication links, visualisation and analysis tools. Our concept of nested materiality draws heavily on perspectives in sociomateriality but highlights (i) the distributed and interconnected infrastructure of the material means (as opposed to artefact-centric) and (ii) in-the-making (as opposed to black-boxed) technology.
