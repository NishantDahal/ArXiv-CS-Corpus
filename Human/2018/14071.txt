Towards automatic initialization of registration algorithms using simulated endoscopy images

Registering images from different modalities is an active area of research in computer aided medical interventions. Several registration algorithms have been developed, many of which achieve high accuracy. However, these results are dependent on many factors, including the quality of the extracted features or segmentations being registered as well as the initial alignment. Although several methods have been developed towards improving segmentation algorithms and automating the segmentation process, few automatic initialization algorithms have been explored. In many cases, the initial alignment from which a registration is initiated is performed manually, which interferes with the clinical workflow. Our aim is to use scene classification in endoscopic procedures to achieve coarse alignment of the endoscope and a preoperative image of the anatomy. In this paper, we show using simulated scenes that a neural network can predict the region of anatomy (with respect to a preoperative image) that the endoscope is located in by observing a single endoscopic video frame. With limited training and without any hyperparameter tuning, our method achieves an accuracy of 76.53 (+/-1.19)%. There are several avenues for improvement, making this a promising direction of research. Code is available at https://github.com/AyushiSinha/AutoInitialization.
