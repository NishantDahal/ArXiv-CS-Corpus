A Deep Learning Approach for Multimodal Deception Detection

Automatic deception detection is an important task that has gained momentum in computational linguistics due to its potential applications. In this paper, we propose a simple yet tough to beat multi-modal neural model for deception detection. By combining features from different modalities such as video, audio, and text along with Micro-Expression features, we show that detecting deception in real life videos can be more accurate. Experimental results on a dataset of real-life deception videos show that our model outperforms existing techniques for deception detection with an accuracy of 96.14% and ROC-AUC of 0.9799.
