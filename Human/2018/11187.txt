Coded Caching via Line Graphs of Bipartite Graphs

We present a coded caching framework using line graphs of bipartite graphs. A clique cover of the line graph describes the uncached subfiles at users. A clique cover of the complement of the square of the line graph gives a transmission scheme that satisfies user demands. We then define a specific class of such caching line graphs, for which the subpacketization, rate, and uncached fraction of the coded caching problem can be captured via its graph theoretic parameters. We present a construction of such caching line graphs using projective geometry. The presented scheme has a rate bounded from above by a constant with subpacketization level $q^{O((log_qK)^2)}$ and uncached fraction $Î˜(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}})$, where $K$ is the number of users and $q$ is a prime power. We also present a subpacketization-dependent lower bound on the rate of coded caching schemes for a given broadcast setup.
