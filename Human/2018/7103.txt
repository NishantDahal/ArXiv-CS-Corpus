Iterative Detection for Orthogonal Precoding in Doubly Selective Channels

Ultra-reliable wireless communication links require the utilization of all diversity sources of a wireless communication channel. Hadani et al. propose a two dimensional discrete symplectic Fourier transform (DSFT) as orthogonal pre-coder for a time-frequency modulation scheme. In this paper we explore \emph{general} orthogonal precoding (OP) and its performance in time- and frequency-selective channels. We show that iterative parallel interference cancellation (PIC) and iterative channel estimation methods can be used for the detection of OP. A scalar signal model for OP transmission is obtained by PIC. Based on this signal model, we can prove that all constant modulus sequences, e.g. the DSFT basis functions or Walsh-Hadamard sequences, lead to the same performance for OP. We validate our receiver structure by numerical link level simulations of a vehicle-to-vehicle communication link with a relative velocity of $0\ldots200\,\text{km/h}$. We demonstrate that OP achieves a gain of about $4.8\,\text{dB}$ if compared to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing at a bit error rate of $10^{-4}$. Our performance results for coded OP are the best results for a fully documented receiver architecture, published so far.
