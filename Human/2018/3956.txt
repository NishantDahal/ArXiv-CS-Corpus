Energy-efficient Deployment of Relay Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks using Evolutionary Techniques

Random deployment of sensor nodes is susceptible to initial communication hole, even when the network is densely populated. However, eliminating holes using structural deployment poses its difficulties. In either case, the resulting coverage holes can degrade overall network performance and lifetime. Many solutions utilizing Relay Nodes (RNs) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this regard, one of the recent solutions proposed using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to deploy RNs. This paper proposes RN deployment using two other evolutionary techniques - Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Differential Evolution (DE) and compares them with existing solution that uses ABC. These popular optimization tools are deployed to optimize the positions of relay nodes for lifetime maximization. Proposed algorithms guarantee satisfactory RNs utilization while maintaining desired connectivity level. It is shown that DE-based deployment improves the network lifetime better than other optimization heuristics considered.
