Analysis of Frequency Agile Radar via Compressed Sensing

Frequency agile radar (FAR) is known to have excellent electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) performance and the potential to realize spectrum sharing in dense electromagnetic environments. Many compressed sensing (CS) based algorithms have been developed for joint range and Doppler estimation in FAR. This paper considers theoretical analysis of FAR via CS algorithms. In particular, we analyze the properties of the sensing matrix, which is a highly structured random matrix. We then derive bounds on the number of recoverable targets. Numerical simulations and field experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of CS approaches to FAR.
