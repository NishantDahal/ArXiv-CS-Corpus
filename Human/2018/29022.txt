DReAM: Dynamic Reconfigurable Architecture Modeling (full paper)

Modern systems evolve in unpredictable environments and have to continuously adapt their behavior to changing conditions. The "DReAM" (Dynamic Reconfigurable Architecture Modeling) framework, has been designed for modeling reconfigurable dynamic systems. It provides a rule-based language, inspired from Interaction Logic, which is expressive and easy to use encompassing all aspects of dynamicity including parametric multi-modal coordination with creation/deletion of components as well as mobility. Additionally, it allows the description of both endogenous/modular and exogenous/centralized coordination styles and sound transformations from one style to the other. The DReAM framework is implemented in the form of a Java API bundled with an execution engine. It allows to develop runnable systems combining the expressiveness of the rule-based notation together with the flexibility of this widespread programming language.
