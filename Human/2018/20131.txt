Antenna Count for Massive MIMO: 1.9 GHz versus 60 GHz

If we assume line-of-sight propagation and perfect channel state information at the base station -- consistent with slow moving terminals -- then a direct performance comparison between single-cell Massive MIMO at PCS and mmWave frequency bands is straightforward and highly illuminating. Line-of-sight propagation is considered favorable for mmWave because of minimal attenuation, and its facilitation of hybrid beamforming to reduce the required number of active transceivers. We quantify the number of mmWave (60 GHz) service antennas that are needed to duplicate the performance of a specified number of PCS (1.9 GHz) service antennas. As a baseline we consider a modest PCS deployment of 128 antennas serving 18 terminals. We find that, to achieve the same per-terminal max-min 95%-likely downlink throughput, 10000 mmWave antennas are needed. To match the total antenna area of the PCS array would require 128000 half-wavelength mmWave antennas, but a much reduced number is adequate because the large number of antennas also confers greater channel orthogonality. The principal alleged benefit of mmWave technology--vast amounts of inexpensive spectrum--is at least partially offset by the complexity of possibly unwieldy amounts of hardware.
