Combined Image Encryption and Steganography Algorithm in the Spatial Domain

In recent years, steganography has emerged as one of the main research areas in information security. Least significant bit (LSB) steganography is one of the fundamental and conventional spatial domain methods, which is capable of hiding larger secret information in a cover image without noticeable visual distortions. In this paper, a combined algorithm based on LSB steganography and chaotic encryption is proposed. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed method. In comparison with existing steganographic spatial domain based algorithms, the suggested algorithm is shown to have some advantages over existing ones, namely, larger key space and a higher level of security against some existing attacks.
