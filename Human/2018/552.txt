Recent Results on Classifying Risk-Based Testing Approaches

In order to optimize the usage of testing efforts and to assess risks of software-based systems, risk-based testing uses risk (re-)assessments to steer all phases in a test process. Several risk-based testing approaches have been proposed in academia and/or applied in industry, so that the determination of principal concepts and methods in risk-based testing is needed to enable a comparison of the weaknesses and strengths of different risk-based testing approaches. In this chapter we provide an (updated) taxonomy of risk-based testing aligned with risk considerations in all phases of a test process. It consists of three top-level classes, i.e., contextual setup, risk assessment, and risk-based test strategy. This taxonomy provides a framework to understand, categorize, assess and compare risk-based testing approaches to support their selection and tailoring for specific purposes. Furthermore, we position four recent risk-based testing approaches into the taxonomy in order to demonstrate its application and alignment with available risk-based testing approaches.
