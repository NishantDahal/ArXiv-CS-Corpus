Golden Angle Modulation: Approaching the AWGN Capacity

In this work, targeting, e.g., future generation cellular, microwave-links, or optical fiber systems, we propose a new geometric shaping design for golden angle modulation (GAM) based on a (double) truncated Gaussian input distribution. The design improves the mutual information (MI), and the peak-to-average power ratio, over the full signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range relative to two key GAM schemes introduced in [1],[2]. Inspired by the proposed geometric shaping, a simpler, SNR-dependent, design is also suggested. The performance is numerically evaluated with respect to MI and compared with classical modulation schemes. With the proposed design, the SNR can be decreased relative to classical quadrature amplitude modulation, even for relatively modest target spectral efficiencies. As the GAM design can approach the Gaussian channel capacity, the power/energy efficiency is expected to improve.
