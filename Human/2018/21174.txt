CellLineNet: End-to-End Learning and Transfer Learning For Multiclass Epithelial Breast cell Line Classification via a Convolutional Neural Network

Computer Vision for Analyzing and Classifying cells and tissues often require rigorous lab procedures and so automated Computer Vision solutions have been sought. Most work in such field usually requires Feature Extractions before the analysis of such features via Machine Learning and Machine Vision algorithms. We developed a Convolutional Neural Network that classifies 5 types of epithelial breast cell lines comprised of two human cancer lines, 2 normal immortalized lines, and 1 immortalized mouse line (MDA-MB-468, MCF7, 10A, 12A and HC11) without requiring feature extraction. The Multiclass Cell Line Classification Convolutional Neural Network extends our earlier work on a Binary Breast Cancer Cell Line Classification model. CellLineNet is 31-layer Convolutional Neural Network trained, validated and tested on a 3,252 image dataset of 5 types of Epithelial Breast cell Lines (MDA-MB-468, MCF7, 10A, 12A and HC11) in an end-to-end fashion. End-to-End Learning enables CellLineNet to identify and learn on its own, visual features and regularities most important to Breast Cancer Cell Line Classification from the dataset of images. Using Transfer Learning, the 28-layer MobileNet Convolutional Neural Network architecture with pre-trained ImageNet weights is extended and fine tuned to the Multiclass Epithelial Breast cell Line Classification problem. CellLineNet simply requires an imaged Cell Line as input and it outputs the type of breast epithelial cell line (MDA-MB-468, MCF7, 10A, 12A or HC11) as predicted probabilities for the 5 classes. CellLineNet scored a 96.67% Accuracy.
