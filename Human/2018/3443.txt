Shapes Characterization on Address Event Representation Using Histograms of Oriented Events and an Extended LBP Approach

Address Event Representation is a thriving technology that could change digital image processing paradigm. This paper proposes a methodology to characterize the shape of objects using the streaming of asynchronous events. A new descriptor that enhances spikes connectivity is associated with two oriented histogram based representations. This paper uses these features to develop both a non-supervised and a supervised multi-classification framework to recognize poker symbols from the Poker-DVS public dataset. The aforementioned framework, which uses a very limited number of events and a simple class modeling, yields results that challenge more sophisticated methodologies proposed by the state of the art. A feature family based on context shapes is applied to the more challenging 2015 Poker-DVS dataset with a supervised classifier obtaining an accuracy of 98.5 %. The system is also applied to the MNIST-DVS dataset yielding an accuracy of 94.6 % and 96.3 % on digit recognition, for scales 4 and 8 respectively.
