An improvement of the asymptotic Elias bound for non-binary codes

For non-binary codes the Elias bound is a good upper bound for the asymptotic information rate at low relative minimum distance, where as the Plotkin bound is better at high relative minimum distance. In this work, we obtain a hybrid of these bounds which improves both. This in turn is based on the anticode bound which is a hybrid of the Hamming and Singleton bounds and improves both bounds.
  The question of convexity of the asymptotic rate function is an important open question. We conjecture a much weaker form of the convexity, and we show that our bounds follow immediately if we assume the conjecture.
