In Design DFM Rule Scoring and Fixing Method using ICV

As compared to DRC rules, DFM rules are a list of selected recommended rules which aim to improve the design margins for better manufacturability. In GLOBALFOUNDRIES, we use DFM scoring methodology as an effective technique to analyze design quality in terms of manufacturability. Physical design engineers can perform our Manufacturability Check Deck (MCD) to asset their design quality during the sign-off stage. In the past, Synopsys users have to convert their design though milkyway database to GDSII format and execute the verification through the third party EDA tools. This method is costly and time-consuming for our Synopsys users. Today, we propose a new and easy-to-use integrated flow which leverages on the ICV engine to provide DFM scoring and in-design fixing techniques. The new methodology address DFM violations early in the design flow and achieve DFM compliance design during sign-off phase.
