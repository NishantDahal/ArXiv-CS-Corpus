Throughput Analysis of Network Coding in Multi-Hop Wireless Mesh Networks Using Queueing Theory

In recent years, a significant amount of research has been conducted to explore the benefits of network coding in different scenarios, from both theoretical and simulation perspectives. In this paper, we utilize queueing theory to propose an analytical framework for bidirectional unicast flows in multi-hop wireless mesh networks, and study throughput of inter-flow network coding. We analytically determine performance metrics such as the probability of successful transmission in terms of collision probability, and feedback mechanism and retransmission. Regarding the coding process, our model uses a multi-class queueing network where coded packets are separated from native packets and have a non-preemptive higher priority over native packets, and both queues are in a stable state. Finally, we use simulations to verify the accuracy of our analytical model.
