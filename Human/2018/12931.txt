Resource Allocation and HARQ Optimization for URLLC Traffic in 5G Wireless Networks

5G wireless networks are expected to support Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) traffic which requires very low packet delays ( < 1 msec.) and extremely high reliability ($\sim$99.999\%). In this paper we focus on the design of a wireless system supporting downlink URLLC traffic. Using a queuing network based model for the wireless system we characterize the effect of various design choices on the maximum URLLC load it can support, including: 1) system parameters such as the bandwidth, link SINR , and QoS requirements; 2) resource allocation schemes in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based systems; and 3) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. Key contributions of this paper which are of practical interest are: 1) study of how the the minimum required system bandwidth to support a given URLLC load scales with associated QoS constraints; 2) characterization of optimal OFDMA resource allocation schemes which maximize the admissible URLLC load; and 3) optimization of a repetition code based HARQ scheme which approximates Chase HARQ combining.
