Algorithms for screening of Cervical Cancer: A chronological review

There are various algorithms and methodologies used for automated screening of cervical cancer by segmenting and classifying cervical cancer cells into different categories. This study presents a critical review of different research papers published that integrated AI methods in screening cervical cancer via different approaches analyzed in terms of typical metrics like dataset size, drawbacks, accuracy etc. An attempt has been made to furnish the reader with an insight of Machine Learning algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machines), GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix), k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbours), MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), spatial fuzzy clustering algorithms, PNNs (Probabilistic Neural Networks), Genetic Algorithm, RFT (Random Forest Trees), C5.0, CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and Hierarchical clustering algorithm for feature extraction, cell segmentation and classification. This paper also covers the publicly available datasets related to cervical cancer. It presents a holistic review on the computational methods that have evolved over the period of time, in chronological order in detection of malignant cells.
