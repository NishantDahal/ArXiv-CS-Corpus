CLEF: Limiting the Damage Caused by Large Flows in the Internet Core (Technical Report)

The detection of network flows that send excessive amounts of traffic is of increasing importance to enforce QoS and to counter DDoS attacks. Large-flow detection has been previously explored, but the proposed approaches can be used on high-capacity core routers only at the cost of significantly reduced accuracy, due to their otherwise too high memory and processing overhead. We propose CLEF, a new large-flow detection scheme with low memory requirements, which maintains high accuracy under the strict conditions of high-capacity core routers. We compare our scheme with previous proposals through extensive theoretical analysis, and with an evaluation based on worst-case-scenario attack traffic. We show that CLEF outperforms previously proposed systems in settings with limited memory.
