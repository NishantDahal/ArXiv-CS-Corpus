An Investigation of the Monitoring Activity in Self Adaptive Systems

Runtime monitoring is essential for the violation detection during the underlying software system execution. In this paper, an investigation of the monitoring activity of MAPE-K control loop is performed which aims at exploring:(1) the architecture of the monitoring activity in terms of the involved components and control and data flow between them; (2) the standard interface of the monitoring component with other MAPE-K components; (3) the adaptive monitoring and its importance to the monitoring overhead issue; and (4) the monitoring mode and its relevance to some specific situations and systems. This paper also presented a Java framework for the monitoring process for self adaptive systems.
