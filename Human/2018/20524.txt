An explicit formula for a weight enumerator of linear-congruence codes

An explicit formula for a weight enumerator of linear-congruence codes is provided. This extends the work of Bibak and Milenkovic [IEEE ISIT (2018) 431-435] addressing the binary case to the non-binary case. Furthermore, the extension simplifies their proof and provides a complete solution to a problem posed by them.
