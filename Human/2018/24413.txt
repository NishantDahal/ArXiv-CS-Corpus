Hyperplane Sections of Determinantal Varieties over Finite Fields and Linear Codes

We determine the number of ${\mathbb{F}}_q$-rational points of hyperplane sections of classical determinantal varieties defined by the vanishing of minors of a fixed size of a generic matrix, and identify sections giving the maximum number of ${\mathbb{F}}_q$-rational points. Further we consider similar questions for sections by linear subvarieties of a fixed codimension in the ambient projective space. This is closely related to the study of linear codes associated to determinantal varieties, and the determination of their weight distribution, minimum distance and generalized Hamming weights. The previously known results about these are generalized and expanded significantly
