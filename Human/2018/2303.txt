Introduction to the SP theory of intelligence

This article provides a brief introduction to the "Theory of Intelligence" and its realisation in the "SP Computer Model". The overall goal of the SP programme of research, in accordance with long-established principles in science, has been the simplification and integration of observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human learning, perception, and cognition. In broad terms, the SP system is a brain-like system that takes in "New" information through its senses and stores some or all of it as "Old" information. A central idea in the system is the powerful concept of "SP-multiple-alignment", borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. This the key to the system's versatility in aspects of intelligence, in the representation of diverse kinds of knowledge, and in the seamless integration of diverse aspects of intelligence and diverse kinds of knowledge, in any combination. There are many potential benefits and applications of the SP system. It is envisaged that the system will be developed as the "SP Machine", which will initially be a software virtual machine, hosted on a high-performance computer, a vehicle for further research and a step towards the development of an industrial-strength SP Machine.
