Protection of Information from Imitation on the Basis of Crypt-Code Structures

A system is offered for imitation resistant transmitting of encrypted information in wireless communication networks on the basis of redundant residue polynomial codes. The particular feature of this solution is complexing of methods for cryptographic protection of information and multi-character codes that correct errors, and the resulting structures (crypt-code structures) ensure stable functioning of the information protection system in the conditions simulating the activity of the adversary. Such approach also makes it possible to create multi-dimensional "crypt-code structures" to conduct multi-level monitoring and veracious restoration of distorted encrypted information. The use of authentication codes as a means of one of the levels to detect erroneous blocks in the ciphertext in combination with the redundant residue polynomial codes of deductions makes it possible to decrease the introduced redundancy and find distorted blocks of the ciphertext to restore them.
