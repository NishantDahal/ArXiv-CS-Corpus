Why do Users Kill HPC Jobs?

Given the cost of HPC clusters, making best use of them is crucial to improve infrastructure ROI. Likewise, reducing failed HPC jobs and related waste in terms of user wait times is crucial to improve HPC user productivity (aka human ROI). While most efforts (e.g.,debugging HPC programs) explore technical aspects to improve ROI of HPC clusters, we hypothesize non-technical (human) aspects are worth exploring to make non-trivial ROI gains; specifically, understanding non-technical aspects and how they contribute to the failure of HPC jobs.
  In this regard, we conducted a case study in the context of Beocat cluster at Kansas State University. The purpose of the study was to learn the reasons why users terminate jobs and to quantify wasted computations in such jobs in terms of system utilization and user wait time. The data from the case study helped identify interesting and actionable reasons why users terminate HPC jobs. It also helped confirm that user terminated jobs may be associated with non-trivial amount of wasted computation, which if reduced can help improve the ROI of HPC clusters.
