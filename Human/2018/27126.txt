BCWS: Bilingual Contextual Word Similarity

This paper introduces the first dataset for evaluating English-Chinese Bilingual Contextual Word Similarity, namely BCWS (https://github.com/MiuLab/BCWS). The dataset consists of 2,091 English-Chinese word pairs with the corresponding sentential contexts and their similarity scores annotated by the human. Our annotated dataset has higher consistency compared to other similar datasets. We establish several baselines for the bilingual embedding task to benchmark the experiments. Modeling cross-lingual sense representations as provided in this dataset has the potential of moving artificial intelligence from monolingual understanding towards multilingual understanding.
