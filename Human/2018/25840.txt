Optimizing City-Wide White-Fi Networks in TV White Spaces

White-Fi refers to WiFi deployed in the TV white spaces. Unlike its ISM band counterparts, White-Fi must obey requirements that protect TV reception. As a result, optimization of citywide White-Fi networks faces the challenges of heterogeneous channel availability and link quality, over location. The former is because, at any location, channels in use by TV networks are not available for use by White-Fi. The latter is because the link quality achievable at a White-Fi receiver is determined by not only its link gain to its transmitter but also by its link gains to TV transmitters and its transmitter's link gains to TV receivers.
  In this work, we model the medium access control (MAC) throughput of a White-Fi network. We propose heuristic algorithms to optimize the throughput, given the described heterogeneity. The algorithms assign power, access probability, and channels to nodes in the network, under the constraint that reception at TV receivers is not compromised. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach over example city-wide White-Fi networks deployed over Denver and Columbus (respectively, low and high channel availability) in the USA, and compare with assignments cognizant of heterogeneity to a lesser degree, for example, akin to FCC regulations.
