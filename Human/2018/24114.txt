Deploying South African Social Honeypots on Twitter

Inspired by the simple, yet effective, method of tweeting gibberish to attract automated social agents (bots), we attempt to create localised honeypots in the South African political context. We produce a series of defined techniques and combine them to generate interactions from users on Twitter. The paper offers two key contributions. Conceptually, an argument is made that honeypots should not be confused for bot detection methods, but are rather methods to capture low-quality users. Secondly, we successfully generate a list of 288 local low quality users active in the political context.
