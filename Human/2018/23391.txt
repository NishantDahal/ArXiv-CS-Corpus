Impact of Integrated Circuit Packaging on Synaptic Dynamics of Memristive Devices

The memristor can be used as non volatile memory (NVM) and for emulating neuron behavior. It has the ability to switch between low resistance $R_{on}$ and high resistance values $R_{off}$, and exhibit the synaptic dynamic behaviour such as potentiation and depression. This paper presents a study on potentiation and depression of memristors in Quad Flat Pack. A comparison is drawn between the memristors with and without the impact of parasitics of packaging, using measured data and equivalent circuit models. The parameters in memristor and packaging models for the SPICE simulations were determined using measured data to reflect the memristor parasitics in Quad Flat Packs.
