Quantum communication in a superposition of causal orders

Quantum mechanics allows for situations where the relative order between two processes is entangled with a quantum degree of freedom. Here we show that such entanglement can enhance the ability to transmit quantum information over noisy communication channels. We consider two completely dephasing channels, which in normal conditions are unable to transmit any quantum information. We show that, when the two channels are traversed in an indefinite order, a quantum bit sent through them has a 25% probability to reach the receiver without any error. For partially dephasing channels, a similar advantage takes place deterministically: the amount of quantum information that can travel through two channels in a superposition of orders can be larger than the amount of quantum information that can travel through each channel individually.
