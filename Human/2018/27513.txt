Word Embeddings from Large-Scale Greek Web Content

Word embeddings are undoubtedly very useful components in many NLP tasks. In this paper, we present word embeddings and other linguistic resources trained on the largest to date digital Greek language corpus. We also present a live web tool for testing the Greek word embeddings, by offering "analogy", "similarity score" and "most similar words" functions. Through our explorer, one could interact with the Greek word vectors.
