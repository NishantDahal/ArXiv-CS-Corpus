Is Fragmentation a Threat to the Success of the Internet of Things?

The current revolution in collaborating distributed things is seen as the first phase of IoT to develop various services. Such collaboration is threatened by the fragmentation found in the industry nowadays as it brings challenges stemming from the difficulty to integrate diverse technologies in system. Diverse networking technologies induce interoperability issues, hence, limiting the possibility of reusing the data to develop new services. Different aspects of handling data collection must be available to provide interoperability to the diverse objects interacting; however, such approaches are challenged as they bring substantial performance impairments in settings with the increasing number of collaborating devices/technologies.
