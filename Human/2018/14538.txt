Conditions for Major Transitions in Biological and Cultural Evolution

Evolution by natural selection can be seen an algorithm for generating creative solutions to difficult problems. More precisely, evolution by natural selection is a class of algorithms that share a set of properties. The question we address here is, what are the conditions that define this class of algorithms? There is a standard answer to this question: Briefly, the conditions are variation, heredity, and selection. We agree that these three conditions are sufficient for a limited type of evolution, but they are not sufficient for open-ended evolution. By open-ended evolution, we mean evolution that generates a continuous stream of creative solutions, without stagnating. We propose a set of conditions for open-ended evolution. The new conditions build on the standard conditions by adding fission, fusion, and cooperation. We test the proposed conditions by applying them to major transitions in the evolution of life and culture. We find that the proposed conditions are able to account for the major transitions.
