Transpiling Programmable Computable Functions to Answer Set Programs

Programming Computable Functions (PCF) is a simplified programming language which provides the theoretical basis of modern functional programming languages. Answer set programming (ASP) is a programming paradigm focused on solving search problems. In this paper we provide a translation from PCF to ASP. Using this translation it becomes possible to specify search problems using PCF.
