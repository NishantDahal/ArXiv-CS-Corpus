Performance Analysis and Robustification of Single-query 6-DoF Camera Pose Estimation

We consider a single-query 6-DoF camera pose estimation with reference images and a point cloud, i.e. the problem of estimating the position and orientation of a camera by using reference images and a point cloud. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of three state-of-the-art strategies for 6-DoF camera pose estimation, i.e. feature-based, photometric-based and mutual-information-based approaches. The performance of the studied methods is evaluated on two standard datasets in terms of success rate, translation error and max orientation error. Building on the results analysis, we propose a hybrid approach that combines feature-based and mutual-information-based pose estimation methods since it provides complementary properties for pose estimation. Experiments show that (1) in cases with large environmental variance, the hybrid approach outperforms feature-based and mutual-information-based approaches by an average of 25.1% and 5.8% in terms of success rate, respectively; (2) in cases where query and reference images are captured at similar imaging conditions, the hybrid approach performs similarly as the feature-based approach, but outperforms both photometric-based and mutual-information-based approaches with a clear margin; (3) the feature-based approach is consistently more accurate than mutual-information-based and photometric-based approaches when at least 4 consistent matching points are found between the query and reference images.
