Wireless Sensor Networks Security: State of the Art

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become one of the main research topics in computer science in recent years, primarily owing to the significant challenges imposed by these networks and their immense applicability. WSNs have been employed for a diverse group of monitoring applications, with emphasis on industrial control scenarios, traffic management, rescue operations, public safety, residential automation, weather forecasting, and several other fields. These networks constitute resource-constrained sensors for which security and energy efficiency are essential concerns. In this context, many research efforts have been focused on increasing the security levels and reducing the energy consumption in the network. This paper provides a state-of-the-art survey of recent works in this direction, proposing a new taxonomy for the security attacks and requirements of WSNs.
