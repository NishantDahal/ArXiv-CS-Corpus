Simple Data and Workflow Management with the signac Framework

Researchers in the field of materials science, chemistry, and computational physics are regularly posed with the challenge of managing large and heterogeneous data spaces. The amount of data increases in lockstep with computational efficiency multiplied by the amount of available computational resources, which shifts the bottleneck in the scientific process from data acquisition to data processing and analysis. We present a framework designed to aid in the integration of various specialized data formats, tools and workflows. The signac framework provides all basic components required to create a well-defined and thus collectively accessible and searchable data space, simplifying data access and modification through a homogeneous data interface that is largely agnostic to the data source, i.e., computation or experiment. The framework's data model is designed to not require absolute commitment to the presented implementation, simplifying adaption into existing data sets and workflows. This approach not only increases the efficiency with which scientific results can be produced, but also significantly lowers barriers for collaborations requiring shared data access.
