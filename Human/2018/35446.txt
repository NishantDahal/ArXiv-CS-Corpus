Non-Orthogonal Multiplexing of Ultra-Reliable and Broadband Services in Fog-Radio Architectures

The fifth generation (5G) of cellular systems is introducing Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) services alongside more conventional enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) traffic. Furthermore, the 5G cellular architecture is evolving from a base station-centric deployment to a fog-like set-up that accommodates a flexible functional split between cloud and edge. In this paper, a novel solution is proposed that enables the non-orthogonal coexistence of URLLC and eMBB services by processing URLLC traffic at the Edge Nodes (ENs), while eMBB communications are handled centrally at a cloud processor as in a Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) system. This solution guarantees the low-latency requirements of the URLLC service by means of edge processing, e.g., for vehicle-to-cellular use cases, as well as the high spectral efficiency for eMBB traffic via centralized baseband processing. Both uplink and downlink are analyzed by accounting for the heterogeneous performance requirements of eMBB and URLLC traffic and by considering practical aspects such as fading, lack of channel state information for URLLC transmitters, rate adaptation for eMBB transmitters, finite fronthaul capacity, and different coexistence strategies, such as puncturing.
