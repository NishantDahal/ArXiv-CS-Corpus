A New SVDD-Based Multivariate Non-parametric Process Capability Index

Process capability index (PCI) is a commonly used statistic to measure ability of a process to operate within the given specifications or to produce products which meet the required quality specifications. PCI can be univariate or multivariate depending upon the number of process specifications or quality characteristics of interest. Most PCIs make distributional assumptions which are often unrealistic in practice.
  This paper proposes a new multivariate non-parametric process capability index. This index can be used when distribution of the process or quality parameters is either unknown or does not follow commonly used distributions such as multivariate normal.
