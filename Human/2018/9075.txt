Sensing Hidden Vehicles by Exploiting Multi-Path V2V Transmission

This paper presents a technology of sensing hidden vehicles by exploiting multi-path vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. This overcomes the limitation of existing RADAR technologies that requires line-of-sight (LoS), thereby enabling more intelligent manoeuvre in autonomous driving and improving its safety. The proposed technology relies on transmission of orthogonal waveforms over different antennas at the target (hidden) vehicle. Even without LoS, the resultant received signal enables the sensing vehicle to detect the position, shape, and driving direction of the hidden vehicle by jointly analyzing the geometry (AoA/AoD/propagation distance) of individual propagation path. The accuracy of the proposed technique is validated by realistic simulation including both highway and rural scenarios.
