Communication over an Arbitrarily Varying Channel under a State-Myopic Encoder

We study the problem of communication over a discrete arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) when a noisy version of the state is known non-causally at the encoder. The state is chosen by an adversary which knows the coding scheme. A state-myopic encoder observes this state non-causally, though imperfectly, through a noisy discrete memoryless channel (DMC). We first characterize the capacity of this state-dependent channel when the encoder-decoder share randomness unknown to the adversary, i.e., the randomized coding capacity. Next, we show that when only the encoder is allowed to randomize, the capacity remains unchanged when positive. Interesting and well-known special cases of the state-myopic encoder model are also presented.
