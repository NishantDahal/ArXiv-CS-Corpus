A 5.16Gbps decoder ASIC for Polar Code in 16nm FinFET

Polar codes has been selected as 5G standard. However, only a couple of ASIC featuring decoders are fabricated,and none of them support list size L > 4 and code length N > 1024. This paper presents an ASIC implementation of three decoders for polar code: successive cancellation (SC) decoder, flexible decoder and ultra-reliable decoder. These decoders are all SC based decoder, supporting list size up to 1,8,32 and code length up to 2^15,2^14,2^11 respectively. This chip is fabricated in a 16nm TSMC FinFET technology, and can be clocked at 1 Ghz. Optimization techniques are proposed and employed to increase throughput. Experiment result shows that the throughput can achieve up to 5.16Gbps. Compared with fabricated AISC decoder and synthesized decoder in literature, the flexible decoder achieves higher area efficiency.
