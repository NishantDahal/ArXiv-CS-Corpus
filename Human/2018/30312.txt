Multi-Block Grid deformation Method in 3D

Multi-block grids provide the computational efficiency of structured grids and the flexibility for complex geometry. Thus, Multi-block structured grids are widely used for field simulation on complex domains. In this paper we propose a method which adapts multi-block grids according to a monitor function, which specifies cell volume distribution. The method is an extension of the deformation method on a single block to multi-blocks.
  Key words: multi-block grids, deformation method, adaptive grids
