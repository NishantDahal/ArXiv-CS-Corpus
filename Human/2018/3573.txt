Unsupervised Typography Transfer

Traditional methods in Chinese typography synthesis view characters as an assembly of radicals and strokes, but they rely on manual definition of the key points, which is still time-costing. Some recent work on computer vision proposes a brand new approach: to treat every Chinese character as an independent and inseparable image, so the pre-processing and post-processing of each character can be avoided. Then with a combination of a transfer network and a discriminating network, one typography can be well transferred to another. Despite the quite satisfying performance of the model, the training process requires to be supervised, which means in the training data each character in the source domain and the target domain needs to be perfectly paired. Sometimes the pairing is time-costing, and sometimes there is no perfect pairing, such as the pairing between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese characters. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised typography transfer method which doesn't need pairing.
