Real-Time Stereo Vision for Road Surface 3-D Reconstruction

Stereo vision techniques have been widely used in civil engineering to acquire 3-D road data. The two important factors of stereo vision are accuracy and speed. However, it is very challenging to achieve both of them simultaneously and therefore the main aim of developing a stereo vision system is to improve the trade-off between these two factors. In this paper, we present a real-time stereo vision system used for road surface 3-D reconstruction. The proposed system is developed from our previously published 3-D reconstruction algorithm where the perspective view of the target image is first transformed into the reference view, which not only increases the disparity accuracy but also improves the processing speed. Then, the correlation cost between each pair of blocks is computed and stored in two 3-D cost volumes. To adaptively aggregate the matching costs from neighbourhood systems, bilateral filtering is performed on the cost volumes. This greatly reduces the ambiguities during stereo matching and further improves the precision of the estimated disparities. Finally, the subpixel resolution is achieved by conducting a parabola interpolation and the subpixel disparity map is used to reconstruct the 3-D road surface. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU for the real-time purpose. The experimental results illustrate that the reconstruction accuracy is around 3 mm.
