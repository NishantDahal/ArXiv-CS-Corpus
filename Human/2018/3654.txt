Storage-Latency Trade-off in Cache-Aided Fog Radio Access Networks

A fog radio access network (F-RAN) is studied, in which $K_T$ edge nodes (ENs) connected to a cloud server via orthogonal fronthaul links, serve $K_R$ users through a wireless Gaussian interference channel. Both the ENs and the users have finite-capacity cache memories, which are filled before the user demands are revealed. While a centralized placement phase is used for the ENs, which model static base stations, a decentralized placement is leveraged for the mobile users. An achievable transmission scheme is presented, which employs a combination of interference alignment, zero-forcing and interference cancellation techniques in the delivery phase, and the \textit{normalized delivery time} (NDT), which captures the worst-case latency, is analyzed.
