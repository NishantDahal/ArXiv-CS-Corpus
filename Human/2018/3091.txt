Sum Secrecy Rate Maximization in a Multi-Carrier MIMO Wiretap Channel with Full-Duplex Jamming

In this paper we address a sum secrecy rate maximization problem for a multi-carrier and MIMO communication system. We consider the case that the receiver is capable of full-duplex (FD) operation and simultaneously sends jamming signal to a potential eavesdropper. In particular, we simultaneously take advantage of the spatial and frequency diversity in the system in order to obtain a higher level of security in the physical layer. Due to the non-convex nature of the resulting mathematical problem, we propose an iterative solution with a guaranteed convergence, based on block coordinate descent method, by re-structuring our problem as a separately convex program. Moreover, for the special case that the transmitter is equipped with a single antenna, an optimal transmit power allocation strategy is obtained analytically, assuming a known jamming strategy. We also study a FD bidirectional secure communication system, where the jamming power can be reused to enhance the sum secrecy rate. The performance of the proposed design is then numerically evaluated compared to the other design strategies, and under different system assumptions.
