Improv Chat: Second Response Generation for Chatbot

Existing research on response generation for chatbot focuses on \textbf{First Response Generation} which aims to teach the chatbot to say the first response (e.g. a sentence) appropriate to the conversation context (e.g. the user's query). In this paper, we introduce a new task \textbf{Second Response Generation}, termed as Improv chat, which aims to teach the chatbot to say the second response after saying the first response with respect the conversation context, so as to lighten the burden on the user to keep the conversation going. Specifically, we propose a general learning based framework and develop a retrieval based system which can generate the second responses with the users' query and the chatbot's first response as input. We present the approach to building the conversation corpus for Improv chat from public forums and social networks, as well as the neural networks based models for response matching and ranking. We include the preliminary experiments and results in this paper. This work could be further advanced with better deep matching models for retrieval base systems or generative models for generation based systems as well as extensive evaluations in real-life applications.
