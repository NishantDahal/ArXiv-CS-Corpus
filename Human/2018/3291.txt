The Complex Event Recognition Group

The Complex Event Recognition (CER) group is a research team, affiliated with the National Centre of Scientific Research "Demokritos" in Greece. The CER group works towards advanced and efficient methods for the recognition of complex events in a multitude of large, heterogeneous and interdependent data streams. Its research covers multiple aspects of complex event recognition, from efficient detection of patterns on event streams to handling uncertainty and noise in streams, and machine learning techniques for inferring interesting patterns. Lately, it has expanded to methods for forecasting the occurrence of events. It was founded in 2009 and currently hosts 3 senior researchers, 5 PhD students and works regularly with under-graduate students.
