Knowledge extraction, modeling and formalization: EEG case study

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a well-established method for data analysis which finds many applications in data mining. Its extension on complex data representation formats brought a wave of new applications to the problems such as gene expression mining, prediction of toxicity of chemical compounds or clustering of sequences in process event logs. Insipired from this work our research inherits their model and designs an experiment for mining electroencephalographic recordings for patterns of sleep spindles. The contribution of this paper lies in the specification of desritizition procedure and the architecture of FCA experiment. We also provide some reflection on the related research papers.
