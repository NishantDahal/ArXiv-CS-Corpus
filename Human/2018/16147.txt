Where are we now? A large benchmark study of recent symbolic regression methods

In this paper we provide a broad benchmarking of recent genetic programming approaches to symbolic regression in the context of state of the art machine learning approaches. We use a set of nearly 100 regression benchmark problems culled from open source repositories across the web. We conduct a rigorous benchmarking of four recent symbolic regression approaches as well as nine machine learning approaches from scikit-learn. The results suggest that symbolic regression performs strongly compared to state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithms, although in terms of running times is among the slowest of the available methodologies. We discuss the results in detail and point to future research directions that may allow symbolic regression to gain wider adoption in the machine learning community.
