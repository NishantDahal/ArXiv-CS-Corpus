Generating Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging Data of Brain Tumours from Linear, Non-Linear and Deep Learning Models

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) provides valuable information to help with the identification and understanding of brain tumors, yet MRS is not a widely available medical imaging modality. Aiming to counter this issue, this research draws on the advancements in machine learning techniques in other fields for the generation of artificial data. The generated methods were tested through the evaluation of their output against that of a real-world labelled MRS brain tumor data-set. Furthermore the resultant output from the generative techniques were each used to train separate traditional classifiers which were tested on a subset of the real MRS brain tumor dataset. The results suggest that there exist methods capable of producing accurate, ground truth based MRS voxels. These findings indicate that through generative techniques, large datasets can be made available for training deep, learning models for the use in brain tumor diagnosis.
