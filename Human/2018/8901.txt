Creating an extrovert robotic assistant via IoT networking devices

The communication and collaboration of Cyber-Physical Systems, including machines and robots, among themselves and with humans, is expected to attract researchers' interest for the years to come. A key element of the new revolution is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT infrastructures enable communication between different connected devices using internet protocols. The integration of robots in an IoT platform can improve robot capabilities by providing access to other devices and resources. In this paper we present an IoT-enabled application including a NAO robot which can communicate through an IoT platform with a reflex measurement system and a hardware node that provides robotics-oriented services in the form of RESTful web services. An activity reminder application is also included, illustrating the extension capabilities of the system.
