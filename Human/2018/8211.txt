Additive Number Theory via Approximation by Regular Languages

We prove some new theorems in additive number theory, using novel techniques from automata theory and formal languages. As an example of our method, we prove that every natural number > 25 is the sum of at most three natural numbers whose base-2 representation has an equal number of 0's and 1's.
