A generalized concept-cognitive learning: A machine learning viewpoint

Concept-cognitive learning (CCL) is a hot topic in recent years, and it has attracted much attention from the communities of formal concept analysis, granular computing and cognitive computing. However, the relationship among cognitive computing (CC), concept-cognitive computing (CCC), CCL and concept-cognitive learning model (CCLM) is not clearly described. To this end, we first explain the relationship of CC, CCC, CCL and CCLM. Then, we propose a generalized concept-cognitive learning (GCCL) from the point of view of machine learning. Finally, experiments on some data sets are conducted to verify the feasibility of concept formation and concept-cognitive process of GCCL.
