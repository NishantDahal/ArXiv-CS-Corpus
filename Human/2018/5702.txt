Link prediction for interdisciplinary collaboration via co-authorship network

We analyse the Publication and Research (PURE) data set of University of Bristol collected between $2008$ and $2013$. Using the existing co-authorship network and academic information thereof, we propose a new link prediction methodology, with the specific aim of identifying potential interdisciplinary collaboration in a university-wide collaboration network.
