Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in Cloud Based Wireless HetNets

In this paper, we study the joint computation offloading and resource allocation problem in the two-tier wireless heterogeneous network (HetNet). Our design aims to optimize the computation offloading to the cloud jointly with the subchannel allocation to minimize the maximum (min-max) weighted energy consumption subject to practical constraints on bandwidth, computing resource and allowable latency for the multi-user multitask computation system. To tackle this non-convex mixed integer non-linear problem (MINLP), we employ the bisection search method to solve it where we propose a novel approach to transform and verify the feasibility of the underlying problem in each iteration. In addition, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which can decrease the number of binary optimization variables and enable more scalable computation offloading optimization in the practical wireless HetNets. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed design achieves the energy saving gains about 55% in comparison with the local computation scheme under the strict required latency of 0.1s.
