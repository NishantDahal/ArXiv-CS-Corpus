Almost optimal Boolean matrix multiplication [BMM]-by multi-encoding of rows and columns

The Boolean product $R = P \cdot Q$ of two $\{ 0, 1\} \; m \times m \; $ matrices is $$R(j,k) = 1 \; \mathrm{\ IF\ for\ some\ } \; t \; \,P(j, t) = Q(t, k) = 1\; \; \mathrm{ELSE\ } \, R(j, k) = 0. $$ The near-optimal design reduces the complexity of computing $R$ from the standard $m^3$ to $O(m^{(2+e)})$, for arbitrary small $e > 0$, by a practical algorithm. This renders reduced complexity to several graph-property tests:  Finding triangles and higher-size cliques;  finding all-pairs shortest paths, and more.  Also, parsing a string $w$ by a context-free grammar is reduced to near quadratic in $w$-size. The design uses several distinct 2-digit encodings:  $j$ by $(j_1, j_2), \; k \, $ by $\, (k_1, k_2)$.  Each one gives rise to bunches of short digraphs from sources $j$'s to sinks $k$'s via switching nodes, and walks between them.  The combined information, using the Chinese remainder theorem, leads to the correct values of $R(j, k)$.
