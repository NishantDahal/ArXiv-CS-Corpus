Complete Simulation of Automata Networks

Consider a finite set $A$ and an integer $n \geq 1$. This paper studies the concept of complete simulation in the context of semigroups of transformations of $A^n$, also known as finite state-homogeneous automata networks. For $m \geq n$, a transformation of $A^m$ is \emph{$n$-complete of size $m$} if it may simulate every transformation of $A^n$ by updating one coordinate (or register) at a time. Using tools from memoryless computation, it is established that there is no $n$-complete transformation of size $n$, but there is such a transformation of size $n+1$. By studying the the time of simulation of various $n$-complete transformations, it is conjectured that the maximal time of simulation of any $n$-complete transformation is at least $2n$. A transformation of $A^m$ is \emph{sequentially $n$-complete of size $m$} if it may sequentially simulate every finite sequence of transformations of $A^n$; in this case, minimal examples and bounds for the size and time of simulation are determined. It is also shown that there is no $n$-complete transformation that updates all the registers in parallel, but that there exists a sequentally $n$-complete transformation that updates all but one register in parallel. This illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of parallel models of computation, such as cellular automata.
