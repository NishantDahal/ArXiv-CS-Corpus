VeriTable: Fast Equivalence Verification of Multiple Large Forwarding Tables

Due to network practices such as traffic engineering and multi-homing, the number of routes---also known as IP prefixes---in the global forwarding tables has been increasing significantly in the last decade and continues growing in a super linear trend. One of the most promising solutions is to use smart Forwarding Information Base (FIB) aggregation algorithms to aggregate the prefixes and convert a large table into a small one. Doing so poses a research question, however, i.e., how can we quickly verify that the original table yields the same forwarding behaviors as the aggregated one? We answer this question in this paper, including addressing the challenges caused by the longest prefix matching (LPM) lookups. In particular, we propose the VeriTable algorithm that can employ a single tree/trie traversal to quickly check if multiple forwarding tables are forwarding equivalent, as well as if they could result in routing loops or black holes. The VeriTable algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art work for both IPv4 and IPv6 tables in every aspect, including the total running time, memory access times and memory consumption.
