Collective Story Writing through Linking Images

Collaborative creativity is the approach of employing crowd to accomplish creative tasks. In this paper, we present a collaborative crowdsourcing platform for writing stories by means of connecting a series of `images'. These connected images are termed as Image Chains, reflecting successive scenarios. Users can either start or extend an Image Chain by uploading their own image or choosing from the available ones. These users are allowed to pen their stories from the Image Chains. Finally, stories get published based on the number of votes obtained. This provides an organized framework of story writing unlike most of the state-of-the-art collaborative editing platforms. Our experiments on 25 contributors highlight their interest in growing shorter Image Chains but voting longer Image Chains.
