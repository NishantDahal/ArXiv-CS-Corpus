Missing Value Imputation Based on Deep Generative Models

Missing values widely exist in many real-world datasets, which hinders the performing of advanced data analytics. Properly filling these missing values is crucial but challenging, especially when the missing rate is high. Many approaches have been proposed for missing value imputation (MVI), but they are mostly heuristics-based, lacking a principled foundation and do not perform satisfactorily in practice. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework based on deep generative models for MVI. Under this framework, imputing the missing entries amounts to seeking a fixed-point solution between two conditional distributions defined on the missing entries and latent variables respectively. These distributions are parameterized by deep neural networks (DNNs) which possess high approximation power and can capture the nonlinear relationships between missing entries and the observed values. The learning of weight parameters of DNNs is performed by maximizing an approximation of the log-likelihood of observed values. We conducted extensive evaluation on 13 datasets and compared with 11 baselines methods, where our methods largely outperforms the baselines.
