A Budget Feasible Peer Graded Mechanism For IoT-Based Crowdsourcing

We develop and extend a line of recent works on the design of mechanisms for heterogeneous tasks assignment problem in 'crowdsourcing'. The budgeted market we consider consists of multiple task requesters and multiple IoT devices as task executers; where each task requester is endowed with a single distinct task along with the publicly known budget. Also, each IoT device has valuations as the cost for executing the tasks and quality, which are private. Given such scenario, the objective is to select a subset of IoT devices for each task, such that the total payment made is within the allotted quota of the budget while attaining a threshold quality. For the purpose of determining the unknown quality of the IoT devices, we have utilized the concept of peer grading. In this paper, we have carefully crafted a truthful budget feasible mechanism; namely TUBE-TAP for the problem under investigation that also allows us to have the true information about the quality of the IoT devices. The simulations are performed in order to measure the efficacy of our proposed mechanism.
