Artificial Intelligence and Legal Liability

A recent issue of a popular computing journal asked which laws would apply if a self-driving car killed a pedestrian. This paper considers the question of legal liability for artificially intelligent computer systems. It discusses whether criminal liability could ever apply; to whom it might apply; and, under civil law, whether an AI program is a product that is subject to product design legislation or a service to which the tort of negligence applies. The issue of sales warranties is also considered. A discussion of some of the practical limitations that AI systems are subject to is also included.
