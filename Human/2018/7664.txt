Tourist Navigation in Android Smartphone by using Emotion Generating Calculations and Mental State Transition Networks

Mental State Transition Network which consists of mental states connected to each other is a basic concept of approximating to human psychological and mental responses. It can represent transition from an emotional state to other one with stimulus by calculating Emotion Generating Calculations method. A computer agent can transit a mental state in MSTN based on analysis of emotion by EGC method. In this paper, the Andorid EGC which the agent works in Android smartphone can evaluate the feelings in the conversation. The tourist navigation system with the proposed technique in this paper will be expected to be an emotional oriented interface in Android smartphone.
