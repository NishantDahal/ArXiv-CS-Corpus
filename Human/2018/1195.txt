Cumulant Generating Function of Codeword Lengths in Variable-Length Lossy Compression Allowing Positive Excess Distortion Probability

This paper considers the problem of variable-length lossy source coding. The performance criteria are the excess distortion probability and the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths. We derive a non-asymptotic fundamental limit of the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths allowing positive excess distortion probability. It is shown that the achievability and converse bounds are characterized by the RÃ©nyi entropy-based quantity. In the proof of the achievability result, the explicit code construction is provided. Further, we investigate an asymptotic single-letter characterization of the fundamental limit for a stationary memoryless source.
