Emoji Sentiment Scores of Writers using Odds Ratio and Fisher Exact Test

The sentiment of a given emoji is traditionally calculated by averaging the ratings {-1, 0 or +1} given by various users to a given context where the emoji appears.

Finally, we provide a list of sentiment scores with the often-missing exact p-values and CI for the most common emoji.
