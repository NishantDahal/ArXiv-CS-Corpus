Performance Analysis of Ultra-Reliable Short Message Decode and Forward Relaying Protocols

Machine-Type Communication (MTC) is a rapidly growing technology which covers a broad range of automated applications and propels the world into a fully connected society. Two new use cases of MTC are mMTC and URLLC, where mMTC support a large number of devices with high reliability and low rate connectivity while URLLC refers to excessively low outage probability under very stringent latency constraint. Herein, we examine the URLLC through three cooperative schemes, namely dual-hop DF, SC and MRC, and compare to direct transmission under Rayleigh fading. We compare the performance of studied cooperative protocols under two distinct power constraints with respect to latency and energy efficiency. Moreover, we illustrate the impact of coding rate on the probability of successful transmission in ultra-reliable region in addition to the effect of power allocation on the outage probability. We also provide the performance analysis of cooperative schemes in terms of energy efficiency and latency requirements.
