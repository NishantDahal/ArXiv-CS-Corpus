Cellular Controlled Delay TCP (C2TCP)

Cellular networks have special characteristics including highly variable channels, fast fluctuating capacities, deep per user buffers, self-inflicted queuing delays, radio uplink/downlink scheduling delays, etc. These distinguishing properties make the problem of achieving low latency and high throughput in cellular networks more challenging than in wired networks. That's why in this environment, TCP and its flavors, which are generally designed for wired networks, perform poorly.
  To cope with these challenges, we present C2TCP, a flexible end-to-end solution targeting interactive applications requiring high throughput and low delay in cellular networks. C2TCP stands on top of loss-based TCP and brings it delay sensitivity without requiring any network state profiling, channel prediction, or complicated rate adjustment mechanisms. The key idea behind C2TCP is to absorb dynamics of unpredictable cellular channels by investigating local minimum delay of packets in a moving time window and react to the cellular network's capacity changes very fast.
  Through extensive trace-based evaluations using traces from five commercial LTE and 3G networks, we have compared performance of C2TCP with various TCP variants, and state-of-the-art schemes including BBR, Verus, and Sprout. Results show that on average, C2TCP outperforms these schemes and achieves lower average and 95th percentile delay for packets.
