Synthesized Texture Quality Assessment via Multi-scale Spatial and Statistical Texture Attributes of Image and Gradient Magnitude Coefficients

Perceptual quality assessment for synthesized textures is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a training-free reduced-reference (RR) objective quality assessment method that quantifies the perceived quality of synthesized textures. The proposed reduced-reference synthesized texture quality assessment metric is based on measuring the spatial and statistical attributes of the texture image using both image- and gradient-based wavelet coefficients at multiple scales. Performance evaluations on two synthesized texture databases demonstrate that our proposed RR synthesized texture quality metric significantly outperforms both full-reference and RR state-of-the-art quality metrics in predicting the perceived visual quality of the synthesized textures.
