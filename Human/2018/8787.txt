Affective Recommendation System for Tourists by Using Emotion Generating Calculations

An emotion orientated intelligent interface consists of Emotion Generating Calculations (EGC) and Mental State Transition Network (MSTN). We have developed the Android EGC application software which the agent works to evaluate the feelings in the conversation. In this paper, we develop the tourist information system which can estimate the user's feelings at the sightseeing spot. The system can recommend the sightseeing spot and the local food corresponded to the user's feeling. The system calculates the recommendation list by the estimate function which consists of Google search results, the important degree of a term at the sightseeing website, and the the aroused emotion by EGC. In order to show the effectiveness, this paper describes the experimental results for some situations during Hiroshima sightseeing.
