Syst√®me de traduction automatique statistique Anglais-Arabe

Machine translation (MT) is the process of translating text written in a source language into text in a target language. In this article, we present our English-Arabic statistical machine translation system. First, we present the general process for setting up a statistical machine translation system, then we describe the tools as well as the different corpora we used to build our MT system. Our system was evaluated in terms of the BLUE score (24.51%)
