Quantified block gluing, aperiodicity and entropy of multidimensional SFT

It is possible to define mixing properties for subshifts according to the intensity which allows to concatenate two rectangular blocks. We study the interplay between this intensity and computational properties. In particular we prove that there exists linearly block gluing subshift of finite type which are aperiodic and that all right-recursively enumerable positive number can be realized as entropy of linearly block gluing Z 2-subshift of finite type. Like linearly block gluing imply transitivity, this last point answer a question asked in [HM10] about the characterization of the entropy of transitive subshift of finite type.
