User Transmit Power Minimization through Uplink Resource Allocation and User Association in HetNets

The popularity of cellular internet of things (IoT) is increasing day by day and billions of IoT devices will be connected to the internet. Many of these devices have limited battery life with constraints on transmit power. High user power consumption in cellular networks restricts the deployment of many IoT devices in 5G. To enable the inclusion of these devices, 5G should be supplemented with strategies and schemes to reduce user power consumption. Therefore, we present a novel joint uplink user association and resource allocation scheme for minimizing user transmit power while meeting the quality of service. We analyze our scheme for two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) and show an average transmit power of -2.8 dBm and 8.2 dBm for our algorithms compared to 20 dBm in state-of-the-art Max reference signal received power (RSRP) and channel individual offset (CIO) based association schemes.
