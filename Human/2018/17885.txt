Transfer Learning for Action Unit Recognition

This paper presents a classifier ensemble for Facial Expression Recognition (FER) based on models derived from transfer learning. The main experimentation work is conducted for facial action unit detection using feature extraction and fine-tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Several classifiers for extracted CNN codes such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are compared and evaluated. Multi-model ensembles are also used to further improve the performance. We have found that VGG-Face and ResNet are the relatively optimal pre-trained models for action unit recognition using feature extraction and the ensemble of VGG-Net variants and ResNet achieves the best result.
