Decreasing the size of the Restricted Boltzmann machine

We propose a method to decrease the number of hidden units of the restricted Boltzmann machine while avoiding decrease of the performance measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Then, we demonstrate our algorithm by using numerical simulations.
