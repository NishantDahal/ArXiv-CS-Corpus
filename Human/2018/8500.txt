The study was conducted on the basis of how users make use of Apps. It was conducted through the assessment of permissions required by various Apps through carefully selected third-party Apps and the devices settings and also a review of existing literature that has been conducted in fields within Apps and privacy. It will be unearthed that a many different but exhaustive lists of permission are sought by each App installed and the device it is installed on can quite give the user the information.
