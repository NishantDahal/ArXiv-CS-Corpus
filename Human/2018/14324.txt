The Perception of Humanoid Robots for Domestic Use in Saudi Arabia

We propose a research to investigate Saudi peoples' perception of humanoid domestic robots and attitude towards the possibility of having one in their house. Through a series of questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participatory design sessions, this research will explore Saudi peoples' level of acceptance towards domestic robots, the tasks and responsibilities they would feel comfortable assigning to these robots, their preferred appearance of domestic robots, and the cultural stereotypes they feel a domestic robot must mimic.
