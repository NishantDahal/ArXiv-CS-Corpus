On Interference Dynamics in Matérn Networks

A thorough understanding of the temporal dynamics of interference in wireless networks is crucial for the design of communication protocols, scheduling, and interference management. This paper applies stochastic geometry to investigate interference dynamics for the first time in a network with nodes that use carrier sense multiple access. This type of networks is approximated by a Matérn hard-core point process of type II with Nakagami fading. We derive and analyze expressions for the variance, covariance, and correlation of the interference power at a given point in space. Results show that even though the commonly used Poisson approximation to carrier sense multiple access may have the same average interference than the Matérn model, the three interference dynamics measurements investigated behave significantly different.
