Prediction of Signal Sequences in Abiotic Stress Inducible Genes from Main Crops by Association Rule Mining

It is important to study on genes affecting to growing environment of main crops. Especially the recognition problem of promoter region, which is the problem to predict whether DNA sequences contain promoter regions or not, is prior to find abiotic stress-inducible genes. Studies on predicting promoter sequences in DNA sequences have been studied by traditional pattern matching methods and machine learning methods in biology and computer science.
