A fixed-point model for semi-persistent scheduling of vehicular safety messages

In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of a semi-persistent scheduling scheme for vehicular safety communications, motivated by the Mode 4 medium access control protocol in 3GPP Release 14 for Cellular-V2X. An analytical model is built and a fixed point method is used to calculate the collision probability and average delay in both fully connected and partially connected cases under the assumption of perfect PHY performance. We use Monte Carlo simulation to verify the results obtained in the analytical model. The simulation results show that our analytical model can give a good estimation of the collision probability and average delay. We verify that a trade-off between delay and collision probability can be achieved with a flexible resource block selection. Monte Carlo simulation results show that with the flexible resource selection scheme average delay can be shortened significantly with only a small compromise in collision probability.
