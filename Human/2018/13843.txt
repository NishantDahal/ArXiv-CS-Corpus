An Algebra of Reversible Computation

Process algebra ACP based on the interleaving semantics can not be reversed. We design a reversible version of APTC called RAPTC. It has algebraic laws of reversible choice, sequence, parallelism, communication, silent step and abstraction, and also the soundness and completeness modulo strongly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations and weakly forward-reverse truly concurrent bisimulations.
