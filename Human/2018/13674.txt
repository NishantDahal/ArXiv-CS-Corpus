On PGZ decoding of alternant codes

In this note we first review the classical Petterson-Gorenstein-Zierler decoding algorithm for the class of alternant codes (which includes Reed-Solomon, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem and classical Goppa codes), then we present an improvement of the method to find the number of errors and the errorlocator polynomial, and finally we illustrate the procedure with several examples. In two appendices we sketch the main features of the system we have used for the computations.
