Solving equilibrium problems using extended mathematical programming

We introduce an extended mathematical programming framework for specifying equilibrium problems and their variational representations, such as generalized Nash equilibrium, multiple optimization problems with equilibrium constraints, and (quasi-) variational inequalities, and computing solutions of them from modeling languages. We define a new set of constructs with which users annotate variables and equations of the model to describe equilibrium and variational problems. Our constructs enable a natural translation of the model from one formulation to another more computationally tractable form without requiring the modeler to supply derivatives. In the context of many independent agents in the equilibrium, we facilitate expression of sophisticated structures such as shared constraints and additional constraints on their solutions. We define a new concept, shared variables, and demonstrate its uses for sparse reformulation, equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints, mixed pricing behavior of agents, and so on. We give some equilibrium and variational examples from the literature and describe how to formulate them using our framework. Experimental results comparing performance of various complementarity formulations for shared variables are given. Our framework has been implemented and is available within GAMS/EMP.
