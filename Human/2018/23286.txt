Humanoid TeenSize Open Platform NimbRo-OP

In recent years, the introduction of affordable platforms in the KidSize class of the Humanoid League has had a positive impact on the performance of soccer robots. The lack of readily available larger robots, however, severely affects the number of participants in Teen- and AdultSize and consequently the progress of research that focuses on the challenges arising with robots of larger weight and size. This paper presents the first hardware release of a low cost Humanoid TeenSize open platform for research, the first software release, and the current state of ROS-based software development. The NimbRo-OP robot was designed to be easily manufactured, assembled, repaired, and modified. It is equipped with a wide-angle camera, ample computing power, and enough torque to enable full-body motions, such as dynamic bipedal locomotion, kicking, and getting up.
