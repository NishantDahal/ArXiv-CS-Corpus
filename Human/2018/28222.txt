Energy-Efficient Cellular Communications Powered by Smart Grid Technology

The energy efficiency aspect of cellular networks is a vital topic of research over the recent days. As energy consumption is on the rise and the price of electricity is increasing very rapidly, necessity to reduce electricity usage in every aspect is becoming much more significant. The power grid infrastructure, from which the cellular networks attain the required electricity for operation is considering a significant change from the traditional electricity grid to the smart grid. The base stations, which are the main candidates for energy consumption in cellular networks, remain in operation even when there are a very few users or no user at all. In this paper, we propose an effective application scenario of the femtocell technology for power saving purpose of cellular networks. Effective deployment of femto-access-points in the required places can reduce the power usage of cellular networks by turning off the redundant base stations. Moreover, the signal to noise plus interference ratio is also enhanced in comparison to the traditional scheme. The base station turn off probability and the energy consumption in the overall network are analyzed. The comparison results show that the proposed energy efficient model can significantly reduce energy consumption and increase the service quality of the cellular users.
