NeuralWarp: Time-Series Similarity with Warping Networks

Research on time-series similarity measures has emphasized the need for elastic methods which align the indices of pairs of time series and a plethora of non-parametric have been proposed for the task. On the other hand, deep learning approaches are dominant in closely related domains, such as learning image and text sentence similarity. In this paper, we propose \textit{NeuralWarp}, a novel measure that models the alignment of time-series indices in a deep representation space, by modeling a warping function as an upper level neural network between deeply-encoded time series values. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{NeuralWarp} outperforms both non-parametric and un-warped deep models on a range of diverse real-life datasets.
