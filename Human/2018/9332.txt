Decentralizing Privacy Enforcement for Internet of Things Smart Objects

Internet of Things (IoT) is now evolving into a loosely coupled, decentralized system of cooperating smart objects, where high- speed data processing, analytics and shorter response times are becoming more necessary than ever. Such decentralization has a great impact on the way personal information generated and consumed by smart objects should be protected, because, without centralized data management, it is more difficult to control how data are combined and used by smart objects. To cope with this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework where users of smart objects can specify their privacy preferences. Compliance check of user individual privacy preferences is performed directly by smart objects. Moreover, acknowledging that embedding the enforcement mechanism into smart objects implies some overhead, we have extensively tested the proposed framework on different scenarios, and the obtained results show the feasibility of our approach.
