Efficient Pose Tracking from Natural Features in Standard Web Browsers

Computer Vision-based natural feature tracking is at the core of modern Augmented Reality applications. Still, Web-based Augmented Reality typically relies on location-based sensing (using GPS and orientation sensors) or marker-based approaches to solve the pose estimation problem.
  We present an implementation and evaluation of an efficient natural feature tracking pipeline for standard Web browsers using HTML5 and WebAssembly. Our system can track image targets at real-time frame rates tablet PCs (up to 60 Hz) and smartphones (up to 25 Hz).
