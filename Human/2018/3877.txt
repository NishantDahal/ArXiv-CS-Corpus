Ensuring Data Integrity in Electronic Health Records: A Quality Health Care Implication

An Electronic Health Record (EHR) system must enable efficient availability of meaningful, accurate and complete data to assist improved clinical administration through the development, implementation and optimisation of clinical pathways. Therefore data integrity is the driving force in EHR systems and is an essential aspect of service delivery at all levels. However, preserving data integrity in EHR systems has become a major problem because of its consequences in promoting high standards of patient care. In this paper, we review and address the impact of data integrity of the use of EHR system and its associated issues. We determine and analyse three phases of data integrity of an EHR system. Finally, we also present an appropriate method to preserve the integrity in EHR systems. To analyse and evaluate the data integrity, one of the major clinical systems in Australia is considered. This will demonstrate the impact on quality and safety of patient care.
