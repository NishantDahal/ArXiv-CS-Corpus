Secure and Reliable Biometric Access Control for Resource-Constrained Systems and IoT

With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a growing need for access control and data protection on low-power, pervasive devices. Biometric-based authentication is promising for IoT due to its convenient nature and lower susceptibility to attacks. However, the costs associated with biometric processing and template protection are nontrivial for smart cards, key fobs, and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the security, cost, and utility of biometric systems and develop two major frameworks for improving them. First, we introduce a new framework for implementing biometric systems based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and hardware obfuscation that, unlike traditional software approaches, does not require nonvolatile storage of a biometric template/key. Aside from reducing the risk of compromising the biometric, the nature of obfuscation also provides protection against access control circumvention via malware and fault injection. The PUF provides non-invertibility and non-linkability. Second, a major requirement of the proposed PUF/obfuscation approach is that a reliable (robust) key be generated from the users input biometric. We propose a noiseaware biometric quantization framework capable of generating unique, reliable keys with reduced enrollment time and denoising costs. Finally, we conduct several case studies. In the first, the proposed noise-aware approach is compared to our previous approach for multiple biometric modalities, including popular ones (fingerprint and iris) and emerging cardiovascular ones (ECG and PPG). The results show that ECG provides the best tradeoff between reliability, key length, entropy, and cost. In the second and third case studies, we demonstrate how reliability, denoising costs, and enrollment times can be simultaneously improved by modeling subject intra-variations for ECG.
