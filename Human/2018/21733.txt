Exploiting Effective Representations for Chinese Sentiment Analysis Using a Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network

Effective representation of a text is critical for various natural language processing tasks. For the particular task of Chinese sentiment analysis, it is important to understand and choose an effective representation of a text from different forms of Chinese representations such as word, character and pinyin. This paper presents a systematic study of the effect of these representations for Chinese sentiment analysis by proposing a multi-channel convolutional neural network (MCCNN), where each channel corresponds to a representation. Experimental results show that: (1) Word wins on the dataset of low OOV rate while character wins otherwise; (2) Using these representations in combination generally improves the performance; (3) The representations based on MCCNN outperform conventional ngram features using SVM; (4) The proposed MCCNN model achieves the competitive performance against the state-of-the-art model fastText for Chinese sentiment analysis.
