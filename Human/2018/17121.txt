The REquirements TRacing On target (RETRO).NET Dataset

This paper presents the REquirements TRacing On target (RETRO).NET dataset. The dataset includes the requirement specification, the source code files (C# and Visual Basic), the gold standard/answer set for tracing the artifacts to each other, as well as the script used to parse the requirements from the specification (to put in RETRO.NET format). The dataset can be used to support tracing and other tasks.
