Assessing the state of e-Readiness for Small and Medium Companies in Mexico: a Proposed Taxonomy and Adoption Model

Emerging economies frequently show a large component of their Gross Domestic Product to be dependant on the economic activity of small and medium enterprises. Nevertheless, e-business solutions are more likely designed for large companies. SMEs seem to follow a classical family-based management, used to traditional activities, rather than seeking new ways of adding value to their business strategy. Thus, a large portion of a nations economy may be at disadvantage for competition. This paper aims at assessing the state of e-business readiness of Mexican SMEs based on already published e-business evolution models and by means of a survey research design. Data is being collected in three cities with differing sizes and infrastructure conditions. Statistical results are expected to be presented. A second part of this research aims at applying classical adoption models to suggest potential causal relationships, as well as more suitable recommendations for development.
