The Optimality of Partial Clique Covering for Index Coding

Partial clique covering is one of the most basic coding schemes for index coding problems, generalizing clique and cycle covering on the side information digraph and further reducing the achievable broadcast rate. In this paper, we start with partition multicast, a special case of partial clique covering with cover number 1, and show that partition multicast achieves the optimal broadcast rate of the multiple-unicast index coding if and only if the side information digraph is partially acyclic. A digraph is said to be partially acyclic if its sub-digraph induced by the vertex with maximum in-degree and its incoming neighbors in the complementary digraph is acyclic. We further extend to the general partial clique covering, offering sufficient conditions of its optimality and sub-optimality with the aid of strong connectivity decomposition. In addition, for some digraph classes, we also prove that the optimal broadcast rate can be approximated by partial clique covering (as well as by other basic schemes) within either a constant factor, or a multiplicative factor of $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$, or $O(n^ε)$ for some $ε\in (0,1)$.
