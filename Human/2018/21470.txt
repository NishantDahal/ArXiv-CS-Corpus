What is wrong with style transfer for texts?

A number of recent machine learning papers work with an automated style transfer for texts and, counter to intuition, demonstrate that there is no consensus formulation of this NLP task. Different researchers propose different algorithms, datasets and target metrics to address it. This short opinion paper aims to discuss possible formalization of this NLP task in anticipation of a further growing interest to it.
