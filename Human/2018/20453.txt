Fractional Multiscale Fusion-based De-hazing

This report presents the results of a proposed multi-scale fusion-based single image de-hazing algorithm, which can also be used for underwater image enhancement. Furthermore, the algorithm was designed for very fast operation and minimal run-time. The proposed scheme is the faster than existing algorithms for both de-hazing and underwater image enhancement and amenable to digital hardware implementation. Results indicate mostly consistent and good results for both categories of images when compared with other algorithms from the literature.
