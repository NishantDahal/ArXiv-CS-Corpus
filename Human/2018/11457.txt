Security Performance Analysis of Physical Layer over Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ Fading Channels

In this letter, the performance analysis of physical layer security over Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ fading channels is investigated. In particular, the average secrecy capacity (ASC), the secure outage probability (SOP), the lower bound of the SOP (SOP$^L$), and the strictly positive secure capacity (SPSC) are derived in exact closed-from expressions. The Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ fading channel is a composite of multipath/shadowed fading that are represented by the Nakagami-$m$ distribution. Moreover, it provides close results to the practical measurements than the generalised $K$ ($K_G$) fading channels. To validate our analysis, the numerical results are affirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations.
