Towards the Development of a Rule-based Drought Early Warning Expert Systems using Indigenous Knowledge

Drought forecasting and prediction is a complicated process due to the complexity and scalability of the environmental parameters involved. Hence, it required a high level of expertise to predict. In this paper, we describe the research and development of a rule-based drought early warning expert systems (RB-DEWES) for forecasting drought using local indigenous knowledge obtained from domain experts. The system generates inference by using rule set and provides drought advisory information with attributed certainty factor (CF) based on the user's input. The system is believed to be the first expert system for drought forecasting to use local indigenous knowledge on drought. The architecture and components such as knowledge base, JESS inference engine and model base of the system and their functions are presented.
