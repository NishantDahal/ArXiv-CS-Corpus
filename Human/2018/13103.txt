SpeechPy - A Library for Speech Processing and Recognition

SpeechPy is an open source Python package that contains speech preprocessing techniques, speech features, and important post-processing operations. It provides most frequent used speech features including MFCCs and filterbank energies alongside with the log-energy of filter-banks. The aim of the package is to provide researchers with a simple tool for speech feature extraction and processing purposes in applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speaker Verification.
