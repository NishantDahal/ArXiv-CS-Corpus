Formal Requirement Elicitation and Debugging for Testing and Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems

A framework for the elicitation and debugging of formal specifications for Cyber-Physical Systems is presented. The elicitation of specifications is handled through a graphical interface. Two debugging algorithms are presented. The first checks for erroneous or incomplete temporal logic specifications without considering the system. The second can be utilized for the analysis of reactive requirements with respect to system test traces. The specification debugging framework is applied on a number of formal specifications collected through a user study. The user study establishes that requirement errors are common and that the debugging framework can resolve many insidious specification errors.
