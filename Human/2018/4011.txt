On Some Linear Codes

Linear code with complementary dual($LCD$) are those codes which meet their duals trivially. In this paper we will give rather alternative proof of Massey's theorem\cite{Massey2}, which is one of the most important characterization of $LCD$ codes. Let $LCD[n,k]_3$ denote the maximum of possible values of $d$ among $[n,k,d]$ ternary codes. We will give bound on $LCD[n,k]_3$. We will also discuss the cases when this bound is attained.
