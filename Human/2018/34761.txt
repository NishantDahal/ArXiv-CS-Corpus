DNQ: Dynamic Network Quantization

Network quantization is an effective method for the deployment of neural networks on memory and energy constrained mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Network Quantization (DNQ) framework which is composed of two modules: a bit-width controller and a quantizer. Unlike most existing quantization methods that use a universal quantization bit-width for the whole network, we utilize policy gradient to train an agent to learn the bit-width of each layer by the bit-width controller. This controller can make a trade-off between accuracy and compression ratio. Given the quantization bit-width sequence, the quantizer adopts the quantization distance as the criterion of the weights importance during quantization. We extensively validate the proposed approach on various main-stream neural networks and obtain impressive results.
