A Theorem for Secrecy in Tagged Protocols Using the Theory of Witness-Functions

In this paper, we enunciate the theorem of secrecy in tagged protocols using the theory of witness-functions and we run a formal analysis on a new tagged version of the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol using this theorem. We discuss the significance of tagging in securing cryptographic protocols as well.
