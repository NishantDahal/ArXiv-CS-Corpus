A QPTAS for Gapless MEC

We consider the problem Minimum Error Correction (MEC). A MEC instance is an n x m matrix M with entries from {0,1,-}. Feasible solutions are composed of two binary m-bit strings, together with an assignment of each row of M to one of the two strings. The objective is to minimize the number of mismatches (errors) where the row has a value that differs from the assigned solution string. The symbol "-" is a wildcard that matches both 0 and 1. A MEC instance is gapless, if in each row of M all binary entries are consecutive.
  Gapless-MEC is a relevant problem in computational biology, and it is closely related to segmentation problems that were introduced by [Kleinberg-Papadimitriou-Raghavan STOC'98] in the context of data mining.
  Without restrictions, it is known to be UG-hard to compute an O(1)-approximate solution to MEC. For both MEC and Gapless-MEC, the best polynomial time approximation algorithm has a logarithmic performance guarantee. We partially settle the approximation status of Gapless-MEC by providing a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS). Additionally, for the relevant case where the binary part of a row is not contained in the binary part of another row, we provide a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS).
