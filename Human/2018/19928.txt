A Markov Chain Theory Approach to Characterizing the Minimax Optimality of Stochastic Gradient Descent (for Least Squares)

This work provides a simplified proof of the statistical minimax optimality of (iterate averaged) stochastic gradient descent (SGD), for the special case of least squares. This result is obtained by analyzing SGD as a stochastic process and by sharply characterizing the stationary covariance matrix of this process. The finite rate optimality characterization captures the constant factors and addresses model mis-specification.
