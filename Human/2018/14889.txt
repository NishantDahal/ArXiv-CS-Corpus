Efficient Data Perturbation for Privacy Preserving and Accurate Data Stream Mining

The widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised many concerns, including the protection of private information. Existing privacy preservation methods cannot provide a good balance between data utility and privacy, and also have problems with efficiency and scalability. This paper proposes an efficient data stream perturbation method (named as $P^2RoCAl$). $P^2RoCAl$ offers better data utility than similar methods: classification accuracies of $P^2RoCAl$ perturbed data streams are very close to those of the original data streams. $P^2RoCAl$ also provides higher resilience against data reconstruction attacks.
