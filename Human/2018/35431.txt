Two-Dimensional Control and Assurance of Data Integrity in Information Systems Based on Residue Number System Codes and Cryptographic Hash Functions

The method of two-dimensional control and assurance of data integrity with the possibility of their recovery for information systems operating under conditions of random errors as well as errors generated through deliberate actions of the attacker is proposed. The data recovery procedure is based on the application of the mathematical apparatus of redundant residue number system codes, and the control (verification of the recovered data validity (reliability, accuracy)) of data integrity is performed by means of cryptographic methods.
