On-Demand TDMA for Energy Efficient Data Collection with LoRa and Wake-up Receiver

Low-power and long-range communication tech- nologies such as LoRa are becoming popular in IoT applications due to their ability to cover kilometers range with milliwatt of power consumption. One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of micro- watt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 Î¼W during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mAh Lithium battery.
