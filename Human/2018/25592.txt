A Look at Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles at an Intersection

Autonomous Vehicles are currently being tested in a variety of scenarios. As we move towards Autonomous Vehicles, how should intersections look? To answer that question, we break down an intersection management into the different conundrums and scenarios involved in the trajectory planning and current approaches to solve them. Then, a brief analysis of current works in autonomous intersection is conducted. With a critical eye, we try to delve into the discrepancies of existing solutions while presenting some critical and important factors that have been addressed. Furthermore, open issues that have to be addressed are also emphasized. We also try to answer the question of how to benchmark intersection management algorithms by providing some factors that impact autonomous navigation at intersection.
