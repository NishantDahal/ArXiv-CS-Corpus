Fuzzy Membership Function Implementation with Memristor

The neuro-fuzzy system is network which resemble human-like operation of the naturally imprecise data and decision-making. This paper proposes implementation of the fundamental module of the neuro-fuzzy system - membership function (MF), realized as a analog electronic hardware. The memristive crossbar arrays are used as the architecture for proposed MF analog circuit. The main advantages of the memristive crossbar circuit are size, energy efficiency and fault tolerance compared to another analog alternatives. The conducted crossbar SPICE simulation with MS model of the memristor results confirm the performance and highlighted benefits of the proposed circuit.
