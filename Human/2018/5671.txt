Optimizing Age of Information in Wireless Networks with Perfect Channel State Information

Age of information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since the last received update was generated, is a newly proposed metric to measure the timeliness of information updates in a network. We consider AoI minimization problem for a network with general interference constraints, and time varying channels. We propose two policies, namely, virtual-queue based policy and age-based policy when the channel state is available to the network scheduler at each time step. We prove that the virtual-queue based policy is nearly optimal, up to a constant additive factor, and the age-based policy is at-most factor 4 away from optimality. Comparing with our previous work, which derived age optimal policies when channel state information is not available to the scheduler, we demonstrate a 4 fold improvement in age due to the availability of channel state information.
