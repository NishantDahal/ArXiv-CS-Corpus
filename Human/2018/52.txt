A Delay-Tolerant Payment Scheme Based on the Ethereum Blockchain

Banking as an essential service can be hard to access in remote, rural regions where the network connectivity is intermittent. Although micro-banking has been made possible by SMS or USSD messages in some places, their security flaws and session-based nature prevent them from a wider adoption. Global level cryptocurrencies enable low-cost, secure and pervasive money transferring among distributed peers, but are still limited in their ability to reach more people in remote communities.
  We proposed to take advantage of the delay-tolerant nature of blockchains to deliver banking services to remote communities that only connect to the broader Internet intermittently. Using a base station that offers connectivity within the local area, regular transaction processing is solely handled by blockchain miners. The bank only joins to process currency exchange requests, reward miners and track user balances when the connection is available. By distributing the verification and storage tasks among peers, our system design saves on the overall deployment and operational costs without sacrificing the reliability and trustwor- thiness. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we provided insights to system design, tested its robustness against network disturbances, and demonstrated the feasibility of implementation on off-the-shelf computers and mobile devices.
