On QoS-Compliant Telehaptic Communication over Shared Networks

The development of communication protocols for teleoperation with force feedback (generally known as telehaptics) has gained widespread interest over the past decade. Several protocols have been proposed for performing telehaptic interaction over shared networks. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of network cross-traffic on telehaptic streams, and the feasibility of Quality of Service (QoS) compliance is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap. Specifically, we explore the QoS experienced by two classes of telehaptic protocols on shared networks - Constant Bitrate (CBR) protocols and adaptive sampling based protocols, accounting for CBR as well as TCP cross-traffic. Our treatment of CBR-based telehaptic protocols is based on a micro-analysis of the interplay between TCP and CBR flows on a shared bottleneck link, which is broadly applicable for performance evaluation of CBR-based media streaming applications. Based on our analytical characterization of telehaptic QoS, and via extensive simulations and real network experiments, we formulate a set of sufficient conditions for telehaptic QoS-compliance. These conditions provide guidelines for designers of telehaptic protocols, and for network administrators to configure their networks for guaranteeing QoS-compliant telehaptic communication.
