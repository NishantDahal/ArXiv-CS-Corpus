Optimal Energy Distribution with Energy Packet Networks

We use Energy Packet Network paradigms to investigate energy distribution problems in a computer system with energy harvesting and storages units. Our goal is to minimize both the overall average response time of jobs at workstations and the total rate of energy lost in the network. Energy is lost when it arrives at idle workstations which are empty. Energy is also lost in storage leakages. We assume that the total rate of energy harvesting and the rate of jobs arriving at workstations are known. We also consider a special case in which the total rate of energy harvesting is sufficiently large so that workstations are less busy. In this case, energy is more likely to be sent to an idle workstation. Optimal solutions are obtained which minimize both the overall response time and energy loss under the constraint of a fixed energy harvesting rate.
