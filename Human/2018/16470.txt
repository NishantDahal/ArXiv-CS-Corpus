Kinematics and dynamics of an egg-shaped robot with a gyro driven inertia actuator

The manuscript discusses still preliminary considerations with regard to the dynamics and kinematics of an egg shaped robot with an gyro driven inertia actuator. The method of calculation follows the idea that we would like to express the entire dynamic equations in terms of moments instead of forces. Also we avoid to derive the equations from a Lagrange function with constraints. The result of the calculations is meant to be applicable to two robot prototypes that have been build at the AES\&R Laboratory at the National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan.
