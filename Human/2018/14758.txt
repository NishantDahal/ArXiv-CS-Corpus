On sound insulation of pyramidal lattice sandwich structure

Pyramidal lattice sandwich structure (PLSS) exhibits high stiffness and strength-to-weight ratio which can be effectively utilized for designing light-weight load bearing structures for ranging from ground to aerospace vehicles. While these structures provide superior strength to weigh ratio, their sound insulation capacity has not been well understood. The aim of this study is to develop numerical and experimental methods to fundamentally investigate the sound insulation property of the pyramidal lattice sandwich structure with solid trusses (PLSSST). A finite element model has been developed to predict the sound transmission loss (STL) of PLSSST and simulation results have been compared with those obtained experimentally. Parametric studies is then performed using the validated finite element model to investigate the effect of different parameters in pyramidal lattice sandwich structure with hollow trusses (PLSSHT), revealing that the pitching angle, the uniform thickness and the length of the hollow truss and the lattice constant have considerable effects on the sound transmission loss. Finally a design optimization strategy has been formulated to optimize PLSSHT in order to maximize STL while meeting mechanical property requirements. It has been shown that STL of the optimal PLSSHT can be increased by almost 10% at the low-frequency band. The work reported here provides useful information for the noise reduction design of periodic lattice structures.
