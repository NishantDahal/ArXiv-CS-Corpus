Reconfiguration of graph minors

Under the reconfiguration framework, we consider the various ways that a target graph $H$ is a {\em minor} of a host graph $G$, where a subgraph of $G$ can be transformed into $H$ by means of {\em edge contraction} (replacement of both endpoints of an edge by a new vertex adjacent to any vertex adjacent to either endpoint). Equivalently, an {\em $H$-model} of $G$ is a labeling of the vertices of $G$ with the vertices of $H$, where the contraction of all edges between identically-labeled vertices results in a graph containing representations of all edges in $H$.
  We explore the properties of $G$ and $H$ that result in a connected {\em reconfiguration graph}, in which nodes represent $H$-models and two nodes are adjacent if their corresponding $H$-models differ by the label of a single vertex of $G$. Various operations on $G$ or $H$ are shown to preserve connectivity. In addition, we demonstrate properties of graphs $G$ that result in connectivity for the target graphs $K_2$, $K_3$, and $K_4$, including a full characterization of graphs $G$ that result in connectivity for $K_2$-models, as well as the relationship between connectivity of $G$ and other $H$-models.
