Extension of Technology Acceptance Model by using System Usability Scale to assess behavioral intention to use e-learning

This study examines the acceptance of technology and behavioral intention to use learning management systems (LMS). In specific, the aim of this research is to examine whether students ultimately accept and use educational learning systems such as e-class and the impact of behavioral intention on their decision to use them. An extended version of technology acceptance model has been proposed and used by employing the System Usability Scale to measure perceived ease of use. 345 university students participated in the study and the data analysis was based on partial least squares method. The results were confirmed in most of the research hypotheses. In particular, social norm, system access and self-efficacy significantly affect behavioral intention to use. As a result, it is suggested that e-learning developers and stakeholders should focus on these factors to increase acceptance and effectiveness of learning management systems.
