Desingularization in the $q$-Weyl algebra

In this paper, we study the desingularization problem in the first $q$-Weyl algebra. We give an order bound for desingularized operators, and thus derive an algorithm for computing desingularized operators in the first $q$-Weyl algebra. Moreover, an algorithm is presented for computing a generating set of the first $q$-Weyl closure of a given $q$-difference operator. As an application, we certify that several instances of the colored Jones polynomial are Laurent polynomial sequences by computing the corresponding desingularized operator.
