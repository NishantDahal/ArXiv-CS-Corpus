Towards the Design of Aerostat Wind Turbine Arrays through AI

A new form of aerostat wind generation system which contains an array of interacting turbines is proposed. The design of the balloon turbine components is undertaken through the combination of artificial intelligence and rapid prototyping techniques such that the need for highly accurate models/simulations of the lift and wake dynamics is removed/reduced. Initial small-scale wind tunnel testing to determine design and algorithmic fundamentals will be presented.
