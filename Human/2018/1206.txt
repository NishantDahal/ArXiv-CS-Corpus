Precoding via Approximate Message Passing with Instantaneous Signal Constraints

This paper proposes a low complexity precoding algorithm based on the recently proposed Generalized Least Square Error (GLSE) scheme with generic penalty and support. The algorithm iteratively constructs the transmit vector via Approximate Message Passing (AMP). Using the asymptotic decoupling property of GLSE precoders, we derive closed form fixed point equations to tune the parameters in the proposed algorithm for a general set of instantaneous signal constraints. The tuning strategy is then utilized to construct transmit vectors with restricted peak-to-average power ratios and to efficiently select a subset of transmit antennas. The numerical investigations show that the proposed algorithm tracks the large-system performance of GLSE precoders even for a moderate number of antennas.
