Never Use Labels: Signal Strength-Based Bayesian Device-Free Localization in Changing Environments

Device-free localization (DFL) methods use measured changes in the received signal strength (RSS) between many pairs of RF nodes to provide location estimates of a person inside the wireless network. Fundamental challenges for RSS DFL methods include having a model of RSS measurements as a function of a person's location, and maintaining an accurate model as the environment changes over time. Current methods rely on either labeled empty-area calibration or labeled fingerprints with a person at each location. Both need to be frequently recalibrated or retrained to stay current with changing environments. Other DFL methods only localize people in motion. In this paper, we address these challenges by, first, introducing a new mixture model for link RSS as a function of a person's location, and second, providing the framework to update model parameters without ever being provided labeled data from either empty-area or known-location classes. We develop two new Bayesian localization methods based on our mixture model and experimentally validate our system at three test sites with seven days of measurements. We demonstrate that our methods localize a person with non-degrading performance in changing environments, and, in addition, reduce localization error by 11-51% compared to other DFL methods.
