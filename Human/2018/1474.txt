Learning audio and image representations with bio-inspired trainable feature extractors

Recent advancements in pattern recognition and signal processing concern the automatic learning of data representations from labeled training samples. Typical approaches are based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks, which require large amount of labeled training samples. In this work, we propose novel feature extractors that can be used to learn the representation of single prototype samples in an automatic configuration process. We employ the proposed feature extractors in applications of audio and image processing, and show their effectiveness on benchmark data sets.
