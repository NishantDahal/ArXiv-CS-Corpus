On the Separability of Ergodic Fading MIMO Channels: A Lattice Coding Approach

This paper addresses point-to-point communication over block-fading channels with independent fading blocks. When both channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and receiver (CSIR) are available, most achievable schemes use separable coding, i.e., coding independently and in parallel over different fading states. Unfortunately, separable coding has drawbacks including large memory requirements at both communication ends. In this paper a lattice coding and decoding scheme is proposed that achieves the ergodic capacity without separable coding, with lattice codebooks and decoding decision regions that are universal across channel realizations. We first demonstrate this result for fading distributions with discrete, finite support whose sequences are robustly typical. Results are then extended to continuous fading distributions, as well as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In addition, a variant of the proposed scheme is presented for the MIMO ergodic fading channel with CSIR only, where we prove the existence of a universal codebook that achieves rates within a constant gap to capacity for finite-support fading distributions. The gap is small compared with other schemes in the literature. Extension to continuous-valued fading is also provided.
