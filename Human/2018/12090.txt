Cell-free Massive MIMO Networks: Optimal Power Control against Active Eavesdropping

This paper studies the security aspect of a recently introduced network ("cell-free massive MIMO") under a pilot spoofing attack. Firstly, a simple method to recognize the presence of this type of an active eavesdropping attack to a particular user is shown. In order to deal with this attack, we consider the problem of maximizing the achievable data rate of the attacked user or its achievable secrecy rate. The corresponding problems of minimizing the consumption power subject to security constraints are also considered in parallel. Path-following algorithms are developed to solve the posed optimization problems under different power allocation to access points (APs). Under equip-power allocation to APs, these optimization problems admit closed-form solutions. Numerical results show their efficiencies.
