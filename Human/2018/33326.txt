Sequential algorithms and the computational content of classical proofs

We develop a correspondence between the theory of sequential algorithms and classical reasoning, via Kreisel's no-counterexample interpretation. Our framework views realizers of the no-counterexample interpretation as dynamic processes which interact with an oracle, and allows these processes to be modelled at any given level of abstraction. We discuss general constructions on algorithms which represent specific patterns which often appear in classical reasoning, and in particular, we develop a computational interpretation of the rule of dependent choice which is phrased purely on the level of algorithms, giving us a clearer insight into the computational meaning of proofs in classical analysis.
