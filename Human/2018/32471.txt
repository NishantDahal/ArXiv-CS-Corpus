Energy and Latency Control for Edge Computing in Dense V2X Networks

This study focuses on edge computing in dense millimeter wave vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. A control problem is formulated to minimize the energy consumption under delay constraint resulting from vehicle mobility. A tractable algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by optimizing the offloaded computing tasks and transmit power of vehicles and road side units. The proposed dynamic solution can well coordinate the interference without requiring global channel state information, and makes a tradeoff between energy consumption and task computing latency.
