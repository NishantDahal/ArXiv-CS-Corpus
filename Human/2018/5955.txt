A Branch-Price-and-Cut Algorithm for Optimal Decoding of LDPC Codes

Channel coding aims to minimize errors that occur during the transmission of digital information from one place to another. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can detect and correct transmission errors if one encodes the original information by adding redundant bits. In practice, heuristic iterative decoding algorithms are used to decode the received vector. However, these algorithms may fail to decode if the received vector contains multiple errors. We consider decoding the received vector with minimum error as an integer programming problem and propose a branch-and-price method for its solution. We improve the performance of our method by introducing heuristic feasible solutions and adding valid cuts to the mathematical formulation. Computational results reveal that our branch-price-and-cut algorithm significantly improves solvability of the problem compared to a commercial solver in high channel error rates. Our proposed algorithm can find higher quality solutions than commonly used iterative decoding heuristics.
