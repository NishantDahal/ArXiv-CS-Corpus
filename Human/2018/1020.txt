Performance Evaluation of Advanced Relaying Protocols in Large Wireless Networks

This paper studies the performance of some state-of-the-art cooperative full-duplex relaying protocols in the context of a large wireless network modelled using stochastic geometry tools. We investigate the outage behaviour for different cooperative schemes, namely, decode-and-forward, noisy-network coding and mixed noisy-network coding, considering fading, path loss and interference from other sources and relays. Due to the high complexity of the network topology and the protocols considered, a closed-form analysis is not possible, so our study is performed through extensive but careful numerical simulations, sweeping a large number of relevant parameters. Several scenarios of particular interest are investigated. In this way, insightful conclusions are drawn regarding the network regimes in which relay-assisted cooperation is most beneficial and the potential gains that could be achieved through it.
