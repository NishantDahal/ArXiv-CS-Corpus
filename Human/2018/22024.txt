Edge Based Data-Driven Pipelines (Technical Report)

This research reports investigates an edge on-device stream processing platform, which extends the serverless com- puting model to the edge to help facilitate real-time data analytics across the cloud and edge in a uniform manner. We investigate associated use cases and architectural design. We deployed and tested our system on edge devices (Raspberry Pi and Android Phone), which proves that stream processing analytics can be performed at the edge of the network with single board computers in a real-time fashion.
