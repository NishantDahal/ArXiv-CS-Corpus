Explore Recurrent Neural Network for PUE Attack Detection in Practical CRN Models

The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and pervasive use of many different types of mobile computing devices make wireless communication spectrum a precious resource. In order to accommodate the still fast increasing number of devices requesting wireless connection, more efficient, fine-grained spectrum allocation and sharing schemes are badly in need. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been widely recognized as one promising solution, in which the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to share channels with licensed primary users (PUs) as long as bringing no interference to the normal operations of the PUs. However, malicious attackers or selfish SUs may mimic the behavior of PUs to occupy the channels illegally. It is nontrivial to accurately, timely detect such kind of primary user emulation (PUE) attacks. In this paper, an efficient PUE attacked detection method is introduced leveraging the recurrent neural network (RNN). After a fundamental algorithm using basic RNN, an advanced version taking advantage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) is proposed, which is more efficient on processing time series with long term memory. The experimental study has provided deeper insights about the different performances the RNNs achieved and validated the effectiveness of the proposed detectors.
