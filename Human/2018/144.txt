Design and Analysis of 5G Scenarios with 'simmer': An R Package for Fast DES Prototyping

Simulation frameworks are important tools for the analysis and design of communication networks and protocols, but they can result extremely costly and/or complex (for the case of very specialized tools), or too naive and lacking proper features and support (for the case of ad-hoc tools). In this paper, we present an analysis of three 5G scenarios using 'simmer', a recent R package for discrete-event simulation that sits between the above two paradigms. As our results show, it provides a simple yet very powerful syntax, supporting the efficient simulation of relatively complex scenarios at a low implementation cost.
