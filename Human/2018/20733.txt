Consensus-Before-Talk: Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Access via Distributed Spectrum Ledger Technology

This paper proposes Consensus-Before-Talk (CBT), a spectrum etiquette architecture leveraged by distributed ledger technology (DLT). In CBT, secondary users' spectrum access requests reach a consensus in a distributed way, thereby enabling collision-free distributed dynamic spectrum access. To achieve this consensus, the secondary users need to pay for the extra request exchanging delays. Incorporating the consensus delay, the end-to-end latency under CBT is investigated. Both the latency analysis and numerical evaluation validate that the proposed CBT achieves the lower end-to-end latency particularly under severe secondary user traffic, compared to the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) benchmark scheme.
