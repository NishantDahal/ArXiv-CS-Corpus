In the recent years, social media have become one of the main places where creative content is being published and consumed by billions of users. Contrary to traditional media, social media allow the publishers to receive almost instantaneous feedback regarding their creative work at an unprecedented scale.

These applications include an interactive conversational bot that allows access to material archives, a Web-based application for automatic selection of optimal video thumbnail, as well as deep learning methods for optimizing headline and predicting video popularity. Our A/B tests show that deployment of our tools leads to significant increase of average video view count by 12.9%. Our additional contribution is a set of considerations collected during the deployment of those tools that can hel
