Modality via Iterated Enrichment

This paper investigates modal type theories by using a new categorical semantics called change-of-base semantics. Change-of-base semantics is novel in that it is based on (possibly infinitely) iterated enrichment and interpretation of modality as hom objects. In our semantics, the relationship between meta and object levels in multi-staged computation exactly corresponds to the relationship between enriching and enriched categories. As a result, we obtain a categorical explanation of situations where meta and object logics may be completely different. Our categorical models include conventional models of modal type theory (e.g., cartesian closed categories with a monoidal endofunctor) as special cases and hence can be seen as a natural refinement of former results.
  On the type theoretical side, it is shown that Fitch-style modal type theory can be directly interpreted in iterated enrichment of categories. Interestingly, this interpretation suggests the fact that Fitch-style modal type theory is the right adjoint of dual-context calculus. In addition, we present how linear temporal, S4, and linear exponential modalities are described in terms of change-of-base semantics. Finally, we show that the change-of-base semantics can be naturally extended to multi-staged effectful computation and generalized contextual modality a la Nanevski et al. We emphasize that this paper answers the question raised in the survey paper by de Paiva and Ritter in 2011, what a categorical model for Fitch-style type theory is like.
