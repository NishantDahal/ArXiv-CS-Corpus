A Brief History of Persistence

Persistent homology is currently one of the more widely known tools from computational topology and topological data analysis. We present in this note a brief survey on the evolution of the subject. The goal is to highlight the main ideas, starting from the subject's computational inception more than 20 years ago, to the more modern categorical and representation-theoretic point of view.
