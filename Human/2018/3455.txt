Enhancing Performance of Random Caching in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Wireless Networks with Random Discontinuous Transmission

To make better use of file diversity provided by random caching and improve the successful transmission probability (STP) of a file, we consider retransmissions with random discontinuous transmission (DTX) in a large-scale cache-enabled heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) employing random caching. We analyze and optimize the STP in two mobility scenarios, i.e., the high mobility scenario and the static scenario. First, in each scenario, by using tools from stochastic geometry, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the STP in the general and low signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) threshold regimes, respectively. The analysis shows that a larger caching probability corresponds to a higher STP in both scenarios; random DTX can improve the STP in the static scenario and its benefit gradually diminishes when mobility increases. Then, in each scenario, we consider the maximization of the STP with respect to the caching probability and the BS activity probability, which is a challenging non-convex optimization problem. In particular, in the high mobility scenario, we obtain a globally optimal solution using interior point method. In the static scenario, we develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point using alternating optimization. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed solutions achieve significant gains over existing baseline schemes and can well adapt to the changes of the system parameters to wisely utilize storage resources and transmission opportunities.
