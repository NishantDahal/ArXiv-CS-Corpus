Software Professionals are Not Directors: What Constitutes a Good Video?

Videos are one of the best documentation options for a rich and effective communication. They allow experiencing the overall context of a situation by representing concrete realizations of certain requirements. Despite 35 years of research on integrating videos in requirements engineering (RE), videos are not an established documentation option in terms of RE best practices. Several approaches use videos but omit the details about how to produce them. Software professionals lack knowledge on how to communicate visually with videos since they are not directors. Therefore, they do not necessarily have the required skills neither to produce good videos in general nor to deduce what constitutes a good video for an existing approach. The discipline of video production provides numerous generic guidelines that represent best practices on how to produce a good video with specific characteristics. We propose to analyze this existing know-how to learn what constitutes a good video for visual communication. As a plan of action, we suggest a literature study of video production guidelines. We expect to identify quality characteristics of good videos in order to derive a quality model. Software professionals may use such a quality model for videos as an orientation for planning, shooting, post-processing, and viewing a video. Thus, we want to encourage and enable software professionals to produce good videos at moderate costs, yet sufficient quality.
