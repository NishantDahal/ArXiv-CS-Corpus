Leveraging Elastic Demand for Forecasting

Demand variance can result in a mismatch between planned supply and actual demand. Demand shaping strategies such as pricing can be used to shift elastic demand to reduce the imbalance. In this work, we propose to consider elastic demand in the forecasting phase. We present a method to reallocate the historical elastic demand to reduce variance, thus making forecasting and supply planning more effective.
