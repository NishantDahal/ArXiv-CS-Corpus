An Effective Property of $ω$-Rational Functions

We prove that  $ω$-regular languages accepted by Büchi or Muller automata satisfy  an effective automata-theoretic version of the Baire property. Then we use this result to obtain a new effective property of rational functions over infinite words which are realized by finite state Büchi transducers: for each such function $F: Σ^ω\rightarrow Γ^ω$, one can construct a deterministic  Büchi automaton $\mathcal{A}$ accepting a dense  ${\bf Π}^0_2$-subset of  $Σ^ω$  such that the restriction of $F$ to $L(\mathcal{A})$ is continuous.
