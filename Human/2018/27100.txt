Evolution of holonic control architectures towards Industry 4.0: A short overview

The flexibility claimed by the next generation production systems induces a deep modification of the behavior and the core itself of the control systems. Overconnectivity and data management abilities targeted by Industry 4.0 paradigm enable the emergence of more flexible and reactive control systems, based on the cooperation of autonomous and connected entities in the decision making process. For the last 20 years, holonic paradigm has become the core paradigm of those evolutions, and evolved in itself. This contribution aims at emphasizing the conceptual evolutions in the application of holonic paradigm in the control architectures of manufacturing systems and highlighting the current research trends in this field.
