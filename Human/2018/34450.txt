Deep Learning Based Joint Pilot Design and Channel Estimation for Multiuser MIMO Channels

In this paper, we propose a joint pilot design and channel estimation scheme based on the deep learning (DL) technique for multiuser multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) channels. To this end, we construct a pilot designer using two-layer neural networks (TNNs) and a channel estimator using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are jointly trained to minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation. To effectively reduce the interference among the multiple users, we also use the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique in the channel estimation process. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) based channel estimation scheme.
