A novel health risk model based on intraday physical activity time series collected by smartphones

We compiled a demo application and collected a motion database of more than 10,000 smartphone users to produce a health risk model trained on physical activity streams. We turned to adversarial domain adaptation and employed the UK Biobank dataset of motion data, augmented by a rich set of clinical information as the source domain to train the model using a deep residual convolutional neuron network (ResNet). The model risk score is a biomarker of ageing, since it was predictive of lifespan and healthspan (as defined by the onset of specified diseases), and was elevated in groups associated with life-shortening lifestyles, such as smoking. We ascertained the target domain performance in a smaller cohort of the mobile application that included users who were willing to share answers to a short questionnaire related to their disease and smoking status. We thus conclude that the proposed pipeline combining deep convolutional and Domain Adversarial neuron networks (DANN) is a powerful tool for disease risk and lifestyle-associated hazard assessment from mobile motion sensors that are transferable across devices and populations.
