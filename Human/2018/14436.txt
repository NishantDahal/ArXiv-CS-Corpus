Cubical informal type theory: the higher groupoid structure

Following a project of developing conventions and notations for informal type theory carried out in the homotopy type theory book for a framework built out of an augmentation of constructive type theory with axioms governing higher-dimensional constructions via Voevodsky's univalance axiom and higher-inductive types, this paper proposes a way of doing informal type theory with a cubical type theory as the underlying foundation instead. To that end, we adopt a cubical type theory recently proposed by Angiuli, Hou (Favonia) and Harper, a framework with a cumulative hierarchy of univalent Kan universes, full univalence and instances of higher-inductive types. In the present paper we confine ourselves to some elementary theorems concerning the higher groupoid structure of types.
