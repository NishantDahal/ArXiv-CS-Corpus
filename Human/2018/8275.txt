Analyzing Solar Irradiance Variation From GPS and Cameras

The total amount of solar irradiance falling on the earth's surface is an important area of study amongst the photo-voltaic (PV) engineers and remote sensing analysts. The received solar irradiance impacts the total amount of generated solar energy. However, this generation is often hindered by the high degree of solar irradiance variability. In this paper, we study the main factors behind such variability with the assistance of Global Positioning System (GPS) and ground-based, high-resolution sky cameras. This analysis will also be helpful for understanding cloud phenomenon and other events in the earth's atmosphere.
