Locally Recoverable codes with local error detection

A locally recoverable code is an error-correcting code such that any erasure in a coordinate of a codeword can be recovered from a set of other few coordinates. In this article we introduce a model of local recoverable codes that also includes local error detection. The cases of the Reed-Solomon and Locally Recoverable Reed-Solomon codes are treated in some detail.
