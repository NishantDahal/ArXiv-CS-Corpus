Endowing Robots with Longer-term Autonomy by Recovering from External Disturbances in Manipulation through Grounded Anomaly Classification and Recovery Policies

Robot manipulation is increasingly poised to interact with humans in co-shared workspaces. Despite increasingly robust manipulation and control algorithms, failure modes continue to exist whenever models do not capture the dynamics of the unstructured environment. To obtain longer-term horizons in robot automation, robots must develop introspection and recovery abilities. We contribute a set of recovery policies to deal with anomalies produced by external disturbances as well as anomaly classification through the use of non-parametric statistics with memoized variational inference with scalable adaptation. A recovery critic stands atop of a tightly-integrated, graph-based online motion-generation and introspection system that resolves a wide range of anomalous situations. Policies, skills, and introspection models are learned incrementally and contextually in a task. Two task-level recovery policies: re-enactment and adaptation resolve accidental and persistent anomalies respectively. The introspection system uses non-parametric priors along with Markov jump linear systems and memoized variational inference with scalable adaptation to learn a model from the data. Extensive real-robot experimentation with various strenuous anomalous conditions is induced and resolved at different phases of a task and in different combinations. The system executes around-the-clock introspection and recovery and even elicited self-recovery when misclassifications occurred.
