The Device War - The War Between IOT Brands In A Household

Users buy compatible IOT devices from different brands with an expectation that their cooperation is smooth, but while function may superficially look friendly, cohabitation can subversively cause early battery depletion in competitor devices. The Wi-Fi Direct standard was introduced with the intention of simplifying peer-to-peer connections in home applications while helping devices to save power through centralization of effort into a single group owner device negotiated on start-up. Attacks on the group formation stage can be based on manipulating a victim device to frequently end up being assigned the group owner function, thereby depleting its batteries at faster rates than its peer devices. This manipulation is made easy by the group formation mechanism adopted by the standard. We show that group formation procedures could be better secured with features ensuring fairness by relying on commitments and by learning about the behavior observed for peer devices in the past. Simulations are used to quantify the resistance achieved against several attack strategies.
