An Ontology-Based Reasoning Framework for Context-Aware Applications

Context-aware applications process context information to support users in their daily tasks and routines. These applications can adapt their functionalities by aggregating context information through machine-learning and data processing algorithms, supporting users with recommendations or services based on their current needs. In the last years, smartphones have been used in the field of context-awareness due to their embedded sensors and various communication interfaces such as Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC or cellular. However, building context-aware applications for smartphones can be a challenging and time-consuming task. In this paper, we describe an ontology-based reasoning framework to create context-aware applications. The framework is based on an ontology as well as micro-services to aggregate, process and represent context information.
