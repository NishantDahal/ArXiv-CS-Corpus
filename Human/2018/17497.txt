Patch-based Evaluation of Dense Image Matching Quality

Airborne laser scanning and photogrammetry are two main techniques to obtain 3D data representing the object surface. Due to the high cost of laser scanning, we want to explore the potential of using point clouds derived by dense image matching (DIM), as effective alternatives to laser scanning data. We present a framework to evaluate point clouds from dense image matching and derived Digital Surface Models (DSM) based on automatically extracted sample patches. Dense matching error and noise level are evaluated quantitatively at both the local level and whole block level. Experiments show that the optimal vertical accuracy achieved by dense matching is as follows: the mean offset to the reference data is 0.1 Ground Sampling Distance (GSD); the maximum offset goes up to 1.0 GSD. When additional oblique images are used in dense matching, the mean deviation, the variation of mean deviation and the level of random noise all get improved. We also detect a bias between the point cloud and DSM from a single photogrammetric workflow. This framework also allows to reveal inhomogeneity in the distribution of the dense matching errors due to over-fitted BBA network. Meanwhile, suggestions are given on the photogrammetric quality control.
