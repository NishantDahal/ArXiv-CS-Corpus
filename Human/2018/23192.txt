Direct optimization of F-measure for retrieval-based personal question answering

Recent advances in spoken language technologies and the introduction of many customer facing products, have given rise to a wide customer reliance on smart personal assistants for many of their daily tasks. In this paper, we present a system to reduce users' cognitive load by extending personal assistants with long-term personal memory where users can store and retrieve by voice, arbitrary pieces of information. The problem is framed as a neural retrieval based question answering system where answers are selected from previously stored user memories. We propose to directly optimize the end-to-end retrieval performance, measured by the F1-score, using reinforcement learning, leading to better performance on our experimental test set(s).
