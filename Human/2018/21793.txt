Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Variational Neural Language Generation in Dialogue Systems

Domain Adaptation arises when we aim at learning from source domain a model that can per- form acceptably well on a different target domain. It is especially crucial for Natural Language Generation (NLG) in Spoken Dialogue Systems when there are sufficient annotated data in the source domain, but there is a limited labeled data in the target domain. How to effectively utilize as much of existing abilities from source domains is a crucial issue in domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training procedure to train a Variational encoder-decoder based language generator via multiple adaptation steps. In this procedure, a model is first trained on a source domain data and then fine-tuned on a small set of target domain utterances under the guidance of two proposed critics. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effec- tively leverage the existing knowledge in the source domain to adapt to another related domain by using only a small amount of in-domain data.
