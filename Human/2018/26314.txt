Certified Ethical Hacker v.10 Online Course - a Case Study

CEH v.10 Certification Self-study Course is an online course preparing learners for one of the most prestige cyber security certifications in the world - the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) v.10 Certification. Due to a pay wall and the practical rather than theoretical nature, most researchers have limited exposure to this course. For the first time, this paper will analyze the course's instructional design based on the highest national standards and related peer-reviewed published research works. The sole intention is to push the course to a higher ground, making it the best online course for cyber security. More importantly, the paper's instructional design evaluation strategy can well be extended and applied to any other online course' instructional design review and/or evaluation process.
