Capacity-Achieving Input Distribution in Per-Sample Zero-Dispersion Model of Optical Fiber

The per-sample zero-dispersion channel model of the optical fiber is considered. It is shown that capacity is uniquely achieved by an input probability distribution that has continuous uniform phase and discrete amplitude that takes on finitely many values. This result holds when the channel is subject to general input cost constraints, that include a peak amplitude constraint and a joint average and peak amplitude constraint.
