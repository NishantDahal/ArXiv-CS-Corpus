EFSIS: Ensemble Feature Selection Integrating Stability

Ensemble learning that can be used to combine the predictions from multiple learners has been widely applied in pattern recognition, and has been reported to be more robust and accurate than the individual learners. This ensemble logic has recently also been more applied in feature selection. There are basically two strategies for ensemble feature selection, namely data perturbation and function perturbation. Data perturbation performs feature selection on data subsets sampled from the original dataset and then selects the features consistently ranked highly across those data subsets. This has been found to improve both the stability of the selector and the prediction accuracy for a classifier. Function perturbation frees the user from having to decide on the most appropriate selector for any given situation and works by aggregating multiple selectors. This has been found to maintain or improve classification performance. Here we propose a framework, EFSIS, combining these two strategies. Empirical results indicate that EFSIS gives both high prediction accuracy and stability.
