Accounting for gender research performance differences in ranking universities

The literature on the theme of gender differences in research performance indicates a quite evident gap in favor of men over women. Beyond the understanding of the factors that could be at the basis of this phenomenon, it is worthwhile understanding if it would be appropriate to conduct the evaluation per population in a manner distinguished by gender. In fact if there is some factor that structurally determines a penalization of performance by women researchers compared to men then the comparative evaluation of organizations' performance that does not take gender into account will lead to an advantage for those that employ more men, under parity in the capacities of their staffs. In this work we measure the differences of the performance and the rank of research institutions as observed when gender is taken into account compared to when it is ignored. The study population consists of all Italian universities and the performance measured in the hard sciences for the period 2006-2010.
