Comparative Study on Millimeter Wave Location-Based Beamforming

This paper presents a comparative study on millimeter wave (mmWave) location-based analog beamforming (BF) techniques based on channel estimation. Localization and compressive sensing (CS) effectively reduces mmWave BF complexity and enhance the performance of mmWave system comparable to the conventional mmWave analog BF techniques. BF techniques based on channel state information (CSI) has high complexity in constructing mmWave channel sensing matrix using CS. Location services based techniques highly reduce this complexity by defining the area within which the user equipment (UE) mostly probable to be exist. In this paper, we study the performance of mmWave location-based BF using various location services. Where, the BF is conducted using channel estimation based CS to estimate both the angle of departures (AoDs) and the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of the mmWave channel.
