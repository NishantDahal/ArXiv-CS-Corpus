Adaptive modeling of urban dynamics during ephemeral event via mobile phone traces

The communication devices have produced digital traces for their users either voluntarily or not. This type of collective data can give powerful indications that are affecting the urban systems design and development. In this study mobile phone data during Armada event is investigated. Analyzing mobile phone traces gives conceptual views about individuals densities and their mobility patterns in the urban city. The geo-visualization and statistical techniques have been used for understanding human mobility collectively and individually. The undertaken substantial parameters are inter-event times, travel distances (displacements) and radius of gyration. They have been analyzed and simulated using computing platform by integrating various applications for huge database management, visualization, analysis, and simulation. Accordingly, the general population pattern law has been extracted. The study contribution outcomes have revealed both the individuals densities in static perspective and individuals mobility in dynamic perspective with multi levels of abstraction (macroscopic, mesoscopic, microscopic).
