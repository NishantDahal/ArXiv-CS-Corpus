Weight Initialization in Neural Language Models

Semantic Similarity is an important application which finds its use in many downstream NLP applications. Though the task is mathematically defined, semantic similarity's essence is to capture the notions of similarity impregnated in humans. Machines use some heuristics to calculate the similarity between words, but these are typically corpus dependent or are useful for specific domains. The difference between Semantic Similarity and Semantic Relatedness motivates the development of new algorithms. For a human, the word car and road are probably as related as car and bus. But this may not be the case for computational methods. Ontological methods are good at encoding Semantic Similarity and Vector Space models are better at encoding Semantic Relatedness. There is a dearth of methods which leverage ontologies to create better vector representations. The aim of this proposal is to explore in the direction of a hybrid method which combines statistical/vector space methods like Word2Vec and Ontological methods like WordNet to leverage the advantages provided by both.
