Characterisation of (Sub)sequential Rational Functions over a General Class Monoids

In this technical report we describe a general class of monoids for which (sub)sequential rational can be characterised in terms of a congruence relation in the flavour of Myhill-Nerode relation. The class of monoids that we consider can be described in terms of natural algebraic axioms, contains the free monoids, groups, the tropical monoid, and is closed under Cartesian.
