Neural Networks with Structural Resistance to Adversarial Attacks

In adversarial attacks to machine-learning classifiers, small perturbations are added to input that is correctly classified. The perturbations yield adversarial examples, which are virtually indistinguishable from the unperturbed input, and yet are misclassified. In standard neural networks used for deep learning, attackers can craft adversarial examples from most input to cause a misclassification of their choice.
  We introduce a new type of network units, called RBFI units, whose non-linear structure makes them inherently resistant to adversarial attacks. On permutation-invariant MNIST, in absence of adversarial attacks, networks using RBFI units match the performance of networks using sigmoid units, and are slightly below the accuracy of networks with ReLU units. When subjected to adversarial attacks, networks with RBFI units retain accuracies above 90% for attacks that degrade the accuracy of networks with ReLU or sigmoid units to below 2%. RBFI networks trained with regular input are superior in their resistance to adversarial attacks even to ReLU and sigmoid networks trained with the help of adversarial examples.
  The non-linear structure of RBFI units makes them difficult to train using standard gradient descent. We show that networks of RBFI units can be efficiently trained to high accuracies using pseudogradients, computed using functions especially crafted to facilitate learning instead of their true derivatives. We show that the use of pseudogradients makes training deep RBFI networks practical, and we compare several structural alternatives of RBFI networks for their accuracy.
