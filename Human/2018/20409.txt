Precoding for Dual Polarization Soliton Transmission

We consider dual-polarized optical multi-soliton pulse transmission. Modulating the nonlinear spectrum, it becomes highly correlated in noisy fiber links. We propose a simple precoding to significantly reduce the correlation, allowing disjoint detection of spectral amplitudes.
