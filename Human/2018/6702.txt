Entanglement-assisted quantum MDS codes constructed from constacyclic codes

Recently, entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) have been constructed by cyclic codes and negacyclic codes. In this paper, by analyzing the cyclotomic cosets in the defining set of constacyclic codes, we constructed three classes of new EAQECCs which satisfy the entanglement-assisted quantum Singleton bound. Besides, three classes of EAQECCs with maximal entanglement from constacyclic codes are constructed in the meanwhile.
