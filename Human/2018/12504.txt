Day-ahead Trading of Aggregated Energy Flexibility - Full Version

Flexibility of small loads, in particular from Electric Vehicles (EVs), has recently attracted a lot of interest due to their possibility of participating in the energy market and the new commercial potentials. Different from existing work, the aggregation techniques proposed in this paper produce flexible aggregated loads from EVs taking into account technical market requirements. They can be further transformed into the so-called flexible orders and be traded in the day-ahead market by a Balance Responsible Party (BRP). As a result, the BRP can achieve at least 20% cost reduction on average in energy purchase compared to traditional charging based on 2017 real electricity prices from the Danish electricity market.
