Rademacher Generalization Bounds for Classifier Chains

In this paper, we propose a new framework to study the generalization property of classifier chains trained over observations associated with multiple and interdependent class labels. The results are based on large deviation inequalities for Lipschitz functions of weakly dependent sequences proposed by Rio in 2000. We believe that the resulting generalization error bound brings many advantages and could be adapted to other frameworks that consider interdependent outputs. First, it explicitly exhibits the dependencies between class labels. Secondly, it provides insights of the effect of the order of the chain on the algorithm generalization performances. Finally, the two dependency coefficients that appear in the bound could also be used to design new strategies to decide the order of the chain.
