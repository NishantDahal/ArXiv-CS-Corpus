Computer Simulation of Biological Processes at the High School

The article describes the method of using computer-learning tools during the modeling of biological processes in the high school. The author developed web pages for online processing of the results of simulation of the genetic structure of the population, which are affected by factors of change in its genetic equilibrium. It is argued that the modeling of the genetic structure of a population that is not described by the Hardy-Weinberg law allows students to formulate persistent beliefs about the causes and directions of microevolutionary changes in populations and the individual factors of the evolutionary process in general.
