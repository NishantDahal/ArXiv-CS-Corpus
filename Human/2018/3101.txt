Stepwise Transmit Antenna Selection in Downlink Massive Multiuser MIMO

Due to the large power consumption in RF-circuitry of massive MIMO systems, practically relevant performance measures such as energy efficiency or bandwidth efficiency are neither necessarily monotonous functions of the total transmit power nor the number of active antennas. Optimal antenna selection is however computationally infeasible in these systems. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the transmit power and the subset of selected antennas subject to non-monotonous performance measures in massive multiuser MIMO settings. Numerical results are given for energy efficiency and demonstrate that for several settings the optimal number of selected antennas reported by the proposed algorithm is significantly smaller than the total number of transmit antennas. This fact indicates that antenna selection in several massive MIMO scenarios not only reduces the hardware complexity and RF-costs, but also enhances the energy efficiency of the system.
