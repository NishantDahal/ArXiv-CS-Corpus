Game-Theoretic Optimization for Machine-Type Communications Under QoS Guarantee

Massive machine-type communication (mMTC) is a new focus of services in fifth generation (5G) communication networks. The associated stringent delay requirement of end-to-end (E2E) service deliveries poses technical challenges. In this paper, we propose a joint random access and data transmission protocol for mMTC to guarantee E2E service quality of different traffic types. First, we develop a priority-queueing-based access class barring (ACB) model and a novel effective capacity is derived. Then, we model the priority-queueing-based ACB policy as a non-cooperative game, where utility is defined as the difference between effective capacity and access penalty price. We prove the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium (NE) of the non-cooperative game, which is also a sub-modular utility maximization problem and can be solved by a greedy updating algorithm with convergence to the unique NE. To further improve the efficiency, we present a price-update algorithm, which converges to a local optimum. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the derived effective capacity and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
