Finite-state Independence and Normal Sequences

We consider the previously defined notion of finite-state independence and we focus specifically on normal words. We characterize finite-state independence of normal words in three different ways, using three different kinds of asynchronous deterministic finite automata with two input tapes containing infinite words. Based on one of the characterizations we give an algorithm to construct a pair of finite-state independent normal words.
