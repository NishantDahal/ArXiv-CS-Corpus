Generating Synchronizing Automata with Large Reset Lengths

We study synchronizing automata with the shortest reset words of relatively large length. First, we refine the Frankl-Pin result on the length of the shortest words of rank $m$, and the Béal, Berlinkov, Perrin, and Steinberg results on the length of the shortest reset words in one-cluster automata. The obtained results are useful in computation aimed in extending the class of small automata for which the Černý conjecture is verified and discovering new automata with special properties regarding synchronization.
