Resource Control in P2P Cryptocurrency Networks

For decentralised P2P networks, it is very important to have a mechanism in place that allows the nodes to control resource usage and prevent flooding and denial-of-service attacks with spam. In this paper, we discuss and compare the different approaches to fully decentralised resource control that are used by projects in the cryptocurrency space. The introduced methods are then applied to design a decentralised exchange for Namecoin names (or more generally, crypto assets) as an example.
