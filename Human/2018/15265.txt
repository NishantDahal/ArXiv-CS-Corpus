The Optimal DoF Region for the Two-User Non-Coherent SIMO Multiple-Access Channel

The optimal degree-of-freedom (DoF) region of the non-coherent multiple-access channels is still unknown in general. In this paper, we make some progress by deriving the entire optimal DoF region in the case of the two-user single-input multiple-output (SIMO) generic block fading channels. The achievability is based on a simple training-based scheme. The novelty of our result lies in the converse using a genie-aided bound and the duality upper bound. As a by-product, our result generalizes previous proofs for the single-user Rayleigh block fading channels.
