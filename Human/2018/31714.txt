A Unified Perspective of Evolutionary Game Dynamics Using Generalized Growth Transforms

In this paper, we show that different types of evolutionary game dynamics are, in principle, special cases of a dynamical system model based on our previously reported framework of generalized growth transforms. The framework shows that different dynamics arise as a result of minimizing a population energy such that the population as a whole evolves to reach the most stable state. By introducing a population dependent time-constant in the generalized growth transform model, the proposed framework can be used to explain a vast repertoire of evolutionary dynamics, including some novel forms of game dynamics with non-linear payoffs.
