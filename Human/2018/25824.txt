Development of a Steel Bridge Climbing Robot

Motivated by a high demand for automated inspection of civil infrastructure, this work presents a new design and development of a tank-like robot for structural health monitoring. Unlike most existing magnetic wheeled mobile robot designs, which may be suitable for climbing on flat steel surface, our proposed tank-like robot design uses reciprocating mechanism and roller-chains to make it capable of climbing on different structural shapes (e.g., cylinder, cube) with coated or non-coated steel surfaces. The proposed robot is able to transition from one surface to the other (e.g., from flat surface to curving surface).
  Taking into account of several strict considerations (including tight dimension, efficient adhesion and climbing flexibility) to adapt with various shapes of steel structures, a prototype tank-like robot incorporating multiple sensors (hall-effects, sonars, inertial measurement unit and camera), has been developed. Rigorous analysis of robot kinematics, adhesion force, sliding failure and turn-over failure has been conducted to demonstrate the stability of the proposed design. Mechanical and magnetic force analysis together with sliding/turn-over failure investigation can serve as an useful framework for designing various steel climbing robots in the future. Experimental results and field deployments confirm the adhesion and climbing capability of the developed robot.
