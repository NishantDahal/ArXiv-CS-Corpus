Construction of MDS Self-dual Codes over Finite Fields

In this paper, we obtain some new results on the existence of MDS self-dual codes utilizing (extended) generalized Reed-Solomon codes over finite fields of odd characteristic. For some fixed $q$, our results can produce more classes of MDS self-dual codes than previous works.
