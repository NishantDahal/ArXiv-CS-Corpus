Adapting website design for people with color-blindness

The aim of the study is the description of problem of developing web design for people with color blindness. The objectives of the study are familiarising with the exiting algorithms of simulation color blindness and searching the most appropriate color models to realize a filter of disputed colors. The object of the study is the convertation of color models and algorithms of filtration. The subject of the study are methods of recognition disputed colors. In the study were investigated the problems of color blind people, examined the basic concepts of trichromatic color vision theory, substantiated the necessity of changing different types of color models, given formulas convertation from RGB-color model to HSL-color model, systematized the algorithms of imitation and filtration of colors for different types of dichromacy: protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia. The results of the study are planned using in development of adapting website design for people with color blindness.
