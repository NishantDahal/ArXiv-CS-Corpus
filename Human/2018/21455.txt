Starting Movement Detection of Cyclists Using Smart Devices

In near future, vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as cyclists and pedestrians will be equipped with smart devices and wearables which are capable to communicate with intelligent vehicles and other traffic participants. Road users are then able to cooperate on different levels, such as in cooperative intention detection for advanced VRU protection. Smart devices can be used to detect intentions, e.g., an occluded cyclist intending to cross the road, to warn vehicles of VRUs, and prevent potential collisions. This article presents a human activity recognition approach to detect the starting movement of cyclists wearing smart devices. We propose a novel two-stage feature selection procedure using a score specialized for robust starting detection reducing the false positive detections and leading to understandable and interpretable features. The detection is modelled as a classification problem and realized by means of a machine learning classifier. We introduce an auxiliary class, that models starting movements and allows to integrate early movement indicators, i.e., body part movements indicating future behaviour. In this way we improve the robustness and reduce the detection time of the classifier. Our empirical studies with real-world data originating from experiments which involve 49 test subjects and consists of 84 starting motions show that we are able to detect the starting movements early. Our approach reaches an F1-score of 67 % within 0.33 s after the first movement of the bicycle wheel. Investigations concerning the device wearing location show that for devices worn in the trouser pocket the detector has less false detections and detects starting movements faster on average. We found that we can further improve the results when we train distinct classifiers for different wearing locations.
