WEBCA: Weakly-Electric-Fish Bioinspired Cognitive Architecture

Neuroethology has been an active field of study for more than a century now. Out of some of the most interesting species that has been studied so far, weakly electric fish is a fascinating one. It performs communication, echo-location and inter-species detection efficiently with an interesting configuration of sensors, neu-rons and a simple brain. In this paper we propose a cognitive architecture inspired by the way these fishes handle and process information. We believe that it is eas-ier to understand and mimic the neural architectures of a simpler species than that of human. Hence, the proposed architecture is expected to both help research in cognitive robotics and also help understand more complicated brains like that of human beings.
