Log-Concave Polynomials III: Mason's Ultra-Log-Concavity Conjecture for Independent Sets of Matroids

We give a self-contained proof of the strongest version of Mason's conjecture, namely that for any matroid the sequence of the number of independent sets of given sizes is ultra log-concave. To do this, we introduce a class of polynomials, called completely log-concave polynomials, whose bivariate restrictions have ultra log-concave coefficients. At the heart of our proof we show that for any matroid, the homogenization of the generating polynomial of its independent sets is completely log-concave.
