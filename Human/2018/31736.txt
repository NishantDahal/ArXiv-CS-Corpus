Fact-checking Initiatives in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal: A Study of User Engagement and Challenges

Fake news and misinformation spread in developing countries as fast as they do in developed countries with increasing penetration of the internet and social media. However, fighting misinformation is more difficult in developing countries where resources and necessary technologies are scarce. This study provides an understanding of the challenges various fact-checking initiatives face in three South Asian countries--Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. In-depth interviews were conducted with senior editors of six fact-checking initiatives. Challenges identified include lack of resources, technologies, and political pressure. An analysis of Facebook pages of these initiatives shows increasing user engagement with their posts.
