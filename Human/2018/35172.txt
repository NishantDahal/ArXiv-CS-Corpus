AIR: Anywhere Immersive Reality with User-Perspective Projection

Projection-based augmented reality (AR) has much potential, but is limited in that it requires burdensome installations and prone to geometric distortions on display surface. To overcome these limitations, we propose AIR. It can be carried and placed anywhere to project AR using pan/tilting motors, while providing the user with distortion-free projection of a correct 3D view.
