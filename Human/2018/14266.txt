Performance Analysis of Unsupervised LTE Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication

Cellular network technology based device-to-device communication attracts increasing attention for use cases such as the control of autonomous vehicles on the ground and in the air. LTE provides device-to-device communication options, however, the configuration options are manifold (leading to 150+ possible combinations) and therefore the ideal combination of parameters is hard to find. Depending on the use case, either throughput, reliability or latency constraints may be the primary concern of the service provider. In this work we analyze the impact of different configuration settings of unsupervised LTE device-to-device (sidelink) communication on the system performance. Using a simulative approach we vary the length of the PSCCH period and the number of PSCCH subframes and determine the impact of different combinations of those parameters on the resulting latency, reliability and the interarrival times of the received packets. Furthermore we examine the system limitations by a scalability analysis. In this context, we propose a modified HARQ process to mitigate scalability constraints. Our results show that the proposed reduced HARQ retransmission probability can increase the system performance regarding latency and interarrival times as well as the packet transmission reliability for higher channel utilization.
