Reliability based-design optimization using the directional bat algorithm

Reliability based design optimization (RBDO) problems are important in engineering applications, but it is challenging to solve such problems. In this study, a new resolution method based on the directional Bat Algorithm (dBA) is presented. To overcome the difficulties in the evaluations of probabilistic constraints, the reliable design space concept has been applied to convert the yielded stochastic constrained optimization problem from the RBDO formulation into a deterministic constrained optimization problem. In addition, the constraint handling technique has also been introduced to the dBA so that the algorithm can solve constrained optimization problem effectively. The new method has been applied to several engineering problems and the results show that the new method can solve different varieties of RBDO problems efficiently. In fact, the obtained solutions are consistent with the best results in the literature.
