Task Replication for Vehicular Edge Computing: A Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit based Approach

In vehicular edge computing (VEC) system, some vehicles with surplus computing resources can provide computation task offloading opportunities for other vehicles or pedestrians. However, vehicular network is highly dynamic, with fast varying channel states and computation loads. These dynamics are difficult to model or to predict, but they have major impact on the quality of service (QoS) of task offloading, including delay performance and service reliability. Meanwhile, the computing resources in VEC are often redundant due to the high density of vehicles. To improve the QoS of VEC and exploit the abundant computing resources on vehicles, we propose a learning-based task replication algorithm (LTRA) based on combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) theory, in order to minimize the average offloading delay. LTRA enables multiple vehicles to process the replicas of the same task simultaneously, and vehicles that require computing services can learn the delay performance of other vehicles while offloading tasks. We take the occurrence time of vehicles into consideration, and redesign the utility function of existing CMAB algorithm, so that LTRA can adapt to the time varying network topology of VEC. We use a realistic highway scenario to evaluate the delay performance and service reliability of LTRA through simulations, and show that compared with single task offloading, LTRA can improve the task completion ratio with deadline 0.6s from 80% to 98%.
