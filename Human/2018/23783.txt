Polyline Drawings with Topological Constraints

Let $G$ be a simple topological graph and let $Γ$ be a polyline drawing of $G$. We say that $Γ$ \emph{partially preserves the topology} of $G$ if it has the same external boundary, the same rotation system, and the same set of crossings as $G$. Drawing $Γ$ fully preserves the topology of $G$ if the planarization of $G$ and the planarization of $Γ$ have the same planar embedding. We show that if the set of crossing-free edges of $G$ forms a connected spanning subgraph, then $G$ admits a polyline drawing that partially preserves its topology and that has curve complexity at most three (i.e., at most three bends per edge). If, however, the set of crossing-free edges of $G$ is not a connected spanning subgraph, the curve complexity may be $Ω(\sqrt{n})$. Concerning drawings that fully preserve the topology, we show that if $G$ has skewness $k$, it admits one such drawing with curve complexity at most $2k$; for skewness-1 graphs, the curve complexity can be reduced to one, which is a tight bound. We also consider optimal $2$-plane graphs and discuss trade-offs between curve complexity and crossing angle resolution of drawings that fully preserve the topology.
