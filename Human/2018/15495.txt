An Industrial Social Network for Sharing Knowledge Among Operators

Due to the increasing complexity of modern automatic machines typically used in several industrial applications, the need for assistive technologies is becoming very relevant. Typical approaches consist in designing advanced and adaptive human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that can be effectively used by any operator and that provide guided procedures for the most common situations. However, when dealing with complex systems, infrequent and unforeseen situations may happen, whose solution require the experience owned by a limited number of skilled operators. To this end, in this paper we propose an industrial social network concept to allow an effective exchange of information among the operators and to facilitate the solution of unforeseen events, such as unscheduled maintenance activities or troubleshooting.
