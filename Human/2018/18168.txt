A deep learning architecture to detect events in EEG signals during sleep

Electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep is used by clinicians to evaluate various neurological disorders. In sleep medicine, it is relevant to detect macro-events (> 10s) such as sleep stages, and micro-events (<2s) such as spindles and K-complexes. Annotations of such events require a trained sleep expert, a time consuming and tedious process with a large inter-scorer variability. Automatic algorithms have been developed to detect various types of events but these are event-specific. We propose a deep learning method that jointly predicts locations, durations and types of events in EEG time series. It relies on a convolutional neural network that builds a feature representation from raw EEG signals. Numerical experiments demonstrate efficiency of this new approach on various event detection tasks compared to current state-of-the-art, event specific, algorithms.
