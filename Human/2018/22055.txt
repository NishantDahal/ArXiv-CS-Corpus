Cyber Threat Intelligence : Challenges and Opportunities

The ever increasing number of cyber attacks requires the cyber security and forensic specialists to detect, analyze and defend against the cyber threats in almost realtime. In practice, timely dealing with such a large number of attacks is not possible without deeply perusing the attack features and taking corresponding intelligent defensive actions, this in essence defines cyber threat intelligence notion. However, such an intelligence would not be possible without the aid of artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced data mining techniques to collect, analyse, and interpret cyber attack evidences. In this introductory chapter we first discuss the notion of cyber threat intelligence and its main challenges and opportunities, and then briefly introduce the chapters of the book which either address the identified challenges or present opportunistic solutions to provide threat intelligence.
