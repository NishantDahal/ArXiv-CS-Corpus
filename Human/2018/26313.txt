Uploading Brain into Computer: Whom to Upload First?

The final goal of the intelligence augmentation process is a complete merger of biological brains and computers allowing for integration and mutual enhancement between computer's speed and memory and human's intelligence. This process, known as uploading, analyzes human brain in detail sufficient to understand its working patterns and makes it possible to simulate said brain on a computer. As it is likely that such simulations would quickly evolve or be modified to achieve superintelligence it is very important to make sure that the first brain chosen for such a procedure is a suitable one. In this paper, we attempt to answer the question: Whom to upload first?
