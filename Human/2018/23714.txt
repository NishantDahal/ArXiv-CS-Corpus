Co-simulation of Continuous Systems: A Tutorial

Co-simulation consists of the theory and techniques to enable global simulation of a coupled system via the composition of simulators. Despite the large number of applications and growing interest in the challenges, the field remains fragmented into multiple application domains, with limited sharing of knowledge.
  This tutorial aims at introducing co-simulation of continuous systems, targeted at researchers new to the field.
