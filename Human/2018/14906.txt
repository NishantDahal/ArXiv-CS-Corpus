Two Algorithms in Group Theory

We present a new algorithm deciding if the intersection of a quasiconvex subgroup of a negatively curved group with a conjugate is finite. We also give a short proof of decidability of the membership problem for quasiconvex subgroups of finitely generated groups with decidable word problem.
