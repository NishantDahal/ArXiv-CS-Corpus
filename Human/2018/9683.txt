Extra Space during Initialization of Succinct Data Structures and Dynamical Initializable Arrays

Many succinct data structures on the word RAM require precomputed tables to start operating. Usually, the tables can be constructed in sublinear time. In this time, most of a data structure is not initialized, i.e., there is plenty of unused space allocated for the data structure. We present a general framework to store temporarily extra buffers between the real data so that the data can be processed immediately, stored first in the buffers, and then moved into the real data structure after finishing the tables. As an application, we apply our framework to Dodis, Patrascu, and Thorup's data structure (STOC 2010) that emulates c-ary memory and to Farzan and Munro's succinct encoding of arbitrary graphs (TCS 2013). We also use our framework to present an in-place dynamical initializable array.
