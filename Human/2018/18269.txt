A Geo-Aware Server Assignment Problem for Mobile Edge Computing

As mobile devices have become the preferred tool for communication, work, and entertainment, traffic at the edge of the network is growing more rapidly than ever. To improve user experience, commodity servers are deployed in the edge to form a decentralized network of mini datacenters each serving a localized region. A challenge is how to place these servers geographically to maximize the offloading benefit and be close to the users they respectively serve. We introduce a formulation for this problem to serve applications that involve pairwise communication between mobile devices at different geolocations. We explore several heuristic solutions and compare them in an evaluation using both real-world and synthetic datasets.
