Characteristic Analysis of 1024-Point Quantized Radix-2 FFT/IFFT Processor

The precise analysis and accurate measurement of harmonic provides a reliable scientific industrial application. However, the high-performance DSP processor is the important method of electrical harmonic analysis. Hence, in this research work, the effort was taken to design a novel high-resolution single 1024-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) processors for improvement of the harmonic measurement techniques. Meanwhile, the project is started with design and simulation to demonstrate the benefit that is achieved by the proposed 1024-point FFT/IFFT processor. The pipelined structure is incorporated in order to enhance the system efficiency. As such, a pipelined architecture was proposed to statically scale the resolution of the processor to suite adequate trade-off constraints. The proposed FFT makes use of programmable fixed-point/floating-point to realize higher precision FFT.
