Fixation Data Analysis for High Resolution Satellite Images

The presented study is an eye tracking experiment for high-resolution satellite (HRS) images. The reported experiment explores the Area Of Interest (AOI) based analysis of eye fixation data for complex HRS images. The study reflects the requisite of reference data for bottom-up saliency-based segmentation and the struggle of eye tracking data analysis for complex satellite images. The intended fixation data analysis aims towards the reference data creation for bottom-up saliency-based segmentation of high-resolution satellite images. The analytical outcome of this experimental study provides a solution for AOI-based analysis for fixation data in the complex environment of satellite images and recommendations for reference data construction which is already an ongoing effort.
