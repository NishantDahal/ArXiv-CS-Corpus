Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes for Channels with Burst and Isolated Erasures

Recovery of data packets from packet erasures in a timely manner is critical for many streaming applications. An early paper by Martinian and Sundberg introduced a framework for streaming codes and designed rate-optimal codes that permit delay-constrained recovery from an erasure burst of length up to $B$. A recent work by Badr et al. extended this result and introduced a sliding-window channel model $\mathcal{C}(N,B,W)$. Under this model, in a sliding-window of width $W$, one of the following erasure patterns are possible (i) a burst of length at most $B$ or (ii) at most $N$ (possibly non-contiguous) arbitrary erasures. Badr et al. obtained a rate upper bound for streaming codes that can recover with a time delay $T$, from any erasure patterns permissible under the $\mathcal{C}(N,B,W)$ model. However, constructions matching the bound were absent, except for a few parameter sets. In this paper, we present an explicit family of codes that achieves the rate upper bound for all feasible parameters $N$, $B$, $W$ and $T$.
