An Improvement of Non-binary Code Correcting Single b-Burst of Insertions or Deletions

This paper constructs a non-binary code correcting a single $b$-burst of insertions or deletions with a large cardinality. This paper also proposes a decoding algorithm of this code and evaluates a lower bound of the cardinality of this code. Moreover, we evaluate an asymptotic upper bound on the cardinality of codes which correct a single burst of insertions or deletions.
