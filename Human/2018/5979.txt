Effect of Eye Dominance on the Perception of Stereoscopic 3D Video

Asymmetric schemes have widespread applications in the 3D video transmission pipeline. The significance of eye dominance becomes a concern when designing such schemes. In this paper, in order to investigate the effect of eye dominance on the perceptual 3D video quality, a database of representative asymmetric stereoscopic sequences is prepared and the overall 3D quality of these sequences is evaluated through subjective experiments. Experiment results showed that viewers find an asymmetric video more pleasant when the view with higher quality is projected to their dominant eye. Moreover, the eye dominance changes the mean opinion quality score by 16 % at most, a result caused by slight asymmetric video compression. For all other representative types of asymmetry, the statistical difference is much lower and in some cases even negligible.
