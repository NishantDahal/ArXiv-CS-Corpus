NOMA Assisted Wireless Caching: Strategies and Performance Analysis

Conventional wireless caching assumes that content can be pushed to local caching infrastructure during off-peak hours in an error-free manner; however, this assumption is not applicable if local caches need to be frequently updated via wireless transmission. This paper investigates a new approach to wireless caching for the case when cache content has to be updated during on-peak hours. Two non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted caching strategies are developed, namely the push-then-deliver strategy and the push-and-deliver strategy. In the push-then-deliver strategy, the NOMA principle is applied to push more content files to the content servers during a short time interval reserved for content pushing in on-peak hours and to provide more connectivity for content delivery, compared to the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) strategy. The push-and-deliver strategy is motivated by the fact that some users' requests cannot be accommodated locally and the base station has to serve them directly. These events during the content delivery phase are exploited as opportunities for content pushing, which further facilitates the frequent update of the files cached at the content servers. It is also shown that this strategy can be straightforwardly extended to device-to-device caching, and various analytical results are developed to illustrate the superiority of the proposed caching strategies compared to OMA based schemes.
