Simple Yet Efficient Content Based Video Copy Detection

Given a collection of videos, how to detect content-based copies efficiently with high accuracy? Detecting copies in large video collections still remains one of the major challenges of multimedia retrieval. While many video copy detection approaches show high computation times and insufficient quality, we propose a new efficient content-based video copy detection algorithm improving both aspects. The idea of our approach consists in utilizing self-similarity matrices as video descriptors in order to capture different visual properties. We benchmark our algorithm on the MuscleVCD ST1 benchmark dataset and show that our approach is able to achieve a score of 100\% and a score of at least 93\% in a wide range of parameters.
