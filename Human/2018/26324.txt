Understanding the Role of Data-Centric Social Context in Personalized Mobile Applications

Context-awareness in personalized mobile applications is a growing area of study. Social context is one of the most important sources of information in human-activity based applications. In this paper, we mainly focus on social relational context that represents the interpersonal relationship between individuals, and the role or influence of such context on users' diverse phone call activities in their real world life. Individuals different phone call activities such as making a phone call to a particular person or responding an incoming call may differ from person-to-person based on their interpersonal relationships such as family, friend, or colleague. However, it is very difficult to make the device understandable about such semantic relationships between individuals and the relevant context-aware applications. To address this issue, in this paper, we explore the data-centric social relational context that can play a significant role in building context-aware personalized mobile applications for various purposes in our real world life.
