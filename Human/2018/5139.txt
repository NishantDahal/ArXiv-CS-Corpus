Big Data Challenges in Genome Informatics

In recent years, we have witnessed a dramatic data explosion in genomics, thanks to the improvement in sequencing technologies and the drastically decreasing costs. We are entering the era of millions of available genomes. Notably, each genome can be composed of billions of nucleotides stored as plain text files in GigaBytes (GBs). It is undeniable that those genome data impose unprecedented data challenges for us. In this article, we briefly discuss the big data challenges associated with genomics in recent years.
