Submap-based Pose-graph Visual SLAM: A Robust Visual Exploration and Localization System

For VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), localization is a challenging task, especially for some challenging situations: textureless frames, motion blur, etc.. To build a robust exploration and localization system in a given space or environment, a submap-based VSLAM system is proposed in this paper. Our system uses a submap back-end and a visual front-end. The main advantage of our system is its robustness with respect to tracking failure, a common problem in current VSLAM algorithms. The robustness of our system is compared with the state-of-the-art in terms of average tracking percentage. The precision of our system is also evaluated in terms of ATE (absolute trajectory error) RMSE (root mean square error) comparing the state-of-the-art. The ability of our system in solving the `kidnapped' problem is demonstrated. Our system can improve the robustness of visual localization in challenging situations.
