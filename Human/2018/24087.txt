Novel Approach to Measure Motion-To-Photon and Mouth-To-Ear Latency in Distributed Virtual Reality Systems

Distributed Virtual Reality systems enable globally dispersed users to interact with each other in a shared virtual environment. In such systems, different types of latencies occur. For a good VR experience, they need to be controlled. The time delay between the user's head motion and the corresponding display output of the VR system might lead to adverse effects such as a reduced sense of presence or motion sickness. Additionally, high network latency among worldwide locations makes collaboration between users more difficult and leads to misunderstandings. To evaluate the performance and optimize dispersed VR solutions it is therefore important to measure those delays. In this work, a novel, easy to set up, and inexpensive method to measure local and remote system latency will be described. The measuring setup consists of a microcontroller, a microphone, a piezo buzzer, a photosensor, and a potentiometer. With these components, it is possible to measure motion-to-photon and mouth-to-ear latency of various VR systems. By using GPS-receivers for timecode-synchronization it is also possible to obtain the end-to-end delays between different worldwide locations. The described system was used to measure local and remote latencies of two HMD based distributed VR systems.
