Damage detection in a unidimensional truss using the firefly optimization algorithm and finite elements

In this paper, we investigate the damage detection of structures seen as an optimization problem, using modal characterization to evaluate the dynamic response of the structure given a damage model. We implemented the firefly optimization algorithm with a simple numerical damage model to assess the performance of the method and its advantages for structural health monitoring (SHM). We show some implementation details and discuss the obtained results.
