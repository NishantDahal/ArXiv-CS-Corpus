t-multiple discrete logarithm problem and solving difficulty

Considering the difficult problem under classical computing model can be solved by the quantum algorithm in polynomial time, t-multiple discrete logarithm problems presented. The problem is non-degeneracy and unique solution. We talk about what the parameter effects the problem solving difficulty. Then we pointed out that the index-calculus algorithm is not suitable for the problem, and two sufficient conditions of resistance to the quantum algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem are given.
