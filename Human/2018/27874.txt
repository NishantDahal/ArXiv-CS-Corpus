On components of a Kerdock code and the dual of the BCH code $C_{1,3}$

In the paper we investigate the structure of $i$-components of two classes of codes: Kerdock codes and the duals of the primitive cyclic BCH code with designed distance 5 of length $n=2^m-1$, for odd $m$. We prove that for any admissible length a punctured Kerdock code consists of two $i$-components and the dual of BCH code is a $i$-component for any $i$. We give an alternative proof for the fact presented by De Caen and van Dam in 1999 that the restriction of the Hamming scheme to a doubly shortened Kerdock code is an association scheme.
