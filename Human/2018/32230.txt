Comment on "All-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks"

Lin et al. (Reports, 7 September 2018, p. 1004) reported a remarkable proposal that employs a passive, strictly linear optical setup to perform pattern classifications. But interpreting the multilayer diffractive setup as a deep neural network and advocating it as an all-optical deep learning framework are not well justified and represent a mischaracterization of the system by overlooking its defining characteristics of perfect linearity and strict passivity.
