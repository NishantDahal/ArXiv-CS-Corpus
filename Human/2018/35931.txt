Codes on graphs: Models for elementary algebraic topology and statistical physics

This paper is mainly a semi-tutorial introduction to elementary algebraic topology and its applications to Ising-type models of statistical physics, using graphical models of linear and group codes. It contains new material on systematic (n,k) group codes and their information sets; normal realizations of homology and cohomology spaces; dual and hybrid models; and connections with system-theoretic concepts such as observability, controllability, and input/output realizations.
