Pareto-Optimization Framework for Automated Network-on-Chip Design

With the advent of multi-core processors, network-on-chip design has been key in addressing network performances, such as bandwidth, power consumption, and communication delays when dealing with on-chip communication between the increasing number of processor cores. As the numbers of cores increase, network design becomes more complex. Therefore, there is a critical need in soliciting computer aid in determining network configurations that afford optimal performance given resources and design constraints. We propose a Pareto-optimization framework that explores the space of possible network configurations to determine optimal network latencies, power consumption, and the corresponding link allocations. For a given number of routers, average network latency and power consumption as example performance objectives can be displayed in form of Pareto-optimal fronts, thus not only offering a design tool, but also enabling trade-off studies.
