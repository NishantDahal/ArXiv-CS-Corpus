AID++: An Updated Version of AID on Scene Classification

Aerial image scene classification is a fundamental problem for understanding high-resolution remote sensing images and has become an active research task in the field of remote sensing due to its important role in a wide range of applications. However, the limitations of existing datasets for scene classification, such as the small scale and low-diversity, severely hamper the potential usage of the new generation deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although huge efforts have been made in building large-scale datasets very recently, e.g., the Aerial Image Dataset (AID) which contains 10,000 image samples, they are still far from sufficient to fully train a high-capacity deep CNN model. To this end, we present a larger-scale dataset in this paper, named as AID++, for aerial scene classification based on the AID dataset. The proposed AID++ consists of more than 400,000 image samples that are semi-automatically annotated by using the existing the geographical data. We evaluate several prevalent CNN models on the proposed dataset, and the results show that our dataset can be used as a promising benchmark for scene classification.
