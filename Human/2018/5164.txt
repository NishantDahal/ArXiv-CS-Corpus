A Low-Resolution ADC Module Assisted Hybrid Beamforming Architecture for mmWave Communications

We propose a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module assisted hybrid beamforming architecture for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. We prove that the proposed low-cost and flexible architecture can reduce the beam training time and complexity dramatically without degradation in the data transmission performance. In addition, we design a fast beam training method which is suitable for the proposed system architecture. The proposed beam training method requires only L + 1 (where L is the number of paths) time slots which is smaller compared to the state-of-the-art.
