The CAPIO 2017 Conversational Speech Recognition System

In this paper we show how we have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the industry-standard NIST 2000 Hub5 English evaluation set. We explore densely connected LSTMs, inspired by the densely connected convolutional networks recently introduced for image classification tasks. We also propose an acoustic model adaptation scheme that simply averages the parameters of a seed neural network acoustic model and its adapted version. This method was applied with the CallHome training corpus and improved individual system performances by on average 6.1% (relative) against the CallHome portion of the evaluation set with no performance loss on the Switchboard portion. With RNN-LM rescoring and lattice combination on the 5 systems trained across three different phone sets, our 2017 speech recognition system has obtained 5.0% and 9.1% on Switchboard and CallHome, respectively, both of which are the best word error rates reported thus far. According to IBM in their latest work to compare human and machine transcriptions, our reported Switchboard word error rate can be considered to surpass the human parity (5.1%) of transcribing conversational telephone speech.
