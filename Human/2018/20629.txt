Attentive Sequence to Sequence Translation for Localizing Clips of Interest by Natural Language Descriptions

We propose a novel attentive sequence to sequence translator (ASST) for clip localization in videos by natural language descriptions. We make two contributions. First, we propose a bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a finely calibrated vision-language attentive mechanism to comprehensively understand the free-formed natural language descriptions. The RNN parses natural language descriptions in two directions, and the attentive model attends every meaningful word or phrase to each frame, thereby resulting in a more detailed understanding of video content and description semantics. Second, we design a hierarchical architecture for the network to jointly model language descriptions and video content. Given a video-description pair, the network generates a matrix representation, i.e., a sequence of vectors. Each vector in the matrix represents a video frame conditioned by the description. The 2D representation not only preserves the temporal dependencies of frames but also provides an effective way to perform frame-level video-language matching. The hierarchical architecture exploits video content with multiple granularities, ranging from subtle details to global context. Integration of the multiple granularities yields a robust representation for multi-level video-language abstraction. We validate the effectiveness of our ASST on two large-scale datasets. Our ASST outperforms the state-of-the-art by $4.28\%$ in Rank$@1$ on the DiDeMo dataset. On the Charades-STA dataset, we significantly improve the state-of-the-art by $13.41\%$ in Rank$@1,IoU=0.5$.
