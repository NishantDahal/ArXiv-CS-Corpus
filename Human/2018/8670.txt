A Bound on the Shannon Capacity via a Linear Programming Variation

We prove an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of a graph via a linear programming variation. We show that our bound can outperform both the Lov√°sz theta number and the Haemers minimum rank bound. As a by-product, we also obtain a new upper bound on the broadcast rate of Index Coding.
