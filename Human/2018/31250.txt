Multi-label Object Attribute Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network

Objects of different classes can be described using a limited number of attributes such as color, shape, pattern, and texture. Learning to detect object attributes instead of only detecting objects can be helpful in dealing with a priori unknown objects. With this inspiration, a deep convolutional neural network for low-level object attribute classification, called the Deep Attribute Network (DAN), is proposed. Since object features are implicitly learned by object recognition networks, one such existing network is modified and fine-tuned for developing DAN. The performance of DAN is evaluated on the ImageNet Attribute and a-Pascal datasets. Experiments show that in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model achieves better results.
