Robust Distributed Compression of Symmetrically Correlated Gaussian Sources

Consider a lossy compression system with $\ell$ distributed encoders and a centralized decoder. Each encoder compresses its observed source and forwards the compressed data to the decoder for joint reconstruction of the target signals under the mean squared error distortion constraint. It is assumed that the observed sources can be expressed as the sum of the target signals and the corruptive noises, which are generated independently from two symmetric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Depending on the parameters of such distributions, the rate-distortion limit of this system is characterized either completely or at least for sufficiently low distortions. The results are further extended to the robust distributed compression setting, where the outputs of a subset of encoders may also be used to produce a non-trivial reconstruction of the corresponding target signals. In particular, we obtain in the high-resolution regime a precise characterization of the minimum achievable reconstruction distortion based on the outputs of $k+1$ or more encoders when every $k$ out of all $\ell$ encoders are operated collectively in the same mode that is greedy in the sense of minimizing the distortion incurred by the reconstruction of the corresponding $k$ target signals with respect to the average rate of these $k$ encoders.
