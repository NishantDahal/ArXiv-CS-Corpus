Canonical projection tilings defined by patterns

We give a necessary and sufficient condition on a $d$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ to be characterized by a finite set of patterns which are forbidden to appear in its digitization. This can also be stated in terms of local rules for canonical projection tilings, or subshift of finite type. This provides a link between algebraic properties of affine subspaces and combinatorics of their digitizations. The condition relies on the notion of {\em coincidence} and can be effectively checked. As a corollary, we get that only algebraic subspaces can be characterized by patterns.
