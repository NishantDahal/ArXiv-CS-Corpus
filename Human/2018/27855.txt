Analysis Of Congestion Control In Data Channels With Frequent Frame Loss

Development of optimal control procedures for congested networks is a key factor in maintaining efficient network utilization. The absence of congestion control mechanism or its failure can lead to the lack of availability for certain network segments, and in severe cases -- for the entire network. The paper presents an analytical model describing the operation of the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm in terms of differential calculus and queuing systems. The purpose of this research is to explore the possibilities and ways of increasing the virtual channel capacity utilization efficiency in a lossy environment.
