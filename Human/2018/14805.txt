Optimal Resource Allocation in Full-Duplex Ambient Backscatter Communication Networks for Wireless-Powered IoT

This paper considers an ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) network in which a full-duplex access point (FAP) simultaneously transmits downlink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals to its legacy user (LU) and receives uplink signals backscattered from multiple BDs in a time-division-multiple-access manner. To maximize the system throughput and ensure fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the backscatter time and reflection coefficients of the BDs, and the FAP's subcarrier power allocation, subject to the LU's throughput constraint, the BDs' harvested-energy constraints, and other practical constraints. For the case with a single BD, we obtain closed-form solutions and propose an efficient algorithm by using the Lagrange duality method. For the general case with multiple BDs, we propose an iterative algorithm by leveraging the block coordinated decent and successive convex optimization techniques. We further show the convergence performances of the proposed algorithms and analyze their complexities. In addition, we study the throughput region which characterizes the Pareto-optimal throughput trade-offs among all BDs. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed joint design achieves significant throughput gain as compared to the benchmark schemes.
