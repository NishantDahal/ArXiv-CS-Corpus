Auto-Generation of Pipelined Hardware Designs for Polar Encoder

This paper presents a general framework for auto-generation of pipelined polar encoder architectures. The proposed framework could be well represented by a general formula. Given arbitrary code length $N$ and the level of parallelism $M$, the formula could specify the corresponding hardware architecture. We have written a compiler which could read the formula and then automatically generate its register-transfer level (RTL) description suitable for FPGA or ASIC implementation. With this hardware generation system, one could explore the design space and make a trade-off between cost and performance. Our experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency of this auto-generator for polar encoder architectures.
