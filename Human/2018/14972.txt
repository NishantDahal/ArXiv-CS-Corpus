Inducing information stability and applications thereof to obtaining information theoretic necessary conditions directly from operational requirements

This work constructs a discrete random variable that, when conditioned upon, ensures information stability of quasi-images. Using this construction, a new methodology is derived to obtain information theoretic necessary conditions directly from operational requirements. In particular, this methodology is used to derive new necessary conditions for keyed authentication over discrete memoryless channels and to establish the capacity region of the wiretap channel, subject to finite leakage and finite error, under two different secrecy metrics. These examples establish the usefulness of the proposed methodology.
