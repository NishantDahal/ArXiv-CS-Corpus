Lightweight Joint Compression-Encryption-Authentication-Integrity Framework Based on Arithmetic Coding

Arithmetic Coding is an efficient lossless compression scheme applied for many multimedia standards such as JPEG, JPEG2000, H.263, H.264 and H.265. Due to nonlinearity, high error propagation and high error sensitivity of arithmetic coders, many techniques have been developed for extending the usage of arithmetic coders for security as a lightweight joint compression and encryption solution for systems with limited resources. Through this paper, we will describe how to upgrade these techniques to achieve an additional low cost authentication and integrity capabilities with arithmetic coders. Consequently, the new proposed technique can produce a secure and lightweight framework of compression, encryption, authentication and integrity for limited resources environments such as Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems. Although the proposed technique can be used alongside with any arithmetic coder based system, we will focus on the implementations for JPEG and JPEG2000 standards.
