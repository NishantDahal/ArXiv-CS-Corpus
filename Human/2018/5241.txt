Spectrum Sensing with Multiple Primary Users over Fading Channels

We investigate the impact of multiple primary users (PUs) and fading on the spectrum sensing of a classical energy detector (ED). Specifically, we present novel closed-form expressions for the false-alarm and detection probabilities in a multiple PUs environment, assuming Nakagami-m fading and complex Gaussian PUs transmitted signals. The results reveal the importance of taking into consideration the wireless environment, when evaluating the ED spectrum sensing performance and selecting the ED threshold.
