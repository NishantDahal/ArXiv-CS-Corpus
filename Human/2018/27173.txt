The Ocean Tensor Package

Matrix and tensor operations form the basis of a wide range of fields and applications, and in many cases constitute a substantial part of the overall computational complexity. The ability of general-purpose GPUs to speed up many of these operations and enable others has resulted in a widespread adaptation of these devices. In order for tensor operations to take full advantage of the computational power, specialized software is required, and currently there exist several packages (predominantly in the area of deep learning) that incorporate tensor operations on both CPU and GPU. Nevertheless, a stand-alone framework that supports general tensor operations is still missing. In this paper we fill this gap and propose the Ocean Tensor Library: a modular tensor-support package that is designed to serve as a foundational layer for applications that require dense tensor operations on a variety of device types. The API is carefully designed to be powerful, extensible, and at the same time easy to use. The package is available as open source.
