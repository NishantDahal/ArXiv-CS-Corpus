A Real-Valued Modal Logic

A many-valued modal logic is introduced that combines the usual Kripke frame semantics of the modal logic K with connectives interpreted locally at worlds by lattice and group operations over the real numbers. A labelled tableau system is provided and a coNEXPTIME upper bound obtained for checking validity in the logic. Focussing on the modal-multiplicative fragment, the labelled tableau system is then used to establish completeness for a sequent calculus that admits cut-elimination and an axiom system that extends the multiplicative fragment of Abelian logic.
