Service Quality Improvement of Mobile Users in Vehicular Environment by Mobile Femtocell Network Deployment

The femto-access-point (FAP), a low power small cellular base station provides better signal quality for the indoor users. The mobile users in the vehicular environment suffer for the low quality signal from the outside wireless networks. The deployment of femtocells in the vehicular environment can solve the low level signal-to-noise plus interference problem. In this paper, we propose new application of the femtocell technology. The femtocells are deployed in the vehicular environment. Short distance between the user and the FAP provides better signal quality. The inside FAPs are connected to the core network through the outside macrocellular networks or the satellite networks. One stronger transceiver is installed at outside the vehicle. This transceiver is connected to FAPs using wired connection and to macrocellular or the satellite access networks through wireless link. The capacity and the outage probability are analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed mobile femtocell deployment significantly enhances the service quality of mobile users in the vehicular environment.
