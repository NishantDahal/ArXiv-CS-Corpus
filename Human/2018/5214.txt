An Introduction to Imperfect Competition via Bilateral Oligopoly

The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we provide a unified framework, by means of non-trivial examples, to compare the results obtained in simultaneous-move and sequential-move versions of bilateral oligopoly with the Cournot model and the Cournot-Walras approach. We also survey the main contributions on imperfect competition and strategic market games that are linked with our analysis. Secondly, we show how the bilateral oligopoly model can be used to study different kinds of oligopoly: symmetric oligopoly, where all agents act strategically; asymmetric oligopoly where only some agents act strategically; simultaneous oligopoly, where sellers and buyers make their choices without knowledge of others' decisions; and sequential oligopoly, where some agents move first. Thirdly, we focus on how the bilateral oligopoly model can clarify how either strategic or competitive behaviours may emerge endogenously depending on the fundamentals of the economy.
