Hybrid Analog-Digital Precoding for Interference Exploitation

We study the multi-user massive multiple-input-single-output (MISO) and focus on the downlink systems where the base station (BS) employs hybrid analog-digital precoding with low-cost 1-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In this paper, we propose a hybrid downlink transmission scheme where the analog precoder is formed based on the SVD decomposition. In the digital domain, instead of designing a linear transmit precoding matrix, we directly design the transmit signals by exploiting the concept of constructive interference. The optimization problem is then formulated based on the geometry of the modulation constellations and is shown to be non-convex. We relax the above optimization and show that the relaxed optimization can be transformed into a linear programming that can be efficiently solved. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme for the hybrid massive MIMO downlink systems.
