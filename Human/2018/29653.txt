Gregory Solid Construction for Polyhedral Volume Parameterization by Sparse Optimization

In isogeometric analysis, it is frequently required to handle the geometric models enclosed by four-sided or non-four-sided boundary patches, such as trimmed surfaces. In this paper, we develop a Gregory solid based method to parameterize those models. First, we extend the Gregory patch representation to the trivariate Gregory solid representation. Second, the trivariate Gregory solid representation is employed to interpolate the boundary patches of a geometric model, thus generating the polyhedral volume parametrization. To improve the regularity of the polyhedral volume parametrization, we formulate the construction of the trivariate Gregory solid as a sparse optimization problem, where the optimization objective function is a linear combination of some terms, including a sparse term aiming to reduce the negative Jacobian area of the Gregory solid. Then, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve the sparse optimization problem. Lots of experimental examples illustrated in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed method.
