Taxonomy of Blockchain Technologies. Principles of Identification and Classification

A comparative study across the most widely known blockchain technologies is conducted with a bottom-up approach. Blockchains are disentangled into building blocks. Each building block is then hierarchically classified in main and subcomponents. Then, alternative layouts for the subcomponents are identified and compared between them. Finally, a taxonomy tree summarises the study and provides a navigation tool across different blockchain architectural configurations.
