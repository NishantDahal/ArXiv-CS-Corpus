On Decoding Schemes for the MDPC-McEliece Cryptosystem

Recently, it has been shown how McEliece public-key cryptosystems based on moderate-density parity-check (MDPC) codes allow for very compact keys compared to variants based on other code families. In this paper, classical (iterative) decoding schemes for MPDC codes are considered. The algorithms are analyzed with respect to their error-correction capability as well as their resilience against a recently proposed reaction-based key-recovery attack on a variant of the MDPC-McEliece cryptosystem by Guo, Johansson and Stankovski (GJS). New message-passing decoding algorithms are presented and analyzed. Two proposed decoding algorithms have an improved error-correction performance compared to existing hard-decision decoding schemes and are resilient against the GJS reaction-based attack for an appropriate choice of the algorithm's parameters. Finally, a modified belief propagation decoding algorithm that is resilient against the GJS reaction-based attack is presented.
