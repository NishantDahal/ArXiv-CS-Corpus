Towards Experimental P-systems using multivesicular liposomes

P-systems are abstract computational models inspired by the phospholipid bilayer membranes generated by biological cells. Illustrated here is a mechanism by which recursive liposome structures (multivesicular liposomes) may be experimentally produced through electroformation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) films for use in `real' P-systems. We first present the electroformation protocol and microscopic characterisation of incident liposomes towards estimating the size of computing elements, level of internal compartment recursion, fault tolerance and stability. Following, we demonstrate multiple routes towards embedding symbols, namely modification of swelling solutions, passive diffusion and microinjection. Finally, we discuss how computing devices based on P-systems can be produced and their current limitations.
