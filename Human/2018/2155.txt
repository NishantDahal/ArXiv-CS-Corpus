QRKE: Quantum-Resistant Public Key Exchange

A Post-Quantum Key Exchange is needed since the availability of quantum computers that allegedly allow breaking classical algorithms like Diffie-Hellman, El Gamal, RSA and others within a practical amount of time is broadly assumed in literature. Although our survey suggests that practical quantum computers appear to be by far less advanced as actually required to break state-of-the-art key negotiation algorithms, it is of high scientific interest to develop fundamentally immune key negotiation methods. A novel polymorphic algorithm based on permutable functions and defined over the field of real numbers is proposed. The proposed key exchange can operate with at least four different strategies. The cryptosystem itself is highly variable and, due to the fact that rounding operations are inevitable and mandatory on a traditional computer system, decoherence of the quantum computer system would lead to a premature end of the computation on quantum systems.
