Deep Learning in Information Security

Machine learning has a long tradition of helping to solve complex information security problems that are difficult to solve manually. Machine learning techniques learn models from data representations to solve a task. These data representations are hand-crafted by domain experts. Deep Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which uses models that are composed of multiple layers. Consequently, representations that are used to solve a task are learned from the data instead of being manually designed.
  In this survey, we study the use of DL techniques within the domain of information security. We systematically reviewed 77 papers and presented them from a data-centric perspective. This data-centric perspective reflects one of the most crucial advantages of DL techniques -- domain independence. If DL-methods succeed to solve problems on a data type in one domain, they most likely will also succeed on similar data from another domain. Other advantages of DL methods are unrivaled scalability and efficiency, both regarding the number of examples that can be analyzed as well as with respect of dimensionality of the input data. DL methods generally are capable of achieving high-performance and generalize well.
  However, information security is a domain with unique requirements and challenges. Based on an analysis of our reviewed papers, we point out shortcomings of DL-methods to those requirements and discuss further research opportunities.
