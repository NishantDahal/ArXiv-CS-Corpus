Towards Automatic & Personalised Mobile Health Interventions: An Interactive Machine Learning Perspective

Machine learning (ML) is the fastest growing field in computer science and healthcare, providing future benefits in improved medical diagnoses, disease analyses and prevention. In this paper, we introduce an application of interactive machine learning (iML) in a telemedicine system, to enable automatic and personalised interventions for lifestyle promotion. We first present the high level architecture of the system and the components forming the overall architecture. We then illustrate the interactive machine learning process design. Prediction models are expected to be trained through the participants' profiles, activity performance, and feedback from the caregiver. Finally, we show some preliminary results during the system implementation and discuss future directions. We envisage the proposed system to be digitally implemented, and behaviourally designed to promote healthy lifestyle and activities, and hence prevent users from the risk of chronic diseases.
