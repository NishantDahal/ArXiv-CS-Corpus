Evolving system bottlenecks in the as a service cloud

The web ecosystem is rapidly evolving with changing business and functional models. Cloud platforms are available in a SaaS, PaaS and IaaS model designed around commoditized Linux based servers. 10 billion users will be online and accessing the web and its various content. The industry has seen a convergence around IP based technology. Additionally, Linux based designs allow for a system wide profiling of application characteristics. The customer is an OEM who provides Linux based servers for telecom solutions. The end customer will develop business applications on the server. Customers are interested in a latency profiling mechanism which helps them to understand how the application behaves at run time. The latency profiler is supposed to find the code path which makes an application block on I/O, and other synchronization primitives. This will allow the customer to understand the performance bottleneck and tune the system and application parameters.
