Joint Doppler and Channel Estimation with Nested Arrays for Millimeter Wave Communications

Channel estimation is essential for precoding/combining in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. However, accurate estimation is usually difficult because the receiver can only observe the low-dimensional projection of the received signals due to the hybrid architecture. We take the high speed scenario into consideration where the Doppler effect caused by fast-moving users can seriously deteriorate the channel estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the nested array into analog array architecture by using RF switch networks with an objective of reducing the complexity and power consumption of the system. Based on the covariance fitting criterion, a joint Doppler and channel estimation method is proposed without need of discretizing the angle space, and thus the model mismatch effect can be totally eliminated. We also present an algorithmic implementation by solving the dual problem of the original one in order to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.
