Delay Minimization for NOMA-MEC Offloading

This paper considers the minimization of the offloading delay for non-orthogonal multiple access assisted mobile edge computing (NOMA-MEC). By transforming the delay minimization problem into a form of fractional programming, two iterative algorithms based on Dinkelbach's method and Newton's method are proposed. The optimality of both methods is proved and their convergence is compared. Furthermore, criteria for choosing between three possible modes, namely orthogonal multiple access (OMA), pure NOMA, and hybrid NOMA, for MEC offloading are established.
