Privacy-Utility Management of Hypothesis Tests

The trade-off of hypothesis tests on the correlated privacy hypothesis and utility hypothesis is studied. The error exponent of the Bayesian composite hypothesis test on the privacy or utility hypothesis can be characterized by the corresponding minimal Chernoff information rate. An optimal management protects the privacy by minimizing the error exponent of the privacy hypothesis test and meanwhile guarantees the utility hypothesis testing performance by satisfying a lower bound on the corresponding minimal Chernoff information rate. The asymptotic minimum error exponent of the privacy hypothesis test is shown to be characterized by the infimum of corresponding minimal Chernoff information rates subject to the utility guarantees.
