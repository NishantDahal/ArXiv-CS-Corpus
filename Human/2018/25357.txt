On Adjacency and e-Adjacency in General Hypergraphs: Towards a New e-Adjacency Tensor

In graphs, the concept of adjacency is clearly defined: it is a pairwise relationship between vertices. Adjacency in hypergraphs has to integrate hyperedge multi-adicity: the concept of adjacency needs to be defined properly by introducing two new concepts: $k$-adjacency - $k$ vertices are in the same hyperedge - and e-adjacency - vertices of a given hyperedge are e-adjacent. In order to build a new e-adjacency tensor that is interpretable in terms of hypergraph uniformisation, we designed two processes: the first is a hypergraph uniformisation process (HUP) and the second is a polynomial homogeneisation process (PHP). The PHP allows the construction of the e-adjacency tensor while the HUP ensures that the PHP keeps interpretability. This tensor is symmetric and can be fully described by the number of hyperedges; its order is the range of the hypergraph, while extra dimensions allow to capture additional hypergraph structural information including the maximum level of $k$-adjacency of each hyperedge. Some results on spectral analysis are discussed.
