Applications of Data Mining Techniques for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks

Due to the recent advances in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), smart applications have been incorporating the data generated from these networks to provide quality of life services. In this paper, we have proposed taxonomy of data mining techniques that have been applied in this domain in addition to a classification of these techniques. Our contribution is to highlight the research methodologies in the literature and allow for comparing among them using different characteristics. The proposed taxonomy covers elementary data mining techniques such as: preprocessing, outlier detection, clustering, and classification of data. In addition, it covers centralized, distributed, offline, and online techniques from the literature.
