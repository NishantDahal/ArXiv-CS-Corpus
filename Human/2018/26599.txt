Broadcasting Information subject to State Masking

We study the problem of coding over a general discrete memoryless broadcast channel controlled by random parameters. The parameters are available at the transmitter in a non-causal manner and are subject to a state masking constraint on the receivers. We derive inner and outer bounds on the achievable region and show that for the special case of Gaussian broadcast channel with private messages, these bounds are tight.
