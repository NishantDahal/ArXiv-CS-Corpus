A Code Equivalence between Secure Network and Index Coding

A code equivalence between index coding and network coding was established, which shows that any index-coding instance can be mapped to a network-coding instance, for which any index code can be translated to a network code with the same decoding-error performance, and vice versa. Also, any network-coding instance can be mapped to an index-coding instance with a similar code translation. In this paper, we extend the equivalence to secure index coding and secure network coding, where eavesdroppers are present in the networks, and any code construction needs to guarantee security constraints in addition to decoding-error performance.
