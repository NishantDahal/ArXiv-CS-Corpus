Coordination and Control of Distributed Discrete Event Systems under Actuator and Sensor Faults

We investigate the coordination and control problems of distributed discrete event systems that are composed of multiple subsystems subject to potential actuator and/or sensor faults. We model actuator faults as local controllability loss of certain actuator events and sensor faults as observability failure of certain sensor readings, respectively. Starting from automata-theoretic models that characterize behaviors of the subsystems in the presence of faulty actuators and/or sensors, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of actuator and sensor fault tolerant supervisors, respectively, and synthesize appropriate local post-fault supervisors to prevent the post-fault subsystems from jeopardizing local safety requirements. Furthermore, we apply an assume-guarantee coordination scheme to the controlled subsystems for both the nominal and faulty subsystems so as to achieve the desired specifications of the system. A multi-robot coordination example is used to illustrate the proposed coordination and control architecture.
