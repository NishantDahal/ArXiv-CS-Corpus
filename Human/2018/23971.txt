Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with Ensemble Methods

We propose to use boosted regression trees as a way to compute human-interpretable solutions to reinforcement learning problems. Boosting combines several regression trees to improve their accuracy without significantly reducing their inherent interpretability. Prior work has focused independently on reinforcement learning and on interpretable machine learning, but there has been little progress in interpretable reinforcement learning. Our experimental results show that boosted regression trees compute solutions that are both interpretable and match the quality of leading reinforcement learning methods.
