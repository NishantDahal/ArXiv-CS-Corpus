TIB-arXiv: An Alternative Search Portal for the arXiv Pre-print Server

arXiv is a popular pre-print server focusing on natural science disciplines (e.g. physics, computer science, quantitative biology). As a platform with focus on easy publishing services it does not provide enhanced search functionality -- but offers programming interfaces which allow external parties to add these services. This paper presents extensions of the open source framework arXiv Sanity Preserver (SP). With respect to the original framework, it derestricts the topical focus and allows for text-based search and visualisation of all papers in arXiv. To this end, all papers are stored in a unified back-end; the extension provides enhanced search and ranking facilities and allows the exploration of arXiv papers by a novel user interface.
