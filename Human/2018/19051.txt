Who did What at Where and When: Simultaneous Multi-Person Tracking and Activity Recognition

We present a bootstrapping framework to simultaneously improve multi-person tracking and activity recognition at individual, interaction and social group activity levels. The inference consists of identifying trajectories of all pedestrian actors, individual activities, pairwise interactions, and collective activities, given the observed pedestrian detections. Our method uses a graphical model to represent and solve the joint tracking and recognition problems via multi-stages: (1) activity-aware tracking, (2) joint interaction recognition and occlusion recovery, and (3) collective activity recognition. We solve the where and when problem with visual tracking, as well as the who and what problem with recognition. High-order correlations among the visible and occluded individuals, pairwise interactions, groups, and activities are then solved using a hypergraph formulation within the Bayesian framework. Experiments on several benchmarks show the advantages of our approach over state-of-art methods.
