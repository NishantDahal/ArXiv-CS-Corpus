Robot Path Planning Algorithms: A Review of Theory and Experiment

The aim of this book is to introduce different robot path planning algorithms and suggest some of the most appropriate ones which are capable of running on a variety of robots and are resistant to disturbances. Being real-time, being autonomous, and the ability to identify high-risk areas and risk management are the other features that will be mentioned throughout these methods.
