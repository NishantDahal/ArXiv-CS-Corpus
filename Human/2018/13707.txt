A Novel Method of Discrete-Time Amplification using NEMS Devices

In this paper we propose a novel method of realizing discrete-time (D-T) signal amplification using Nano-Electro-Mechanical (NEMS) devices. The amplifier uses mechanical devices instead of traditional solid-state circuits. The proposed NEMS-based D-T amplifier provides high gain and operate on a wide dynamic range of signals, consuming only a few micro watts of power. The proposed concept is subsequently verified using Verilog-A model of the NEMS device. Modifications in the proposed amplifier to suit different specifications are also presented.
