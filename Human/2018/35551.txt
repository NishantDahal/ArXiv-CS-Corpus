Private Coded Computation for Machine Learning

In a distributed computing system for the master-worker framework, an erasure code can mitigate the effects of slow workers, also called stragglers. The distributed computing system combined with coding is referred to as coded computation. We introduce a variation of coded computation that protects the master's privacy from the workers, which is referred to as private coded computation. In private coded computation, the master needs to compute a function of its own dataset and one of the datasets in a library exclusively shared by the external workers. After the master recovers the result of the desired function through coded computation, the workers should not know which dataset in the library was desired by the master, which implies that the master's privacy is protected. We propose a private coded computation scheme for matrix multiplication, namely private polynomial codes, based on polynomial codes for conventional coded computation. As special cases of private polynomial codes, we propose private one-shot polynomial codes and private asynchronous polynomial codes. Whereas the private one-shot polynomial code achieves a lower communication load from the master to each worker, the private asynchronous polynomial code achieves faster computation than private one-shot polynomial codes. In terms of computation time and communication load, we compare private one-shot polynomial codes and private asynchronous polynomial codes with a conventional robust private information retrieval scheme which can be directly applied to coded computation.
