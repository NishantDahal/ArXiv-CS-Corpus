Preserving Patient-centred Controls in Electronic Health Record Systems: A Reliance-based Model Implication

As a consequence of the huge advancement of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in healthcare settings, the My Health Record (MHR) is introduced in Australia. However security and privacy of the MHR system have been encumbering the development of the system. Even though the MHR system is claimed as patient-cenred and patient-controlled, there are several instances where healthcare providers (other than the usual provider) and system operators who maintain the system can easily access the system and these unauthorised accesses can lead to a breach of the privacy of the patients. This is one of the main concerns of the consumers that affect the uptake of the system. In this paper, we propose a patient centred MHR framework which requests authorisation from the patient to access their sensitive health information. The proposed model increases the involvement and satisfaction of the patients in their healthcare and also suggests mobile security system to give an online permission to access the MHR system.
