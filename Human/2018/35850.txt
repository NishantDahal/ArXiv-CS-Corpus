Generalized Degrees of Freedom of the Symmetric Cache-Aided MISO Broadcast Channel with Partial CSIT

We consider the cache-aided MISO broadcast channel (BC) in which a multi-antenna transmitter serves $K$ single-antenna receivers, each equipped with a cache memory. The transmitter has access to partial knowledge of the channel state information. For a symmetric setting, in terms of channel strength levels, partial channel knowledge levels and cache sizes, we characterize the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) up to a constant multiplicative factor. The achievability scheme exploits the interplay between spatial multiplexing gains and coded-multicasting gain. On the other hand, a cut-set-based argument in conjunction with a GDoF outer bound for a parallel MISO BC under channel uncertainty are used for the converse. We further show that the characterized order-optimal GDoF is also attained in a decentralized setting, where no coordination is required for content placement in the caches.
