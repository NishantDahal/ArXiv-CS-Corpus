A study on users' privacy perception with smart devices

Nowadays, privacy has become a very serious issue with smart and mobile platforms. Users tend to allow intrusive apps access much sensible information without really knowing the potential threats. To solve this issue several solutions (e.g. GDPR) have been provided. Our claim is that the users currently are not sufficiently involved in this process for being able to use such solutions. To do this we developed an application that provides a form of awareness to the users and we asked them to reply a set of questions. Our conclusions are that users must be better informed of the risks and value of their personal information.
