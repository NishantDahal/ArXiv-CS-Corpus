Sparse Approximation by Semidefinite Programming

The problem of sparse approximation and the closely related compressed sensing have received tremendous attention in the past decade. Primarily studied from the viewpoint of applied harmonic analysis and signal processing, there have been two dominant algorithmic approaches to this problem: Greedy methods called the matching pursuit (MP) and the linear programming based approaches called the basis pursuit (BP). The aim of the current paper is to bring a fresh perspective to sparse approximation by treating it as a combinatorial optimization problem and providing an algorithm based on the powerful optimization technique semidefinite programming (SDP). In particular, we show that there is a randomized algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation of the problem with performance guarantees depending on the coherence and the restricted isometry constant of the dictionary used. We then show a derandomization of the algorithm based on the method of conditional probabilities.
