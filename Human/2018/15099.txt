Model-Based Safety-Cases for Software-Intensive Systems

Safety cases become increasingly important for software certification. Models play a crucial role in building and combining information for the safety case. This position paper sketches an ideal model-based safety case with defect hypotheses and failure characterisations. From this, open research issues are derived.
