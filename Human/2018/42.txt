A cost effective and reliable environment monitoring system for HPC applications

We present a slow control system to gather all relevant environment information necessary to effectively and reliably run an HPC (High Performance Computing) system at a high value over price ratio. The scalable and reliable overall concept is presented as well as a newly developed hardware device for sensor read out. This device incorporates a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino and PoE (Power over Ethernet) functionality in a compact form factor. The system is in use at the 2 PFLOPS cluster of the Johannes Gutenberg-University and Helmholtz-Institute in Mainz.
