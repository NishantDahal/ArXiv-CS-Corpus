Do neutrons publish? A neutron publication survey 2005-2015

Publication in scientific journals is the main product of scientific research. The amount of papers published, their placement in high impact journals, and their citations are used as a measure of the productivity of individual scientists, institutes or fields of science. To give a profound basis on the publication record and the quality of the publication efforts in neutron scattering, a survey has been done following the approach to use bibliographic databases. Questions to be addressed by this survey are: Is the productivity of research with neutrons changing over the years? Which is the geographic distribution in this field of research? Which ones are leading facilities? Is the quality of publications changing? The main results found are presented.
