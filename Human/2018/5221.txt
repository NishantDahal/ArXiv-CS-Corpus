Handling Adversarial Concept Drift in Streaming Data

Classifiers operating in a dynamic, real world environment, are vulnerable to adversarial activity, which causes the data distribution to change over time. These changes are traditionally referred to as concept drift, and several approaches have been developed in literature to deal with the problem of drift handling and detection. However, most concept drift handling techniques, approach it as a domain independent task, to make them applicable to a wide gamut of reactive systems. These techniques were developed from an adversarial agnostic perspective, where they are naive and assume that drift is a benign change, which can be fixed by updating the model. However, this is not the case when an active adversary is trying to evade the deployed classification system. In such an environment, the properties of concept drift are unique, as the drift is intended to degrade the system and at the same time designed to avoid detection by traditional concept drift detection techniques. This special category of drift is termed as adversarial drift, and this paper analyzes its characteristics and impact, in a streaming environment. A novel framework for dealing with adversarial concept drift is proposed, called the Predict-Detect streaming framework. Experimental evaluation of the framework, on generated adversarial drifting data streams, demonstrates that this framework is able to provide reliable unsupervised indication of drift, and is able to recover from drifts swiftly. While traditional partially labeled concept drift detection methodologies fail to detect adversarial drifts, the proposed framework is able to detect such drifts and operates with <6% labeled data, on average. Also, the framework provides benefits for active learning over imbalanced data streams, by innately providing for feature space honeypots, where minority class adversarial samples may be captured.
