A Tamper-Free Semi-Universal Communication System for Deletion Channels

We investigate the problem of reliable communication between two legitimate parties over deletion channels under an active eavesdropping (aka jamming) adversarial model. To this goal, we develop a theoretical framework based on probabilistic finite-state automata to define novel encoding and decoding schemes that ensure small error probability in both message decoding as well as tamper detecting. We then experimentally verify the reliability and tamper-detection property of our scheme.
