A Generative Model of Textures Using Hierarchical Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis

Modeling of textures in natural images is an important task to make a microscopic model of natural images. Portilla and Simoncelli proposed a generative texture model, which is based on the mechanism of visual systems in brains, with a set of texture features and a feature matching. On the other hand, the texture features, used in Portillas' model, have redundancy between its components came from typical natural textures. In this paper, we propose a contracted texture model which provides a dimension reduction for the Portillas' feature. This model is based on a hierarchical principal components analysis using known group structure of the feature. In the experiment, we reveal effective dimensions to describe texture is fewer than the original description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how well the textures can be synthesized from the contracted texture representations.
