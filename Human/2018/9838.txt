Energy-Efficient CMOS Memristive Synapses for Mixed-Signal Neuromorphic System-on-a-Chip

Emerging non-volatile memory (NVM), or memristive, devices promise energy-efficient realization of deep learning, when efficiently integrated with mixed-signal integrated circuits on a CMOS substrate. Even though several algorithmic challenges need to be addressed to turn the vision of memristive Neuromorphic Systems-on-a-Chip (NeuSoCs) into reality, issues at the device and circuit interface need immediate attention from the community. In this work, we perform energy-estimation of a NeuSoC system and predict the desirable circuit and device parameters for energy-efficiency optimization. Also, CMOS synapse circuits based on the concept of CMOS memristor emulator are presented as a system prototyping methodology, while practical memristor devices are being developed and integrated with general-purpose CMOS. The proposed mixed-signal memristive synapse can be designed and fabricated using standard CMOS technologies and open doors to interesting applications in cognitive computing circuits.
