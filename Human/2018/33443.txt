Extraire et r{é}utiliser des patrons de conception {à} partir de Learning Games existants

Learning Games (LGs) are promising pedagogical tools but their design still remains experimental. Inspired by design-pattern based methods, recommended in educational domains, we propose a methodology and a model to analyze the scenario of LGs, which have proven to be effective, in order to extract design patterns. The proposed methodology and model allowed us to extract nine design patterns from the analysis of two LGs, which have been actively used in schools for nearly ten years. These design patterns proved to be very useful because half of them where adopted by teams of designers, in the process of creating LGs, for similar contexts to the ones of the existing LGs.
