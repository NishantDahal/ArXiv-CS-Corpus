Learning to Ask Questions in Open-domain Conversational Systems with Typed Decoders

Asking good questions in large-scale, open-domain conversational systems is quite significant yet rather untouched. This task, substantially different from traditional question generation, requires to question not only with various patterns but also on diverse and relevant topics. We observe that a good question is a natural composition of {\it interrogatives}, {\it topic words}, and {\it ordinary words}. Interrogatives lexicalize the pattern of questioning, topic words address the key information for topic transition in dialogue, and ordinary words play syntactical and grammatical roles in making a natural sentence. We devise two typed decoders (\textit{soft typed decoder} and \textit{hard typed decoder}) in which a type distribution over the three types is estimated and used to modulate the final generation distribution. Extensive experiments show that the typed decoders outperform state-of-the-art baselines and can generate more meaningful questions.
