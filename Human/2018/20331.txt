A Radix-M Construction for Complementary Sets

We extend the paraunitary (PU) theory for complementary pairs to comple- mentary sets and complete complementary codes (CCC) by proposing a new PU construction. A special, but very important case of complementary sets (and CC- C), based on standard delays, is analyzed in details and a new 'Radix-M generator' (RM-G) is presented. The RM-G can be viewed as a generalization of the Boolean generator for complementary pairs. An efficient correlator for standard complemen- tary sets and CCC is also presented. Finally, examples of polyphase, QAM and hexagonal PU sets of three sequences are given.
