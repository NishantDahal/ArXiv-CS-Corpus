Cross-domain CNN for Hyperspectral Image Classification

In this paper, we address the dataset scarcity issue with the hyperspectral image classification. As only a few thousands of pixels are available for training, it is difficult to effectively learn high-capacity Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To cope with this problem, we propose a novel cross-domain CNN containing the shared parameters which can co-learn across multiple hyperspectral datasets. The network also contains the non-shared portions designed to handle the dataset specific spectral characteristics and the associated classification tasks. Our approach is the first attempt to learn a CNN for multiple hyperspectral datasets, in an end-to-end fashion. Moreover, we have experimentally shown that the proposed network trained on three of the widely used datasets outperform all the baseline networks which are trained on single dataset.
