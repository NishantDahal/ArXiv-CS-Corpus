Breaking the Limits in Urban Video Monitoring: Massive Crowd Sourced Surveillance over Vehicles

Contemporary urban environments are in prompt need of means for intelligent decision-making, where a crucial role belongs to smart video surveillance systems. While existing deployments of stationary monitoring cameras already deliver notable societal benefits, the proposed concept of massive video surveillance over connected vehicles that we contribute in this paper may further augment these important capabilities. We therefore introduce the envisioned system concept, discuss its implementation, outline the high-level architecture, and identify major data flows, while also offering insights into the corresponding design and deployment aspects. Our conducted case study confirms the potential of the described crowd sourced vehicular system to effectively complement and eventually surpass even the best of today's static video surveillance setups. We expect that our proposal will become of value and integrate seamlessly into the future Internet-of-Things landscape, thus enabling a plethora of advanced urban applications.
