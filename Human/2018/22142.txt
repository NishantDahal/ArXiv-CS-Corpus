The BaseJump Manycore Accelerator Network

The BaseJump Manycore Accelerator-Network is an open source mesh-based On-Chip-Network which is designed leveraging the Bespoke Silicon Group's 20+ years of experience in designing manycore architectures. It has been used in the 16nm 511-core RISC-V compatible Celerity chip Davidson et al. (2018), forming the basis of both a 1 GHz 496-core RISC-V manycore and a 10-core always-on low voltage complex. It was also used in the 180nm BSG Ten chip, which featured ten cores and a mesh that extends over off-chip links to an FPGA. To facilitate use by the open source community of the BaseJump Manycore network, we explain the ideas, protocols, interfaces and potential uses of the mesh network. We also show an example with source code that demonstrates how to integrate user designs into the mesh network.
