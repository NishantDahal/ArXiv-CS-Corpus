Probabilistic Model Checking for Continuous Time Markov Chains via Sequential Bayesian Inference

Probabilistic model checking for systems with large or unbounded state space is a challenging computational problem in formal modelling and its applications. Numerical algorithms require an explicit representation of the state space, while statistical approaches require a large number of samples to estimate the desired properties with high confidence. Here, we show how model checking of time-bounded path properties can be recast exactly as a Bayesian inference problem. In this novel formulation the problem can be efficiently approximated using techniques from machine learning. Our approach is inspired by a recent result in statistical physics which derived closed form differential equations for the first-passage time distribution of stochastic processes. We show on a number of non-trivial case studies that our method achieves both high accuracy and significant computational gains compared to statistical model checking.
