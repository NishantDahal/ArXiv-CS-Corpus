Energy Efficiency of Fog Computing Health Monitoring Applications

Fog computing offers a scalable and effective solution to overcome the increasing processing and networking demands of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices. In this paper, we investigate the use of fog computing for health monitoring applications. We consider a heart monitoring application where patients send their 30 minute recording of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for processing, analysis, and decision making at fog processing units within the time constraint recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) to save heart patients when an abnormality in the ECG signal is detected. The locations of the processing servers are optimized so that the energy consumption of both the processing and networking equipment are minimised. The results show that processing the ECG signal at fog processing units yields a total energy consumption saving of up to 68% compared to processing the at the central cloud.
