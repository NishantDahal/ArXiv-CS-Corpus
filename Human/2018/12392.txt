Improving Character-level Japanese-Chinese Neural Machine Translation with Radicals as an Additional Input Feature

In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been proven to get impressive results. While some additional linguistic features of input words improve word-level NMT, any additional character features have not been used to improve character-level NMT so far. In this paper, we show that the radicals of Chinese characters (or kanji), as a character feature information, can be easily provide further improvements in the character-level NMT. In experiments on WAT2016 Japanese-Chinese scientific paper excerpt corpus (ASPEC-JP), we find that the proposed method improves the translation quality according to two aspects: perplexity and BLEU. The character-level NMT with the radical input feature's model got a state-of-the-art result of 40.61 BLEU points in the test set, which is an improvement of about 8.6 BLEU points over the best system on the WAT2016 Japanese-to-Chinese translation subtask with ASPEC-JP. The improvements over the character-level NMT with no additional input feature are up to about 1.5 and 1.4 BLEU points in the development-test set and the test set of the corpus, respectively.
