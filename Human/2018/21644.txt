Construction of cospectral graphs

Construction of non-isomorphic cospectral graphs is a nontrivial problem in spectral graph theory specially for large graphs. In this paper, we establish that graph theoretical partial transpose of a graph is a potential tool to create non-isomorphic cospectral graphs by considering a graph as a clustered graph.
