On Lower Complexity Bounds for Large-Scale Smooth Convex Optimization

We derive lower bounds on the black-box oracle complexity of large-scale smooth convex minimization problems, with emphasis on minimizing smooth (with Holder continuous, with a given exponent and constant, gradient) convex functions over high-dimensional ||.||_p-balls, 1<=p<=\infty. Our bounds turn out to be tight (up to logarithmic in the design dimension factors), and can be viewed as a substantial extension of the existing lower complexity bounds for large-scale convex minimization covering the nonsmooth case and the 'Euclidean' smooth case (minimization of convex functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients over Euclidean balls). As a byproduct of our results, we demonstrate that the classical Conditional Gradient algorithm is near-optimal, in the sense of Information-Based Complexity Theory, when minimizing smooth convex functions over high-dimensional ||.||_\infty-balls and their matrix analogies -- spectral norm balls in the spaces of square matrices.
