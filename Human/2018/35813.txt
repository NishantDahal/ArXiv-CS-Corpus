A Sharp Bound on the $s$-Energy and Its Applications to Averaging Systems

The {\em $s$-energy} is a generating function of wide applicability in network-based dynamics. We derive an (essentially) optimal bound of $(3/ρs)^{n-1}$ on the $s$-energy of an $n$-agent symmetric averaging system, for any positive real $s\leq 1$, where~$ρ$ is a lower bound on the nonzero weights. This is done by introducing the new dynamics of {\em twist systems}. We show how to use the new bound on the $s$-energy to tighten the convergence rate of systems in opinion dynamics, flocking, and synchronization.
