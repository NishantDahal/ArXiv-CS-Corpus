Multipath Transmission Scheduling in Millimeter Wave Cloud Radio Access Networks

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications provide great potential for next-generation cellular networks to meet the demands of fast-growing mobile data traffic with plentiful spectrum available. However, in a mmWave cellular system, the shadowing and blockage effects lead to the intermittent connectivity, and the handovers are more frequent. This paper investigates an ``all-mmWave'' cloud radio access network (cloud-RAN), in which both the fronthaul and the radio access links operate at mmWave. To address the intermittent transmissions, we allow the mobile users (MUs) to establish multiple connections to the central unit over the remote radio heads (RRHs). Specifically, we propose a multipath transmission framework by leveraging the ``all-mmWave'' cloud-RAN architecture, which makes decisions of the RRH association and the packet transmission scheduling according to the time-varying network statistics, such that a MU experiences the minimum queueing delay and packet drops. The joint RRH association and transmission scheduling problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Due to the problem size, a low-complexity online learning scheme is put forward, which requires no a priori statistic information of network dynamics. Simulations show that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-art baselines, in terms of average queue length and average packet dropping rate.
