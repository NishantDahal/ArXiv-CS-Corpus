Fog Computing in IoT Aided Smart Grid Transition- Requirements, Prospects, Status Quos and Challenges

Due to unfolded developments in both the IT sectors viz. Intelligent Transportation and Information Technology contemporary Smart Grid (SG) systems are leveraged with smart devices and entities. Such infrastructures when bestowed with the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network make a universe of objects active and online. The traditional cloud deployment succumbs to meet the analytics and computational exigencies decentralized, dynamic cum resource-time critical SG ecosystems. This paper synoptically inspects to what extent the cloud computing utilities can satisfy the mission-critical requirements of SG ecosystems and which subdomains and services call for fog based computing archetypes. The objective of this work is to comprehend the applicability of fog computing algorithms to interplay with the core centered cloud computing support, thus enabling to come up with a new breed of real-time and latency free SG services. The work also highlights the opportunities brought by fog based SG deployments. Correspondingly, we also highlight the challenges and research thrusts elucidated towards the viability of fog computing for successful SG Transition.
