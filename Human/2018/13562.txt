Adaptive Sampling for Rapidly Matching Histograms

In exploratory data analysis, analysts often have a need to identify histograms that possess a specific distribution, among a large class of candidate histograms, e.g., find countries whose income distribution is most similar to that of Greece. This distribution could be a new one that the user is curious about, or a known distribution from an existing histogram visualization. At present, this process of identification is brute-force, requiring the manual generation and evaluation of a large number of histograms. We present FastMatch: an end-to-end approach for interactively retrieving the histogram visualizations most similar to a user-specified target, from a large collection of histograms. The primary technical contribution underlying FastMatch is a probabilistic algorithm, HistSim, a theoretically sound sampling-based approach to identify the top-$k$ closest histograms under $\ell_1$ distance. While HistSim can be used independently, within FastMatch we couple HistSim with a novel system architecture that is aware of practical considerations, employing asynchronous block-based sampling policies, building on lightweight sampling engines developed in recent work. FastMatch obtains near-perfect accuracy with up to $35\times$ speedup over approaches that do not use sampling on several real-world datasets.
