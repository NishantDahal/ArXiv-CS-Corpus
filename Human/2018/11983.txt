CARL: Content-Aware Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Networks

Heterogeneous networks not only present a challenge of heterogeneity in the types of nodes and relations, but also the attributes and content associated with the nodes. While recent works have looked at representation learning on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, there is no work that has collectively addressed the following challenges: (a) the heterogeneous structural information of the network consisting of multiple types of nodes and relations; (b) the unstructured semantic content (e.g., text) associated with nodes; and (c) online updates due to incoming new nodes in growing network. We address these challenges by developing a Content-Aware Representation Learning model (CARL). CARL performs joint optimization of heterogeneous SkipGram and deep semantic encoding for capturing both heterogeneous structural closeness and unstructured semantic relations among all nodes, as function of node content, that exist in the network. Furthermore, an additional online update module is proposed for efficiently learning representations of incoming nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link prediction, document retrieval, node recommendation and relevance search. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the CARL's online update module through a category visualization study.
