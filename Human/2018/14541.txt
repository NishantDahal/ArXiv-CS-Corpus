Mining the Air -- for Research in Social Science and Networking Measurement

Smartphone apps provide a vitally important opportunity for monitoring human mobility, human experience of ubiquitous information aids, and human activity in our increasingly well-instrumented spaces. As wireless data capabilities move steadily up in performance, from 2&3G to 4G (today's LTE) and 5G, it has become more important to measure human activity in this connected world from the phones themselves. The newer protocols serve larger areas than ever before and a wider range of data, not just voice calls, so only the phone can accurately measure its location. Access to the application activity permits not only monitoring the performance and spatial coverage with which the users are served, but as a crowd-sourced, unbiased background source of input on all these subjects, becomes a uniquely valuable resource for input to social science and government as well as telecom providers
