Medical Technologies and Challenges of Robot Assisted Minimally Invasive Intervention and Diagnostics

Emerging paradigms furthering the reach of medical technology deeper into human anatomy present unique modeling, control and sensing problems. This paper discusses a brief history of medical robotics leading to the current trend of minimally invasive intervention and diagnostics in confined spaces. Robotics for natural orifice and single port access surgery, capsule and magnetically actuated robotics and microrobotics are discussed with the aim of elucidating the state of the art. Works on modeling, sensing and control of mechanical architectures of robots for natural orifice and single port access surgery are discussed, followed by a presentation of works on magnetic actuation, sensing and localization for capsule robotics and microrobotics. Finally challenges and open problems in each one of these areas are presented.
