Reversibility of d-State Finite Cellular Automata

This paper investigates reversibility properties of 1-dimensional 3-neighborhood d-state finite cellular automata (CAs) of length n under periodic boundary condition. A tool named reachability tree has been developed from de Bruijn graph which represents all possible reachable configurations of an n-cell CA. This tool has been used to test reversibility of CAs. We have identified a large set of reversible CAs using this tool by following some greedy strategies.
