Multi-robot Path Planning in Well-formed Infrastructures: Prioritized Planning vs. Prioritized Wait Adjustment (Preliminary Results)

We study the problem of planning collision-free paths for a group of homogeneous robots. We propose a novel approach for turning the paths that were planned egocentrically by the robots, e.g. without taking other robots' moves into account, into collision-free trajectories and evaluate it empirically. Suggested algorithm is much faster (up to one order of magnitude) than state-of-the-art but this comes at the price of notable drop-down of the solution cost.
