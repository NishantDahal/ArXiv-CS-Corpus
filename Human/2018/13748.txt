Approximate Capacity Region of the Two-User Gaussian Interference Channel with Noisy Channel-Output Feedback

In this paper, the capacity region of the linear deterministic interference channel with noisy channel-output feedback (LD-IC-NF) is fully characterized. The proof of achievability is based on random coding arguments and rate splitting; block-Markov superposition coding; and backward decoding. The proof of converse reuses some of the existing outer bounds and includes new ones obtained using genie-aided models. Following the insight gained from the analysis of the LD-IC-NF, an achievability region and a converse region for the two-user Gaussian interference channel with noisy channel-output feedback (GIC-NF) are presented. Finally, the achievability region and the converse region are proven to approximate the capacity region of the G-IC-NF to within 4.4 bits.
