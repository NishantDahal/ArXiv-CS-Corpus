Trajectory Representation and Landmark Projection for Continuous-Time Structure from Motion

This paper revisits the problem of continuous-time structure from motion, and introduces a number of extensions that improve convergence and efficiency. The formulation with a $\mathcal{C}^2$-continuous spline for the trajectory naturally incorporates inertial measurements, as derivatives of the sought trajectory. We analyse the behaviour of split interpolation on $\mathbb{SO}(3)$ and on $\mathbb{R}^3$, and a joint interpolation on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$, and show that the latter implicitly couples the direction of translation and rotation. Such an assumption can make good sense for a camera mounted on a robot arm, but not for hand-held or body-mounted cameras. Our experiments show that split interpolation on $\mathbb{SO}(3)$ and on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is preferable over $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ interpolation in all tested cases. Finally, we investigate the problem of landmark reprojection on rolling shutter cameras, and show that the tested reprojection methods give similar quality, while their computational load varies by a factor of 2.
