Understanding Fashionability: What drives sales of a style?

We use customer demand data for fashion articles on Myntra, and derive a fashionability or style quotient, which represents customer demand for the stylistic content of a fashion article, decoupled with its commercials (price, offers, etc.). We demonstrate learning for assortment planning in fashion that would aim to keep a healthy mix of breadth and depth across various styles, and we show the relationship between a customer's perception of a style vs a merchandiser's catalogue of styles. We also backtest our method to calculate prediction errors in our style quotient and customer demand, and discuss various implications and findings.
