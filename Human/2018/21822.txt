Low Delay Scheduling of Objects Over Multiple Wireless Paths

In this paper we consider the task of scheduling packet transmissions amongst multiple paths with uncertain, time-varying delay. We make the observation that the requirement is usually to transmit application layer objects (web pages, images, video frames etc) with low latency, and so it is the object delay rather than the per packet delay which is important. This has fundamental implications for multipath scheduler design. We introduce SOS (Stochastic Object-aware Scheduler), the first multipath scheduler that considers application layer object sizes and their relationship to link uncertainty. We demonstrate that SOS reduces the 95% percentile object delivery delay by 50-100% over production WiFi and LTE links compared to state-of-the art schedulers. We extend SOS to utilize FEC and to handle the scheduling multiple objects in parallel. We show that judicious priority scheduling of HTTP objects can lead to a 2-3x improvement in page load times
