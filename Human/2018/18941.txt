LinBFT: Linear-Communication Byzantine Fault Tolerance for Public Blockchains

This paper presents LinBFT, a novel Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocol for blockchain systems that achieves amortized O(n) communication volume per block under reasonable conditions (where n is the number of participants), while satisfying determinist guarantees on safety and liveness. This significantly improves previous results, which either incurs quadratic communication complexity, or only satisfies safety in a probabilistic sense. LinBFT is based on the popular PBFT protocol, and cuts down its $O(n^4)$ complexity with three tricks, each by $O(n)$: linear view change, threshold signatures, and verifiable random functions. All three are known, i.e., the solutions are right in front of our eyes, and yet LinBFT is the first $O(n)$ solution with deterministic security guarantees.
  Further, LinBFT also addresses issues that are specific to permission-less, public blockchain systems, such as anonymous participants without a public-key infrastructure, proof-of-stake with slashing, rotating leader, and a dynamic participant set. In addition, LinBFT contains no proof-of-work module, reaches consensus for every block, and tolerates changing honesty of the participants for different blocks.
