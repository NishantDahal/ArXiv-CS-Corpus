Detecting Bot Activity in the Ethereum Blockchain Network

The Ethereum blockchain network is a decentralized platform enabling smart contract execution and transactions of Ether (ETH) [1], its designated cryptocurrency. Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency with a market cap of more than 100 billion USD, with hundreds of thousands of transactions executed daily by hundreds of thousands of unique wallets. Tens of thousands of those wallets are newly generated each day. The Ethereum platform enables anyone to freely open multiple new wallets [2] free of charge (resulting in a large number of wallets that are controlled by the same entities). This attribute makes the Ethereum network a breeding space for activity by software robots (bots). The existence of bots is widespread in different digital technologies and there are various approaches to detect their activity such as rule-base, clustering, machine learning and more [3,4]. In this work we demonstrate how bot detection can be implemented using a network theory approach.
