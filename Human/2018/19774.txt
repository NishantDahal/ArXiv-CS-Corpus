One Way Function Candidate based on the Collatz Problem

The one way function based on the Collatz problem is proposed. It is based on the problem's conditional branching structure which is not considered as important even the 3x+1 question is quite famous. The analysis shows why the problem is mathematically so inaccessible and how the algorithm conditional branching structure can be used to construct one way functions. It also shows exponential dependence between algorithm's conditional branching and running cost of algorithm branch-less reductions.
