Microservices as an Evolutionary Architecture of Component-Based Development: A Think-aloud Study

Microservices become a fast growing and popular architectural style based on service-oriented development. One of the major advantages using component-based approaches is to support reuse. In this paper, we present a study of microservices and how these systems are related to the traditional abstract models of component-based systems. This research focuses on the core properties of microservices including their scalability, availability and resilience, consistency, coupling and cohesion, and data storage capability, while highlighting their limitations and challenges in relation to components. To support our study, we investigated the existing literature and provided potential directions and interesting points in this growing field of research. As a result, using microservices as components is promising and would be a good mechanism for building applications that were used to be built with component-based approaches.
