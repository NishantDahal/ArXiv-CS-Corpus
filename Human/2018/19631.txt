Distributed Cache Enabled V2X Networks: Proposals, Research Trends and Challenging Issues

Nowadays, the internet of vehicles (IoV) has been evolved into the stage of vehicle to everything (V2X). However, the majority of existing work focuses on the motor-vehicles. In contrast, the sharing bicycle system is vastly and rapidly deployed as a feasible internet of things (IoT) application scene for the last mile problem (e.g., from station to home/office). Moreover, the internet access of current V2X is relied on the back-haul to roadside unit (RSU) connections. In this paper, other than prior work, we propose a versatile V2X system with a distributed framework and heterogeneous caching method. All the vehicles and devices on-the-road (motor-vehicle, non-motor-vehicle, pedestrian, etc.) are comprehensively included in the proposed networks. We further introduce a heterogeneous cache method for effective wireless transmission while utilizing the massive connected devices. The potential research trends on achieving high speed transmission, deep programming dedicated network slicing are highlighted as well as the big data, machine learning (ML), fog computing based image recognition and reconstruction, to provide some insights for future studies. Finally, the challenging issues, i.e., urban street canyon path loss and channel models, ultra reliable communication and low latency requirements, are discussed.
