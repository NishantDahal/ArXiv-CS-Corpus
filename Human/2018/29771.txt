Viconmavlink: A software tool for indoor positioning using a motion capture system

Motion capture is a widely-used technology in robotics research thanks to its precise posi tional measurements with real-time performance. This paper presents ViconMAVLink, a cross-platform open-source software tool that provides indoor positioning services to networked robots. ViconMAVLink converts Vicon motion capture data into proper pose and motion data formats and send localization information to robots using the MAVLink protocol. The software is a convenient tool for mobile robotics researchers to conduct experiments in a controlled indoor environment.
