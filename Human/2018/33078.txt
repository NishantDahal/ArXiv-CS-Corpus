Secret Key Generation over Noisy Channels with Correlated Sources

This paper investigates the problem of secret key generation over a wiretap channel when the terminals observe correlated sources. These sources are independent of the main channel and the users overhear them before the transmission takes place. A novel achievable scheme is proposed, and its optimality is shown under certain less-noisy conditions. This result improves upon the existing literature where the more stringent condition of degradedness is required. Furthermore, numerical evaluation of the proposed scheme and previously reported results for a binary model are presented; a comparison of the numerical bounds provides insights on the benefit of the novel scheme.
