Big Data and Privacy Issues for Connected Vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems

The evolution of Big Data in large-scale Internet-of-Vehicles has brought forward unprecedented opportunities for a unified management of the transportation sector, and for devising smart Intelligent Transportation Systems. Nevertheless, such form of frequent heterogeneous data collection between the vehicles and numerous applications platforms via diverse radio access technologies has led to a number of security and privacy attacks, and accordingly demands for a secure data collection in such architectures. In this respect, this chapter is primarily an effort to highlight the said challenge to the readers, and to subsequently propose some security requirements and a basic system model for secure Big Data collection in Internet-of-Vehicles. Open research challenges and future directions have also been deliberated.
