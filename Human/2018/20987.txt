DeltaPath: dataflow-based high-performance incremental routing

Routing controllers must react quickly to failures, reconfigurations and workload or policy changes, to ensure service performance and cost-efficient network operation. We propose a general execution model which views routing as an incremental data-parallel computation on a graph-based network model plus a continuous stream of network changes. Our approach supports different routing objectives with only minor re-configuration of its core algorithm, and easily accomodates dynamic user-defined routing policies. Moreover, our prototype demonstrates excellent performance: on Google Jupiter topology it reacts with a median time of 350ms to link failures and serves more than two million path requests per second each with latency under 1ms. This is three orders-of-magnitude faster than the popular ONOS open-source SDN controller.
