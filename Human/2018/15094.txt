Energy Efficiency in Hybrid Beamforming Large-scale mmWave Multiuser MIMO with Spatial Modulation

The problem of radio resource allocation for global energy efficiency (GEE) maximization in mmWaves large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using hybrid-beamforming with spatial modulation is addressed. The theoretical properties of the optimization problem at hand are analyzed and two provably convergent optimization algorithms with affordable complexity are proposed. The former achieves the global optimum, while the latter trades off optimality with a lower computational complexity. Nevertheless, numerical results show that both algorithms attain global optimality in practical scenarios.
