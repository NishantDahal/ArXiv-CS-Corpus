An iALM-ICA-based Anti-Jamming DS-CDMA Receiver for LMS Systems

We consider a land mobile satellite communication system using spread spectrum techniques where the uplink is exposed to MT jamming attacks, and the downlink is corrupted by multi-path fading channels. We proposes an anti-jamming receiver, which exploits inherent low-dimensionality of the received signal model, by formulating a robust principal component analysis (Robust PCA)-based recovery problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed receiver outperforms the conventional receiver for a reasonable rank of the jamming signal.
