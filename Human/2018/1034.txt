Applying Vector Space Model (VSM) Techniques in Information Retrieval for Arabic Language

Information Retrieval (IR) allows the storage, management, processing and retrieval of information, documents, websites, etc. Building an IR system for any language is imperative. This is evident through the massive conducted efforts to build IR systems using any of its models that are valid for certain languages. This report presents an implementation for a core IR technique which is Vector Space Model (VSM). We have chosen VSM model for our project since it is a term weighting scheme, and the retrieved documents could be sorted according to their relevancy degree. One other significant feature for such technique is the ability to get a relevance feedback from the users of the system; users can judge whether the retrieved document is relative to their need or not. The developed system has been validated through building an Arabic IR website using server side scripting. The experiments verifies the effectiveness of our system to apply all techniques of vector space model and valid over Arabic language.
