An Introduction to Classic DEVS

DEVS is a popular formalism for modelling complex dynamic systems using a discrete-event abstraction. At this abstraction level, a timed sequence ofpertinent "events" input to a system (or internal, in the case of timeouts) cause instantaneous changes to the state of the system. Between events, the state does not change, resulting in a a piecewise constant state trajectory. Main advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for modular composition.
  This chapter introduces the Classic DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion, using a simple traffic light example. The syntax and operational semantics of Atomic (i.e., non-hierarchical) models are intruced first. The semantics of Coupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS models. As this formal "flattening" is not efficient, a modular abstract simulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This is the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to actual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance analysis for queueing systems. Finally, we present some of the shortcomings in the Classic DEVS formalism, and show solutions to them in the form of variants of the original formalism.
