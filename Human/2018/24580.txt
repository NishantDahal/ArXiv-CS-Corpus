Efficient Multimedia Similarity Measurement Using Similar Elements

Online social networking techniques and large-scale multimedia systems are developing rapidly, which not only has brought great convenience to our daily life, but generated, collected, and stored large-scale multimedia data. This trend has put forward higher requirements and greater challenges on massive multimedia data retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the problem of image similarity measurement which is used to lots of applications. At first we propose the definition of similarity measurement of images and the related notions. Based on it we present a novel basic method of similarity measurement named SMIN. To improve the performance of calculation, we propose a novel indexing structure called SMI Temp Index (SMII for short). Besides, we establish an index of potential similar visual words off-line to solve to problem that the index cannot be reused. Experimental evaluations on two real image datasets demonstrate that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art method.
