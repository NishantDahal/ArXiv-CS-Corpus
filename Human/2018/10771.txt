Graph-based Filtering of Out-of-Vocabulary Words for Encoder-Decoder Models

Encoder-decoder models typically only employ words that are frequently used in the training corpus to reduce the computational costs and exclude noise. However, this vocabulary set may still include words that interfere with learning in encoder-decoder models. This paper proposes a method for selecting more suitable words for learning encoders by utilizing not only frequency, but also co-occurrence information, which we capture using the HITS algorithm. We apply our proposed method to two tasks: machine translation and grammatical error correction. For Japanese-to-English translation, this method achieves a BLEU score that is 0.56 points more than that of a baseline. It also outperforms the baseline method for English grammatical error correction, with an F0.5-measure that is 1.48 points higher.
