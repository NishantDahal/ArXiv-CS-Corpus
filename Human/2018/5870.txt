Secure SWIPT for Directional Modulation Aided AF Relaying Networks

Secure wireless information and power transfer based on directional modulation is conceived for amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying networks. Explicitly, we first formulate a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem, which can be decomposed into a twin-level optimization problem and solved by a one-dimensional (1D) search and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. Then in order to reduce the search complexity, we formulate an optimization problem based on maximizing the signal-to-leakage-AN-noise-ratio (Max-SLANR) criterion, and transform it into a SDR problem. Additionally, the relaxation is proved to be tight according to the classic Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Finally, to reduce the computational complexity, a successive convex approximation (SCA) scheme is proposed to find a near-optimal solution. The complexity of the SCA scheme is much lower than that of the SRM and the Max-SLANR schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the SCA scheme is very close to that of the SRM scheme in terms of its secrecy rate and bit error rate (BER), but much better than that of the zero forcing (ZF) scheme.
