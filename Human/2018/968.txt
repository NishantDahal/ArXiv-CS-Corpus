Generative Single Image Reflection Separation

Single image reflection separation is an ill-posed problem since two scenes, a transmitted scene and a reflected scene, need to be inferred from a single observation. To make the problem tractable, in this work we assume that categories of two scenes are known. It allows us to address the problem by generating both scenes that belong to the categories while their contents are constrained to match with the observed image. A novel network architecture is proposed to render realistic images of both scenes based on adversarial learning. The network can be trained in a weakly supervised manner, i.e., it learns to separate an observed image without corresponding ground truth images of transmission and reflection scenes which are difficult to collect in practice. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods.
