ClaiRE at SemEval-2018 Task 7 - Extended Version

In this paper we describe our post-evaluation results for SemEval-2018 Task 7 on clas- sification of semantic relations in scientific literature for clean (subtask 1.1) and noisy data (subtask 1.2). This is an extended ver- sion of our workshop paper (Hettinger et al., 2018) including further technical details (Sec- tions 3.2 and 4.3) and changes made to the preprocessing step in the post-evaluation phase (Section 2.1). Due to these changes Classification of Relations using Embeddings (ClaiRE) achieved an improved F1 score of 75.11% for the first subtask and 81.44% for the second.
