On maximum distance separable group codes with complementary duals

Given an LCD group code $C$ in a group algebra $KG$, we inspect kinship between $C$ and $G$, more precisely between the subgroup structures of $G$ and $C$. Under some special circumstances our inspection provides an estimation for various parameters of a group code $C$. When $C$ is MDS, the inter relation between $K$ and $G$ becomes more impressive. Application of Sylow theorem facilitated us to explore the inter relation between $G$ and $K$ (when $C$ is LCD and MDS) in more general way and finally we get the result of Cruz and Willems (Lemma $4.4$) as a simple sequel.
