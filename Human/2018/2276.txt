Transparent Voting Platform Based on Permissioned Blockchain

Since 2004, different research was handling the challenges in the centralized voting systems, e-voting protocols and recently the decentralized voting. So electronic voting puts forward some difficulties regarding the voter anonymity, the secure casting of the votes and to prevent the voting process from frauding. The Decentralized property of the technology called "blockchain" could have the solution for many of the challenges in voting research area and brings a new secure mechanism of safe and transparent voting. In this paper, a broad comparison between ongoing voting systems has studied by analyzing their structure and the drawbacks that should consider in future to improve the whole election process from keeping the privacy of the voter, casting a vote with the possibility to check if it was counted correctly to publishing the results. The result of the paper will give a new approach to extend the target of the election from small scale to large scale despite the fact of Ethereum limitation which can cast on the blockchain just five votes per minute. The primary challenge is to find an answer for this question: "How to balance between voter privacy and transparency without breaking the important rule where the voter can proof for a specific candidate that he voted for him in a bribe situation?".
