Applications for mobile devices focused on support for autism spectrum disorder population and / or people in their immediate environment in their daily lives: a systematic and practical review from a Spanish - speaking perspective

The present study has made a review of scientific publications on applications focused on autism, most of them developed for communication, social behavior and learning, which coincides with what is observed in a digital market that practically lacks scientific validation. The study has also found only 135 of these type of applications with a Spanish version available (in a practical sense), developed mostly for daily life of an autistic person and/or people from their immediate environment. By using these applications, there are positive results in terms of learning and permanent adoption of behaviors and skills, but it is necessary to deepen research and further development of applications focused on leisure, resources for parents and professionals, and supporting of autistic adult needs.
