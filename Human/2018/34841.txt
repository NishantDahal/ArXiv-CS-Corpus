Termination of $λ$$Π$ modulo rewriting using the size-change principle (work in progress)

The Size-Change Termination principle was first introduced to study the termination of first-order functional programs. In this work, we show that it can also be used to study the termination of higher-order rewriting in a system of dependent types extending LF.
