Detecting truth, just on parts

We introduce and discuss, through a computational algebraic geometry approach, the automatic reasoning handling of propositions that are simultaneously true and false over some relevant collections of instances. A rigorous, algorithmic criterion is presented for detecting such cases, and its performance is exemplified through the implementation of this test on the dynamic geometry program GeoGebra.
