Advanced local motion patterns for macro and micro facial expression recognition

In this paper, we develop a new method that recognizes facial expressions, on the basis of an innovative local motion patterns feature, with three main contributions. The first one is the analysis of the face skin temporal elasticity and face deformations during expression. The second one is a unified approach for both macro and micro expression recognition. And, the third one is the step forward towards in-the-wild expression recognition, dealing with challenges such as various intensity and various expression activation patterns, illumination variation and small head pose variations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for micro expression recognition and positions itself among top-rank state-of-the-art methods for macro expression recognition.
