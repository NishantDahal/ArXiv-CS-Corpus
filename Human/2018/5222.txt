An Overview of Vulnerabilities of Voice Controlled Systems

Over the last few years, a rapidly increasing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems that adopt voice as the primary user input have emerged. These systems have been shown to be vulnerable to various types of voice spoofing attacks. However, how exactly these techniques differ or relate to each other has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we provide a survey of recent attack and defense techniques for voice controlled systems and propose a classification of these techniques. We also discuss the need for a universal defense strategy that protects a system from various types of attacks.
