Nanotechnology: The New Features

Nanotechnologies are attracting increasing investments from both governments and industries around the world, which offers great opportunities to explore the new emerging nanodevices, such as the Carbon Nanotube and Nanosensors. This technique exploits the specific properties which arise from structure at a scale characterized by the interplay of classical physics and quantum mechanics. It is difficult to predict these properties a priori according to traditional technologies. Nanotechnologies will be one of the next promising trends after MOS technologies. However, there has been much hype around nanotechnology, both by those who want to promote it and those who have fears about its potentials. This paper gives a deep survey regarding different aspects of the new nanotechnologies, such as materials, physics, and semiconductors respectively, followed by an introduction of several state-of-the-art nanodevices and then new nanotechnology features. Since little research has been carried out on the toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles and nanotubes, this paper also discusses several problems in the nanotechnology area and gives constructive suggestions and predictions.
