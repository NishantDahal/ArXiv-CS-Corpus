Mixed Delay Constraints in Wyner's Soft-Handoff Network

Wyner's soft-handoff network with mixed delay constraints is considered when neighbouring receivers can cooperate over rate-limited links. Each source message is a combination of independent "fast" and "slow" bits, where the former are subject to a stringent decoding delay. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived, and the multiplexing gain region is characterized when only transmitters or only receivers cooperate.
