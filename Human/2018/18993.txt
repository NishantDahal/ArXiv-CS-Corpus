Wideband Time-Domain Digital Backpropagation via Subband Processing and Deep Learning

We propose a low-complexity sub-banded DSP architecture for digital backpropagation where the walk-off effect is compensated using simple delay elements. For a simulated 96-Gbaud signal and 2500 km optical link, our method achieves a 2.8 dB SNR improvement over linear equalization.
