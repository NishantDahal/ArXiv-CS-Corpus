Performance of Cognitive Radio Systems over $κ-μ$ Shadowed with Integer $μ$ and Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ Fading Channels

In this paper, we analyze the performance of cognitive radio (CR) systems over different composite generalized multipath /shadowed fading scenarios. The \k{appa}-μ shadowed and Fisher-Snedecor F fading channels which are proposed as a simple and high accurate distributions in comparison with generalized-K (KG) and Nakagami-m shadowed conditions are used in this analysis. For the \k{appa}-μ shadowed, a novel simple exact closed-form analytic expression for the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) are introduced by assuming the fading parameters are integer numbers. To this end, the detection performance metrics, namely, the average detection probability and the average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) which are used in the analysis of energy detection and the effective rate and the effective rate are derived. To validate the results of this work, comparisons between the simulated and numerical results as well as with various conventional channel models and scenarios are given.
