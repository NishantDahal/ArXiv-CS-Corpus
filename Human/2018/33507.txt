Wibson: A Decentralized Data Marketplace

Our aim is for Wibson to be a blockchain-based, decentralized data marketplace that provides individuals a way to securely and anonymously sell information in a trusted environment. The combination of the Wibson token and blockchain-enabled smart contracts hopes to allow Data Sellers and Data Buyers to transact with each other directly while providing individuals the ability to maintain anonymity as desired.
  Wibson intends that its data marketplace will provide infrastructure and financial incentives for individuals to securely sell personal information without sacrificing personal privacy. Data Buyers receive information from willing and actively participating individuals with the benefit of knowing that the personal information should be accurate and current.
