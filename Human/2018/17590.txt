Implementation strategy of free software in the process of preparation of teachers of mathematics, physics and computer science

Information processes in the society encourage the formation of a revision of the forms and methods of learning; involve the use of didactic capabilities of information and communication technologies in teaching. No less important in this context, the problem of professionals training who are able to use modern possibilities of computer technology. Training of highly qualified teachers is only possible using advanced technologies that cover the entire range of existing opportunities. The analysis used in the formation of the software has showed insufficient use of a whole class of software - free software in the educational process. To overcome this problem, the proposed implementation strategy of free software in the preparation of teachers of mathematics, physics and computer science is proposed.
