Micro-Operator driven Local 5G Network Architecture for Industrial Internet

In addition to the high degree of flexibility and customization required by different vertical sectors, 5G calls for a network architecture that ensures ultra-responsive and ultra-reliable communication links. The novel concept called micro-operator (uO) enables a versatile set of stakeholders to operate local 5G networks within their premises with a guaranteed quality and reliability to complement mobile network operators' (MNOs) offerings. In this paper, we propose a descriptive architecture for emerging 5G uOs which provides user specific and location specific services in a spatially confined environment. The architecture is discussed in terms of network functions and the operational units which entail the core and radio access networks in a smart factory environment which supports industry 4.0 standards. Moreover, in order to realize the conceptual design, we provide simulation results for the latency measurements of the proposed uO architecture with respect to an augmented reality use case in industrial internet. Thereby we discuss the benefits of having uO driven local 5G networks for specialized user requirements, rather than continuing with the conventional approach where only MNOs can deploy cellular networks.
