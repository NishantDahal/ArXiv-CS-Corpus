Obstacle Detection Quality as a Problem-Oriented Approach to Stereo Vision Algorithms Estimation in Road Situation Analysis

In this work we present a method for performance evaluation of stereo vision based obstacle detection techniques that takes into account the specifics of road situation analysis to minimize the effort required to prepare a test dataset. This approach has been designed to be implemented in systems such as self-driving cars or driver assistance and can also be used as problem-oriented quality criterion for evaluation of stereo vision algorithms.
