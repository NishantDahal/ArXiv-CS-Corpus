Minimizing Regret in Discounted-Sum Games

In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing regret in discounted-sum games played on weighted game graphs. We give algorithms for the general problem of computing the minimal regret of the controller (Eve) as well as several variants depending on which strategies the environment (Adam) is permitted to use. We also consider the problem of synthesizing regret-free strategies for Eve in each of these scenarios.
