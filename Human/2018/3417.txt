Programming Requests/Responses with GreatFree in the Cloud Environment

Programming request with GreatFree is an efficient programming technique to implement distributed polling in the cloud computing environment. GreatFree is a distributed programming environment through which diverse distributed systems can be established through programming rather than configuring or scripting. GreatFree emphasizes the importance of programming since it offers developers the opportunities to leverage their distributed knowledge and programming skills. Additionally, programming is the unique way to construct creative, adaptive and flexible systems to accommodate various distributed computing environments. With the support of GreatFree code-level Distributed Infrastructure Patterns, Distributed Operation Patterns and APIs, the difficult procedure is accomplished in a programmable, rapid and highly-patterned manner, i.e., the programming behaviors are simplified as the repeatable operation of Copy-Paste-Replace. Since distributed polling is one of the fundamental techniques to construct distributed systems, GreatFree provides developers with relevant APIs and patterns to program requests/responses in the novel programming environment.
