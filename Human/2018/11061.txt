Finite Blocklength Communications in Smart Grids for Dynamic Spectrum Access and Locally Licensed Scenarios

This work focuses on the performance analysis of short blocklength communication with application in smart grids. We use stochastic geometry to compute in closed form the success probability of a typical message transmission as a function of its size (i.e. blocklength), the number of information bits and the density of interferers. Two different scenarios are investigated: (i) dynamic spectrum access where the licensed and unlicensed users, share the uplink channel frequency band and (ii) local licensing approach using the so called micro operator, which holds an exclusive license of its own. Approximated outage probability expression is derived for the dynamic spectrum access scenario, while a closed-form solution is attained for the micro-operator. The analysis also incorporates the use of retransmissions when messages are detected in error. Our numerical results show how reliability and delay are related in either scenarios.
