A Novel Approach in Calculating Stakeholder priority in Requirements Elicitation

The ultimate goal of any software developer seeking a competitive edge is to meet stakeholders needs and expectations. To achieve this, it is necessary to effectively and accurately manage stakeholders system requirements. The paper proposes a systematic way of classifying stakeholders and then describes a novel method for calculating stakeholder priority taking into consideration the fact that different stakeholders will have different importance level and different requirement preference. Finally the requirement preference calculation is done where stakeholders choose the best requirements based on two factors, value and urgency of the requirement. The proposed method actively involves stakeholders in the requirement elicitation process.
