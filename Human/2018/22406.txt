Is preprocessing of text really worth your time for online comment classification?

A large proportion of online comments present on public domains are constructive, however a significant proportion are toxic in nature. The comments contain lot of typos which increases the number of features manifold, making the ML model difficult to train. Considering the fact that the data scientists spend approximately 80% of their time in collecting, cleaning and organizing their data [1], we explored how much effort should we invest in the preprocessing (transformation) of raw comments before feeding it to the state-of-the-art classification models. With the help of four models on Jigsaw toxic comment classification data, we demonstrated that the training of model without any transformation produce relatively decent model. Applying even basic transformations, in some cases, lead to worse performance and should be applied with caution.
