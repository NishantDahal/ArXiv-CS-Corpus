Proceedings Sixth Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Education

The Sixth International Workshops on Trends in Functional Programming in Education, TFPIE 2017, was held on 22 June 2017 at the University of Kent, in Canterbury, UK, and was co-located with TFP, the Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming.
  The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, professors, teachers, and all professionals interested in functional programming in education. This includes the teaching of functional programming, but also the application of functional programming as a tool for teaching other topics and disciplines.
  A particular topic of this year's TFPIE was that of MOOCs and other online learning and, as well as a session on this, we were delighted to welcome Heather Miller of EFPL and Northeastern University to give a keynote on this topic entitled "Functional Programming for All! Scaling a MOOC for Students and Professionals Alike". Heather works on and around the Scala programming language and is Executive Director of the Scala Center.
