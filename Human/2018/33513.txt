CLoTH: a Simulator for HTLC Payment Networks

The Lightning Network (LN) is one of the most promising off-chain scaling solutions for Bitcoin, as it enables off-chain payments which are not subject to the well-known blockchain scalability limit. In this work, we introduce CLoTH, a simulator for HTLC payment networks, of which LN is the best working example. It simulates input-defined payments on an input-defined HTLC network and produces performance measures in terms of payment-related statistics, such as time to complete payments and probability of payment failure. CLoTH helps to predict issues that might arise in the development of an HTLC payment network, and to estimate the effects of an optimisation before deploying it. In upcoming works we'll publish the results of CLoTH simulations.
