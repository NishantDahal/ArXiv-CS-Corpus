Massive Multiple Input Massive Multiple Output for 5G Wireless Backhauling

In this paper, we propose a new technique for the future fifth generation cellular network wireless backhauling. We show that hundreds of bits per second per Hertz (bits per second per Hz) of spectral efficiency can be attained at a high carrier frequency (such as 26 GHz) between large antenna arrays deployed along structures (such as lamp posts) that are close and roughly parallel to each other. Hundreds of data streams are spatially multiplexed through a short range and line of sight massive multiple input massive multiple output propagation channel thanks to a new low complexity spatial multiplexing scheme, called block discrete Fourier transform based spatial multiplexing with maximum ratio transmission. Its performance in real and existing environments is assessed using accurate ray-tracing tools and antenna models. In the best simulated scenario, 1.6 kbits per second per Hz of spectral efficiency is attained, corresponding to 80% of Singular Value Decomposition performance, with a transmitter and a receiver that are 200 and 10,000 times less complex, respectively.
