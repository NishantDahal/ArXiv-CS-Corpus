A Provenance Framework for Policy Analytics in Smart Cities

Sustainable urban environments based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies require appropriate policy management. However, such policies are established as a result of underlying, potentially complex and long-term policy making processes. Consequently, better policies require improved and verifiable planning processes. In order to assess and evaluate the planning process, transparency of the system is pivotal which can be achieved by tracking the provenance of policy making process. However, at present no system is available that can track the complete cycle of urban planning and decision making. We propose to capture the complete process of policy making and to investigate the role of IoT provenance to support design-making for policy analytics and implementation. The environment in which this research will be demonstrated is that of Smart Cities whose requirements will drive the research process.
