Numerical Simulation of Two-phase Flow in Natural Fractured Reservoirs Using Dual Porosity Method on Parallel Computers

The two-phase oil-water flow in natural fractured reservoirs and its numerical methods are introduced in this paper, where the fracture is modeled by the dual porosity method. Efficient numerical method, including the finite difference method, CPR-FPF preconditioners for linear systems and effective decoupling method, are presented. Parallel computing techniques employed in simulation are also presented. Using those numerical methods and parallel techniques, a parallel reservoir simulator is developed, which is capable of simulating large-scale reservoir models. The numerical results show that our simulator is accurate and scalable compared to the commercial software, and the numerical methods are also effective.
