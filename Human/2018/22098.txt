Diversification on Big Data in Query Processing

Recently, in the area of big data, some popular applications such as web search engines and recommendation systems, face the problem to diversify results during query processing. In this sense, it is both significant and essential to propose methods to deal with big data in order to increase the diversity of the result set. In this paper, we firstly define a set's diversity and an element's ability to improve the set's overall diversity. Based on these definitions, we propose a diversification framework which has good performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Also, this framework has theoretical guarantee on probability of success. Secondly, we design implementation algorithms based on this framework for both numerical and string data. Thirdly, for numerical and string data respectively, we carry out extensive experiments on real data to verify the performance of our proposed framework, and also perform scalability experiments on synthetic data.
