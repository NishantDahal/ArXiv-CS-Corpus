Is Self-Interference in Full-Duplex Communications a Foe or a Friend?

This paper studies the potential of harvesting energy from the self-interference of a full-duplex base station. The base station is equipped with a self-interference cancellation switch, which is turned-off for a fraction of the transmission period for harvesting the energy from the self-interference that arises due to the downlink transmission. For the remaining transmission period, the switch is on such that the uplink transmission takes place simultaneously with the downlink transmission. A novel energy-efficiency maximization problem is formulated for the joint design of downlink beamformers, uplink power allocations and transmission time-splitting factor. The optimization problem is nonconvex, and hence, a rapidly converging iterative algorithm is proposed by employing the successive convex approximation approach. Numerical simulation results show significant improvement in the energy-efficiency by allowing self-energy recycling.
