Plaque Classification in Coronary Arteries from IVOCT Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning

Advanced atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide while being preventable and treatable. In order to image atherosclerotic lesions (plaque), intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) can be used. The technique provides high-resolution images of arterial walls which allows for early plaque detection by experts. Due to the vast amount of IVOCT images acquired in clinical routines, automatic plaque detection has been addressed. For example, attenuation profiles in single A-Scans of IVOCT images are examined to detect plaque. We address automatic plaque classification from entire IVOCT images, the cross-sectional view of the artery, using deep feature learning. In this way, we take context between A-Scans into account and we directly learn relevant features from the image source without the need for handcrafting features.
