A Decision Support System Web-Application for the Management of Forest Road Network

The present study contributes to the development of an online FRMP (Forest Road Management Platform) that aims to assist in the management of forest road network in a holistic way. This is achieved by the proposed methodology which serves as a database using geoprocessing and geospatial technologies for the handling, and the identification of critical issues in the infrastructure of forest road networks, visualization of forest roads, and the optimization of the management of the forest road network by proposing alternative strategies. In this paper, the development of the decision making web-tool, and present examples to demonstrate effectively its application and resulting advantages are described. The developed web-application may provide assistance to various forest organizations in the management of forest road networks and associated problems in an effective and sustainable way.
