The Systems of Computer Mathematics in the Cloud-Based Learning Environment of Educational Institutions

The article highlights the promising ways of providing access to the mathematical software in higher educational institutions. It is emphasized that the cloud computing services implementation is the actual trend of modern ICT pedagogical systems development. The analysis and evaluation of existing ex-perience and educational research of different types of mathematical software packages use are proposed. The methodological guidance on the organization of the cloud-based learning environment in higher educational institutions using the systems of computer mathematics (SCM) is outlined. The advantages and disadvantages of different cloud service models of access to SCM are de-scribed. The cloud-based learning component with the use of Maxima system is described and evaluated.
