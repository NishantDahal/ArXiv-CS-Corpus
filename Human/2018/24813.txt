Rate-Adaptive Neural Networks for Spatial Multiplexers

In resource-constrained environments, one can employ spatial multiplexing cameras to acquire a small number of measurements of a scene, and perform effective reconstruction or high-level inference using purely data-driven neural networks. However, once trained, the measurement matrix and the network are valid only for a single measurement rate (MR) chosen at training time. To overcome this drawback, we answer the following question: How can we jointly design the measurement operator and the reconstruction/inference network so that the system can operate over a \textit{range} of MRs? To this end, we present a novel training algorithm, for learning \textbf{\textit{rate-adaptive}} networks. Using standard datasets, we demonstrate that, when tested over a range of MRs, a rate-adaptive network can provide high quality reconstruction over a the entire range, resulting in up to about 15 dB improvement over previous methods, where the network is valid for only one MR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for sample-efficient object tracking where video frames are acquired at dynamically varying MRs. We also extend this algorithm to learn the measurement operator in conjunction with image recognition networks. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm the applicability of our algorithm to different tasks.
