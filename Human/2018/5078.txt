Manufacturing processes hardware and software development to implement innovative technologies of aircraft manufacturing facilities management

The paper presents approaches to modern aircraft manufacturing facilities' competitiveness growth based on innovative technologies of management decisions implementation. The paper establishes a connection between the aircraft industry and the development of the national economy, along with the dependence of the Russian economy on international manufacturers of civil airplanes. Comparative statistics of civil aircrafts produced by Russian and international manufacturers are given. Comparative analysis of military and civil aviation is done.
