An Approximate Shading Model with Detail Decomposition for Object Relighting

We present an object relighting system that allows an artist to select an object from an image and insert it into a target scene. Through simple interactions, the system can adjust illumination on the inserted object so that it appears naturally in the scene. To support image-based relighting, we build object model from the image, and propose a \emph{perceptually-inspired} approximate shading model for the relighting. It decomposes the shading field into (a) a rough shape term that can be reshaded, (b) a parametric shading detail that encodes missing features from the first term, and (c) a geometric detail term that captures fine-scale material properties. With this decomposition, the shading model combines 3D rendering and image-based composition and allows more flexible compositing than image-based methods. Quantitative evaluation and a set of user studies suggest our method is a promising alternative to existing methods of object insertion.
