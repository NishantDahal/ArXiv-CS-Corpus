Parallel Enumeration of Triangulations

We report on the implementation of an algorithm for computing the set of all regular triangulations of finitely many points in Euclidean space. This algorithm, which we call down-flip reverse search, can be restricted, e.g., to computing full triangulations only; this case is particularly relevant for tropical geometry. Most importantly, down-flip reverse search allows for massive parallelization, i.e., it scales well even for many cores. Our implementation allows to compute the triangulations of much larger point sets than before.
