AccaSim: a Customizable Workload Management Simulator for Job Dispatching Research in HPC Systems

We present AccaSim, a simulator for workload management in HPC systems. Thanks to AccaSim's scalability to large workload datasets, support for easy customization, and practical automated tools to aid experimentation, users can easily represent various real HPC systems, develop novel advanced dispatchers and evaluate them in a convenient way across different workload sources. AccaSim is thus an attractive tool for conducting job dispatching research in HPC systems.
