Graphlets versus node2vec and struc2vec in the task of network alignment

Network embedding aims to represent each node in a network as a low-dimensional feature vector that summarizes the given node's (extended) network neighborhood. The nodes' feature vectors can then be used in various downstream machine learning tasks. Recently, many embedding methods that automatically learn the features of nodes have emerged, such as node2vec and struc2vec, which have been used in tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering, mainly in the social network domain. There are also other embedding methods that explicitly look at the connections between nodes, i.e., the nodes' network neighborhoods, such as graphlets. Graphlets have been used in many tasks such as network comparison, link prediction, and network clustering, mainly in the computational biology domain. Even though the two types of embedding methods (node2vec/struct2vec versus graphlets) have a similar goal -- to represent nodes as features vectors, no comparisons have been made between them, possibly because they have originated in the different domains. Therefore, in this study, we compare graphlets to node2vec and struc2vec, and we do so in the task of network alignment. In evaluations on synthetic and real-world biological networks, we find that graphlets are both more accurate and faster than node2vec and struc2vec.
