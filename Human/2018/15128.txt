Neuromorphic Time-Dependent Pattern Classification with Organic Electrochemical Transistor Arrays

Based on bottom-up assembly of highly variable neural cells units, the nervous system can reach unequalled level of performances with respect to standard materials and devices used in microelectronic. Reproducing these basic concepts in hardware could potentially revolutionize materials and device engineering which are used for information processing. Here, we present an innovative approach that relies on both iono-electronic materials and intrinsic device physics to show pattern classification out of a 12-unit bio-sensing array. We use the reservoir computing and learning concept to demonstrate relevant computing based on the ionic dynamics in 400-nm channel-length organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). We show that this approach copes efficiently with the high level of variability obtained by bottom-up fabrication using a new electropolymerizable polymer, which enables iono-electronic device functionality and material stability in the electrolyte. We investigate the effect of the array size and variability on the performances for a real-time classification task paving the way to new embedded sensing and processing approaches.
