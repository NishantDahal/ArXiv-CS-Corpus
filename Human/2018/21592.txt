Statistics of the Eigenvalues of a Noisy Multi-Soliton Pulse

For Nonlinear-Frequency Division-Multiplexed (NFDM) systems, the statistics of the received nonlinear spectrum in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is an open problem. We present a novel method, based on the Fourier collocation algorithm, to compute these statistics.
