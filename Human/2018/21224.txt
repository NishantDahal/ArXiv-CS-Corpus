Complete Test Sets And Their Approximations

We use testing to check if a combinational circuit $N$ always evaluates to 0 (written as $N \equiv 0$). We call a set of tests proving $N \equiv 0$ a complete test set (CTS). The conventional point of view is that to prove $N \equiv 0$ one has to generate a trivial CTS. It consists of all $2^{|X|}$ input assignments where $X$ is the set of input variables of $N$. We use the notion of a Stable Set of Assignments (SSA) to show that one can build a non-trivial CTS consisting of less than $2^{|X|}$ tests. Given an unsatisfiable CNF formula $H(W)$, an SSA of $H$ is a set of assignments to $W$ that proves unsatisfiability of $H$. A trivial SSA is the set of all $2^{|W|}$ assignments to $W$. Importantly, real-life formulas can have non-trivial SSAs that are much smaller than $2^{|W|}$. In general, construction of even non-trivial CTSs is inefficient. We describe a much more efficient approach where tests are extracted from an SSA built for a `projection' of $N$ on a subset of variables of $N$. These tests can be viewed as an approximation of a CTS for $N$. We give experimental results and describe potential applications of this approach.
