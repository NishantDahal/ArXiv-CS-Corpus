Understanding Latent Factors Using a GWAP

Recommender systems relying on latent factor models often appear as black boxes to their users. Semantic descriptions for the factors might help to mitigate this problem. Achieving this automatically is, however, a non-straightforward task due to the models' statistical nature. We present an output-agreement game that represents factors by means of sample items and motivates players to create such descriptions. A user study shows that the collected output actually reflects real-world characteristics of the factors.
