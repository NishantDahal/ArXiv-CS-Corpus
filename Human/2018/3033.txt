Experimental Demonstration of DDoS Mitigation over a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Network Using Software Defined Networking (SDN)

We experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, DDoS mitigation of QKD-based networks utilizing a software defined network application. Successful quantum-secured link allocation is achieved after a DDoS attack based on real-time monitoring of quantum parameters
