Mm-wave specific challenges in designing 5G transceiver architectures and air-interfaces

The mm-wave spectrum will be of significant importance to 5G mobile systems. There are multiple challenges in designing transceiver architectures and air interfaces in this spectrum. This paper is an attempt to explain some of these challenges and their interactions as means of enabling robust system design in near future.
