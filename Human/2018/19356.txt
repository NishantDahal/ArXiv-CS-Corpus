Provably Secure Integration Cryptosystem on Non-Commutative Group

Braid group is a very important non-commutative group. It is also an important tool of quantum field theory, and has good topological properties. This paper focuses on the provable security research of cryptosystem over braid group, which consists of two aspects: One, we proved that the Ko's cryptosystem based on braid group is secure against chosen-plaintext-attack(CPA) which proposed in CRYPTO2000, while it dose not resist active attack. The other is to propose a new public key cryptosystem over braid group which is secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext-attack(CCA2). Our proofs are based on random oracle models, under the computational conjugacy search assumption( the CCS assumption ). This kind of results have never been seen before.
