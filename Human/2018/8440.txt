Distribution-based Prediction of the Degree of Grammaticalization for German Prepositions

We test the hypothesis that the degree of grammaticalization of German prepositions correlates with their corpus-based contextual dispersion measured by word entropy. We find that there is indeed a moderate correlation for entropy, but a stronger correlation for frequency and number of context types.
