Implications of Integrated CPU-GPU Processors on Thermal and Power Management Techniques

Heterogeneous processors with architecturally different cores (CPU and GPU) integrated on the same die lead to new challenges and opportunities for thermal and power management techniques because of shared thermal/power budgets between these cores. In this paper, we show that new parallel programming paradigms (e.g., OpenCL) for CPU-GPU processors create a tighter coupling between the workload, the thermal/power management unit and the operating system. Using detailed thermal and power maps of the die from infrared imaging, we demonstrate that in contrast to traditional multi-core CPUs, heterogeneous processors exhibit higher coupled behavior for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and workload scheduling, in terms of their effect on performance, power, and temperature. Further, we show that by taking the differences in core architectures and relative proximity of different computing cores on the die into consideration, better scheduling schemes could be implemented to reduce both the power density and peak temperature of the die. The findings presented in the paper can be used to improve thermal and power efficiency of heterogeneous CPU-GPU processors.
