CNNs-based Acoustic Scene Classification using Multi-Spectrogram Fusion and Label Expansions

Spectrograms have been widely used in Convolutional Neural Networks based schemes for acoustic scene classification, such as the STFT spectrogram and the MFCC spectrogram, etc. They have different time-frequency characteristics, contributing to their own advantages and disadvantages in recognizing acoustic scenes. In this letter, a novel multi-spectrogram fusion framework is proposed, making the spectrograms complement each other. In the framework, a single CNN architecture is applied onto multiple spectrograms for feature extraction. The deep features extracted from multiple spectrograms are then fused to discriminate the acoustic scenes. Moreover, motivated by the inter-class similarities in acoustic scene datasets, a label expansion method is further proposed in which super-class labels are constructed upon the original classes. On the help of the expanded labels, the CNN models are transformed into the multitask learning form to improve the acoustic scene classification by appending the auxiliary task of super-class classification. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, intensive experiments have been performed on the DCASE2017 and the LITIS Rouen datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve promising accuracies on both datasets. Specifically, accuracies of 0.9744, 0.8865 and 0.7778 are obtained for the LITIS Rouen dataset, the DCASE Development set and Evaluation set respectively.
