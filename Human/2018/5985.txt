A New Simulation Algorithm for Absorbing Receiver in Molecular Communication

The simulation of diffusion-based molecular communication systems with absorbing receivers often requires a high computational complexity to produce accurate results. In this work, a new a priori Monte Carlo (APMC) algorithm is proposed to precisely simulate the molecules absorbed at a spherical receiver when the simulation time step length is relatively large. This algorithm addresses the limitations of the current refined Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm, since the RMC algorithm provides accurate simulation only for a relatively small time step length. The APMC algorithm is demonstrated to achieve a higher simulation efficiency than the existing algorithms by finding that the APMC algorithm, for a relatively large time step length, absorbs the fraction of molecules expected by analysis, while other algorithms do not.
