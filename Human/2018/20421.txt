Counting Independent Sets in Cocomparability Graphs

We show that the number of independent sets in cocomparability graphs can be counted in linear time, as can counting cliques in comparability graphs. By contrast, counting cliques in cocomparabilty graphs and counting independent sets in comparability graphs are #P-complete. We extend these results to counting maximal cliques and independent sets. We also consider the fixed-parameter versions of counting cliques and independent sets of given size $k$. Finally, we combine the results to show that both counting cliques and independent sets in permutation graphs are in linear time.
