The temporal logic of two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with slower-than-light accessibility is decidable

We work primarily with the Kripke frame consisting of two-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with the irreflexive accessibility relation 'can reach with a slower-than-light signal'. We show that in the basic temporal language, the set of validities over this frame is decidable. We then refine this to PSPACE-complete. In both cases the same result for the corresponding reflexive frame follows immediately. With a little more work we obtain PSPACE-completeness for the validities of the Halpern-Shoham logic of intervals on the real line with two different combinations of modalities.
