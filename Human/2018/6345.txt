Object cosegmentation using deep Siamese network

Object cosegmentation addresses the problem of discovering similar objects from multiple images and segmenting them as foreground simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline to segment the similar objects simultaneously from relevant set of images using supervised learning via deep-learning framework. We experiment with multiple set of object proposal generation techniques and perform extensive numerical evaluations by training the Siamese network with generated object proposals. Similar objects proposals for the test images are retrieved using the ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) library and deep semantic segmentation is performed on them. Finally, we form a collage from the segmented similar objects based on the relative importance of the objects.
