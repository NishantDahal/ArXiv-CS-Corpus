On a metric generalization of the $tt$-degrees and effective dimension theory

In this article, we study an analogue of $tt$-reducibility for points in computable metric spaces. We characterize the notion of the metric $tt$-degree in the context of first-level Borel isomorphism. Then, we study this concept from the perspectives of effective topological dimension theory and of effective fractal dimension theory.
