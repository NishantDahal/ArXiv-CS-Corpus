Plane-Casting: 3D Cursor Control with a SmartPhone

We present Plane-Casting, a novel technique for 3D object manipulation from a distance that is especially suitable for smartphones. We describe two variations of Plane-Casting, Pivot and Free Plane-Casting, and present results from a pilot study. Results suggest that Pivot Plane-Casting is more suitable for quick, coarse movements whereas Free Plane-Casting is more suited to slower, precise motion. In a 3D movement task, Pivot Plane-Casting performed better quantitatively, but subjects preferred Free Plane-Casting overall.
