Over-the-Air Implementation of Uplink NOMA

Though the concept of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) was proposed several years ago, the performance of uplink NOMA has only been verified in theory, but not in practice. This paper presents an over-the-air implementation of a uplink NOMA system, while providing solutions to most common practical problems, i.e., carrier frequency offset (CFO) synchronization, time synchronization, and channel estimation. The implemented CFO synchronization method adopts the primary synchronization signal (PSS) of LTE. Also, we design a novel preamble for each uplink user, and it is appended to every frame before it is transmitted through the air. This preamble will be used for time synchronization and channel estimation at the BS. Also, a low-complexity, iterative linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector has been implemented for multi-user decoding. The paper also validates the proposed architecture numerically, as well as experimentally.
