Study of Automatic GPU Offloading Technology for Open IoT

IoT technologies have been progressed. Now Open IoT concept has attracted attentions which achieve various IoT services by integrating horizontal separated devices and services. For Open IoT era, we have proposed the Tacit Computing technology to discover the devices with necessary data for users on demand and use them dynamically. However, existing Tacit Computing does not care about performance and operation cost. Therefore in this paper, we propose an automatic GPU offloading technology as an elementary technology of Tacit Computing which uses Genetic Algorithm to extract appropriate offload loop statements to improve performances. We evaluate a C/C++ matrix manipulation to verify effectiveness of GPU offloading and confirm more than 35 times performances within 1 hour tuning time.
