Zampa's systems theory: a comprehensive theory of measurement in dynamic systems

The article outlines in memoriam Prof. Pavel Zampa's concepts of system theory which enable to devise a measurement in dynamic systems independently of the particular system behaviour. From the point of view of Zampa's theory, terms like system time, system attributes, system link, system element, input, output, subsystems, and state variables are defined. In Conclusions, Zampa's theory is discussed together with another mathematical approaches of qualitative dynamics known since the 19th century. In Appendices, we present applications of Zampa's technical approach to measurement of complex dynamical (chemical and biological) systems at the Institute of Complex Systems, University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice.
