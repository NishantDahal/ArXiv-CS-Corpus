How to generate all possible rational Wilf-Zeilberger pairs?

A Wilf--Zeilberger pair $(F, G)$ in the discrete case satisfies the equation $ F(n+1, k) - F(n, k) = G(n, k+1) - G(n, k)$. We present a structural description of all possible rational Wilf--Zeilberger pairs and their continuous and mixed analogues.
