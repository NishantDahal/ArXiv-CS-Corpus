Space-Time Block Coding Based Beamforming for Beam Squint Compensation

In this paper, the beam squint problem, which causes significant variations in radiated beam gain over frequencies in millimeter wave communication system, is investigated. A constant modulus beamformer design, which is formulated to maximize the expected average beam gain within the bandwidth with limited variation over frequencies within the bandwidth, is proposed. A semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method is developed to solve the optimization problem under the constant modulus constraints. Depending on the eigenvalues of the optimal solution, either direct beamforming or transmit diversity based beamforming is employed for data transmissions. Through numerical results, the proposed transmission scheme can compensate for beam squint effectively and improve system throughput. Overall, a transmission scheme for beam squint compensation in wideband wireless communication systems is provided.
