Performance of Turbo Coded OFDM Under the Presence of Various Noise Types

A telecommunication system uses carriers in order to transmit information through a cable or wirelessly. If each time only one carrier is transmitted, then the system s signal will not be immune to frequency selective fading. If frequency selective fading includes the working frequency of the system, then the wireless link will not be established. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM is the primary solution for coping with inter signal interference and frequency selective fading. Many carriers can be produced by splitting a fast information stream to slower data series. Different orthogonal frequencies carry slower data series. System s performance can be further enhanced with the utilization of turbo codes. Turbo codes make the system more immune to noise effects with excellent BER results. This paper presents the thorough analysis of a turbo coded OFDM scheme using a PCCC technique in the presence of a channel which includes AWGN, phase noise, Rayleigh fading, Rician fading and Doppler shift.
