The cloud technologies of learning: origin

The research goal is to investigate the evolution of the concept of utility computing in the works of foreign researchers in the years 1959-1966. First the A. O. Mann's results and expanded overview of the D. F. Parkhill's results on the concept of computer (information) utility were introduced in the domestic scientific circulation. Functionally identity of the computer utility and cloud computing concepts was proved, as well as refined the primary sources of cloud service models. There was proposed the interpretation of the "cloud technologies of learning" concept. Continuity of the development of cloud technologies over the past 55 years and their relationship with the development of ICT in general was concluded. The research results make it possible to determine the prospects of the development of cloud computing in general and cloud technologies of learning in particular.
