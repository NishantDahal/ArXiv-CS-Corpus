Deep learning for word-level handwritten Indic script identification

We propose a novel method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction. Not just limited to conventional spatial domain representation, we use multilevel 2D discrete Haar wavelet transform, where image representations are scaled to a variety of different sizes. These are then used to train different CNNs to select features. To be precise, we use 10 different CNNs that select a set of 10240 features, i.e. 1024/CNN. With this, 11 different handwritten scripts are identified, where 1K words per script are used. In our test, we have achieved the maximum script identification rate of 94.73% using multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Our results outperform the state-of-the-art techniques.
