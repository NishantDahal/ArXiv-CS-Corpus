On completely regular codes of covering radius 1 in the halved hypercubes

We consider constructions of covering-radius-1 completely regular codes, or, equivalently, equitable 2-partitions (regular 2-partitions, perfect 2-colorings), of halved n-cubes. Keywords: completely regular code, equitable partition, regular partition, partition design, perfect coloring, halved hypercube.
