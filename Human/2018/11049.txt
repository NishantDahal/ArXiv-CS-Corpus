Evaluating Non-Motorized Transport Popularity of Urban Roads by Sports GPS Tracks

Non-motorized transport is becoming increasingly important in urban development of cities in China. How to evaluate the non-motorized transport popularity of urban roads is an interesting question to study. The great amount of tracking data generated by smart mobile devices give us opportunities to solve this problem. This study aims to provide a data driven method for evaluating the popularity (walkability and bikeability) of urban non-motorized transport system. This paper defines a p-index to evaluate the popular degree of road segments which is based on the cycling, running, and walking GPS track data from outdoor activities logging applications. According to the p-index definition, this paper evaluates the non-motorized transport popularity of urban area in Wuhan city within different temporal periods.
