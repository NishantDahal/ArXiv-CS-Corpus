Fast Channel Estimation for Millimetre Wave Wireless Systems Using Overlapped Beam Patterns

This paper is concerned with the channel estimation problem in millimetre wave (MMW) wireless systems with large antenna arrays. By exploiting the sparse nature of the MMW channel, we present an efficient estimation algorithm based on a novel overlapped beam pattern design. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed and an upper bound on the probability of channel estimation failure is derived. Results show that the algorithm can significantly reduce the number of required measurements in channel estimation (e.g., by 225% when a single overlap is used) when compared to the existing channel estimation algorithm based on non-overlapped beam patterns.
