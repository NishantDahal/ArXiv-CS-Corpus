Recognizing Birds from Sound - The 2018 BirdCLEF Baseline System

Reliable identification of bird species in recorded audio files would be a transformative tool for researchers, conservation biologists, and birders. In recent years, artificial neural networks have greatly improved the detection quality of machine learning systems for bird species recognition. We present a baseline system using convolutional neural networks. We publish our code base as reference for participants in the 2018 LifeCLEF bird identification task and discuss our experiments and potential improvements.
