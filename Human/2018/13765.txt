A method for obtaining Fibonacci identities

For the Lucas sequence $\{U_{k}(P,Q)\}$ we discuss the identities such as the well-known Fibonacci identities. We also propose a method for obtaining identities involving recurrence sequences. With the help of which we find an interpolating type identity for second order linear recurrences.
