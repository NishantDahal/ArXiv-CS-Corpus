Winograd Schema - Knowledge Extraction Using Narrative Chains

The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) is a test of machine intelligence, designed to be an improvement on the Turing test. A Winograd Schema consists of a sentence and a corresponding question. To successfully answer these questions, one requires the use of commonsense knowledge and reasoning. This work focuses on extracting common sense knowledge which can be used to generate answers for the Winograd schema challenge. Common sense knowledge is extracted based on events (or actions) and their participants; called Event-Based Conditional Commonsense (ECC). I propose an approach using Narrative Event Chains [Chambers et al., 2008] to extract ECC knowledge. These are stored in templates, to be later used for answering the WSC questions. This approach works well with respect to a subset of WSC tasks.
