On the Verification of Logically Decorated Graph Transformations

We address the problem of reasoning on graph transformations featuring actions such as \emph{addition} and \emph{deletion} of nodes and edges, node \emph{merging} and \emph{cloning}, node or edge \emph{labelling} and edge \emph{redirection}. First, we introduce the considered graph rewrite systems which are parameterized by a given logic $\mathcal{L}$. Formulas of $\mathcal{L}$ are used to label graph nodes and edges. In a second step, we tackle the problem of formal verification of the considered rewrite systems by using a Hoare-like weakest precondition calculus. It acts on triples of the form $\{\texttt{Pre}\}(\texttt{R},\texttt{strategy}) \{\texttt{Post}\}$ where \texttt{Pre} and \texttt{Post} are conditions specified in the given logic $\mathcal{L}$, \texttt{R} is a graph rewrite system and \texttt{strategy} is an expression stating how rules in \texttt{R} are to be performed. We prove that the calculus we introduce is sound. Moreover, we show how the proposed framework can be instantiated successfully with different logics. We investigate first-order logic and several of its decidable fragments with a particular focus on different dialects of description logic (DL). We also show, by using bisimulation relations, that some DL fragments cannot be used due to their lack of expressive power.
