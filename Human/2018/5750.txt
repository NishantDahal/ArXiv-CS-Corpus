Research on Cross-platform Measurement method of online Advertising

There are a large number of competing ADXs on the Internet. It is the primary demand to identify and compare the advertising performance of ADX. Traditional method relies on training artificial online personas to represent behavioral traits. Then it uncovers existing correlation between users each exhibiting a certain behavioral trait and the display ads shown to them. This approach only measures and evaluates the performance of a single ADX. Due to without common measurement basis, this method does not able to apply to the comparative study of the performance of multiple ADXs. Therefore, in this tech report, a synchronous cross-platform measurement method is proposed and implemented. This method can realize the comparison of the performance of different ADXs, and help advertisers select the appropriate ADX.
