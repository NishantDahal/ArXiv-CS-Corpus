Evaluation of a congruent auditory feedback for Motor Imagery BCI

Designing a feedback that helps participants to achieve higher performances is an important concern in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. In a pilot study, we demonstrate how a congruent auditory feedback could improve classification in a electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery BCI. This is a promising result for creating alternate feedback modality.
