High-Dimensional Vector Semantics

In this paper we explore the "vector semantics" problem from the perspective of "almost orthogonal" property of high-dimensional random vectors. We show that this intriguing property can be used to "memorize" random vectors by simply adding them, and we provide an efficient probabilistic solution to the set membership problem. Also, we discuss several applications to word context vector embeddings, document sentences similarity, and spam filtering.
