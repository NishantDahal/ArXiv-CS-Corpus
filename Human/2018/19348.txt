Quantitative Phase Imaging and Artificial Intelligence: A Review

Recent advances in quantitative phase imaging (QPI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up the possibility of an exciting frontier. The fast and label-free nature of QPI enables the rapid generation of large-scale and uniform-quality imaging data in two, three, and four dimensions. Subsequently, the AI-assisted interrogation of QPI data using data-driven machine learning techniques results in a variety of biomedical applications. Also, machine learning enhances QPI itself. Herein, we review the synergy between QPI and machine learning with a particular focus on deep learning. Further, we provide practical guidelines and perspectives for further development.
