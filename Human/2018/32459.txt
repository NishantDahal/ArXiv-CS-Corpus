The CodRep Machine Learning on Source Code Competition

CodRep is a machine learning competition on source code data. It is carefully designed so that anybody can enter the competition, whether professional researchers, students or independent scholars, without specific knowledge in machine learning or program analysis. In particular, it aims at being a common playground on which the machine learning and the software engineering research communities can interact. The competition has started on April 14th 2018 and has ended on October 14th 2018. The CodRep data is hosted at https://github.com/KTH/CodRep-competition/.
