Uplink and Downlink Transceiver Design for OFDM with Index Modulation in Multi-user Networks

A new modulation scheme called OFDM with index modulation (OFDM-IM) is introduced recently. This scheme allows to transmit additional bits by mapping a part of incoming bit stream to the indices of the subcarriers. In this work, performance of OFDM-IM in multi-user networks for uplink and downlink scenario is studied. For both scenarios, novel base station designs are introduced in order to overcome the inter-user-interference (IUI). Simulation results show that OFDM-IM outperforms the classical OFDM in multi-user networks and IUI is eliminated successfully even in large networks.
