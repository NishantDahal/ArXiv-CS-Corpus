Block Error Rate and UE Throughput Performance Evaluation using LLS and SLS in 3GPP LTE Downlink

This paper provides a link and system level study of the downlink using OFDMA techniques based on LTE systems. At the link level, the Block Error Rate (BLER) performance curves are generated and 10 % points of BLER curves, calculated under SISO AWGN channel, are considered as reference to generate the SNR-to-CQI mapping. These mapping results are used in system level simulator (SLS) via MIESM link to system interface. Then the UE throughput is evaluated by considering proportional fair (PF), round robin (RR), and best CQI schedulers at different values of UE throughput CDF. In this paper we analyze that the PF scheduler outperforms other schedulers in fairness and average throughput, while the best CQI scheduler performs good under high SINR region. The RR is the best choice when resource allocation is to be done without considering any kind of channel condition.
