Quantum Büchi Automata

This paper defines a notion of quantum Büchi automaton (QBA for short) with two different acceptance conditions for ω-words: non-disturbing and disturbing. Several pumping lemmas are established for QBAs. The relationship between the ω-languages accepted by QBAs and those accepted by classical Büchi automata are clarified with the help of the pumping lemmas. The closure properties of the languages accepted by QBAs are studied in the probable, almost sure and threshold semantics. The decidability of the emptiness problem for the languages accepted by QBAs is proved using the Tarski-Seidenberg elimination.
