Digitalized Responsive Logical Interface Application

The quest for proper protection of data in the ERU and its accessibility led to the design of a Digitalized Responsive Logical Interface Application (DRLIA) with an embedded feature such as keeping ERU data safer and accessible at any given point. The system works in three modules [i] Password/Staff number Synchronization, [ii] Encryption (token) Synchronization and [iii] i and ii synchronisations. This method help prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the stored data, it also has the capability of recording time the authorised user gained access to the system in case of system theft. It has the ability to render the data unreachable, thereby making it not useful. Keywords
