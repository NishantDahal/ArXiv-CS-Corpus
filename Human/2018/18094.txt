Using statistical encoding to achieve tree succinctness never seen before

We propose a new succinct representation of labeled trees which represents a tree T using |T|H_k(T) number of bits (plus some smaller order terms), where |T|H_k(T) denotes the k-th order (tree label) entropy, as defined by Ferragina at al. 2005. Our representation employs a new, simple method of partitioning the tree, which preserves both tree shape and node degrees. Previously, the only representation that used |T|H_k(T) bits was based on XBWT, a transformation that linearizes tree labels into a single string, combined with compression boosting. The proposed representation is much simpler than the one based on XBWT, which used additional linear space (bounded by 0.01n) hidden in the "smaller order terms" notion, as an artifact of using zeroth order entropy coder; our representation uses sublinear additional space (for reasonable values of k and size of the label alphabet σ). The proposed representation can be naturally extended to a succinct data structure for trees, which uses |T|H_k(T) plus additional O(|T|k log_σ/ log_σ |T| + |T| log log_σ |T|/ log_σ |T|) bits and supports all the usual navigational queries in constant time. At the cost of increasing the query time to O(log log |T|/ log |T|) we can further reduce the space redundancy to O(|T| log log |T|/ log_σ |T|) bits, assuming k <= log_σ |T|. This is a major improvement over representation based on XBWT: even though XBWT-based representation uses |T|H_k(T) bits, the space needed for structure supporting navigational queries is much larger: (...)
