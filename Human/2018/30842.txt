Physical Signal Classification Via Deep Neural Networks

A Deep Neural Network is applied to classify physical signatures obtained from physical sensor measurements of running gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles and other devices. The classification provides information on the target identities as to vehicle type and even vehicle model. The physical measurements include acoustic, acceleration (vibration), geophonic, and magnetic.
