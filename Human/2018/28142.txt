Managing Smartphones Signalling Load in UMTS Networks: A Practical Analysis

Smartphone users and application behaviors add high pressure to apply smart techniques that stabilize the network capacity and consequently improve the end-user experience. The massive increase in smartphone penetration engenders signalling load, which exceeds the network capacity in terms of signaling. The signalling load leads to network congestion, degradation in the network KPIs. The classical way to tackle the signalling is by network expansion. However, this approach is not efficient in terms of capital expenditure (CAPEX) and also in terms of efficient utilization of the network resources. More specifically, the signaling domain becomes overloaded while the data domain are underutilized. In this paper, two UMTS air-interface features; Cell-PCH (paging channel) and enhanced fast dormancy (E-FD) are analyzed to mitigate the signalling load. Practical performance analysis is conducted based on results from commercial UMTS networks. The deployment of these features offers major improvement in network KPIs and significant relief in the signaling load. It is concluded that these two features in addition to several optimization techniques, discussed in this paper, provide solution to the smartphone signaling load and efficiently utilize the available network and spectrum resources while providing users with better always-on connectivity and improved battery consumption.
