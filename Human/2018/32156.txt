LeukoNet: DCT-based CNN architecture for the classification of normal versus Leukemic blasts in B-ALL Cancer

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) constitutes approximately 25% of the pediatric cancers. In general, the task of identifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells under the microscope is challenging because morphologically the images of the two cells appear similar. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for classifying immature leukemic blasts and normal cells. The proposed model combines the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain features extracted via CNN with the Optical Density (OD) space features to build a robust classifier. Elaborate experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed LeukoNet classifier.
