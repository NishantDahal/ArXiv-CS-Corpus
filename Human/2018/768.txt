Coexistence of 5G mmWave Users with Incumbent Fixed Stations over 70 and 80 GHz

Millimeter wave spectrum access over the 70GHz and 80GHz is central to unlocking gigabit connectivity and meeting the explosive growth of mobile traffic. A pressing question, however, is whether fifth-generation (5G) systems can harmoniously coexist with the incumbents of these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). To this end, we thoroughly analyze the impact of 5G coexistence on FSs. Specifically, we first analyze the geometry of existing FSs' deployment using actual databases of these stations. Then, we present a case study on the interference generated from users towards FSs in two populated areas in Chicago, where we use actual building databases to accurately compute the aggregate interference. The analysis and simulation results reveal that the deployment strategy of FSs and the high attenuation losses at 70/80GHz significantly limit the 5G interference, with the majority of FSs experiencing interference levels well below the noise floor.
