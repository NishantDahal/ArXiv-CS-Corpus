Fisher Information and Natural Gradient Learning of Random Deep Networks

A deep neural network is a hierarchical nonlinear model transforming input signals to output signals. Its input-output relation is considered to be stochastic, being described for a given input by a parameterized conditional probability distribution of outputs. The space of parameters consisting of weights and biases is a Riemannian manifold, where the metric is defined by the Fisher information matrix. The natural gradient method uses the steepest descent direction in a Riemannian manifold, so it is effective in learning, avoiding plateaus. It requires inversion of the Fisher information matrix, however, which is practically impossible when the matrix has a huge number of dimensions. Many methods for approximating the natural gradient have therefore been introduced. The present paper uses statistical neurodynamical method to reveal the properties of the Fisher information matrix in a net of random connections under the mean field approximation. We prove that the Fisher information matrix is unit-wise block diagonal supplemented by small order terms of off-block-diagonal elements, which provides a justification for the quasi-diagonal natural gradient method by Y. Ollivier. A unitwise block-diagonal Fisher metrix reduces to the tensor product of the Fisher information matrices of single units. We further prove that the Fisher information matrix of a single unit has a simple reduced form, a sum of a diagonal matrix and a rank 2 matrix of weight-bias correlations. We obtain the inverse of Fisher information explicitly. We then have an explicit form of the natural gradient, without relying on the numerical matrix inversion, which drastically speeds up stochastic gradient learning.
