Merging and Evolution: Improving Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Applications

Compact neural networks are inclined to exploit "sparsely-connected" convolutions such as depthwise convolution and group convolution for employment in mobile applications. Compared with standard "fully-connected" convolutions, these convolutions are more computationally economical. However, "sparsely-connected" convolutions block the inter-group information exchange, which induces severe performance degradation. To address this issue, we present two novel operations named merging and evolution to leverage the inter-group information. Our key idea is encoding the inter-group information with a narrow feature map, then combining the generated features with the original network for better representation. Taking advantage of the proposed operations, we then introduce the Merging-and-Evolution (ME) module, an architectural unit specifically designed for compact networks. Finally, we propose a family of compact neural networks called MENet based on ME modules. Extensive experiments on ILSVRC 2012 dataset and PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset demonstrate that MENet consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art compact networks under different computational budgets. For instance, under the computational budget of 140 MFLOPs, MENet surpasses ShuffleNet by 1% and MobileNet by 1.95% on ILSVRC 2012 top-1 accuracy, while by 2.3% and 4.1% on PASCAL VOC 2007 mAP, respectively.
