Wireless Map-Reduce Distributed Computing with Full-Duplex Radios and Imperfect CSI

Consider a distributed computing system in which the worker nodes are connected over a shared wireless channel. Nodes can store a fraction of the data set over which computation needs to be carried out, and a Map-Shuffle-Reduce protocol is followed in order to enable collaborative processing. If there is exists some level of redundancy among the computations performed at the nodes, the inter-node communication load during the Shuffle phase can be reduced by using either coded multicasting or cooperative transmission. It was previously shown that the latter approach is able to reduce the high-Signal-to-Noise Ratio communication load by half in the presence of full-duplex nodes and perfect transmit-side Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, a novel scheme based on superposition coding is proposed that is demonstrated to outperform both coded multicasting and cooperative transmission under the assumption of imperfect CSI.
