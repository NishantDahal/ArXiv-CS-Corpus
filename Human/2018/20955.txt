Millimeter-wave Extended NYUSIM Channel Model for Spatial Consistency

Commonly used drop-based channel models cannot satisfy the requirements of spatial consistency for millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel modeling where transient motion or closely-spaced users need to be considered. A channel model having \textit{spatial consistency} can capture the smooth variations of channels, when a user moves, or when multiple users are close to each other in a local area within, say, 10 m in an outdoor scenario. Spatial consistency is needed to support the testing of beamforming and beam tracking for massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user MIMO in fifth-generation (5G) mmWave mobile networks. This paper presents a channel model extension and an associated implementation of spatial consistency in the NYUSIM channel simulation platform. Along with a mathematical model, we use measurements where the user moved along a street and turned at a corner over a path length of 75 m in order to derive realistic values of several key parameters such as correlation distance and the rate of cluster birth and death, that are shown to provide spatial consistency for NYUSIM in an urban microcell street canyon scenario.
