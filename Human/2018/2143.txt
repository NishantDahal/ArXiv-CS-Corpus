Walsh Sampling with Incomplete Noisy Signals

With the advent of massive data outputs at a regular rate, admittedly, signal processing technology plays an increasingly key role. Nowadays, signals are not merely restricted to physical sources, they have been extended to digital sources as well.
  Under the general assumption of discrete statistical signal sources, we propose a practical problem of sampling incomplete noisy signals for which we do not know a priori and the sampling size is bounded. We approach this sampling problem by Shannon's channel coding theorem. Our main results demonstrate that it is the large Walsh coefficient(s) that characterize(s) discrete statistical signals, regardless of the signal sources. By the connection of Shannon's theorem, we establish the necessary and sufficient condition for our generic sampling problem for the first time. Our generic sampling results find practical and powerful applications in not only statistical cryptanalysis, but software system performance optimization.
