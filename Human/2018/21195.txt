Syntree2Vec - An algorithm to augment syntactic hierarchy into word embeddings

Word embeddings aims to map sense of the words into a lower dimensional vector space in order to reason over them. Training embeddings on domain specific data helps express concepts more relevant to their use case but comes at a cost of accuracy when data is less. Our effort is to minimise this by infusing syntactic knowledge into the embeddings. We propose a graph based embedding algorithm inspired from node2vec. Experimental results have shown that our algorithm improves the syntactic strength and gives robust performance on meagre data.
