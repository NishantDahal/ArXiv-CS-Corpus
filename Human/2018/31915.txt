An Adaptive Pruning Algorithm for Spoofing Localisation Based on Tropical Geometry

The problem of spoofing attacks is increasingly relevant as digital systems are becoming more ubiquitous. Thus the detection of such attacks and the localisation of attackers have been objects of recent study. After an attack has been detected, various algorithms have been proposed in order to localise the attacker. In this work we propose a new adaptive pruning algorithm inspired by the tropical and geometrical analysis of the traditional Viterbi pruning algorithm to solve the localisation problem. In particular, the proposed algorithm tries to localise the attacker by adapting the leniency parameter based on estimates about the state of the solution space. These estimates stem from the enclosed volume and the entropy of the solution space, as they were introduced in our previous works.
