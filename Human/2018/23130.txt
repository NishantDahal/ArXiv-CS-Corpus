The dangerous path towards your own cryptography method

Would you like to have your own cryptography method? Experts say you should not do it. If you think you can develop a better cryptography method anyway. We present a brief discussion about some well known cryptography methods and how our model fails against the traditional attacks. We do not want to discourage anybody, we just want to show that, despite of the importance of developing better cryptography models, it is a very hard task.
