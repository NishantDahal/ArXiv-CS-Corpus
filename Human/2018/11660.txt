Analysis of Noise in Current Mirrors with memristive Device

This work presents an analysis of noise in a cascode current mirror with CMOS-memristive device done by comparison with the basic current mirror. The analysis is completed based on THD for different frequency and channel length values by means of computer-aided design. AC and DC analyses are presented for both balanced and unbalanced current mirrors. While the change in the channel length has similar effect in both circuits, memristor in a circuit decreases noise significantly at high frequencies.
