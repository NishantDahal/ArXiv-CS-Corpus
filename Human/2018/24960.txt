Oblique Stripe Removal in Remote Sensing Images via Oriented Variation

Destriping is a classical problem in remote sensing image processing. Although considerable effort has been made to remove stripes, few of the existing methods can eliminate stripe noise with arbitrary orientations. This situation makes the removal of oblique stripes in the higher-level remote sensing products become an unfinished and urgent issue. To overcome the challenging problem, we propose a novel destriping model which is self-adjusted to different orientations of stripe noise. First of all, the oriented variation model is designed to accomplish the stripe orientation approximation. In this model, the stripe direction is automatically estimated and then imbedded into the constraint term to depict the along-stripe smoothness of the stripe component. Mainly based on the oriented variation model, a whole destriping framework is proposed by jointly employing an L1-norm constraint and a TV regularization to separately capture the global distribution property of stripe component and the piecewise smoothness of the clean image. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results of both orientation and destriping aspects confirm the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method.
