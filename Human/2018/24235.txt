Distinguished Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence Wireless Communication Systems

With the great success of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in pattern recognitions and signal processing, it is interesting to introduce AI technologies into wireless communication systems. Currently, most of studies are focused on applying AI technologies for solving old problems, e.g., wireless location accuracy and resource allocation optimization in wireless communication systems. However, It is important to distinguish new capabilities created by AI technologies and rethink wireless communication systems based on AI running schemes. Compared with conventional capabilities of wireless communication systems, three distinguished capabilities, i.e., the cognitive, learning and proactive capabilities are proposed for future AI wireless communication systems. Moreover, an intelligent vehicular communication system is configured to validate the cognitive capability based on AI clustering algorithm. Considering the revolutionary impact of AI technologies on the data, transmission and protocol architecture of wireless communication systems, the future challenges of AI wireless communication systems are analyzed. Driven by new distinguished capabilities of AI wireless communication systems, the new wireless communication theory and functions would indeed emerge in the next round of the wireless communications revolution.
