Learning Hybrid Sparsity Prior for Image Restoration: Where Deep Learning Meets Sparse Coding

State-of-the-art approaches toward image restoration can be classified into model-based and learning-based. The former - best represented by sparse coding techniques - strive to exploit intrinsic prior knowledge about the unknown high-resolution images; while the latter - popularized by recently developed deep learning techniques - leverage external image prior from some training dataset. It is natural to explore their middle ground and pursue a hybrid image prior capable of achieving the best in both worlds. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach of achieving this goal called Structured Analysis Sparse Coding (SASC). Specifically, a structured sparse prior is learned from extrinsic training data via a deep convolutional neural network (in a similar way to previous learning-based approaches); meantime another structured sparse prior is internally estimated from the input observation image (similar to previous model-based approaches). Two structured sparse priors will then be combined to produce a hybrid prior incorporating the knowledge from both domains. To manage the computational complexity, we have developed a novel framework of implementing hybrid structured sparse coding processes by deep convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid image restoration method performs comparably with and often better than the current state-of-the-art techniques.
