Recurrent Autoregressive Networks for Online Multi-Object Tracking

The main challenge of online multi-object tracking is to reliably associate object trajectories with detections in each video frame based on their tracking history. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Autoregressive Network (RAN), a temporal generative modeling framework to characterize the appearance and motion dynamics of multiple objects over time. The RAN couples an external memory and an internal memory. The external memory explicitly stores previous inputs of each trajectory in a time window, while the internal memory learns to summarize long-term tracking history and associate detections by processing the external memory. We conduct experiments on the MOT 2015 and 2016 datasets to demonstrate the robustness of our tracking method in highly crowded and occluded scenes. Our method achieves top-ranked results on the two benchmarks.
