Fully automatic structure from motion with a spline-based environment representation

While the common environment representation in structure from motion is given by a sparse point cloud, the community has also investigated the use of lines to better enforce the inherent regularities in man-made surroundings. Following the potential of this idea, the present paper introduces a more flexible higher-order extension of points that provides a general model for structural edges in the environment, no matter if straight or curved. Our model relies on linked BÃ©zier curves, the geometric intuition of which proves great benefits during parameter initialization and regularization. We present the first fully automatic pipeline that is able to generate spline-based representations without any human supervision. Besides a full graphical formulation of the problem, we introduce both geometric and photometric cues as well as higher-level concepts such overall curve visibility and viewing angle restrictions to automatically manage the correspondences in the graph. Results prove that curve-based structure from motion with splines is able to outperform state-of-the-art sparse feature-based methods, as well as to model curved edges in the environment.
