On a Theorem of Kyureghyan and Pott

In the paper of Gohar M. Kyureghyan and Alexander Pott (Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 29, 149-164, 2003), the linear feedback polynomials of the Sidel'nikov-Lempel-Cohn-Eastman sequences were determined for some special cases. When referring to that paper, we found that Corollary 4 and Theorem 2 of that paper are wrong because there exist many counterexamples for these two results. In this note, we give some counterexamples of Corollary 4 and Theorem 2 of that paper.
