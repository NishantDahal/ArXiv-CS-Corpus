Minimum weight codewords in dual Algebraic-Geometric codes from the Giulietti-Korchmáros curve

In this paper we investigate the number of minimum weight codewords of some dual Algebraic-Geometric codes associated with the Giulietti-Korchmáros maximal curve, by computing the maximal number of intersections between the Giulietti-Korchmáros curve and lines, plane conics and plane cubics.
