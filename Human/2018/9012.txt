Large Scale Low Power Computing System - Status of Network Design in ExaNeSt and EuroExa Projects

The deployment of the next generation computing platform at ExaFlops scale requires to solve new technological challenges mainly related to the impressive number (up to 10^6) of compute elements required. This impacts on system power consumption, in terms of feasibility and costs, and on system scalability and computing efficiency. In this perspective analysis, exploration and evaluation of technologies characterized by low power, high efficiency and high degree of customization is strongly needed. Among the various European initiative targeting the design of ExaFlops system, ExaNeSt and EuroExa are EU-H2020 funded initiatives leveraging on high end MPSoC FPGAs. Last generation MPSoC FPGAs can be seen as non-mainstream but powerful HPC Exascale enabling components thanks to the integration of embedded multi-core, ARM-based low power CPUs and a huge number of hardware resources usable to co-design application oriented accelerators and to develop a low latency high bandwidth network architecture. In this paper we introduce ExaNet the FPGA-based, scalable, direct network architecture of ExaNeSt system. ExaNet allow us to explore different interconnection topologies, to evaluate advanced routing functions for congestion control and fault tolerance and to design specific hardware components for acceleration of collective operations. After a brief introduction of the motivations and goals of ExaNeSt and EuroExa projects, we will report on the status of network architecture design and its hardware/software testbed adding preliminary bandwidth and latency achievements.
