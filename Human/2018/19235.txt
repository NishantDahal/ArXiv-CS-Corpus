Joint Failure Recovery, Fault Prevention, and Energy-efficient Resource Management for Real-time SFC in Fog-supported SDN

In this paper, we focus on the problems of traffic engineering, failure recovery, fault prevention, and Service Function Chain (SFC) with reliability and energy consumption constraints in Software Defined Networks (SDN). These types of deployments use Fog computing as an emerging paradigm to manage the distributed small-size traffic flows passing through the SDN-enabled switches (possibly Fog Nodes). The main aim of this integration is to support service delivery in real-time, failure recovery, and fault-awareness in an SFC context. Firstly, we present an architecture for Failure Recovery and Fault Prevention called FRFP; this is a multi-tier structure in which the real-time traffic flows pass through SDN-enabled switches to jointly decrease the network side-effects of flow rerouting and energy consumption of the Fog Nodes. We then mathematically formulate an optimization problem called the Optimal Fog-Supported Energy-Aware SFC rerouting algorithm (OFES) and propose a near-optimal heuristic called Heuristic OFES (HFES) to solve the corresponding problem in polynomial time. In this way, the energy consumption and the reliability of the selected paths are optimized, while the Quality of Service constraints are met and the network congestion is minimized. In a reliability context, the focus of this work is on fault prevention; however, since we use a reallocation technique, the proposed scheme can be used as a failure recovery scheme. We compare the performance of HFES and OFES in terms of power consumption, average path length, fault probability, network side-effects, link utilization, and Fog Node utilization. Additionally, we analyze the computational complexity of HFES. We use a real-world network topology to evaluate our algorithm. The simulation results show that the heuristic algorithm is applicable to large-scale networks.
