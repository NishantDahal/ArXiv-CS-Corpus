Ambient Assisted Living technologies from the perspectives of older people and professionals

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) and Ambient Intelligence technologies are providing support to older people in living an independent and confident life by developing innovative ICT-based products, services, and systems. Despite significant advancement in AAL technologies and smart systems, they have still not found the way into the nursing home of the older people. The reasons are manifold. On one hand, the development of such systems lack in addressing the requirements of the older people and caregivers of the organization and the other is the unwillingness of the older people to make use of assistive systems. A qualitative study was performed at a nursing home to understand the needs and requirements of the residents and caregivers and their perspectives about the existing AAL technologies.
