How could we ignore the lens and pupils of eyeballs: Metamaterial optics for retinal projection

Retinal projection is required for xR applications that can deliver immersive visual experience throughout the day. If general-purpose retinal projection methods can be realized at a low cost, not only could the image be displayed on the retina using less energy, but there is also the possibility of cutting off the weight of projection unit itself from the AR goggles. Several retinal projection methods have been previously proposed; however, as the lenses and iris of the eyeball are in front of the retina, which is a limitation of the eyeball, the proposal of retinal projection is generally fraught with narrow viewing angles and small eyebox problems. In this short technical report, we introduce ideas and samples of an optical system for solving the common problems of retinal projection by using the metamaterial mirror (plane symmetric transfer optical system). Using this projection method, the designing of retinal projection can becomes easy, and if appropriate optics are available, it would be possible to construct an optical system that allows the quick follow-up of retinal projection hardware.
