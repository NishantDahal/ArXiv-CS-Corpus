Non-Reciprocity Compensation Combined with Turbo Codes for Secret Key Generation in Vehicular Ad Hoc Social IoT Networks

The physical attributes of the dynamic vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) propagation channel can be utilised for the generation of highly random and symmetric cryptographic keys. However, in a physical-layer key agreement scheme, non-reciprocity due to inherent channel noise and hardware impairments can propagate bit disagreements. This has to be addressed prior to the symmetric key generation which is inherently important in social Internet of Things (IoT) networks, including in adversarial settings (e.g. battlefields). In this paper, we parametrically incorporate temporal variability attributes, such as three-dimensional (3D) scattering and scatterers mobility. Accordingly, this is the first work to incorporate such features into the key generation process by combining non-reciprocity compensation with turbo codes. Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement when using Turbo Codes in bit mismatch rate (BMR) and key generation rate (KGR) in comparison to sample indexing techniques.
