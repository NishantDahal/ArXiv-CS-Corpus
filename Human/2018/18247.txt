Maximizing Ergodic Throughput in Wireless Powered Communication Networks

This paper considers a single-antenna wirelesspowered communication network (WPCN) over a flat-fading channel. We show that, by using our probabilistic harvestand-transmit (PHAT) strategy, which requires the knowledge of instantaneous full channel state information (CSI) and fading probability distribution, the ergodic throughput of this system may be greatly increased relative to that achieved by the harvestthen-transmit (HTT) protocol. To do so, instead of dividing every frame to the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), the channel is allocated to the UL wireless information transmission (WIT) and DL wireless power transfer (WPT) based on the estimated channel power gain. In other words, based on the fading probability distribution, we will derive some thresholds that determine the association of a frame to the DL WPT or UL WIT. More specifically, if the channel gain falls below or goes over these thresholds, the channel will be allocated to WPT or WIT. Simulation results verify the performance of our proposed scheme.
