On the Gaussian Multiple Access Wiretap Channel and the Gaussian Wiretap Channel with a Helper: Achievable Schemes and Upper Bounds

We study deterministic approximations of the Gaussian two-user multiple access wiretap channel (G-MAC-WT) and the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper (G-WT-H). These approximations enable results beyond the recently shown 2/3 and 1/2 secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) for the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H, respectively. While the s.d.o.f. were obtained by real interference alignment, our approach uses signal-scale alignment. We show achievable schemes which are independent of the rationality of the channel gains. Moreover, our results can differentiate between channel strengths, in particular between both users, and establishes secrecy rates dependent on this difference. We can show that the resulting achievable secrecy rates tend to the s.d.o.f. for vanishing channel gain differences. Moreover, we extend previous and develop new techniques to prove general s.d.o.f. bounds for varying channel strengths and show that our achievable schemes reach the bounds for certain channel gain parameters. We believe that our analysis is the next step towards a constant-gap analysis of the G-MAC-WT and the G-WT-H.
