The Polylog-Time Hierarchy Captured by Restricted Second-Order Logic

Let $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ denote the restriction of second-order logic, where second-order quantification ranges over relations of size at most poly-logarithmic in the size of the structure. In this article we investigate the problem, which Turing machine complexity class is captured by Boolean queries over ordered relational structures that can be expressed in this logic. For this we define a hierarchy of fragments $Σ^{\mathit{plog}}_m$ (and $Π^{\mathit{plog}}_m$) defined by formulae with alternating blocks of existential and universal second-order quantifiers in quantifier-prenex normal form. We first show that the existential fragment $Σ^{\mathit{plog}}_1$ captures NPolyLogTime, i.e. the class of Boolean queries that can be accepted by a non-deterministic Turing machine with random access to the input in time $O((\log n)^k)$ for some $k \ge 0$. Using alternating Turing machines with random access input allows us to characterise also the fragments $Σ^{\mathit{plog}}_m$ (and $Π^{\mathit{plog}}_m$) as those Boolean queries with at most $m$ alternating blocks of second-order quantifiers that are accepted by an alternating Turing machine. Consequently, $\mathrm{SO}^{\mathit{plog}}$ captures the whole poly-logarithmic time hierarchy. We demonstrate the relevance of this logic and complexity class by several problems in database theory.
