5G Island for Network Resilience and Autonomous Failsafe Operations

The resilience of 5G networks can be strongly challenged by central cloud virtual network function (VNF) outages, which can be cause by server and backhaul connection errors. This paper proposes a context-aware approach to migrate VNF from central cloud to local edge cloud, in order to improve the network resilience with minimized VNF migration cost.
