End-to-end 5G services via an SDN/NFV-based multi-tenant network and cloud testbed

5G has a main requirement of highly flexible, ultralow latency and ultra-high bandwidth virtualized infrastructure in order to deliver end-to-end services. This requirement can be met by efficiently integrating all network segments (radio access, aggregation and core) with heterogeneous wireless and optical technologies (5G, mmWave, LTE/LTE-A, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, MPLS, WDM, software-defined optical transmission, etc.), and massive computing and storage cloud services (offered in edge/core data centers). This paper introduces the preliminary architecture aiming at integrating three consolidated and standalone experimental infrastructures at CTTC, in order to deploy the required end-to-end top-to-bottom converged infrastructure pointed out above for testing and developing advanced 5G services.
