Topological Time Series Analysis

Time series are ubiquitous in our data rich world. In what follows I will describe how ideas from dynamical systems and topological data analysis can be combined to gain insights from time-varying data. We will see several applications to the live sciences and engineering, as well as some of the theoretical underpinnings.
