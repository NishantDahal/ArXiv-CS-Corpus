Information Measures for Microphone Arrays

We propose a novel information-theoretic approach for evaluating microphone arrays that relies on the array physics and geometry rather than the underlying beamforming algorithm. The analogy between Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless communication channel and the acoustic channel of microphone arrays is exploited to define information measures of microphone arrays, which provide upper bounds of the information rate of the microphone array system.
