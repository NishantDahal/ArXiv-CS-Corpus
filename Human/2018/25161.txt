Error Performance of Various QAM Schemes for Nonrenegerative Cooperative MIMO Network with Transmit Antenna Selection

In this paper, performance of a dual-hop cooperative multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system is analyzed over Rayleigh faded channels. For the considered system model, non-regenerative MIMO scheme with transmit antenna selection strategy (TAS) is employed. In this scheme, a single transmit antenna which maximizes the total received signal power at the receiver is selected for transmission. Useful insights from average symbol error rate for various quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes such as general order hexagonal QAM (HQAM), general order rectangular QAM (RQAM) and 32-cross QAM (XQAM) are drawn. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to validate the derived analytical expressions.
