Lossy Transmission of Correlated Sources over Two-Way Channels

Achievability and converse results for the lossy transmission of correlated sources over Shannon's two-way channels (TWCs) are presented. A joint source-channel coding theorem for independent sources and TWCs for which adaptation cannot enlarge the capacity region is also established. We further investigate the optimality of scalar coding for TWCs with discrete modulo additive noise as well as additive white Gaussian noise. Comparing the distortion of scalar coding with the derived bounds, we observe that scalar coding achieves the minimum distortion over both families of TWCs for independent and uniformly distributed sources and independent Gaussian sources.
