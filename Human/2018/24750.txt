A Magnetically-Triggered Soft Capsule for On-Demand Mucus Collection

In this work, we present a soft capsule for mucus collection in human intestine for diagnostic purpose, with reduced risk of tissue damage compared with other biopsy methods. The capsule implements passive locomotion and the sampling process is triggered by magnetic field using a permanent magnet, which is placed on the skin above the region of interest (ROI). The capsule contains a soft vacuum chamber which is sealed with wax. When magnetic field and mucus are present simultaneously, the circuit inside the capsule will be closed and nichrome wire will start to generate heat to melt the wax, and mucus will be collected into the vacuum chamber due to air pressure. Experiments on heating capability of nichrome wire, mucus collection and reliability of the capsule are conducted to validate this design.
