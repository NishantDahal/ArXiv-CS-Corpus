Base Station Distance Adaptive LEACH

For some applications, we need to deploy a network of sensors in working field to sense the environment and send collected data to a base station for processing; these sensors depend on non-rechargeable batteries, so the routing protocols for such network of sensors need to be efficient. LEACH is one of these protocols which is a hierarchical routing protocol and helps in saving energy in wireless sensor networks. Enhanced LEACH depends on a mathematical model to calculate the estimated average energy in each round. consequently, utilizing the node remaining energy to ensure rotating cluster head role over all the nodes. It also depends on a mathematical model to calculate base station distance from work field whereas LEACH does not take into its account any consideration for remaining energy of node. In this paper, we enhance LEACH (work efficiency in homogeneous networks) to adapt with base-station distance, thus more energy saving for certain distances from base-station. The obtained simulation results show that enhanced LEACH saves energy better than LEACH and increase network stability and reliability when base-station is inside working field and consume the same energy as LEACH when base-station is outside work field.
