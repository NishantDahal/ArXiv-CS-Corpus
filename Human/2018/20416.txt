First-order justification logic with constant domain semantics

Justification logic is a term used to identify a relatively new family of modal-like logics. There is an established literature about propositional justification logic, but incursions on the first-order case are scarce. In this paper we present a constant domain semantics for the first-order logic of proofs with the Barcan Formula (FOLPb); then we prove Soundness and Completeness Theorems. A monotonic semantics for a version of this logic without the Barcan Formula is already in the literature, but constant domains requires substantial new machinery, which may prove useful in other contexts as well. Although we work mainly with one system, we also indicate how to generalize these results for the quantified version of JT45, the justification counterpart of the modal logic S5. We believe our methods are more generally applicable, but initially examining specific cases should make the work easier to follow.
