TGE-viz : Transition Graph Embedding for Visualization of Plan Traces and Domains

Existing work for plan trace visualization in automated planning uses pipeline-style visualizations, similar to plans in Gantt charts. Such visualization do not capture the domain structure or dependencies between the various fluents and actions. Additionally, plan traces in such visualizations cannot be easily compared with one another without parsing the details of individual actions, which imposes a higher cognitive load. We introduce TGE-viz, a technique to visualize plan traces within an embedding of the entire transition graph of a domain in low dimensional space. TGE-viz allows users to visualize and criticize plans more intuitively for mixed-initiative planning. It also allows users to visually appraise the structure of domains and the dependencies in it.
