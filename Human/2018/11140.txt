Image Captioning

This paper discusses and demonstrates the outcomes from our experimentation on Image Captioning. Image captioning is a much more involved task than image recognition or classification, because of the additional challenge of recognizing the interdependence between the objects/concepts in the image and the creation of a succinct sentential narration. Experiments on several labeled datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. As a toy application, we apply image captioning to create video captions, and we advance a few hypotheses on the challenges we encountered.
