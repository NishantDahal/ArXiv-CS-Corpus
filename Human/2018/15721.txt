EasyConvPooling: Random Pooling with Easy Convolution for Accelerating Training and Testing

Convolution operations dominate the overall execution time of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper proposes an easy yet efficient technique for both Convolutional Neural Network training and testing. The conventional convolution and pooling operations are replaced by Easy Convolution and Random Pooling (ECP). In ECP, we randomly select one pixel out of four and only conduct convolution operations of the selected pixel. As a result, only a quarter of the conventional convolution computations are needed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EasyConvPooling can achieve 1.45x speedup on training time and 1.64x on testing time. What's more, a speedup of 5.09x on pure Easy Convolution operations is obtained compared to conventional convolution operations.
