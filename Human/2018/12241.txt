Fundamental Limits of Decentralized Caching in Fog-RANs with Wireless Fronthaul

This paper aims to characterize the synergy of distributed caching and wireless fronthaul in a fog radio access network (Fog-RAN) where all edge nodes (ENs) and user equipments (UEs) have a local cache and store contents independently at random. The network operates in two phases, a file-splitting based decentralized cache placement phase and a fronthaul-aided content delivery phase. We adopt normalized delivery time (NDT) to characterize the asymptotic latency performance with respect to cache size and fronthaul capacity. Both an achievable upper bound and a theoretical lower bound of NDT are obtained, and their multiplicative gap is within 12. In the proposed delivery scheme, we utilize the fronthaul link, by exploiting coded multicasting, to fetch both non-cached and cached contents to boost EN cooperation in the access link. In particular, to fetch contents already cached at ENs, an additional layer of coded multicasting is added on the coded messages desired by UEs in the fronthaul link. Our analysis shows that the proposed delivery scheme can balance the delivery latency between the fronthaul link and access link, and is approximately optimum under decentralized caching.
