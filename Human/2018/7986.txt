Secrecy Analysis of Physical Layer over $κ-μ$ Shadowed Fading Scenarios

In this paper, the secrecy analysis of physical layer when both the main and wiretap channels undergo $κ-μ$ shadowed fading channel is investigated. In particular, the average secrecy capacity (ASC), secure outage probability (SOP), the lower bound of SOP (SOP$^L$), and the probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity (SPSC) are derived by using the classic Wyner's wiretap model. Two different scenarios for the fading parameters, i.e., $μ$ and $m$ which represents the shadowing impact have been studied. These parameters are chosen first as arbitrary numbers, thus the performance metrics are expressed in single infinite series with multivariate Meijer $G$-function. In the second scenario, both the aforementioned fading parameters are assumed to be integer numbers in order to obtain the derived results in simple exact closed-form analytic mathematically tractable expressions. The numerical results of this analysis are verified via Monte Carlo simulations.
