Named Entity Analysis and Extraction with Uncommon Words

Most previous research treats named entity extraction and classification as an end-to-end task. We argue that the two sub-tasks should be addressed separately. Entity extraction lies at the level of syntactic analysis while entity classification lies at the level of semantic analysis. According to Noam Chomsky's "Syntactic Structures," pp. 93-94 (Chomsky 1957), syntax is not appealed to semantics and semantics does not affect syntax. We analyze two benchmark datasets for the characteristics of named entities, finding that uncommon words can distinguish named entities from common text; where uncommon words are the words that hardly appear in common text and they are mainly the proper nouns. Experiments validate that lexical and syntactic features achieve state-of-the-art performance on entity extraction and that semantic features do not further improve the extraction performance, in both of our model and the state-of-the-art baselines. With Chomsky's view, we also explain the failure of joint syntactic and semantic parsings in other works.
