Resolution Limits for Detecting Community Changes in Multilayer Networks

Multilayer networks capture pairwise relationships between the components of complex systems across multiple modes or scales of interactions. An important meso-scale feature of these networks is measured though their community structure, which defines groups of strongly connected nodes that exist within and across network layers. Because interlayer edges can describe relationships between different modalities, scales, or time points, it is essential to understand how communities change and evolve across layers. A popular method for detecting communities in multilayer networks consists of maximizing a quality function known as modularity. However, in the multilayer setting the modularity function depends on an interlayer coupling parameter, $ω$, and how this parameter affects community detection is not well understood. Here, we expose an upper bound for $ω$ beyond which community changes across layers can not be detected. This upper bound has non-trivial, purely multilayer effects and acts as a resolution limit for detecting evolving communities. Further, we establish an explicit and previously undiscovered relationship between the single layer resolution parameter, $γ$, and interlayer coupling parameter, $ω,$ that provides new understanding of the modularity parameter space. Our findings not only represent new theoretical considerations but also have important practical implications for choosing interlayer coupling values when using multilayer networks to model real-world systems whose communities change across time or modality.
