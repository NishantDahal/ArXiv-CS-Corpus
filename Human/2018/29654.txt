Constructing Trivariate B-splines with Positive Jacobian by Pillow Operation and Geometric Iterative Fitting

The advent of isogeometric analysis has prompted a need for methods to generate Trivariate B-spline Solids (TBS) with positive Jacobian. However, it is difficult to guarantee a positive Jacobian of a TBS since the geometric pre-condition for ensuring the positive Jacobian is very complicated. In this paper, we propose a method for generating TBSs with guaranteed positive Jacobian. For the study, we used a tetrahedral (tet) mesh model and segmented it into sub-volumes using the pillow operation. Then, to reduce the difficulty in ensuring a positive Jacobian, we separately fitted the boundary curves and surfaces and the sub-volumes using a geometric iterative fitting algorithm. Finally, the smoothness between adjacent TBSs is improved. The experimental examples presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed algorithm.
