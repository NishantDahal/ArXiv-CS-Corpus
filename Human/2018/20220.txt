A Combinatorial Model of Interference in Frequency Hopping Schemes

In a frequency hopping (FH) scheme users communicate simultaneously using FH sequences defined on the same set of frequency channels. An FH sequence specifies the frequency channel to be used as communication progresses. Much of the research on the performance of FH schemes is based on either pairwise mutual interference or adversarial interference but not both. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an FH scheme with respect to both group-wise mutual interference and adversarial interference (jamming), bearing in mind that more than two users may be transmitting simultaneously in the presence of a jammer. We establish a correspondence between a cover-free code and an FH scheme. This gives a lower bound on the transmission capacity. Furthermore, we specify a jammer model and consider what additional properties a cover-free code should have to resist the jammer. We demonstrate that a purely combinatorial approach is inadequate against such a jammer, but that with the use of pseudorandomness, we can have a system that has high throughput as well as security against jamming.
