A Traceable Concurrent Data Anonymous Transmission Scheme for Heterogeneous VANETs

Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are attractive scenarios that can improve the traffic situation and provide convenient services for drivers and passengers via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. However, there are still many security challenges in the traffic information transmission, especially in the intense traffic case. For ensuring the privacy of users and traceability of vehicles, we propose a traceable concurrent data anonymous transmission scheme for heterogeneous VANETs. The scheme is based on certificateless aggregate signcryption, so it supports batch verification. Moreover, conditional anonymity is also achieved due to the involving of the pseudo-ID technique. Furthermore, it is a pairing-free scheme for the merit of multi-trapdoor hash functions. As a result, the total computation overhead is greatly reduced.
