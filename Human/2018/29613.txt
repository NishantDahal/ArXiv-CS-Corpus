In (Stochastic) Search of a Fairer Alife

Economies and societal structures in general are complex stochastic systems which may not lend themselves well to algebraic analysis. An addition of subjective value criteria to the mechanics of interacting agents will further complicate analysis. The purpose of this short study is to demonstrate capabilities of agent-based computational economics to be a platform for fairness or equity analysis in both a broad and practical sense.
