A framework for (de)composing with Boolean automata networks

Boolean automata networks (BANs) are a generalisation of Boolean cellular automata. In such, any theorem describing the way BANs compute information is a strong tool that can be applied to a wide range of models of computation. In this paper we explore a way of working with BANs which involves adding external inputs to the base model (via modules), and more importantly, a way to link networks together using the above mentioned inputs (via wirings). Our aim is to develop a powerful formalism for BAN (de)composition. We formulate two results: the first one shows that our modules/wirings definition is complete, the second one uses modules/wirings to prove simulation results amongst BANs.
