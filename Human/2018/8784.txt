Constructive Analysis of S1S and B端chi Automata

We study S1S and B端chi automata in the constructive type theory of the Coq proof assistant. For UP semantics (ultimately periodic sequences), we verify B端chi's translation of formulas to automata and thereby establish decidability of S1S constructively. For AS semantics (all sequences), we verify B端chi's translation assuming that sequences over finite semigroups have Ramseyan factorisations (RF). Assuming RF, UP semantics and AS semantics agree. RF is a consequence of Ramsey's theorem and implies the infinite pigeonhole principle, which is known to be unprovable constructively. We show that each of the following properties holds for UP semantics but is equivalent to RF for AS semantics: excluded middle of formula satisfaction, excluded middle of automaton acceptance, and existence of complement automata.
