Data-Driven Investigative Journalism For Connectas Dataset

The following paper explores the possibility of using Machine Learning algorithms to detect the cases of corruption and malpractice by governments. The dataset used by the authors contains information about several government contracts in Colombia from year 2007 to 2012. The authors begin with exploring and cleaning the data, followed by which they perform feature engineering before finally implementing Machine Learning models to detect anomalies in the given dataset.
