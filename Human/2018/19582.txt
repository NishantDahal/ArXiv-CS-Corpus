Analyzing DNA Hybridization via machine learning

In DNA computing, it is impossible to decide whether a specific hybridization among complex DNA molecules is effective or not within acceptable time. In order to address this common problem, we introduce a new method based on the machine learning technique. First, a sample set is employed to train the Boosted Tree (BT) algorithm, and the corresponding model is obtained. Second, this model is used to predict classification results of molecular hybridizations. The experiments show that the average accuracy of the new method is over 94.2%, and its average efficiency is over 90839 times higher than that of the existing method. These results indicate that the new method can quickly and accurately determine the biological effectiveness of molecular hybridization for a given DNA design.
