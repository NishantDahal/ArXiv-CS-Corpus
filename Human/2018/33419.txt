Modeling and Robust Attitude Controller Design for a Small Size Helicopter

This paper addresses the design and application controller for a small-size unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In this work, the main objective is to study the modeling and attitude controller design for a small size helicopter. Based on a non-simplified helicopter model, a new robust attitude control law, which is combined with a nonlinear control method and a model-free method, is proposed in this paper. Both wind gust and ground effect phenomena conditions are involved in this experiment and the result on a real helicopter platform demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm and robustness of its resultant controller.
