A Droplet Approach Based on Raptor Codes for Distributed Computing With Straggling Servers

We propose a coded distributed computing scheme based on Raptor codes to address the straggler problem. In particular, we consider a scheme where each server computes intermediate values, referred to as droplets, that are either stored locally or sent over the network. Once enough droplets are collected, the computation can be completed. Compared to previous schemes in the literature, our proposed scheme achieves lower computational delay when the decoding time is taken into account.
