Skew cyclic codes over F_{p}+uF_{p}+\dots +u^{k-1}F_{p}

In this article, we study the skew cyclic codes over R_{k}=F_{p}+uF_{p}+\dots +u^{k-1}F_{p} of length n. We characterize the skew cyclic codes of length $n$ over R_{k} as free left R_{k}[x;θ]-submodules of R_{k}[x;θ]/\langle x^{n}-1\rangle and construct their generators and minimal generating sets. Also, an algorithm has been provided to encode and decode these skew cyclic codes.
