Cross-Mode Interference Characterization in Cellular Networks with Voronoi Guard Regions

Advances in cellular networks such as device-to-device communications and full-duplex radios, as well as the inherent elimination of intra-cell interference achieved by network-controlled multiple access schemes, motivates the investigation of the cross-mode interference properties under a guard region corresponding to the Voronoi cell of an access point (AP). By modeling the positions of interfering APs and user equipments (UEs) as Poisson distributed, analytical expressions for the statistics of the cross-mode interference generated by either APs or UEs are obtained based on appropriately defined density functions. The considered system model and analysis are general enough to capture many operational scenarios of practical interest, including conventional downlink/uplink transmissions with nearest AP association, as well as transmissions where not both communicating nodes lie within the same cell. Analysis provides insights on the level of protection offered by a Voronoi guard region and its dependence on type of interference and receiver position. Numerical examples demonstrate the validity/accuracy of the analysis in obtaining the system coverage probability for operational scenarios of practical interest.
