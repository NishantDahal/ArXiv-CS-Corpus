Peacock: Probe-Based Scheduling of Jobs by Rotating Between Elastic Queues

In this paper, we propose Peacock, a new distributed probe-based scheduler which handles heterogeneous workloads in data analytics frameworks with low latency. Peacock mitigates the \emph{Head-of-Line blocking} problem, i.e., shorter tasks are enqueued behind the longer tasks, better than the state-of-the-art. To this end, we introduce a novel probe rotation technique. Workers form a ring overlay network and rotate probes using elastic queues. It is augmented by a novel probe reordering algorithm executed in workers. We evaluate the performance of Peacock against two state-of-the-art probe-based solutions through both trace-driven simulation and distributed experiment in Spark under various loads and cluster sizes. Our large-scale performance results indicate that Peacock outperforms the state-of-the-art in all cluster sizes and loads. Our distributed experiments confirm our simulation results.
