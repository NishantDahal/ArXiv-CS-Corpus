A Variational Time Series Feature Extractor for Action Prediction

We propose a Variational Time Series Feature Extractor (VTSFE), inspired by the VAE-DMP model of Chen et al., to be used for action recognition and prediction. Our method is based on variational autoencoders. It improves VAE-DMP in that it has a better noise inference model, a simpler transition model constraining the acceleration in the trajectories of the latent space, and a tighter lower bound for the variational inference. We apply the method for classification and prediction of whole-body movements on a dataset with 7 tasks and 10 demonstrations per task, recorded with a wearable motion capture suit. The comparison with VAE and VAE-DMP suggests the better performance of our method for feature extraction. An open-source software implementation of each method with TensorFlow is also provided. In addition, a more detailed version of this work can be found in the indicated code repository. Although it was meant to, the VTSFE hasn't been tested for action prediction, due to a lack of time in the context of Maxime Chaveroche's Master thesis at INRIA.
