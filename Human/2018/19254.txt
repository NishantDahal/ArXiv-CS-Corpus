Benchmarking the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm for the GECCO 2018 Competition on Niching Methods Multimodal Optimization

This report presents benchmarking results of the latest version of the Hill-Valley Evolutionary Algorithm (HillVallEA) on the CEC2013 niching benchmark suite. The benchmarking follows restrictions required by the GECCO 2018 competition on Niching methods for Multimodal Optimization. In particular, no problem dependent parameter tuning is performed. A number of adjustments have been made to original publication of HillVallEA that are discussed in this report.
