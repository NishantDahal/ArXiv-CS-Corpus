Energy-Efficient Adaptive Transmission in Machine Type Communications with Delay-Outage Constraints

In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Transmission Strategy to improve energy efficiency~(EE) in a wireless point-to-point transmission system with Quality of Service~(QoS) requirement, i.e., delay-outage probability considered. The transmitter is scheduled to use the channel that has better coefficients, and is forced into silent state when the channel suffers deep fading. The proposed strategy can be easily implemented by applying two-mode circuitry and is suitable for massive machine type communications (MTC) scenarios. In order to enhance EE, we formulate an EE maximization problem, which has a single optimum under a loose QoS constraint. We also show that the maximization problem can be solved efficiently by a binary search algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed strategy can obtain significant EE gains, hence confirming our theoretical analysis.
