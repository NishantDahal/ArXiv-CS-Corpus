Distributed Random Number Generation for the Needs of Public Governance

We propose distributed protocol for generation of random numbers via computer systems. The protocol is specifically designed to fit the needs of random selection as it is performed in public sphere and is inspired by real problems, which are posing difficulties for Bulgarian judicial system. Random selection in public sphere is meant to be mechanism for increasing the transparency and reducing the possibilities of collusion between various government actors. Usage of computers reduces transparency and when done improperly, can lead to disastrous consequences concerning the public trust in the institutions of government. This protocol tries to provide technical solution to the transparency problem by allowing third parties to guarantee for the fairness of the random selection without giving these parties the ability to influence maliciously the result.
