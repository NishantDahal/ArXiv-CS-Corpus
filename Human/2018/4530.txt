Labeled homology of higher-dimensional automata

We construct labeling homomorphisms on the cubical homology of higher-dimensional automata and show that they are natural with respect to cubical dimaps and compatible with the tensor product of HDAs. We also indicate two possible applications of labeled homology in concurrency theory.
