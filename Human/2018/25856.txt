Optimal Placement of Relay Nodes in Wireless Sensor Network Using Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm

Deploying sensor nodes randomly most of the time generates initial communication hole even in highly dense networks. These communication holes cannot be totally eliminated even when the deployment is done in a structured manner. In either case, the resulting inter-node distances may degrade the performance of the network. This paper proposes an enhanced deployment algorithm based on Artificial Bees Colony (ABC). The ABC-based deployment is guaranteed to extend the lifetime by optimizing the network parameters and constraining the total number of deployed relays. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under different cases of problem complexity. Results show that the proposed approach improves the network lifetime considerably when compared to solutions reported in the literature such as Shortest Path 3-D grid Deployment (SP3D) algorithm.
