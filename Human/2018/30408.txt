The domino problem is undecidable on surface groups

We show that the domino problem is undecidable on orbit graphs of non-deterministic substitutions which satisfy a technical property. As an application, we prove that the domino problem is undecidable for the fundamental group of any closed orientable surface of genus at least 2.
