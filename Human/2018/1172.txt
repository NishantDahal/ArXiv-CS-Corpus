Graph-Based Radio Resource Management for Vehicular Networks

This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in device-to-device (D2D)-based vehicular communications, based on slow fading statistics of channel state information (CSI), to alleviate signaling overhead for reporting rapidly varying accurate CSI of mobile links. We consider the case when each vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link shares spectrum with multiple vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Leveraging the slow fading statistical CSI of mobile links, we maximize the sum V2I capacity while guaranteeing the reliability of all V2V links. We propose a graph-based algorithm that uses graph partitioning tools to divide highly interfering V2V links into different clusters before formulating the spectrum sharing problem as a weighted 3-dimensional matching problem, which is then solved through adapting a high-performance approximation algorithm.
