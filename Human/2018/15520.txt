Graph Theory Towards New Graphical Passwords In Information Networks

Graphical passwords (GPWs) have been studied over 20 years. We are motivated from QR codes that can be considered GPWs, are successfully applied in today's world. However, one need such GPWs that can be use conveniently and have higher level security in information networks. We aim to GPWs for mobile devices with touch screen. No more researching papers of GPWs by means of techniques of graph theory that are already used in a wide range of scientific areas, especially, dynamic networks. Our investigation is devoted to designing new type of graphical passwords by methods of graph theory, such as various topological structures and colorings (labellings). We develop the idea of "topological structure plus number theory" in maximal planar graphs, and provide new techniques for designing new type of GPWs, and furthermore we do theoretical analysis on these new type of GPWs.
