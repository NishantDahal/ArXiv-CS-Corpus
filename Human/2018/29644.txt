An Internet of Things Oriented Approach for Water Utility Monitoring and Control

This paper aims to propose a more efficient distributed monitoring and control approach for water utility in order to reduce the current water loss. This approach will help utilities operators improve water management systems, especially by exploiting the emerging technologies. The Internet of Things could prove to be one of the most important methods for developing more utility-proper systems and for making the consumption of water resources more efficient.
