Parallelization of JOREK-STARWALL for non-linear MHD simulations including resistive walls (Report of the EUROfusion High Level Support Team Projects JORSTAR/JORSTAR2)

Large scale plasma instabilities inside a tokamak can be influenced by the currents flowing in the conducting vessel wall. This involves non linear plasma dynamics and its interaction with the wall current. In order to study this problem the code that solves the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations, called JOREK [Huysmans G.T.A. and Czarny O. NF 47, 659 (2007); Czarny O. and Huysmans G. JCP 227, 7423 (2008)], was coupled [Hoelzl M., et al. Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 401, 012010 (2012)] with the model for the vacuum region and the resistive conducting structure named STARWALL [Merkel P., Strumberger E., arXiv:150804911 (2015)]. The JOREK-STARWALL model has been already applied to perform simulations of Vertical Displacement Events (VDEs), Resistive Wall Modes (RWMs), Quiescent H-Mode, and vertical kick ELM triggering. At the beginning of the project it was not possible to resolve the realistic wall structure with a large number of finite element triangles due to the huge consumption of memory and wall clock time by STARWALL and the corresponding coupling routine in JOREK. Moreover, both the STARWALL code and the JOREK coupling routine were only partially parallelized via OpenMP. The aim of this project is to implement an MPI parallelization to reduce memory consumption and execution time such that simulations with large resolutions become possible.
