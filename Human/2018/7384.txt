Maximum Likelihood Detection for Cooperative Molecular Communication

In this paper, symbol-by-symbol maximum likelihood (ML) detection is proposed for a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system. In this system, a fusion center (FC) chooses the transmitter's symbol that is more likely, given the likelihood of the observations from multiple receivers (RXs). We propose three different ML detection variants according to different constraints on the information available to the FC, which enables us to demonstrate trade-offs in their performance versus the information available. The system error probability for one variant is derived in closed form. Numerical and simulation results show that the ML detection variants provide lower bounds on the error performance of the simpler cooperative variants and demonstrate that majority rule detection has performance comparable to ML detection when the reporting is noisy.
