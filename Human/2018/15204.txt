Controlling spectral energies of all harmonics in programmable way using time-domain digital coding metasurface

Modern wireless communication is one of the most important information technologies, but its system architecture has been unchanged for many years. Here, we propose a much simpler architecture for wireless communication systems based on metasurface. We firstly propose a time-domain digital coding metasurface to reach a simple but efficient method to manipulate spectral distributions of harmonics. Under dynamic modulations of phases on surface reflectivity, we could achieve accurate controls to different harmonics in a programmable way to reach many unusual functions like frequency cloaking and velocity illusion, owing to the temporal gradient introduced by digital signals encoded by '0' and '1' sequences. A theoretical model is presented and experimentally validated to reveal the nonlinear process. Based on the time-domain digital coding metasurface, we propose and realize a new wireless communication system in binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) frame, which has much more simplified architecture than the traditional BFSK with excellent performance for real-time message transmission. The presented work, from new concept to new system, will find important applications in modern information technologies.
