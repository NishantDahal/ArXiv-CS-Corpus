Robust Geometry-Based User Scheduling for Large MIMO Systems Under Realistic Channel Conditions

The problem of user scheduling with reduced overhead of channel estimation in the uplink of Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems has been considered. A geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM), called the COST 2100 channel model has been used for realistic analysis of channels. In this paper, we propose a new user selection algorithm based on knowledge of the geometry of the service area and location of clusters, without having full channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). The multi-user link correlation in the GSCMs arises from the common clusters in the area. The throughput depends on the position of clusters in the GSCMs and users in the system. Simulation results show that although the BS does not require the channel information of all users, by the proposed geometry-based user scheduling algorithm the sum-rate of the system is only slightly less than the well-known greedy weight clique scheme. Finally, the robustness of the proposed algorithm to the inaccuracy of cluster localization is verified by the simulation results.
