On deep-holes of Gabidulin codes

In this paper, we determine the covering radius and a class of deep holes for Gabidulin codes with both rank metric and Hamming metric. Moreover, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for deciding whether a word is not a deep hole for Gabidulin codes, by which we study the error distance of a special class of words to certain Gabidulin codes.
