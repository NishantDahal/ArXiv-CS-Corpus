Revitalizing Copybacks in Modern SSDs: Why and How

For modern flash-based SSDs, the performance overhead of internal data migrations is dominated by the data transfer time, not by the flash program time as in old SSDs. In order to mitigate the performance impact of data migrations, we propose rCopyback, a restricted version of copyback. Rcopyback works like the original copyback except that only n consecutive copybacks are allowed. By limiting the number of successive copybacks, it guarantees that no data reliability problem occurs when data is internally migrated using rCopyback. In order to take a full advantage of rCopyback, we developed a rCopyback-aware FTL, rcFTL, which intelligently decides whether rCopyback should be used or not by exploiting varying host workloads. Our evaluation results show that rcFTL can improve the overall I/O throughput by 54% on average over an existing FTL which does not use copybacks.
