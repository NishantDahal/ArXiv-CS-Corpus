The Theory and Algorithm of Ergodic Inference

Approximate inference algorithm is one of the fundamental research fields in machine learning. The two dominant theoretical inference frameworks in machine learning are variational inference (VI) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, because of the fundamental limitation in the theory, it is very challenging to improve existing VI and MCMC methods on both the computational scalability and statistical efficiency. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a new theoretical inference framework called ergodic Inference based on the fundamental property of ergodic transformations. The key contribution of this work is to establish the theoretical foundation of ergodic inference for the development of practical algorithms in future work.
