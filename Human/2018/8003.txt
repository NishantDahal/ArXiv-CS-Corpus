Sparse Power Factorization: Balancing peakiness and sample complexity

In many applications, one is faced with an inverse problem, where the known signal depends in a bilinear way on two unknown input vectors. Often at least one of the input vectors is assumed to be sparse, i.e., to have only few non-zero entries. Sparse Power Factorization (SPF), proposed by Lee, Wu, and Bresler, aims to tackle this problem. They have established recovery guarantees for a somewhat restrictive class of signals under the assumption that the measurements are random. We generalize these recovery guarantees to a significantly enlarged and more realistic signal class at the expense of a moderately increased number of measurements.
