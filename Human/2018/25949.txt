Characterizing subclasses of cover-incomparability graphs by forbidden subposets

In this paper we continue investigations of cover-incomparability graphs of finite partially ordered sets (see \cite{Bres,Bres2,Bres3,Bres4} and \cite{Max,MaxDH}). We consider in some detail the distinction between cover-preserving subsets and isometric subsets of a partially ordered set. This is critical to understanding why forbidden subposet characterizations of certain classes of cover-incomparability graphs in \cite{Bres} and \cite{Bres3} are not valid as presented. Here we provide examples, investigate the root of the difficulties, and formulate and prove valid revisions of these characterizations.
