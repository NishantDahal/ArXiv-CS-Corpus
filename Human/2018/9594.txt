The Effectiveness of Classification on Information Retrieval System (Case Study)

Large amount of unstructured designed information is difficult to deal with. Obtaining specific information is a hard mission and takes a lot of time. Information Retrieval System (IR) is a way to solve this kind of problem. IR is a good mechanism but does not give the perfect solution. Other techniques have been added to IR to develop the result. One of the techniques is text classification. Text classification task is to assign a document to one or more category. It could be done manually or algorithmically. Text classification enhances the output of this process by reducing the results. This study proved that text classification has a positive influence on Information Retrieval Systems.
