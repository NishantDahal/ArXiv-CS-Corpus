Dynamic Channel Allocation for QoS Provisioning in Visible Light Communication

In visible light communication (VLC) diverse types of traffic are supported while the number of optical channels is limited. In this paper we propose a dynamic channel reservation scheme for higher priority calls that does not reduce the channel utilization. The number of reserved channels for each traffic class is calculated using real time observation of the call arrival rates of each traffic classes. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is able to reduce the call blocking probability of the higher priority user within a reasonable range without sacrificing channel utilization.
