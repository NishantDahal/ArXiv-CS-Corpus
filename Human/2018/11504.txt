Unsupervised Learning of Neural Networks to Explain Neural Networks

This paper presents an unsupervised method to learn a neural network, namely an explainer, to interpret a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), i.e., explaining knowledge representations hidden in middle conv-layers of the CNN. Given feature maps of a certain conv-layer of the CNN, the explainer performs like an auto-encoder, which first disentangles the feature maps into object-part features and then inverts object-part features back to features of higher conv-layers of the CNN. More specifically, the explainer contains interpretable conv-layers, where each filter disentangles the representation of a specific object part from chaotic input feature maps. As a paraphrase of CNN features, the disentangled representations of object parts help people understand the logic inside the CNN. We also learn the explainer to use object-part features to reconstruct features of higher CNN layers, in order to minimize loss of information during the feature disentanglement. More crucially, we learn the explainer via network distillation without using any annotations of sample labels, object parts, or textures for supervision. We have applied our method to different types of CNNs for evaluation, and explainers have significantly boosted the interpretability of CNN features.
