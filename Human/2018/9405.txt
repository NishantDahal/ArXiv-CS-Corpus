Fingerprint template protection using minutia-pair spectral representations

Storage of biometric data requires some form of template protection in order to preserve the privacy of people enrolled in a biometric database. One approach is to use a Helper Data System. Here it is necessary to transform the raw biometric measurement into a fixed-length representation. In this paper we extend the spectral function approach of Stanko and Skoric [WIFS2017], which provides such a fixed-length representation for fingerprints. First, we introduce a new spectral function that captures different information from the minutia orientations. It is complementary to the original spectral function, and we use both of them to extract information from a fingerprint image. Second, we construct a helper data system consisting of zero-leakage quantisation followed by the Code Offset Method. We show empirical data which demonstrates that applying our helper data system causes only a small performance penalty compared to fingerprint authentication based on the unprotected spectral functions.
