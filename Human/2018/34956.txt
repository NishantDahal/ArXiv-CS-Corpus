A Two-Step Learning and Interpolation Method for Location-Based Channel Database

Timely and accurate knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is necessary to support scheduling operations at both physical and network layers. In order to support pilot-free channel estimation in cell sleeping scenarios, we propose to adopt a channel database that stores the CSI as a function of geographic locations. Such a channel database is generated from historical user records, which usually can not cover all the locations in the cell. Therefore, we develop a two-step interpolation method to infer the channels at the uncovered locations. The method firstly applies the K-nearest-neighbor method to form a coarse database and then refines it with a deep convolutional neural network. When applied to the channel data generated by ray tracing software, our method shows a great advantage in performance over the conventional interpolation methods.
