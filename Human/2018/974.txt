Predicting Smartphone Battery Life based on Comprehensive and Real-time Usage Data

Smartphones and smartphone apps have undergone an explosive growth in the past decade. However, smartphone battery technology hasn't been able to keep pace with the rapid growth of the capacity and the functionality of smartphones and apps. As a result, battery has always been a bottleneck of a user's daily experience of smartphones. An accurate estimation of the remaining battery life could tremendously help the user to schedule their activities and use their smartphones more efficiently. Existing studies on battery life prediction have been primitive due to the lack of real-world smartphone usage data at scale. This paper presents a novel method that uses the state-of-the-art machine learning models for battery life prediction, based on comprehensive and real-time usage traces collected from smartphones. The proposed method is the first that identifies and addresses the severe data missing problem in this context, using a principled statistical metric called the concordance index. The method is evaluated using a dataset collected from 51 users for 21 months, which covers comprehensive and fine-grained smartphone usage traces including system status, sensor indicators, system events, and app status. We find that the remaining battery life of a smartphone can be accurately predicted based on how the user uses the device at the real-time, in the current session, and in history. The machine learning models successfully identify predictive features for battery life and their applicable scenarios.
