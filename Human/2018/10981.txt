The Error Probability of Generalized Perfect Codes via the Meta-Converse

We introduce a definition of perfect and quasi-perfect codes for symmetric channels parametrized by an auxiliary output distribution. This notion generalizes previous definitions of perfect and quasi-perfect codes and encompasses maximum distance separable codes. The error probability of these codes, whenever they exist, is shown to coincide with the estimate provided by the meta-converse lower bound. We illustrate how the proposed definition naturally extends to cover almost-lossless source-channel coding and lossy compression.
