Twin-GAN -- Unpaired Cross-Domain Image Translation with Weight-Sharing GANs

We present a framework for translating unlabeled images from one domain into analog images in another domain. We employ a progressively growing skip-connected encoder-generator structure and train it with a GAN loss for realistic output, a cycle consistency loss for maintaining same-domain translation identity, and a semantic consistency loss that encourages the network to keep the input semantic features in the output. We apply our framework on the task of translating face images, and show that it is capable of learning semantic mappings for face images with no supervised one-to-one image mapping.
