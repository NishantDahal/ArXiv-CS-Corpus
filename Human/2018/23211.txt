Older Adults and Crowdsourcing: Android TV App for Evaluating TEDx Subtitle Quality

In this paper we describe the insights from an exploratory qualitative pilot study testing the feasibility of a solution that would encourage older adults to participate in online crowdsourcing tasks in a non-computer scenario. Therefore, we developed an Android TV application using Amara API to retrieve subtitles for TEDx talks which allows the participants to detect and categorize errors to support the quality of the translation and transcription processes. It relies on the older adults' innate skills as long-time native language users and the motivating factors of this socially and personally beneficial task. The study allowed us to verify the underlying concept of using Smart TVs as interfaces for crowdsourcing, as well as possible barriers, including the interface, configuration issues, topics and the process itself. We have also assessed the older adults' interaction and engagement with this TV-enabled online crowdsourcing task and we are convinced that the design of our setup addresses some key barriers to crowdsourcing by older adults. It also validates avenues for further research in this area focused on such considerations as autonomy and freedom of choice, familiarity, physical and cognitive comfort as well as building confidence and the edutainment value.
