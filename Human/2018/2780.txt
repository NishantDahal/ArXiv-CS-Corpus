MIMO Transmit Beampattern Matching Under Waveform Constraints

In this paper, the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmit beampattern matching problem is considered. The problem is formulated to approximate a desired transmit beampattern (i.e., an energy distribution in space and frequency) and to minimize the cross-correlation of signals reflected back to the array by considering different practical waveform constraints at the same time. Due to the nonconvexity of the objective function and the waveform constraints, the optimization problem is highly nonconvex. An efficient one-step method is proposed to solve this problem based on the majorization-minimization (MM) method. The performance of the proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-art algorithms is shown through numerical simulations.
