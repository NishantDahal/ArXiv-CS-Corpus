The Research of the Real-time Detection and Recognition of Targets in Streetscape Videos

This study proposes a method for the real-time detection and recognition of targets in streetscape videos. The proposed method is based on separation confidence computation and scale synthesis optimization. We use the proposed method to detect and recognize targets in streetscape videos with high frame rates and high definition. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the accuracy and robustness of our proposed method are superior to those of conventional methods.
