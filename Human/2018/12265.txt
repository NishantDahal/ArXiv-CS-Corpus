Diffusion Based Network Embedding

In network embedding, random walks play a fundamental role in preserving network structures. However, random walk based embedding methods have two limitations. First, random walk methods are fragile when the sampling frequency or the number of node sequences changes. Second, in disequilibrium networks such as highly biases networks, random walk methods often perform poorly due to the lack of global network information. In order to solve the limitations, we propose in this paper a network diffusion based embedding method. To solve the first limitation, our method employs a diffusion driven process to capture both depth information and breadth information. The time dimension is also attached to node sequences that can strengthen information preserving. To solve the second limitation, our method uses the network inference technique based on cascades to capture the global network information. To verify the performance, we conduct experiments on node classification tasks using the learned representations. Results show that compared with random walk based methods, diffusion based models are more robust when samplings under each node is rare. We also conduct experiments on a highly imbalanced network. Results shows that the proposed model are more robust under the biased network structure.
