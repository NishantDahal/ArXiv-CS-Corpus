Porosity Amount Estimation in Stones Based on Combination of One Dimensional Local Binary Patterns and Image Normalization Technique

Since now, many approaches has been proposed for surface defect detection based on image texture analysis techniques. One of the efficient texture analysis operations is local binary patterns which provides good accuracy.
