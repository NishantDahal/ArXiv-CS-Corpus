Conceptualization and Validation of a Novel Protocol for Investigating the Uncanny Valley

Loosely based on principles of similarity-attraction, robots intended for social contexts are being designed with increasing human similarity to facilitate their reception by and communication with human interactants. However, the observation of an uncanny valley - the phenomenon in which certain humanlike entities provoke dislike instead of liking - has lead some to caution against this practice. Substantial evidence supports both of these contrasting perspectives on the design of social technologies. Yet, owing to both empirical and theoretical inconsistencies, the relationship between anthropomorphic design and people's liking of the technology remains poorly understood.
  Here we present three studies which investigate people's explicit ratings of and behavior towards a large sample of real-world robots. The results show a profound "valley effect" on people's \emph{willingness} to interact with humanlike robots, thus highlighting the formidable design challenge the uncanny valley poses for social robotics. In addition to advancing uncanny valley theory, Studies 2 and 3 contribute and validate a novel laboratory task for objectively measuring people's perceptions of humanlike robots.
