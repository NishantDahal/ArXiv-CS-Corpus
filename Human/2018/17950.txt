How Consumer Empathy Assist Power Grid in Demand Response

This paper investigates interaction among residential electricity users and utility company in a distribution network with the capability of two-way communication provided by smart grid. The energy consumption scheduling of electricity users is formulated as a game-theoretic problem within a group where all players are not totally selfish. Considering altruistic behavior of human decision-making, altruistic player action to other players actions can be influenced by recognizing the well being of others. The proposed model captures the empathy of electricity users in energy consumption scheduling and how this behavior affect peak demand and electricity prices. Numerical results demonstrate that both residential users and utility company can benefit through the channel of empathy.
