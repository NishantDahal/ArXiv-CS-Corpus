Comment on: Decomposition of structural learning about directed acyclic graphs [1]

We propose an alternative proof concerning necessary and sufficient conditions to split the problem of searching for d-separators and building the skeleton of a DAG into small problems for every node of a separation tree T. The proof is simpler than the original [1]. The same proof structure has been used in [2] for learning the structure of multivariate regression chain graphs (MVR CGs).
