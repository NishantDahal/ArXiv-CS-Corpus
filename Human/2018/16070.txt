Dynamic learning rate using Mutual Information

This paper demonstrates dynamic hyper-parameter setting, for deep neural network training, using Mutual Information (MI). The specific hyper-parameter studied in this paper is the learning rate. MI between the output layer and true outcomes is used to dynamically set the learning rate of the network through the training cycle; the idea is also extended to layer-wise setting of learning rate. Two approaches are demonstrated - tracking relative change in mutual information and, additionally tracking its value relative to a reference measure. The paper does not attempt to recommend a specific learning rate policy. Experiments demonstrate that mutual information may be effectively used to dynamically set learning rate and achieve competitive to better outcomes in competitive to better time.
