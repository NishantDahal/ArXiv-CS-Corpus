LinkedIn Talent Solutions business contributes to around 65% of LinkedIn's annual revenue, and provides tools for job providers to reach out to potential candidates and for job seekers to find suitable career opportunities. LinkedIn's job ecosystem has been designed as a platform to connect job providers and job seekers, and to serve as a marketplace for efficient matching between potential candidates and job openings. A key mechanism to help achieve these goals is the LinkedIn Recruiter product, which enables recruiters to search for relevant candidates and obtain candidate recommendations for their job postings. In this work, we highlight a set of unique information retrieval, system, and modeling challenges associated with talent search and recommendation systems.
