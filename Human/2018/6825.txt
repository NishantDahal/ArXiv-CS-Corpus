Augmented Artificial Intelligence: a Conceptual Framework

All artificial Intelligence (AI) systems make errors. These errors are unexpected, and differ often from the typical human mistakes ("non-human" errors). The AI errors should be corrected without damage of existing skills and, hopefully, avoiding direct human expertise. This paper presents an initial summary report of project taking new and systematic approach to improving the intellectual effectiveness of the individual AI by communities of AIs. We combine some ideas of learning in heterogeneous multiagent systems with new and original mathematical approaches for non-iterative corrections of errors of legacy AI systems. The mathematical foundations of AI non-destructive correction are presented and a series of new stochastic separation theorems is proven. These theorems provide a new instrument for the development, analysis, and assessment of machine learning methods and algorithms in high dimension. They demonstrate that in high dimensions and even for exponentially large samples, linear classifiers in their classical Fisher's form are powerful enough to separate errors from correct responses with high probability and to provide efficient solution to the non-destructive corrector problem. In particular, we prove some hypotheses formulated in our paper `Stochastic Separation Theorems' (Neural Networks, 94, 255--259, 2017), and answer one general problem published by Donoho and Tanner in 2009.
