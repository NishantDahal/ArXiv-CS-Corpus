Ranking of Social Media Alerts with Workload Bounds in Emergency Operation Centers

Extensive research on social media usage during emergencies has shown its value to provide life-saving information, if a mechanism is in place to filter and prioritize messages. Existing ranking systems can provide a baseline for selecting which updates or alerts to push to emergency responders. However, prior research has not investigated in depth how many and how often should these updates be generated, considering a given bound on the workload for a user due to the limited budget of attention in this stressful work environment. This paper presents a novel problem and a model to quantify the relationship between the performance metrics of ranking systems (e.g., recall, NDCG) and the bounds on the user workload. We then synthesize an alert-based ranking system that enforces these bounds to avoid overwhelming end-users. We propose a Pareto optimal algorithm for ranking selection that adaptively determines the preference of top-k ranking and user workload over time. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach for Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) by performing an evaluation based on real world data from six crisis events. We analyze the trade-off between recall and workload recommendation across periodic and realtime settings. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed ranking selection approach can improve the efficiency of monitoring social media requests while optimizing the need for user attention.
