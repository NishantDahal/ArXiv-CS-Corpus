Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets---Extended Version

Motivated by the increasing availability of vehicle trajectory data, we propose learn-to-route, a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution. Specifically, we first construct a graph-like structure from trajectories as the routing infrastructure. Second, we enable trajectory-based routing given an arbitrary (source, destination) pair.
  In the first step, given a road network and a collection of trajectories, we propose a trajectory-based clustering method that identifies regions in a road network. If a pair of regions are connected by trajectories, we maintain the paths used by these trajectories and learn a routing preference for travel between the regions. As trajectories are skewed and sparse, many region pairs are not connected by trajectories. We thus transfer routing preferences from region pairs with sufficient trajectories to such region pairs and then use the transferred preferences to identify paths between the regions. In the second step, we exploit the above graph-like structure to achieve a comprehensive trajectory-based routing solution. Empirical studies with two substantial trajectory data sets offer insight into the proposed solution, indicating that it is practical. A comparison with a leading routing service offers evidence that the paper's proposal is able to enhance routing quality.
  This is an extended version of "Learning to Route with Sparse Trajectory Sets" [1], to appear in IEEE ICDE 2018.
