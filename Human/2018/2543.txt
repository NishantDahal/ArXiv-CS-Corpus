Multi-RATs Support to Improve V2X Communication

As the next generation of wireless system targets at providing a wider range of services with divergent QoS requirements, new applications will be enabled by the fifth generation (5G) network. Among the emerging applications, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is an important use case targeted by 5G to enable an improved traffic safety and traffic efficiency. Since the V2X communication requires a low end-to-end (E2E) latency and an ultra-high reliability, the legacy cellular networks can not meet the service requirement. In this work, we inspect on the system performance of applying the LTE-Uu and PC5 interfaces to enable the V2X communication. With the LTE-Uu interface, one V2X data packet is transmitted through the cellular network infrastructure, while the PC5 interface facilitates the direct V2X communication without involving the network infrastructure in user-plane. In addition, due to the high reliability requirement, the application of a single V2X transmission technology can not meet the targets in some scenarios. Therefore, we also propose a multi-radio access technologies (multi-RATs) scheme where the data packet travels through both the LTE-Uu and PC5 interfaces to obtain a diversity gain. Last but not least, in order to derive the system performance, a system level simulator is implemented in this work. The numerical results provide us insights on how the different technologies will perform in different scenarios and also validate the proposed multi-RATs scheme.
