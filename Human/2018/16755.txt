Learning Visually Grounded Sentence Representations

We introduce a variety of models, trained on a supervised image captioning corpus to predict the image features for a given caption, to perform sentence representation grounding. We train a grounded sentence encoder that achieves good performance on COCO caption and image retrieval and subsequently show that this encoder can successfully be transferred to various NLP tasks, with improved performance over text-only models. Lastly, we analyze the contribution of grounding, and show that word embeddings learned by this system outperform non-grounded ones.
