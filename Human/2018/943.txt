Effect of Meltdown and Spectre Patches on the Performance of HPC Applications

In this work we examine how the updates addressing Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities impact the performance of HPC applications. To study this we use the application kernel module of XDMoD to test the performance before and after the application of the vulnerability patches. We tested the performance difference for multiple application and benchmarks including: NWChem, NAMD, HPCC, IOR, MDTest and IMB. The results show that although some specific functions can have performance decreased by as much as 74%, the majority of individual metrics indicates little to no decrease in performance. The real-world applications show a 2-3% decrease in performance for single node jobs and a 5-11% decrease for parallel multi node jobs.
