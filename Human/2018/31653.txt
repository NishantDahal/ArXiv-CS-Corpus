High Dimensional Clustering with $r$-nets

Clustering, a fundamental task in data science and machine learning, groups a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same cluster are closer to each other than to those in other clusters. In this paper, we consider a well-known structure, so-called $r$-nets, which rigorously captures the properties of clustering. We devise algorithms that improve the run-time of approximating $r$-nets in high-dimensional spaces with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ metrics from $\tilde{O}(dn^{2-Θ(\sqrtε)})$ to $\tilde{O}(dn + n^{2-α})$, where $α= Ω({ε^{1/3}}/{\log(1/ε)})$. These algorithms are also used to improve a framework that provides approximate solutions to other high dimensional distance problems. Using this framework, several important related problems can also be solved efficiently, e.g., $(1+ε)$-approximate $k$th-nearest neighbor distance, $(4+ε)$-approximate Min-Max clustering, $(4+ε)$-approximate $k$-center clustering. In addition, we build an algorithm that $(1+ε)$-approximates greedy permutations in time $\tilde{O}((dn + n^{2-α}) \cdot \logΦ)$ where $Φ$ is the spread of the input. This algorithm is used to $(2+ε)$-approximate $k$-center with the same time complexity.
