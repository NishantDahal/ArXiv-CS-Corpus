Quantum enhanced cross-validation for near-optimal neural networks architecture selection

This paper proposes a quantum-classical algorithm to evaluate and select classical artificial neural networks architectures. The proposed algorithm is based on a probabilistic quantum memory and the possibility to train artificial neural networks in superposition. We obtain an exponential quantum speedup in the evaluation of neural networks. We also verify experimentally through a reduced experimental analysis that the proposed algorithm can be used to select near-optimal neural networks.
