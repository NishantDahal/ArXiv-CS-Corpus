Making Double Spectrum Auction Practical: Both Privacy and Efficiency Matter

Truthful spectrum auction is believed to be an effective method for spectrum redistribution. However, privacy concerns have largely hampered the practical applications of truthful spectrum auctions. In this paper, to make the applications of double spectrum auctions practical, we present a privacy-preserving and socially efficient double spectrum auction design, SDSA. Specifically, by combining three security techniques: homomorphic encryption, secret sharing and garbled circuits, we design a secure two-party protocol computing a socially efficient double spectrum auction, TDSA, without leaking any information about sellers' requests or buyers' bids beyond the auction outcome. We give the formal security definition in our context, and theoretically prove the security that our design achieves. Experimental results show that our design is also efficient in performance, even for large-scale double spectrum auctions.
