Demonstration Abstract: A Toolkit for Specifying Service Level Agreements for IoT applications

Today we see the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various application domains such as healthcare, smart homes, smart cars, and smart-x applications in smart cities. The number of applications based on IoT and cloud computing is projected to increase rapidly over the next few years. IoT-based services must meet the guaranteed levels of quality of service (QoS) to match users' expectations. Ensuring QoS through specifying the QoS constraints using Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is crucial. Therefore, as a first step toward SLA management, it is essential to provide an SLA specification in a machine-readable format. In this paper, we demonstrate a toolkit for creating SLA specifications for IoT applications. The toolkit is used to simplify the process of capturing the requirements of IoT applications. We present a demonstration of the toolkit using a Remote Health Monitoring Service (RHMS) usecase. The toolkit supports the following: (1) specifying the Service-Level Objectives (SLO) of an IoT application at the application level; (2) specifying the workflow activities of the IoT application; (3) mapping each activity to the required software and hardware resources and specifying the constraints of SLOs and other configuration- related metrics of the required hardware and software; and (4) creating the composed SLA in JSON format.
