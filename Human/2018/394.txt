Behavior Trees as a Representation for Medical Procedures

Behavior trees (BTs) emerged from video game development as a graphical language for modeling intelligent agent behavior. BTs have several properties which are attractive for modeling medical procedures including human-readability, authoring tools, and composability. This paper will illustrate construction of BTs for exemplary medical procedures. We are pleased to acknowledge support from National Science Foundation grant #IIS-1637444 and collaborations on that project with Johns Hopkins University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
