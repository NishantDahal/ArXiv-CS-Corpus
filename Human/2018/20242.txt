An Improved Solution for Restricted and Uncertain TRQ

CSPTRQ is an interesting problem and its has attracted much attention. The CSPTRQ is a variant of the traditional PTRQ. As objects moving in a constrained-space are common, clearly, it can also find many applications. At the first sight, our problem can be easily tackled by extending existing methods used to answer the PTRQ. Unfortunately, those classical techniques are not well suitable for our problem, due to a set of new challenges. We develop targeted solutions and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods through extensive experiments.
