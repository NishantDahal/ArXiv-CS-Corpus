Accurate Hand Keypoint Localization on Mobile Devices

We present a novel approach for 2D hand keypoint localization from regular color input. The proposed approach relies on an appropriately designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that computes a set of heatmaps, one per hand keypoint of interest. Extensive experiments with the proposed method compare it against state of the art approaches and demonstrate its accuracy and computational performance on standard, publicly available datasets. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method matches or outperforms the competing methods in accuracy, but clearly outperforms them in computational efficiency, making it a suitable building block for applications that require hand keypoint estimation on mobile devices.
