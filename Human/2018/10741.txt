LaKe: An Energy Efficient, Low Latency, Accelerated Key-Value Store

Key-value store is a popular type of cloud computing applications. The performance of key-value store applications have been shown to be very sensitive to load within the data center, and in particular to latency. As load within data center increases, it is becoming hard to maintain key-value store applications' performance, without exceeding both the processing capacity of hosts and the power budgets of racks. In this paper, we present LaKe: a low latency, power efficient key-value store design for cloud applications. LaKe is a modular design, combining multiple cores and cache layering, both in hardware and software. LaKe achieves full line rate throughput, while maintaining a latency of 1.1us and better power efficiency than existing hardware based memcached designs. Using the modularity of our design, we study trade-offs in the use of on-chip memory, SRAM and DRAM in accelerated designs and provide insights for future architectures.
