Representation Learning over Dynamic Graphs

How can we effectively encode evolving information over dynamic graphs into low-dimensional representations? In this paper, we propose DyRep, an inductive deep representation learning framework that learns a set of functions to efficiently produce low-dimensional node embeddings that evolves over time. The learned embeddings drive the dynamics of two key processes namely, communication and association between nodes in dynamic graphs. These processes exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics that evolve at different time scales and subsequently contribute to the update of node embeddings. We employ a time-scale dependent multivariate point process model to capture these dynamics. We devise an efficient unsupervised learning procedure and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms representative baselines on two real-world datasets for the problem of dynamic link prediction and event time prediction.
