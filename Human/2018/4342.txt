Technology in Hospitality Industry: Prospects and Challenges

The leisure and hospitality industry is one of the driving forces of the global economy. The widespread adoption of new technologies in this industry over recent years has fundamentally reshaped the way in which services are provided and received. In this paper, we explore some of the state-of-the-art technologies currently employed in the hospitality industry and how they are improving guest experiences and changing the hospitality service platform. We also envision some potential future hospitality services we can expect as the Internet of things (IoT) technology keeps growing. We recognize that the technological backbone of many hospitality establishments needs to be overhauled in order to facilitate the changing landscape of technology in the modern world. We discuss some fundamental challenges that need to be overcome to institute a lasting future-proof solution for the hospitality industry. We also touch upon the problems these challenges pose for guests and hospitality service providers (HSP).
