Security protocols for distributed wireless sensor networks

Sensor Networks technologies had proved their great practicability in the real world, being just a matter of time until this kind of networks will be standardized and used in the field. We focus on security issues in Distributed Sensor Networks like useful cryptosystems, attacks, preventing and detecting possible attacks, describing state of the art in domain and proposing new methods for further investigation
