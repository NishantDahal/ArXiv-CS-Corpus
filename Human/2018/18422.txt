Derivation of the closed-form BER expressions for DL-NOMA over Nakagami-m fading channels

NOMA is as a strong candidate for the Future Radio Access Network (FRA) due to its potential to support massive connectivity and high spectral efficiency. However, the most important drawback of NOMA is the error during Successive Interference Canceller (SIC) is implemented because of the inter-user interferences. In this paper, we derive closed-form exact Bit-Error Rate expressions for Downlink(DL) NOMA over Nakagami-m fading channels in the presence of SIC errors. The derived expressions are validated by the computer simulations. It is shown that the m parameter still represents the diversity order like as OMA systems. Besides, the BER performances of users for NOMA have substantially depended on the power allocation coefficient.
