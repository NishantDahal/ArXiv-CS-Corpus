Cloud-Edge Non-Orthogonal Transmission for Fog Networks with Delayed CSI at the Cloud

In a Fog Radio Access Network (F-RAN), the cloud processor (CP) collects channel state information (CSI) from the edge nodes (ENs) over fronthaul links. As a result, the CSI at the cloud is generally affected by an error due to outdating. In this work, the problem of content delivery based on fronthaul transmission and edge caching is studied from an information-theoretic perspective in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. For the set-up under study, under the assumption of perfect CSI, prior work has shown the (approximate or exact) optimality of a scheme in which the ENs transmit information received from the cloud and cached contents over orthogonal resources. In this work, it is demonstrated that a non-orthogonal transmission scheme is able to substantially improve the latency performance in the presence of imperfect CSI at the cloud.
