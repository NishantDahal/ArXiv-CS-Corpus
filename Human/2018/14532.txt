TxPI-u: A Resource for Personality Identification of Undergraduates

Resources such as labeled corpora are necessary to train automatic models within the natural language processing (NLP) field. Historically, a large number of resources regarding a broad number of problems are available mostly in English. One of such problems is known as Personality Identification where based on a psychological model (e.g. The Big Five Model), the goal is to find the traits of a subject's personality given, for instance, a text written by the same subject. In this paper we introduce a new corpus in Spanish called Texts for Personality Identification (TxPI). This corpus will help to develop models to automatically assign a personality trait to an author of a text document. Our corpus, TxPI-u, contains information of 416 Mexican undergraduate students with some demographics information such as, age, gender, and the academic program they are enrolled. Finally, as an additional contribution, we present a set of baselines to provide a comparison scheme for further research.
