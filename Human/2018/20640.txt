On the convergence of optimistic policy iteration for stochastic shortest path problem

In this paper, we prove some convergence results of a special case of optimistic policy iteration algorithm for stochastic shortest path problem. We consider both Monte Carlo and $TD(Î»)$ methods for the policy evaluation step under the condition that the termination state will eventually be reached almost surely.
