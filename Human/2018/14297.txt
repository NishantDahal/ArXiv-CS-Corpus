Vision-based Pose Estimation for Augmented Reality : A Comparison Study

Augmented reality aims to enrich our real world by inserting 3D virtual objects. In order to accomplish this goal, it is important that virtual elements are rendered and aligned in the real scene in an accurate and visually acceptable way. The solution of this problem can be related to a pose estimation and 3D camera localization. This paper presents a survey on different approaches of 3D pose estimation in augmented reality and gives classification of key-points-based techniques. The study given in this paper may help both developers and researchers in the field of augmented reality.
