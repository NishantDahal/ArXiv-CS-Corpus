Differentiable lower bound for expected BLEU score

In natural language processing tasks performance of the models is often measured with some non-differentiable metric, such as BLEU score. To use efficient gradient-based methods for optimization, it is a common workaround to optimize some surrogate loss function. This approach is effective if optimization of such loss also results in improving target metric. The corresponding problem is referred to as loss-evaluation mismatch. In the present work we propose a method for calculation of differentiable lower bound of expected BLEU score that does not involve computationally expensive sampling procedure such as the one required when using REINFORCE rule from reinforcement learning (RL) framework.
