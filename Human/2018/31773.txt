The External Interface for Extending WASP

Answer set programming (ASP) is a successful declarative formalism for knowledge representation and reasoning. The evaluation of ASP programs is nowadays based on the Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) backtracking search algorithm. Recent work suggested that the performance of CDCL-based implementations can be considerably improved on specific benchmarks by extending their solving capabilities with custom heuristics and propagators. However, embedding such algorithms into existing systems requires expert knowledge of the internals of ASP implementations. The development of effective solver extensions can be made easier by providing suitable programming interfaces. In this paper, we present the interface for extending the CDCL-based ASP solver WASP. The interface is both general, i.e. it can be used for providing either new branching heuristics and propagators, and external, i.e. the implementation of new algorithms requires no internal modifications of WASP. Moreover, we review the applications of the interface witnessing it can be successfully used to extend WASP for solving effectively hard instances of both real-world and synthetic problems.
