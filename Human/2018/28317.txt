Proceedings 11th Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE'18, the 11th Interaction and Concurrency Experience, which was held in Madrid, Spain on the 20th and 21st of June 2018 as a satellite event of DisCoTec'18. 
  The ICE workshop series features a distinguishing review and selection procedure, allowing PC members to interact anonymously with authors. As in the past ten editions, this interaction considerably improved the accuracy of the feedback from the reviewers and the quality of accepted papers, and offered the basis for lively discussion during the workshop. For the second time, the 2018 edition of ICE included double blind reviewing of original research papers, in order to increase fairness and avoid bias in reviewing.
  Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether six papers were accepted for publication (the workshop also featured four oral presentations which are not part of this volume). We were proud to host three invited talks, by Elvira Albert, Silvia Crafa, and Alexey Gotsman. The abstracts of these talks are included in this volume together with the regular papers. Final versions of the contributions, taking into account the discussion at the workshop, are included.
