3D shape retrieval basing on representatives of classes

In this paper, we present an improvement of our proposed technique for 3D shape retrieval in classified databases [2] which is based on representatives of classes. Instead of systematically matching the object-query with all 3D models of the database, our idea presented in [2] consist, for a classified database, to represent each class by one representative that is used to orient the retrieval process to the right class (the class excepted to contain 3D models similar to the query). In order to increase the chance to fall in the right class, our idea in this work is to represent each class by more than one representative. In this case, instead of using only one representative to decide which is the right class we use a set of representatives this will contribute certainly to improving the relevance of retrieval results. The obtained experimental results show that the relevance is significantly improved.
