Secrecy Amplification for Distributed Encrypted Sources with Correlated Keys using Affine Encoders

This paper proposed the application of post-encryption-compression (PEC) to strengthen the secrecy in the case of distributed encryption where the encryption keys are correlated to each other. We derive the universal code construction for the compression and the rate region where codes with achievability and secrecy are obtainable. Our main technique is to use affine encoders which are constructed from certain linear encoders to encode the ciphertexts before sending them to public communication channels. We show that if the rates of linear codes are within a certain rate region:(1) information leakage on the original sources from the encoded ciphertexts without the keys is negligible, while (2) one who has legitimate keys is able to retrieve the original source data with negligible error probability.
