Learning a Shared Shape Space for Multimodal Garment Design

Designing real and virtual garments is becoming extremely demanding with rapidly changing fashion trends and increasing need for synthesizing realistic dressed digital humans for various applications. This necessitates creating simple and effective workflows to facilitate authoring sewing patterns customized to garment and target body shapes to achieve desired looks. Traditional workflow involves a trial-and-error procedure wherein a mannequin is draped to judge the resultant folds and the sewing pattern iteratively adjusted until the desired look is achieved. This requires time and experience. Instead, we present a data-driven approach wherein the user directly indicates desired fold patterns simply by sketching while our system estimates corresponding garment and body shape parameters at interactive rates. The recovered parameters can then be further edited and the updated draped garment previewed. Technically, we achieve this via a novel shared shape space that allows the user to seamlessly specify desired characteristics across multimodal input {\em without} requiring to run garment simulation at design time. We evaluate our approach qualitatively via a user study and quantitatively against test datasets, and demonstrate how our system can generate a rich quality of on-body garments targeted for a range of body shapes while achieving desired fold characteristics.
