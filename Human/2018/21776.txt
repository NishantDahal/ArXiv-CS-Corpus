Packing colouring of some classes of cubic graphs

The packing chromatic number $χ$ $ρ$ (G) of a graph G is the smallest integer k such that its set of vertices V (G) can be partitioned into k disjoint subsets V 1 ,. .. , V k , in such a way that every two distinct vertices in V i are at distance greater than i in G for every i, 1 $\le$ i $\le$ k. Recently, Balogh, Kostochka and Liu proved that $χ$ $ρ$ is not bounded in the class of subcubic graphs [Packing chromatic number of subcubic graphs, Discrete Math. 341 (2018), 474483], thus answering a question previously addressed in several papers. However, several subclasses of cubic or subcubic graphs have bounded packing chromatic number. In this paper, we determine the exact value of, or upper and lower bounds on, the packing chromatic number of some classes of cubic graphs, namely circular ladders, and so-called H-graphs and generalised H-graphs.
