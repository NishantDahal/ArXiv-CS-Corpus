Uniqueness of Transformation based on Jacobian Determinant and curl-Vector

Numerical examples demonstrated that a prescribed positive Jacobian determinant alone can not uniquely determine a diffeomorphism. It is conjectured that the uniqueness of a transformation can be assured by its Jacobian determinant and the curl-vector. In this work, we study the uniqueness problem analytically and propose an approach to the proof of the uniqueness of a transformation with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl-vector.
