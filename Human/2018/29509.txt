Short monadic second order sentences about sparse random graphs

In this paper, we study zero-one laws for the Erdős--Rényi random graph model $G(n,p)$ in the case when $p = n^{-α}$ for $α>0$. For a given class $\mathcal{K}$ of logical sentences about graphs and a given function $p=p(n)$, we say that $G(n,p)$ obeys the zero-one law (w.r.t. the class $\mathcal{K}$) if each sentence $\varphi\in\mathcal{K}$ either a.a.s. true or a.a.s. false for $G(n,p)$. In this paper, we consider first order properties and monadic second order properties of bounded \textit{quantifier depth} $k$, that is, the length of the longest chain of nested quantifiers in the formula expressing the property. Zero-one laws for properties of quantifier depth $k$ we call the \textit{zero-one $k$-laws}.
  The main results of this paper concern the zero-one $k$-laws for monadic second order properties (MSO properties). We determine all values $α>0$, for which the zero-one $3$-law for MSO properties does not hold. We also show that, in contrast to the case of the $3$-law, there are infinitely many values of $α$ for which the zero-one $4$-law for MSO properties does not hold. To this end, we analyze the evolution of certain properties of $G(n,p)$ that may be of independent interest.
