Multi-objective Non-cooperative Game Model for Cost-based Task Scheduling in Computational Grid

Task scheduling is an important and complex problem in computational grid. A computational grid often covers a range of different kinds of nodes, which offers a complex environment. There is a need to develop algorithms that can capture this complexity as while as can be easily implemented and used to solve a wide range of load-balancing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a game theory based algorithm to the grid load balancing problem on the principle of minimizing the cost of the grid. The grid load-balancing problem is treated as a non-cooperative game. The experiment results demonstrate that the game based algorithm has a desirable capability to reduce the cost of the grid.
