Secrecy by Witness-Functions on Increasing Protocols

In this paper, we present a new formal method to analyze cryptographic protocols statically for the property of secrecy. It consists in inspecting the level of security of every component in the protocol and making sure that it does not diminish during its life cycle. If yes, it concludes that the protocol keeps its secret inputs. We analyze in this paper an amended version of the Woo-Lam protocol using this new method.
