A hybrid architecture for astronomical computing

With many large science equipment constructing and putting into use, astronomy has stepped into the big data era. The new method and infrastructure of big data processing has become a new requirement of many astronomers. Cloud computing, Map/Reduce, Hadoop, Spark, etc. many new technology has sprung up in recent years. Comparing to the high performance computing(HPC), Data is the center of these new technology. So, a new computing architecture infrastructure is necessary, which can be shared by both HPC and big data processing. Based on Astronomy Cloud project of Chinese Virtual Observatory (China-VO), we have made much efforts to optimize the designation of the hybrid computing platform. which include the hardware architecture, cluster management, Job and Resource scheduling.
