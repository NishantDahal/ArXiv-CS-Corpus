MIMO-OTFS in High-Doppler Fading Channels: Signal Detection and Channel Estimation

Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a recently introduced multiplexing technique designed in the 2-dimensional (2D) delay-Doppler domain suited for high-Doppler fading channels. OTFS converts a doubly-dispersive channel into an almost non-fading channel in the delay-Doppler domain through a series of 2D transformations. In this paper, we focus on MIMO-OTFS which brings in the high spectral and energy efficiency benefits of MIMO and the robustness of OTFS in high-Doppler fading channels. The OTFS channel-symbol coupling and the sparse delay-Doppler channel impulse response enable efficient MIMO channel estimation in high Doppler environments. We present an iterative algorithm for signal detection based on message passing and a channel estimation scheme in the delay-Doppler domain suited for MIMO-OTFS. The proposed channel estimation scheme uses impulses in the delay-Doppler domain as pilots for estimation. We also compare the performance of MIMO-OTFS with that of MIMO-OFDM under high Doppler scenarios.
