Use of Eye-Tracking Technology to Investigate Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive load theory (CLT) provides us guiding principles in the design of learning materials. CLT differentiates three different kinds of cognitive load -- intrinsic, extraneous and germane load. Intrinsic load is related to the learning goal, extraneous load costs cognitive resources but does not contribute to learning. Germane load can foster learning. Objective methods, such as eye movement measures and EEG have been used measure the total cognitive load. Very few research studies, if any, have been completed to measure the three kinds of load separately with physiological methods in a continuous manner. In this current study, we will show how several eye-tracking based parameters are related to the three kinds of load by having explicit manipulation of the three loads independently. Participants having low prior knowledge regarding the learning material participated in the study. Working memory capacity was also measured by an operation memory span task.
