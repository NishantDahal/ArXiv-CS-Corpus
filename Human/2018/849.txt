The Design Space of Social Robots

We consider the design space available for social robots in terms of a hierarchy of functional definitions: the essential properties in terms of a locus of interaction, autonomy, intelligence, awareness of humans as possessors of mental state, and awareness of humans as social interactors. We also suggest that the emphasis on physical embodiment in some segments of the social robotics community has obscured commonalities with a class of agents that are identical in all other respects. These definitions naturally suggest research issues, directions, and possibilities which we explore. Social robotics also lacks compelling 'killer apps' which we suggest would help focus the community on a research agenda.
