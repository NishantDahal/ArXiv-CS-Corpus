Many-Goals Reinforcement Learning

All-goals updating exploits the off-policy nature of Q-learning to update all possible goals an agent could have from each transition in the world, and was introduced into Reinforcement Learning (RL) by Kaelbling (1993). In prior work this was mostly explored in small-state RL problems that allowed tabular representations and where all possible goals could be explicitly enumerated and learned separately. In this paper we empirically explore 3 different extensions of the idea of updating many (instead of all) goals in the context of RL with deep neural networks (or DeepRL for short). First, in a direct adaptation of Kaelbling's approach we explore if many-goals updating can be used to achieve mastery in non-tabular visual-observation domains. Second, we explore whether many-goals updating can be used to pre-train a network to subsequently learn faster and better on a single main task of interest. Third, we explore whether many-goals updating can be used to provide auxiliary task updates in training a network to learn faster and better on a single main task of interest. We provide comparisons to baselines for each of the 3 extensions.
