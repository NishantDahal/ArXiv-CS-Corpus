Multi-View Community Detection in Facebook Public Pages

Community detection in social networks is widely studied because of its importance in uncovering how people connect and interact. However, little attention has been given to community structure in Facebook public pages. In this study, we investigate the community detection problem in Facebook newsgroup pages. In particular, to deal with the diversity of user activities, we apply multi-view clustering to integrate different views, for example, likes on posts and likes on comments. In this study, we explore the community structure in not only a given single page but across multiple pages. The results show that our method can effectively reduce isolates and improve the quality of community structure.
