Layered BPSK for High Data Rates

This paper proposes a novel transmission strategy, referred to as layered BPSK, which allows two independent symbol streams to be layered at the transmitter on a non-orthogonal basis and isolated from each other at the receiver without inter-stream interference, aiming to achieve high data rates. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, its data rate is formulated over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Based on the theoretical analysis, numerical results are provided for the performance comparisons between the proposed scheme and conventional transmission schemes, which substantiate the validity of the proposed scheme.
