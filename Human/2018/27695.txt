Asynchronous Wi-Fi Control Interface (AWCI) Using Socket IO Technology

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices to the Internet that are provided with unique identifiers which has the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to- human or human-to- computer interaction. Raspberry pi-3 a popular, cheap, small and powerful computer with built in Wi-Fi can be used to make any devices smart by connecting to that particular device and embedding the required software to Raspberry pi-3 and connect it to Internet. It is difficult to install a full Linux OS inside a small devices like light switch so in that case to connect to a Wi-Fi connection a model was proposed known as Asynchronous Wi-Fi Control Interface (AWCI) which is a simple Wi-Fi connectivity software for a Debian compatible Linux OS). The objective of this paper is to make the interactive user interface for Wi-Fi connection in Raspberry Pi touch display by providing live updates using Socket IO technology. The Socket IO technology enables real-time bidirectional communication between client and server. Asynchronous Wi-Fi Control Interface (AWCI) is compatible with every platform, browser or device.
