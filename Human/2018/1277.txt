QBM - Mapping User-Specified Functions to Programmable Logic through a QBF Satisfiability Problem

This is a brief overview on the background behind the test set formulas generated by the QBM tool. After establishing its application context, its formal approach to the generation of QBF formulas and the concrete test set formulas are described. Finally, some related work will be credited and the source to obtain the open-source tool will be identified.
