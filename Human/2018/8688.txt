Regular Polygon Surfaces

A $\textit{regular polygon surface}$ $M$ is a surface graph $(Σ, Γ)$ together with a continuous map $ψ$ from $Σ$ into Euclidean 3-space which maps faces to regular Euclidean polygons. When $Σ$ is homeomorphic to the sphere and the degree of every face of $Γ$ is five, we prove that $M$ can be realized as the boundary of a union of dodecahedra glued together along common facets. Under the same assumptions but when the faces of $Γ$ have degree four or eight, we prove that $M$ can be realized as the boundary of a union of cubes and octagonal prisms glued together along common facets. We exhibit counterexamples showing the failure of both theorems for higher genus surfaces.
