Network Slicing with Mobile Edge Computing for Micro-Operator Networks in Beyond 5G

We model the scenarios of network slicing allocation for the micro-operator (MO) network. The MO creates the slices "as a service" of wireless resource and then allocates these slices to multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). We propose the slice allocation problem of multiple MNOs with the goal of maximizing the social welfare of the network defined as sum rate of all MNOs. The many-to-one matching game framework is adopted to solve this problem. Then, the generic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is introduced for the computation of game theoretical solution. After the MNOs obtain the slices, for each small cell base station (SBS), we investigate the role of power allocation using Q-learning and uniform power. We numerically show that the solution of the matching game leads to two-sided stable matching. Furthermore, for each MNO, we explore the problem of infrastructure cost minimization constrained on the latency at the user equipment (UE). The optimal solution is given by a greedy fractional knapsack algorithm. We illustrate that it is sufficient for the MNO to use a small fraction of the SBS to serve the UE while satisfying the latency constraint. For the problem of overall data rate maximization, we numerically show that the power allocation has significant effect on the social welfare of the system.
