Challenges: Bridge between Cloud and IoT

In the real time processing, a new emerging technology where the need of connecting smart devices with cloud through Internet has raised. IoT devices processed information is to be stored and accessed anywhere needed with a support of powerful computing performance, efficient storage infrastructure for heterogeneous systems and software which configures and controls these different devices. A lot of challenges to be addressed are listed with this new emerging technology as it needs to be compatible with the upcoming 5G wireless devices too. In this paper, the benefits and challenges of this innovative paradigm along with the areas open to do research are shown.
