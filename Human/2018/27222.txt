Planification par fusions incr√©mentales de graphes

In this paper, we introduce a generic and fresh model for distributed planning called "Distributed Planning Through Graph Merging" ({\sf DPGM}). This model unifies the different steps of the distributed planning process into a single step. Our approach is based on a planning graph structure for the agent reasoning and a CSP mechanism for the individual plan extraction and the coordination. We assume that no agent can reach the global goal alone. Therefore the agents must cooperate, {\it i.e.,} take in into account potential positive interactions between their activities to reach their common shared goal. The originality of our model consists in considering as soon as possible, {\it i.e.,} in the individual planning process, the positive and the negative interactions between agents activities in order to reduce the search cost of a global coordinated solution plan.
