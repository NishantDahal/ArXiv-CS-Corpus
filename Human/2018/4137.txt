A Hierarchical Contextual Attention-based GRU Network for Sequential Recommendation

Sequential recommendation is one of fundamental tasks for Web applications. Previous methods are mostly based on Markov chains with a strong Markov assumption. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are getting more and more popular and has demonstrated its effectiveness in many tasks. The last hidden state is usually applied as the sequence's representation to make recommendation. Benefit from the natural characteristics of RNN, the hidden state is a combination of long-term dependency and short-term interest to some degrees. However, the monotonic temporal dependency of RNN impairs the user's short-term interest. Consequently, the hidden state is not sufficient to reflect the user's final interest. In this work, to deal with this problem, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Attention-based GRU (HCA-GRU) network. The first level of HCA-GRU is conducted on the input. We construct a contextual input by using several recent inputs based on the attention mechanism. This can model the complicated correlations among recent items and strengthen the hidden state. The second level is executed on the hidden state. We fuse the current hidden state and a contextual hidden state built by the attention mechanism, which leads to a more suitable user's overall interest. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that HCA-GRU can effectively generate the personalized ranking list and achieve significant improvement.
