A Note on "New techniques for noninteractive zero-knowledge"

In 2012, Groth, et al. [J. ACM, 59 (3), 1-35, 2012] developed some new techniques for noninteractive zero-knowledge (NIZK) and presented: the first perfect NIZK argument system for all NP; the first universally composable NIZK argument for all NP in the presence of an adaptive adversary; the first noninteractive zap for all NP, which is based on a standard cryptographic security assumption. These solved several long-standing open questions. In this note, we remark that their basic system is flawed because the prover can cheat the verifier to accept a false claim. Thus, these problems remain open now.
