SFA: Small Faces Attention Face Detector

In recent year, tremendous strides have been made in face detection thanks to deep learning. However, most published face detectors deteriorate dramatically as the faces become smaller. In this paper, we present the Small Faces Attention (SFA) face detector to better detect faces with small scale. First, we propose a new scale-invariant face detection architecture which pays more attention to small faces, including 4-branch detection architecture and small faces sensitive anchor design. Second, feature maps fusion strategy is applied in SFA by partially combining high-level features into low-level features to further improve the ability of finding hard faces. Third, we use multi-scale training and testing strategy to enhance face detection performance in practice. Comprehensive experiments show that SFA significantly improves face detection performance, especially on small faces. Our real-time SFA face detector can run at 5 FPS on a single GPU as well as maintain high performance. Besides, our final SFA face detector achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on challenging face detection benchmarks, including WIDER FACE and FDDB datasets, with competitive runtime speed. Both our code and models will be available to the research community.
