Tilings of the plane with unit area triangles of bounded diameter

There exist tilings of the plane with pairwise noncongruent triangles of equal area and bounded perimeter. Analogously, there exist tilings with triangles of equal perimeter, the areas of which are bounded from below by a positive constant. This solves a problem of Nandakumar.
