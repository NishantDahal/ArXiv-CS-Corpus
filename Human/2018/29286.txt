On Stochastic Orders and Fast Fading Multiuser Channels with Statistical CSIT

In this paper, fading Gaussian multiuser channels are considered. If the channel is perfectly known to the transmitter, capacity has been established for many cases in which the channels may satisfy certain information theoretic orders such as degradedness or strong/very strong interference. Here, we study the case when only the statistics of the channels are known at the transmitter which is an open problem in general. The main contribution of this paper is the following: First, we introduce a framework to classify random fading channels based on their joint distributions by leveraging three schemes: maximal coupling, coupling, and copulas. The underlying spirit of all scheme is, we obtain an equivalent channel by changing the joint distribution in such a way that it now satisfies a certain information theoretic order while ensuring that the marginal distributions of the channels to the different users are not changed. The construction of this equivalent multi-user channel allows us to directly make use of existing capacity results, which includes Gaussian interference channels, Gaussian broadcast channels, and Gaussian wiretap channels. We also extend the framework to channels with a specific memory structure, namely, channels with finite-state, wherein the Markov fading broadcast channel is discussed as a special case. Several practical examples such as Rayleigh fading and Nakagami-\textit{m} fading illustrate the applicability of the derived results.
