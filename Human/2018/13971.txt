Ethical Aspects of Internet of Things from Islamic Perspective

The Internet of Things (IoTs) is an evolving new face of technology that provides state of the art services using ubiquitously connected smart objects. These smart objects are capable of sensing, processing, collaborating, communicating the events and provide services. The IoT is a collection of heterogeneous technologies like Sensor, RFID, Communication and nanotechnology. These technologies enable smart objects to identify objects, collect information about their status,communicating the collected information for taking some desired actions. Widespread adaptations of IoT based devices and services raised the ethical challenges for their users. In this paper we highlight ethical challenges raised by IoT and discuss the solutions and methods for encouraging people to properly use these technologies according to Islamic teachings.
