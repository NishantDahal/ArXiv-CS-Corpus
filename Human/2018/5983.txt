Model Visualization in understanding rapid growth of a journal in an emerging area

A recent independent study resulted in a ranking system which ranked Astronomy and Computing (ASCOM) much higher than most of the older journals highlighting the niche prominence of the particular journal. We investigate the remarkable ascendancy in reputation of ASCOM by proposing a novel differential equation based modeling. The Modeling is a consequence of knowledge discovery from big data-centric methods, namely L1-SVD. The inadequacy of the ranking method in explaining the reason behind the growth in reputation of ASCOM is reasonable to understand given that the study was post-facto. Thus, we propose a growth model by accounting for the behavior of parameters that contribute to the growth of a field. It is worthwhile to spend some time in analysing the cause and control variables behind rapid rise in reputation of a journal in a niche area. We intent to probe and bring out parameters responsible for its growing influence. Delay differential equations are used to model the change of influence on a journal's status by exploiting the effects of historical data.
