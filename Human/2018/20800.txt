Introducing the Perception-Distortion Tradeoff into the Rate-Distortion Theory of General Information Sources

Blau and Michaeli recently introduced a novel concept for inverse problems of signal processing, that is, the perception-distortion tradeoff. We introduce their tradeoff into the rate distortion theory of lossy source coding in information theory, and clarify the tradeoff among information rate, distortion and perception for general information sources.
