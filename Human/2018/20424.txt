Botnet Campaign Detection on Twitter

This is an approach to detecting a subset of bots on Twitter, that at best is under-researched. This approach will be generic enough to be adaptable to most, if not all social networks. The subset of bots this focuses on are those that can evade most, if not all current detection methods. This is simply because they have little to no information associated with them that can be analyzed to make a determination. Although any account on any social media site inherently has information associated with it, it is very easy to blend in with the majority of users who are simply "lurkers" - those who only consume content, but do not contribute. How can you determine if an account is a bot if they don't do anything? By the time they act, it will be too late to detect. The only solution would be a real time, or near real-time, detection algorithm.
