Shared Services Center for E-Government Policy

It is a general opinion that applicative cooperation represents a useful vehicle for the development of e-government. At the architectural level, solutions for applicative cooperation are quite stable, but organizational and methodological problems prevent the expected and needed development of cooperation among different administrations. Moreover, the introduction of the digital government requires a considerable involvement of resources that can be unsustainable for small public administrations. This work shows how the above mentioned problems can be (partially) solved with the introduction of a Shared Services Center (SSC).
