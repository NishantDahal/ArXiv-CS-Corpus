On channel sounding with switched arrays in fast time-varying channels

Time-division multiplexed (TDM) channel sounders, in which a single RF chain is connected sequentially via an electronic switch to different elements of an array, are widely used for the measurement of double-directional/MIMO propagation channels. This paper investigates the impact of array switching patterns on the accuracy of parameter estimation of multipath components (MPC) for a time-division multiplexed (TDM) channel sounder. The commonly-used sequential (uniform) switching pattern poses a fundamental limit on the number of antennas that a TDM channel sounder can employ in fast time-varying channels. We thus aim to design improved patterns that relax these constraints. To characterize the performance, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal ambiguity function, which can handle the non-idealities of real-word arrays. We formulate the sequence design problem as an optimization problem and propose an algorithm based on simulated annealing to obtain the optimal sequence. As a result we can extend the estimation range of Doppler shifts by eliminating ambiguities in parameter estimation. We show through Monte Carlo simulations that the root mean square errors of both direction of departure and Doppler are reduced significantly with the new switching sequence. Results are also verified with actual vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel measurements.
