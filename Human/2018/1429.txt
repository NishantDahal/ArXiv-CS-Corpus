Joint convolutional neural pyramid for depth map super-resolution

High-resolution depth map can be inferred from a low-resolution one with the guidance of an additional high-resolution texture map of the same scene. Recently, deep neural networks with large receptive fields are shown to benefit applications such as image completion. Our insight is that super resolution is similar to image completion, where only parts of the depth values are precisely known. In this paper, we present a joint convolutional neural pyramid model with large receptive fields for joint depth map super-resolution. Our model consists of three sub-networks, two convolutional neural pyramids concatenated by a normal convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural pyramids extract information from large receptive fields of the depth map and guidance map, while the convolutional neural network effectively transfers useful structures of the guidance image to the depth image. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms not only on data pairs of RGB/depth images, but also on other data pairs like color/saliency and color-scribbles/colorized images.
