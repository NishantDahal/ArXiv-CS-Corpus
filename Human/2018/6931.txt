Wadge Degrees of $ω$-Languages of Petri Nets

We prove that  $ω$-languages of (non-deterministic) Petri nets and $ω$-languages of (non-deterministic)  Turing machines   have the same topological complexity:   the Borel and Wadge hierarchies of the class of  $ω$-languages of (non-deterministic) Petri nets are equal to the Borel and Wadge hierarchies of the class of $ω$-languages of (non-deterministic) Turing machines which also form the class of effective analytic sets. In particular,  for each non-null recursive ordinal $α< ω\_1^{\rm CK} $ there exist some ${\bf Σ}^0\_α$-complete and some ${\bf Π}^0\_α$-complete   $ω$-languages of Petri nets, and the supremum of the set of Borel ranks of $ω$-languages  of Petri nets is the ordinal $γ\_2^1$, which  is strictly greater than the first non-recursive ordinal $ω\_1^{\rm CK}$. We also prove that there are some ${\bf Σ}\_1^1$-complete, hence non-Borel, $ω$-languages of Petri nets, and that it is consistent with ZFC that there exist some $ω$-languages of Petri nets which are neither Borel nor  ${\bf Σ}\_1^1$-complete. This  answers  the question of the topological complexity of $ω$-languages of (non-deterministic) Petri nets which was left open in [DFR14,FS14].
