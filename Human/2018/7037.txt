TTW: A Time-Triggered-Wireless Design for CPS [ Extended version ]

Wired field buses have proved their effectiveness to support Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). However, in avionics, for ease of deployment, or for new functionality featuring mobile devices, there is a strong interest for wireless solutions. Low-power wireless protocols have been proposed, but requirements of a large class of CPS applications can still not be satisfied. This paper presents Time-Triggered-Wireless (TTW), a distributed low-power wireless system design that minimizes energy consumption and offers end-to-end timing predictability, adaptability, reliability, low latency. Our evaluation shows a reduction of communication latency by a factor 2x and of energy consumption by 33-40% compared to state-of-the-art approaches. This validates the suitability of TTW for wireless CPS applications and opens the way for implementation and real-world experience with industry partners.
