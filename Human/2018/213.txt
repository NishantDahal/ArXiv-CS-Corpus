Securing On-Body IoT Devices By Exploiting Creeping Wave Propagation

On-body devices are an intrinsic part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) vision to provide human-centric services. These on-body IoT devices are largely embedded devices that lack a sophisticated user interface to facilitate traditional Pre-Shared Key based security protocols. Motivated by this real-world security vulnerability, this paper proposes SecureTag, a system designed to add defense in depth against active attacks by integrating physical layer (PHY) information with upper-layer protocols. The underpinning of SecureTag is a signal processing technique that extracts the peculiar propagation characteristics of creeping waves to discern on-body devices. Upon overhearing a suspicious transmission, SecureTag initiates a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to mitigate attacks. We implement our system on different commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wearables and a smartphone. Extensive experiments are conducted in a lab, apartments, malls, and outdoor areas, involving 12 volunteer subjects of different age groups, to demonstrate the robustness of our system. Results show that our system can mitigate 96.13% of active attack attempts while triggering false alarms on merely 5.64% of legitimate traffic.
