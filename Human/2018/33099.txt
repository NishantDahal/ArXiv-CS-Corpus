Mobile Cloud Business Process Management System for the Internet of Things: A Survey

The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a comprehensive environment that consists of a large number of smart devices interconnecting heterogeneous physical objects to the Internet. Many domains such as logistics, manufacturing, agriculture, urban computing, home automation, ambient assisted living and various ubiquitous computing applications have utilised IoT technologies. Meanwhile, Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) have become a successful and efficient solution for coordinated management and optimised utilisation of resources/entities. However, past BPMS have not considered many issues they will face in managing large scale connected heterogeneous IoT entities. Without fully understanding the behaviour, capability and state of the IoT entities, the BPMS can fail to manage the IoT integrated information systems. In this paper, we analyse existing BPMS for IoT and identify the limitations and their drawbacks based on Mobile Cloud Computing perspective. Later, we discuss a number of open challenges in BPMS for IoT.
