A Linear Algebraic Approach to Subfield Subcodes of GRS Codes

The problem of finding subfield subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes (i.e., alternant codes) is considered. A pure linear algebraic approach is taken in order to derive message constraints that generalize the well known conjugacy constraints for cyclic GRS codes and their Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) subfield subcodes. It is shown that the presented technique can be used for finding nested subfield subcodes with increasing design distance.
