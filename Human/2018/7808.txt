CompNet: Neural networks growing via the compact network morphism

It is often the case that the performance of a neural network can be improved by adding layers. In real-world practices, we always train dozens of neural network architectures in parallel which is a wasteful process. We explored $CompNet$, in which case we morph a well-trained neural network to a deeper one where network function can be preserved and the added layer is compact. The work of the paper makes two contributions: a). The modified network can converge fast and keep the same functionality so that we do not need to train from scratch again; b). The layer size of the added layer in the neural network is controlled by removing the redundant parameters with sparse optimization. This differs from previous network morphism approaches which tend to add more neurons or channels beyond the actual requirements and result in redundance of the model. The method is illustrated using several neural network structures on different data sets including MNIST and CIFAR10.
