Cooperative Spectrum Sharing Relaying Protocols With Energy Harvesting Cognitive User

The theory of wireless information and power transfer in energy constrained wireless networks has caught the interest of researchers due to its potential in increasing the lifetime of sensor nodes and mitigate the environment hazards caused by conventional cell batteries. Similarly, the advancements in areas of cooperative spectrum sharing protocols has enabled efficient use of frequency spectrum between a licensed primary user and a secondary user. In this paper, we consider an energy constrained secondary user which harvests energy from the primary signal and relays the primary signal in exchange for the spectrum access. We consider Nakagami-m fading model and propose two key protocols, namely time-splitting cooperative spectrum sharing (TS-CSS) and power-sharing cooperative spectrum sharing (PS-CSS), and derive expressions for the outage probabilities of the primary and secondary user in decode-forward and amplify-forward relaying modes. From the obtained results, it has been shown that the secondary user can carry its own transmission without adversely affecting the performance of the primary user and that PS-CSS protocol outperforms the TS-PSS protocol in terms of outage probability over a wide range of Signal to noise ratio(SNRs). The effect of various system parameters on the outage performance of these protocols have also been studied.
