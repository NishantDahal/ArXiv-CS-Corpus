Computing Approximate Statistical Discrepancy

Consider a geometric range space $(X,cA)$ where each data point $x \in X$ has two or more values (say $r(x)$ and $b(x)$). Also consider a function $Φ(A)$ defined on any subset $A \in (X,cA)$ on the sum of values in that range e.g., $r_A = \sum_{x \in A} r(x)$ and $b_A = \sum_{x \in A} b(x)$. The $Φ$-maximum range is $A^* = \arg \max_{A \in (X,cA)} Φ(A)$. Our goal is to find some $\hat{A}$ such that $|Φ(\hat{A}) - Φ(A^*)| \leq \varepsilon.$ We develop algorithms for this problem for range spaces with bounded VC-dimension, as well as significant improvements for those defined by balls, halfspaces, and axis-aligned rectangles. This problem has many applications in many areas including discrepancy evaluation, classification, and spatial scan statistics.
