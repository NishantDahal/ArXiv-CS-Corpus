Weighted simplicial complex reconstruction from mobile laser scanning using sensor topology

We propose a new method for the reconstruction of simplicial complexes (combining points, edges and triangles) from 3D point clouds from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS). Our method uses the inherent topology of the MLS sensor to define a spatial adjacency relationship between points. We then investigate each possible connexion between adjacent points, weighted according to its distance to the sensor, and filter them by searching collinear structures in the scene, or structures perpendicular to the laser beams. Next, we create and filter triangles for each triplet of self-connected edges and according to their local planarity. We compare our results to an unweighted simplicial complex reconstruction.
