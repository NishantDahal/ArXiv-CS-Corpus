A Game-Theoretic Approach for NOMA-ALOHA

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can improve the spectral efficiency by exploiting the power domain and successive interference cancellation (SIC), and it can be applied to various transmission schemes including random access that plays a crucial role in the Internet of Things (IoT) to support connectivity for a number of devices with sparse activity. In this paper, we formulate a game when NOMA is applied to ALOHA to decide the transmission probability. We consider a payoff function based on an energy-efficiency metric and drive the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (NE).
