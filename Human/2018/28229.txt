Intelligent Interference Management Based on On-Demand Service Connectivity for Femtocellular Networks

The femto-access-point (FAP), a low power small cellular base station provides better signal quality for the indoor users as to provide high data-rate communications with improved coverage, access network capacity and quality of service. Highly dense femtocellular deployments-the ultimate goal of the femtocellular technology-will require significant degree of selforganization in lieu of manual configuration as to mitigate unwanted handovers and interference effects. The deployment of femtocells with our proposed on-demand scheme in the multistoried building or home environment can solve the low level signal-to-noise plus interference ratio and throughput problems. In this paper, we propose new application of the femtocell technology with a new idea of femto-idle-mode and femto-active-mode system. The signal-to-noise plus interference ratio level and throughput are analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed on-demand scheme in femtocell deployment significantly enhances the signal-to-noise plus interference ratio level and throughput in the multistoried building or home environment.
