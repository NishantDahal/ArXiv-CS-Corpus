Dual skew codes from annihilators: Transpose Hamming ring extensions

In this paper a framework to study the dual of skew cyclic codes is proposed. The transposed Hamming ring extensions are based in the existence of an anti-isomorphism of algebras between skew polynomial rings. Our construction is applied to left ideal convolutional codes, skew constacyclic codes and skew Reed-Solomon code, showing that the dual of these codes belong to the same class.
