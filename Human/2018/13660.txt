Remaining Idle Time Aware Intelligent Channel Bonding Schemes for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks

Channel Bonding (CB) is a technique used to provide larger bandwidth to users. It has been applied to various networks such as wireless local area networks (WLANs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), and Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs). The implementation of CB in CRSNs needs special attention as Primary Radio (PR) nodes traffic must be protected from any harmful interference by Cognitive Radio (CR) nodes. On the other hand, CR nodes need to communicate without interruption to meet their data rate requirements. If CR nodes perform frequent channel switching due to PR traffic then it will be difficult to meet their quality of service (QoS) and data rate requirements. So, CR nodes need to select those channels which are stable. By stable, we mean those channels which cause less harmful interference to PR nodes and having less PR activity or long remaining idle time. In this paper, we propose our two approaches Remaining Idle Time aware intelligent Channel Bonding (RITCB) and Remaining Idle Time aware Intelligent Channel Bonding with Interference Prevention (RITCB-IP) for cognitive radio sensor networks which select those channels for CB which have longest remaining idle time. We compare our approaches with four schemes PRACB, SWA, KNOWS and AGILE. Simulation results show that our proposed approaches RITCB and RITCB-IP decrease harmful interference (HIR) and increases the life time of cognitive radio sensor nodes.
