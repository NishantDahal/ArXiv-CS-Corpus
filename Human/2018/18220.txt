Minor probability events detection in big data: An integrated approach with Bayesian testing and MIM

The minor probability events detection is a crucial problem in Big data. Such events tend to include rarely occurring phenomenons which should be detected and monitored carefully. Given the prior probabilities of separate events and the conditional distributions of observations on the events, the Bayesian detection can be applied to estimate events behind the observations. It has been proved that Bayesian detection has the smallest overall testing error in average sense. However, when detecting an event with very small prior probability, the conditional Bayesian detection would result in high miss testing rate. To overcome such a problem, a modified detection approach is proposed based on Bayesian detection and message importance measure, which can reduce miss testing rate in conditions of detecting events with minor probability. The result can help to dig minor probability events in big data.
