Bit-Metric Decoding of Non-Binary LDPC Codes with Probabilistic Amplitude Shaping

A new approach for combining non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes with higher-order modulation and probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) is presented. Instead of symbol-metric decoding (SMD), a bit-metric decoder (BMD) is used so that matching the field order of the non-binary code to the constellation size is not needed, which increases the flexibility of the coding scheme. Information rates, density evolution thresholds and finite-length simulations show that the flexibility comes at no loss of performance if PAS is used.
