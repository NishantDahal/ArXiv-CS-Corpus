On the computability of the Fréchet distance of surfaces in the bit-model of real computation

We show that the Fréchet distance of two-dimensional parametrised surfaces in a metric space is computable in the bit-model of real computation. An analogous result in the real RAM model for piecewise-linear surfaces has recently been obtained by Nayyeri and Xu (2016).
