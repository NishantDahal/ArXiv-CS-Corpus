Role Semantics for Better Models of Implicit Discourse Relations

Predicting the structure of a discourse is challenging because relations between discourse segments are often implicit and thus hard to distinguish computationally. I extend previous work to classify implicit discourse relations by introducing a novel set of features on the level of semantic roles. My results demonstrate that such features are helpful, yielding results competitive with other feature-rich approaches on the PDTB. My main contribution is an analysis of improvements that can be traced back to role-based features, providing insights into why and when role semantics is helpful.
