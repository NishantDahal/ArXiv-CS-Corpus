Investigating the Power of Circuits with $MOD_6$ Gates

We consider the power of Boolean circuits with MOD$_{6}$ gates. First, we introduce a few basic notions of computational complexity, and describe the standard models with which we study the complexity of problems. We then define the model of Boolean circuits, equate a restricted class of circuits with an algebraic model, and present some results from working with this algebra.
