Downlink coverage probability in cellular networks with Poisson-Poisson cluster deployed base stations

Poisson-Poisson cluster processes (PPCPs) are a class of point processes exhibiting attractive point patterns. Recently, PPCPs are actively studied for modeling and analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks or device-to-device networks. However, surprisingly, to the best knowledge of the author, there is no exact derivation of downlink coverage probability in a numerically computable form for a cellular network with base stations (BSs) deployed according to a PPCP within the most fundamental setup such as single-tier, Rayleigh fading and nearest BS association. In this paper, we consider this fundamental model and derive a numerically computable form of coverage probability. To validate the analysis, we compare the results of numerical computations with those by Monte Carlo simulations and confirm the good agreement.
