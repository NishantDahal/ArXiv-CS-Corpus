X-Vision: An augmented vision tool with real-time sensing ability in tagged environments

We present the concept of X-Vision, an enhanced Augmented Reality (AR)-based visualization tool, with the real-time sensing capability in a tagged environment. We envision that this type of a tool will enhance the user-environment interaction and improve the productivity in factories, smart-spaces, home & office environments, maintenance/facility rooms and operation theatres, etc. In this paper, we describe the design of this visualization system built upon combining the object's pose information estimated by the depth camera and the object's ID & physical attributes captured by the RFID tags. We built a physical prototype of the system demonstrating the projection of 3D holograms of the objects encoded with sensed information like water-level and temperature of common office/household objects. The paper also discusses the quality metrics used to compare the pose estimation algorithms for robust reconstruction of the object's 3D data.
