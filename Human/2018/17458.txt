Deep Unsupervised Multi-View Detection of Video Game Stream Highlights

We consider the problem of automatic highlight-detection in video game streams. Currently, the vast majority of highlight-detection systems for games are triggered by the occurrence of hard-coded game events (e.g., score change, end-game), while most advanced tools and techniques are based on detection of highlights via visual analysis of game footage. We argue that in the context of game streaming, events that may constitute highlights are not only dependent on game footage, but also on social signals that are conveyed by the streamer during the play session (e.g., when interacting with viewers, or when commenting and reacting to the game). In this light, we present a multi-view unsupervised deep learning methodology for novelty-based highlight detection. The method jointly analyses both game footage and social signals such as the players facial expressions and speech, and shows promising results for generating highlights on streams of popular games such as Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.
