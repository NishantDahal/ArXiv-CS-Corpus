AMMCOA - Nomadic 5G Private Networks

This paper presents ideas and concepts for interconnected off-road vehicles, like harvesters or tandem rollers, which span a mobile network by themselves to be, to some extent, independent from the network infrastructure. Multiple RATs are used to cover a variety of use cases, including mmW technology for short range high bandwidth communication and ranging. The AMMCOA Project aims at providing connectivity in areas where the infrastructure network is either at long range distances or out off range entirely. In this case, for certain network services, like authentication of UEs, to be available, some of the core network functionalities have to be instantiated locally. This effectively turns the local network into a light version of a core network. In this paper we give an overview of the project's use cases, their requirements, the architectural idea of a local autonomous network (Trust Zone, 5G Island, 5G Private Networks) and the AMMCOA network architecture envisioned so far.
