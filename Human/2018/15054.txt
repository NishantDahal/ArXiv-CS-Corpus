An Information Theoretic Converse for the "Consecutive Complete--$S$" PICOD Problem

Pliable Index CODing (PICOD) is a variant of the Index Coding (IC) problem in which a user is satisfied whenever it can successfully decode any one message that is not in its side information set, as opposed to a fixed pre-determined message. The complete--$S$ PICOD with $m$ messages, for $S\subseteq[0:m-1]$, has $n = \sum_{s\in S} \binom{m}{s}$ users with distinct side information sets. Past work on PICOD provided tight converse results when either the sender is constrained to use linear codes, or for some special classes of complete--$S$ PICOD. This paper provides a tight information theoretic converse result (i.e., no restriction to linear codes) for the so-called "consecutive complete--$S$" PICOD, where the set $S$ satisfies $S=[s_{min} : s_{max}]$ for some $0\leq s_{min} \leq s_{max} \leq m-1$. This result extends existing converse results and shows that linear codes have the smallest possible code length given by $\min(m-s_{\min},1+s_{\max})$. The central contribution is a novel proof technique rooted in combinatorics. The main idea is to consider all the messages a user can eventually successfully decode, in addition to its own desired message. This allows us to circumvent the necessity of essentially considering all possible assignments of desired messages for the users. The keystone of the proof is to show that, for the case of $S=\{s\}$ and $m = 2s+1$, there exists at least one user who can decode $s+1$ messages. From this, the extension to the "consecutive complete--$S$" PICOD follows.
