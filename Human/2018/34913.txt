Localization and Tracking of an Acoustic Source using a Diagonal Unloading Beamforming and a Kalman Filter

We present the signal processing framework and some results for the IEEE AASP challenge on acoustic source localization and tracking (LOCATA). The system is designed for the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in single-source scenarios. The proposed framework consists of four main building blocks: pre-processing, voice activity detection (VAD), localization, tracking. The signal pre-processing pipeline includes the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of the multichannel input captured by the array and the cross power spectral density (CPSD) matrices estimation. The VAD is calculated with a trace-based threshold of the CPSD matrices. The localization is then computed using our recently proposed diagonal unloading (DU) beamforming, which has low-complexity and high resolution. The DOA estimation is finally smoothed with a Kalman filer (KF). Experimental results on the LOCATA development dataset are reported in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) for a 7-microphone linear array, the 12-microphone pseudo-spherical array integrated in a prototype head for a humanoid robot, and the 32-microphone spherical array.
