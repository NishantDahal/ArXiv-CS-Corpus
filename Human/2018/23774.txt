Crossbar-Constrained Technology Mapping for ReRAM based In-Memory Computing

In recent times, Resistive RAMs (ReRAMs) have gained significant prominence due to their unique feature of supporting both non-volatile storage and logic capabilities. ReRAM is also reported to provide extremely low power consumption compared to the standard CMOS storage devices. As a result, researchers have explored the mapping and design of diverse applications, ranging from arithmetic to neuromorphic computing structures to ReRAM-based platforms. ReVAMP, a general-purpose ReRAM computing platform, has been proposed recently to leverage the parallelism exhibited in a crossbar structure. However, the technology mapping on ReVAMP remains an open challenge. Though the technology mapping with device/area-constraints have been proposed, crossbar constraints are not considered so far. In this work, we address this problem. Two technology mapping flows are proposed, considering different runtime-efficiency trade-offs. Both the mapping flows take crossbar constraints into account and generate feasible mapping for a variety of crossbar dimensions. Our proposed algorithms are highly scalable and reveal important design hints for ReRAM-based implementations.
