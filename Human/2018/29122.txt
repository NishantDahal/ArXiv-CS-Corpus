A Common Framework for Natural Gradient and Taylor based Optimisation using Manifold Theory

This technical report constructs a theoretical framework to relate standard Taylor approximation based optimisation methods with Natural Gradient (NG), a method which is Fisher efficient with probabilistic models. Such a framework will be shown to also provide mathematical justification to combine higher order methods with the method of NG.
