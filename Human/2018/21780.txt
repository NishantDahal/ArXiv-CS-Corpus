Permutation patterns in genome rearrangement problems

In the context of the genome rearrangement problem, we analyze two well known models, namely the block transposition and the prefix block transposition models, by exploiting the connection with the notion of permutation pattern. More specifically, for any $k$, we provide a characterization of the set of permutations having distance $\leq k$ from the identity (which is known to be a permutation class) in terms of what we call generating permutations and we describe some properties of its basis, which allow to compute such a basis for small values of $k$.
