Hybrid Precoding Based on Non-Uniform Quantization Codebook to Reduce Feedback Overhead in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems

In this paper, we focus on the design of the hybrid analog/digital precoding in millimeter wave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two non-uniform quantization (NUQ) codebook based hybrid precoding schemes for two main hybrid precoding implementations, i.e., the full-connected structure and the sub-connected structure. Specifically, we firstly group the angles of the arrive/departure (AOAs/AODs) of the scattering paths into several spatial lobes by exploiting the sparseness property of the millimeter wave in the angular domain, which divides the total angular domain into effective spatial lobes' coverage angles and ineffective coverage angles. Then, we map the quantization bits non-uniformly to different coverage angles and construct NUQ codebooks, where high numbers of quantization bits are employed for the effective coverage angles to quantize AoAs/AoDs and zero quantization bit is employed for ineffective coverage angles. Finally, two low-complexity hybrid analog/digital precoding schemes are proposed based on NUQ codebooks. Simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed two NUQ codebook based hybrid precoding schemes achieve near-optimal spectral efficiencies and show the superiority in reducing the feedback overhead compared with the uniform quantization (UQ) codebook based works, e.g., at least 12.5% feedback overhead could be reduced for a system with 144/36 transmitting/receiving antennas.
