Descriptive Unions. A Fibre Bundle Characterization of the Union of Descriptively Near Sets

This paper introduces an extension of descriptive intersection and provides a framework for descriptive unions of nonempty sets. Fibre bundles provide structures that characterize spatially near as well as descriptively near sets, their descriptive intersection and their unions. The properties of four different forms of descriptive unions are given. A main result given in this paper is the equivalence between ordinary set intersection and a descriptive union. Applications of descriptive unions are given with respect to Jeffs-Novik convex unions and descriptive unions in digital images.
