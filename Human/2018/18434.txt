Eurolab-4-HPC Long-Term Vision on High-Performance Computing

Radical changes in computing are foreseen for the next decade. The US IEEE society wants to "reboot computing" and the HiPEAC Vision 2017 sees the time to "re-invent computing", both by challenging its basic assumptions. This document presents the "EuroLab-4-HPC Long-Term Vision on High-Performance Computing" of August 2017, a road mapping effort within the EC CSA1 Eurolab-4-HPC that targets potential changes in hardware, software, and applications in High-Performance Computing (HPC).
  The objective of the Eurolab-4-HPC vision is to provide a long-term roadmap from 2023 to 2030 for High-Performance Computing (HPC). Because of the long-term perspective and its speculative nature, the authors started with an assessment of future computing technologies that could influence HPC hardware and software. The proposal on research topics is derived from the report and discussions within the road mapping expert group. We prefer the term "vision" over "roadmap", firstly because timings are hard to predict given the long-term perspective, and secondly because EuroLab-4-HPC will have no direct control over the realization of its vision.
