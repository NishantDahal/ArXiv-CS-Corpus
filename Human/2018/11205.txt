Rate-Maximizing OFDM Pilot Patterns for UAV Communications in Nonstationary A2G Channels

In this paper, we propose and evaluate rate-maximizing pilot configurations for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communications employing OFDM waveforms. OFDM relies on pilot symbols for effective communications. We formulate a rate-maximization problem in which the pilot spacing (in the time-frequency resource grid) and power is varied as a function of the time-varying channel statistics. The receiver solves this rate-maximization problem, and the optimal pilot spacing and power are explicitly fed back to the transmitter to adapt to the time-varying channel statistics in an air-to-ground (A2G) environment. We show the enhanced throughput performance of this scheme for UAV communications in sub-6 GHz bands. These performance gains are achieved at the cost of very low computational complexity and feedback requirements, making it attractive for A2G UAV communications in 5G.
