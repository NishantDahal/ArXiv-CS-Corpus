Action Detection from a Robot-Car Perspective

We present the new Road Event and Activity Detection (READ) dataset, designed and created from an autonomous vehicle perspective to take action detection challenges to autonomous driving. READ will give scholars in computer vision, smart cars and machine learning at large the opportunity to conduct research into exciting new problems such as understanding complex (road) activities, discerning the behaviour of sentient agents, and predicting both the label and the location of future actions and events, with the final goal of supporting autonomous decision making.
