Beyond "Usability and User Experience" , Towards an Integrative Heuristic Inspection: from Accessibility to Persuasiveness in the UX Evaluation A Case Study on an Insurance Prospecting Tablet Application

Heuristic inspections are often carried out in a rather restrictive manner in the sense that they often address one or two of User Experience aspects. These two generally being: usability and "user experience". This fails to consider UX as it should be [considered]: through a holistic approach. Thus, we suggest to go beyond that by opting for what we have called an Integrative Heu-ristic Inspection that takes into account issues of: accessibility, usability, emotions \& motivation and persuasion, and that aims to simplify the overflow of recommendations UX professionals are faced with nowadays. We illustrate our proposal by a case study carried out on an insurance prospecting tablet application. We analyzed the results of the inspection separately for each dimension as well as combined across dimensions. Implications for a reflection on the struc-turing of the criteria for a general criteria-based approach in UX are discussed.
