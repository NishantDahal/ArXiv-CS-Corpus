Target Defense Against Link-Prediction-Based Attacks via Evolutionary Perturbations

In social networks, by removing some target-sensitive links, privacy protection might be achieved. However, some hidden links can still be re-observed by link prediction methods on observable networks. In this paper, the conventional link prediction method named Resource Allocation Index (RA) is adopted for privacy attacks. Several defense methods are proposed, including heuristic and evolutionary approaches, to protect targeted links from RA attacks via evolutionary perturbations. This is the first time to study privacy protection on targeted links against link-prediction-based attacks. Some links are randomly selected from the network as targeted links for experimentation. The simulation results on six real-world networks demonstrate the superiority of the evolutionary perturbation approach for target defense against RA attacks. Moreover, transferring experiments show that, although the evolutionary perturbation approach is designed to against RA attacks, it is also effective against other link-prediction-based attacks.
