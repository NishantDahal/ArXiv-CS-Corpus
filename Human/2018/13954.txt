Mammographic Image Enhancement using Digital Image Processing Technique

Abstract PURPOSES this study aims to perform microcalsification detection by performing image enhancement in mammography image by using transformation of negative image and histogram equalization. image mammography with .pgm format changed to. jpg format then processed into negative image result then processed again using histogram equalization. the results of the image enhancement process using negative image techniques and equalization histograms are compared and validated with MSE and PSNR on each mammographic image. CONCLUSION: Image enhancement process on mammography image can be done, however there are only some image that have improved quality, this affected by threshold usage, which have important role to get better visualization on mammographic image.
