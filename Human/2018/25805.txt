Fuzzy Graph Modelling of Anonymous Networks

Anonymous networks have enabled secure and anonymous communication between the users and service providers while maintaining their anonymity and privacy. The hidden services in the networks are dynamic and continuously change their domains and service features to maintain anonymity and prevent fingerprinting. This makes modelling of such networks a challenging task. Further, modelling with crisp graphs is not suitable as they cannot capture the dynamic nature of the anonymous networks. In this work, we model the anonymous networks using fuzzy graphs and provide a methodology to simulate and analyze an anonymous network. We consider the case studies of two popular anonymous communication networks: Tor and Freenet, and show how the two networks can be analyzed using our proposed fuzzy representation.
