Reliability-Based Windowed Decoding for Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes

In this letter, we propose a reliability-based windowed decoding scheme for spatially-coupled (SC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. To mitigate the error propagation along the sliding windowed decoder of the SC LDPC codes, a partial message reservation (PMR) method is proposed where only the reliable messages generated in the previous decoding window are reserved for the next decoding window. We also propose a partial syndrome check (PSC) stopping rule for each decoding window, in which only the complete VNs are checked. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme significantly improves the error floor performance compared to the sliding windowed decoder with the conventional weighted bit-flipping (WBF) algorithm.
