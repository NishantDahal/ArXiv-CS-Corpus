Semantic Interoperability Middleware Architecture for Heterogeneous Environmental Data Sources

Data heterogeneity hampers the effort to integrate and infer knowledge from vast heterogeneous data sources. An application case study is described, in which the objective was to semantically represent and integrate structured data from sensor devices with unstructured data in the form of local indigenous knowledge. However, the semantic representation of these heterogeneous data sources for environmental monitoring systems is not well supported yet. To combat the incompatibility issues, a dedicated semantic middleware solution is required. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a cross-domain middleware architecture that semantically integrates and generate inference from heterogeneous data sources. These use of semantic technology for predicting and forecasting complex environmental phenomenon will increase the degree of accuracy of environmental monitoring systems.
