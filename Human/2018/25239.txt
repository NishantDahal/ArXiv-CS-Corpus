Entanglement-assisted quantum codes from Galois LCD codes

Entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs) make use of preexisting entanglement between the sender and receiver to boost the rate of transmission. It is possible to construct an EAQECC from any classical linear code, unlike standard quantum error-correcting codes, which can only be constructed from dual-containing codes. However, the parameter of ebits $c$ is usually calculated by computer search. In this paper, we construct four classes of MDS entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (MDS EAQECCs) based on $k$-Galois LCD MDS codes for some certain code lengths, where the parameter of ebits $c$ can be easily generated algebraically and not by computational search. Moreover, the constructed four classes of EAQECCs are also maximal-entanglement EAQECCs.
