Sampler Design for Bayesian Personalized Ranking by Leveraging View Data

Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is a representative pairwise learning method for optimizing recommendation models. It is widely known that the performance of BPR depends largely on the quality of negative sampler. In this paper, we make two contributions with respect to BPR. First, we find that sampling negative items from the whole space is unnecessary and may even degrade the performance. Second, focusing on the purchase feedback of E-commerce, we propose an effective sampler for BPR by leveraging the additional view data. In our proposed sampler, users' viewed interactions are considered as an intermediate feedback between those purchased and unobserved interactions. The pairwise rankings of user preference among these three types of interactions are jointly learned, and a user-oriented weighting strategy is considered during learning process, which is more effective and flexible. Compared to the vanilla BPR that applies a uniform sampler on all candidates, our view-enhanced sampler enhances BPR with a relative improvement over 37.03% and 16.40% on two real-world datasets. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering users' additional feedback when modeling their preference on different items, which avoids sampling negative items indiscriminately and inefficiently.
