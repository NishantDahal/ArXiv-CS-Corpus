Private Text Classification

Confidential text corpora exist in many forms, but do not allow arbitrary sharing. We explore how to use such private corpora using privacy preserving text analytics. We construct typical text processing applications using appropriate privacy preservation techniques (including homomorphic encryption, Rademacher operators and secure computation). We set out the preliminary materials from Rademacher operators for binary classifiers, and then construct basic text processing approaches to match those binary classifiers.
