MADARi: A Web Interface for Joint Arabic Morphological Annotation and Spelling Correction

In this paper, we introduce MADARi, a joint morphological annotation and spelling correction system for texts in Standard and Dialectal Arabic. The MADARi framework provides intuitive interfaces for annotating text and managing the annotation process of a large number of sizable documents. Morphological annotation includes indicating, for a word, in context, its baseword, clitics, part-of-speech, lemma, gloss, and dialect identification. MADARi has a suite of utilities to help with annotator productivity. For example, annotators are provided with pre-computed analyses to assist them in their task and reduce the amount of work needed to complete it. MADARi also allows annotators to query a morphological analyzer for a list of possible analyses in multiple dialects or look up previously submitted analyses. The MADARi management interface enables a lead annotator to easily manage and organize the whole annotation process remotely and concurrently. We describe the motivation, design and implementation of this interface; and we present details from a user study working with this system.
