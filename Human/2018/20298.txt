Decentralized Search on Decentralized Web

Decentralized Web, or DWeb, is envisioned as a promising future of the Web. Being decentralized, there are no dedicated web servers in DWeb; Devices that retrieve web contents also serve their cached data to peer devices with straight privacy-preserving mechanisms. The fact that contents in DWeb are distributed, replicated, and decentralized lead to a number of key advantages over the conventional web. These include better resiliency against network partitioning and distributed-denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), and better browsing experiences in terms of shorter latency and higher throughput. Moreover, DWeb provides tamper-proof contents because each content piece is uniquely identified by a cryptographic hash. DWeb also clicks well with future Internet architectures, such as Named Data Networking (NDN).Search engines have been an inseparable element of the Web. Contemporary ("Web 2.0") search engines, however, provide centralized services. They are thus subject to DDoS attacks, insider threat, and ethical issues like search bias and censorship. As the web moves from being centralized to being decentralized, search engines ought to follow. We propose QueenBee, a decentralized search engine for DWeb. QueenBee is so named because worker bees and honeycomb are a common metaphor for distributed architectures, with the queen being the one that holds the colony together. QueenBee aims to revolutionize the search engine business model by offering incentives to both content providers and peers that participate in QueenBee's page indexing and ranking operations.
