Towards Dependability Metrics for Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks (NN) are instrumental in realizing highly-automated driving functionality. An overarching challenge is to identify best safety engineering practices for NN and other learning-enabled components. In particular, there is an urgent need for an adequate set of metrics for measuring all-important NN dependability attributes. We address this challenge by proposing a number of NN-specific and efficiently computable metrics for measuring NN dependability attributes including robustness, interpretability, completeness, and correctness.
