Video Analysis for Body-worn Cameras in Law Enforcement

The social conventions and expectations around the appropriate use of imaging and video has been transformed by the availability of video cameras in our pockets. The impact on law enforcement can easily be seen by watching the nightly news; more and more arrests, interventions, or even routine stops are being caught on cell phones or surveillance video, with both positive and negative consequences. This proliferation of the use of video has led law enforcement to look at the potential benefits of incorporating video capture systematically in their day to day operations. At the same time, recognition of the inevitability of widespread use of video for police operations has caused a rush to deploy all types of cameras, including body worn cameras. However, the vast majority of police agencies have limited experience in utilizing video to its full advantage, and thus do not have the capability to fully realize the value of expanding their video capabilities. In this white paper, we highlight some of the technology needs and challenges of body-worn cameras, and we relate these needs to the relevant state of the art in computer vision and multimedia research. We conclude with a set of recommendations.
