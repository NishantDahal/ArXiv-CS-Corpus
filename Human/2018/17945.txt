Achievable Rate maximization by Passive Intelligent Mirrors

This paper investigates the use of a Passive Intelligent Mirrors (PIM) to operate a multi-user MISO downlink communication. The transmit powers and the mirror reflection coefficients are designed for sum-rate maximization subject to individual QoS guarantees to the mobile users. The resulting problem is non-convex, and is tackled by combining alternating maximization with the majorization-minimization method. Numerical results show the merits of the proposed approach, and in particular that the use of PIM increases the system throughput by at least $40\%$, without requiring any additional energy consumption.
