Fairness-Aware Recommendation of Information Curators

This paper highlights our ongoing efforts to create effective information curator recommendation models that can be personalized for individual users, while maintaining important fairness properties. Concretely, we introduce the problem of information curator recommendation, provide a high-level overview of a fairness-aware recommender, and introduce some preliminary experimental evidence over a real-world Twitter dataset. We conclude with some thoughts on future directions.
