Tools of computer simulation in learning physics

The article deals with the problem of intellectual development of students in learning of physics by means of computer simulation. The main objectives of teaching computer simulation in learning of physics is the general outlook development, mastery of modelling as a method of knowledge, the development of practical skills of computer simulation, the implementation of inter-subject relationship, development and professionalization of computer skills, building skills of project activities. It is shown that the means of computer simulation of physical processes is one of the components of intellectual learning environment. It is spoken in detail about classification of simulation software such as software of demonstration and modelling and educational software tools which means environment of activity. Using software of demonstration and modelling allows for establish interdisciplinary communication, improve the quality of knowledge, create a positive motivation, enhance student interest in the subject. Educational software tools which means environment of activity is an intelligent educational systems, the use of which contributes to the understanding of the essence of the logical relationship between the original and models, especially the construction of models, form the students an idea of modelling as a method of learning about the world. Accordingly the adequate use of educational software tools which means environment of activity in learning of physics is contribute to the development of intelligence of students.
