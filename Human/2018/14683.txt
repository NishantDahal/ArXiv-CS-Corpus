A road to ultrafilter extensions

We propose a uniform method of constructing ultrafilter extensions from canonical models, which is based on the similarity between ultrafilters and maximal consistent sets. This method can help us understand why the known ultrafilter extensions of models for normal modal logics and for classical modal logics are so defined. We then apply this method to obtain ultrafilter extensions of models for Kripke contingency logics and for neighborhood contingency logics.
