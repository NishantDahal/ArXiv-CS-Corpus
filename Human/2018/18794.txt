A Note on the Shannon Entropy of Short Sequences

For source sequences of length L symbols we proposed to use a more realistic value to the usual benchmark of number of code letters by source letters. Our idea is based on a quantifier of information fluctuation of a source, F(U), which corresponds to the second central moment of the random variable that measures the information content of a source symbol. An alternative interpretation of typical sequences is additionally provided through this approach.
