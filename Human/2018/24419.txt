Compact QC-LDPC Block and SC-LDPC Convolutional Codes for Low-Latency Communications

Low decoding latency and complexity are two important requirements of channel codes used in many applications, like machine-to-machine communications. In this paper, we show how these requirements can be fulfilled by using some special quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check block codes and spatially coupled low-density parity-check convolutional codes that we denote as compact. They are defined by parity-check matrices designed according to a recent approach based on sequentially multiplied columns. This method allows obtaining codes with girth up to 12. Many numerical examples of practical codes are provided.
