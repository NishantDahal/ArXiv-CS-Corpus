Convex Hull Formulations for Mixed-Integer Multilinear Functions

In this paper, we present convex hull formulations for a mixed-integer, multilinear term/function (MIMF) that features products of multiple continuous and binary variables. We develop two equivalent convex relaxations of an MIMF and study their polyhedral properties in their corresponding higher-dimensional spaces. We numerically observe that the proposed formulations consistently perform better than state-of-the-art relaxation approaches.
