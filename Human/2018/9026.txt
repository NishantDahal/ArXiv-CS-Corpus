Enumerating All Subgraphs without Forbidden Induced Subgraphs via Multivalued Decision Diagrams

We propose a general method performed over multivalued decision diagrams that enumerates all subgraphs of an input graph that are characterized by input forbidden induced subgraphs. Our method combines elaborations of classical set operations and the developing construction technique, called the frontier based search, for multivalued decision diagrams. Using the algorithm, we enumerated all the chordal graphs of size at most 10 on multivalued decision diagrams.
