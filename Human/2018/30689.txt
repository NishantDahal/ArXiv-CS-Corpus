Leveraging mmWave Imaging and Communications for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

In this work, we propose a novel approach for high accuracy user localization by merging tools from both millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging and communications. The key idea of the proposed solution is to leverage mmWave imaging to construct a high-resolution 3D image of the line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) objects in the environment at one antenna array. Then, uplink pilot signaling with the user is used to estimate the angle-of-arrival and time-of-arrival of the dominant channel paths. By projecting the AoA and ToA information on the 3D mmWave images of the environment, the proposed solution can locate the user with a sub-centimeter accuracy. This approach has several gains. First, it allows accurate simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from a single standpoint, i.e., using only one antenna array. Second, it does not require any prior knowledge of the surrounding environment. Third, it can locate NLOS users, even if their signals experience more than one reflection and without requiring an antenna array at the user. The approach is evaluated using a hardware setup and its ability to provide sub-centimeter localization accuracy is shown.
