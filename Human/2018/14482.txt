Characterizing multiple instance datasets

In many pattern recognition problems, a single feature vector is not sufficient to describe an object. In multiple instance learning (MIL), objects are represented by sets (\emph{bags}) of feature vectors (\emph{instances}). This requires an adaptation of standard supervised classifiers in order to train and evaluate on these bags of instances. Like for supervised classification, several benchmark datasets and numerous classifiers are available for MIL. When performing a comparison of different MIL classifiers, it is important to understand the differences of the datasets, used in the comparison. Seemingly different (based on factors such as dimensionality) datasets may elicit very similar behaviour in classifiers, and vice versa. This has implications for what kind of conclusions may be drawn from the comparison results. We aim to give an overview of the variability of available benchmark datasets and some popular MIL classifiers. We use a dataset dissimilarity measure, based on the differences between the ROC-curves obtained by different classifiers, and embed this dataset dissimilarity matrix into a low-dimensional space. Our results show that conceptually similar datasets can behave very differently. We therefore recommend examining such dataset characteristics when making comparisons between existing and new MIL classifiers.
