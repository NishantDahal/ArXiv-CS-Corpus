A Cascaded Channel-Power Allocation for D2D Underlaid Cellular Networks Using Matching Theory

We consider a device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular network, where each cellular channel can be shared by several D2D pairs and only one channel can be allocated to each D2D pair. We try to maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs while limiting the interference to cellular links. Due to the lack of global information in large scale networks, resource allocation is hard to be implemented in a centralized way. Therefore, we design a novel distributed resource allocation scheme which is based on local information and requires little coordination and communication between D2D pairs. Specifically, we decompose the original problem into two cascaded subproblems, namely channel allocation and power control. The cascaded structure of our scheme enables us to cope with them respectively. Then a two-stage algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, we model the channel allocation problem as a many-to-one matching with externalities and try to find a strongly swap-stable matching. In the second stage, we adopt a pricing mechanism and develop an iterative two-step algorithm to solve the power control problem.
