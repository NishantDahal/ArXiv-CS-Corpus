Multi-View Graph Embedding Using Randomized Shortest Paths

Real-world data sets often provide multiple types of information about the same set of entities. This data is well represented by multi-view graphs, which consist of several distinct sets of edges over the same nodes. These can be used to analyze how entities interact from different viewpoints. Combining multiple views improves the quality of inferences drawn from the underlying data, which has increased interest in developing efficient multi-view graph embedding methods. We propose an algorithm, C-RSP, that generates a common (C) embedding of a multi-view graph using Randomized Shortest Paths (RSP). This algorithm generates a dissimilarity measure between nodes by minimizing the expected cost of a random walk between any two nodes across all views of a multi-view graph, in doing so encoding both the local and global structure of the graph. We test C-RSP on both real and synthetic data and show that it outperforms benchmark algorithms at embedding and clustering tasks while remaining computationally efficient.
