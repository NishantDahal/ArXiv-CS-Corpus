Predictive Liability Models and Visualizations of High Dimensional Retail Employee Data

Employee theft and dishonesty is a major contributor to loss in the retail industry. Retailers have reported the need for more automated analytic tools to assess the liability of their employees. In this work, we train and optimize several machine learning models for regression prediction and analysis on this data, which will help retailers identify and manage risky employees. Since the data we use is very high dimensional, we use feature selection techniques to identify the most contributing factors to an employee's assessed risk. We also use dimension reduction and data embedding techniques to present this dataset in a easy to interpret format.
