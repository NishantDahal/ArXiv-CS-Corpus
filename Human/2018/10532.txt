New expression on the performance of a novel multi-hop relay-assisted hybrid FSO / RF communication system

In this paper a novel multi-hop relay-assisted hybrid FSO / RF system is presented. It is assumed that direct RF connection between mobile users and source Base Station is impossible, therefore a relay connects RF users to the source Base Station via a FSO link. Source and destination Base Stations are connected via a multi-hop relay-assisted hybrid FSO / RF link. FSO link is investigated over moderate to saturate regimes of atmospheric turbulence. Also RF link is assumed to have Rayleigh fading. For the first time, new exact and asymptotic expressions are derived in closed-form for Bit Error Rate (BER) and the Outage Probability (P_out), of the proposed system. MATLAB simulations are performed to validate obtained analytical results. Results indicate that the proposed structure has low dependence on the number of users, therefore, the proposed structure is suitable for cells which encounter different populations during a day, because there is little performance difference between systems with different number of users. Also the proposed structure, at Negative exponential atmospheric turbulence has small dependence on the number of relays, but this dependence is a bit more for Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence. Therefore, the proposed structure increases capacity whereas maintaining performance of the system.
