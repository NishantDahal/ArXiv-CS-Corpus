Protograph LDPC Codes with Block Thresholds: Extension to Degree-1 and Generalized Nodes

Protograph low-density-parity-check (LDPC) are considered to design near-capacity low-rate codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC) and binary additive white Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) channel. For protographs with degree-one variable nodes and doubly-generalized LDPC (DGLDPC) codes, conditions are derived to ensure equality of bit-error threshold and block-error threshold. Using this condition, low-rate codes with block-error threshold close to capacity are designed and shown to have better error rate performance than other existing codes.
