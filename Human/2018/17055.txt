Artificial Intelligence based Smart Doctor using Decision Tree Algorithm

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has already made a huge impact on our current technological trends. Through AI developments, machines are now given power and intelligence to behave and work like human mind. In this research project, we propose and implement an AI based health physician system that would be able to interact with the patient, do the diagnosis and suggest quick remedy or treatment of their problem. A decision tree algorithm is implemented in order to follow a top down searching approach to identify and diagnose the problem and suggest a possible solution. The system uses a questionnaire based approach to query the user (patient) about various Symptoms, based on which a decision is made and a medicine is recommended
