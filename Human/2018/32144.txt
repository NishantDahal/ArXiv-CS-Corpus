Quantitative Simulations by Matrices

We introduce notions of simulation between semiring-weighted automata as models of quantitative systems. Our simulations are instances of the categorical/coalgebraic notions previously studied by Hasuo---hence soundness against language inclusion comes for free---but are concretely presented as matrices that are subject to linear inequality constraints. Pervasiveness of these formalisms allows us to exploit existing algorithms in: searching for a simulation, and hence verifying quantitative correctness that is formulated as language inclusion. Transformations of automata that aid search for simulations are introduced, too. This verification workflow is implemented for the plus-times and max-plus semirings. Furthermore, an extension to weighted tree automata is presented and implemented.
