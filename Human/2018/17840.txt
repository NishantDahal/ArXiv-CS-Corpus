Distance-based Kernels for Surrogate Model-based Neuroevolution

The topology optimization of artificial neural networks can be particularly difficult if the fitness evaluations require expensive experiments or simulations. For that reason, the optimization methods may need to be supported by surrogate models. We propose different distances for a suitable surrogate model, and compare them in a simple numerical test scenario.
