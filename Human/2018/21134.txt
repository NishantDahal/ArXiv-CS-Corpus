Haze Density Estimation via Modeling of Scattering Coefficients of Iso-depth Regions

Vision based haze density estimation is of practical implications for the purpose of precaution alarm and emergency reactions toward disastrous hazy weathers. In this paper, we introduce a haze density estimation framework based on modeling of scattering coefficients of iso-depth regions. A haze density metric of Normalized Scattering Coefficient (NSC) is proposed to measure current haze density level with reference to two reference scales. Iso-depth regions are determined via superpixel segmentation. Efficient searching and matching of iso-depth units could be carried out for measurements via unstationary cameras. A robust dark SP selection method is used to produce reliable predictions for most out-door scenarios.
