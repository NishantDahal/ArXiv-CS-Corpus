A Parametric Framework for Reversible Pi-Calculi

This paper presents a study of causality in a reversible, concurrent setting. There exist various notions of causality in pi-calculus, which differ in the treatment of parallel extrusions of the same name. In this paper we present a uniform framework for reversible pi-calculi that is parametric with respect to a data structure that stores information about an extrusion of a name. Different data structures yield different approaches to the parallel extrusion problem. We map three well-known causal semantics into our framework. We show that the (parametric) reversibility induced by our framework is causally-consistent and prove a causal correspondence between an appropriate instance of the framework and Boreale and Sangiorgi's causal semantics.
