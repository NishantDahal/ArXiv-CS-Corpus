Extended Comment on the Article "Consistent Development of a Beam-To-Beam Contact Algorithm via the Curve to Solid Beam Contact - Analysis for the Non-Frictional Case"

In the authors' previous works, novel finite element formulations for the contact interaction of slender beams have been proposed. In their recent article "Consistent Development of a Beam-To-Beam Contact Algorithm via the Curve to Solid Beam Contact - Analysis for the Non-Frictional Case", Konyukhov et al. refer extensively to the aforementioned works by the authors. However, many of these statements turn out to be scientifically incorrect and not only question the quality and correctness of the authors' previous works in a way that is neither objective nor justified but also might cause quite some confusion to researchers in this field. Hence, the authors find it necessary to comment on these statements, disprove them if incorrect, and demonstrate the correctness of the derivations made in their previous works.
