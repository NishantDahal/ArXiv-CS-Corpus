The Mathematics of Quantum-Enabled Applications on the D-Wave Quantum Computer

In this article we cover the canonical problem formulation necessary to program the D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU) and discuss how such a problem is compiled onto the QPU. We also cover recent joint work solving a problem from topological data analysis on the D-Wave quantum computer. The goal of the article is to cover the above from a mathematical viewpoint accessible to a wide range of levels to introduce people to a (small) portion of the mathematics encountered in this industry.
