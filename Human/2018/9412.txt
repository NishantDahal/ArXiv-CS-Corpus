Spatially coupled turbo-like codes: a new trade-off between waterfall and error floor

Spatially coupled turbo-like codes (SC-TCs) have been shown to have excellent decoding thresholds due to the threshold saturation effect. Furthermore, even for moderate block lengths, simulation results demonstrate very good bit error rate performance (BER) in the waterfall region. In this paper, we discuss the effect of spatial coupling on the performance of TCs in the finite block-length regime. We investigate the effect of coupling on the error-floor performance of SC-TCs by establishing conditions under which spatial coupling either preserves or improves the minimum distance of TCs. This allows us to investigate the error-floor performance of SC-TCs by performing a weight enumerator function (WEF) analysis of the corresponding uncoupled ensembles. While uncoupled TC ensembles with close-to-capacity performance exhibit a high error floor, our results show that SC-TCs can simultaneously approach capacity and achieve very low error floor.
