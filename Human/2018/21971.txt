On the Fairness of Quality-based Data Markets

For data pricing, data quality is a factor that must be considered. To keep the fairness of data market from the aspect of data quality, we proposed a fair data market that considers data quality while pricing. To ensure fairness, we first design a quality-driven data pricing strategy. Then based on the strategy, a fairness assurance mechanism for quality-driven data marketplace is proposed. In this mechanism, we ensure that savvy consumers cannot cheat the system and users can verify each consumption with Trusted Third Party (TTP) that they are charged properly. Based on this mechanism, we develop a fair quality-driven data market system. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of proposed techniques. Experimental results show that our quality-driven data pricing strategy could assign a reasonable price to the data according to data quality and the fairness assurance mechanism could effectively protect quality-driven data pricing from potential cheating.
