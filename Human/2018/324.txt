Relaxed Conditions for Secrecy in a Role-Based Specification

In this paper, we look at the property of secrecy through the growth of the protocol. Intuitively, an increasing protocol preserves the secret. For that, we need functions to estimate the security of messages. Here, we give relaxed conditions on the functions and on the protocol and we prove that an increasing protocol is correct when analyzed with functions that meet these conditions.
