CCP: Conflicts Check Protocol for Bitcoin Block Security

In this work, we present our early stage results on a Conflicts Check Protocol (CCP) that enables preventing potential attacks on bitcoin system. Based on the observation and discovery of a common symptom that many attacks may generate, CCP refines the current bitcoin systems by proposing a novel arbitration mechanism that is capable to determine the approval or abandon of certain transactions involved in confliction. This work examines the security issue of bitcoin from a new perspective, which may extend to a larger scope of attack analysis and prevention
