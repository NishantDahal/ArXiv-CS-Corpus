Towards Cytoskeleton Computers. A proposal

We propose a road-map to experimental implementation of cytoskeleton-based computing devices. An overall concept is described in the following. Collision-based cytoskeleton computers implement logical gates via interactions between travelling localisation (voltage solitons on AF/MT chains and AF/MT polymerisation wave fronts). Cytoskeleton networks are grown via programmable polymerisation. Data are fed into the AF/MT computing networks via electrical and optical means. Data signals are travelling localisations (solitons, conformational defects) at the network terminals. The computation is implemented via collisions between the localisations at structural gates (branching sites) of the AF/MT network. The results of the computation are recorded electrically and/or optically at the output terminals of the protein networks. As additional options, optical I/O elements are envisaged via direct excitation of the protein network and by coupling to fluorescent molecules.
