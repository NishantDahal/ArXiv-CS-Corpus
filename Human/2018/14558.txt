Disentangling Multiple Conditional Inputs in GANs

In this paper, we propose a method that disentangles the effects of multiple input conditions in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In particular, we demonstrate our method in controlling color, texture, and shape of a generated garment image for computer-aided fashion design. To disentangle the effect of input attributes, we customize conditional GANs with consistency loss functions. In our experiments, we tune one input at a time and show that we can guide our network to generate novel and realistic images of clothing articles. In addition, we present a fashion design process that estimates the input attributes of an existing garment and modifies them using our generator.
