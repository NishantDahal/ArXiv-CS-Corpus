Impact of UAV Antenna Configuration on Wireless Connectivity in Urban Environments

The growing presence of UAVs has led operators to explore the issue of how to provide wireless service to UAVs. The achieveable service quality will be affected by a number of factors, including the type of antenna that the UAVs are equipped with and whether to use existing cellular infrastructure or deploy dedicated ground stations to service these new user devices. In this paper we employ stochastic geometry to carry out an analysis of the UAV coverage probability that can be achieved with a network of dedicated ground stations using a sub-6GHz technology such as LTE under different deployment conditions, given different types of UAV antennas. We provide analytical expressions for the coverage probability; we also evaluate the performance of the GS network against the case where the UAVs are served by a typical terrestrial BS network.
