Sky detection and log illumination refinement for PDE-based hazy image contrast enhancement

This report presents the results of a sky detection technique used to improve the performance of a previously developed partial differential equation (PDE)-based hazy image enhancement algorithm. Additionally, a proposed alternative method utilizes a function for log illumination refinement to improve de-hazing results while avoiding over-enhancement of sky or homogeneous regions. The algorithms were tested with several benchmark and calibration images and compared with several standard algorithms from the literature. Results indicate that the algorithms yield mostly consistent results and surpasses several of the other algorithms in terms of colour and contrast enhancement in addition to improved edge visibility.
