Interference Alignment Schemes Using Latin Square for Kx3 MIMO X Channel

In this paper, we study an interference alignment (IA) scheme with finite time extension and beamformer selection method with low computational complexity for X channel. An IA scheme with a chain structure by the Latin square is proposed for Kx3 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) X channel. Since the proposed scheme can have a larger set of possible beamformers than the conventional schemes, its performance is improved by the efficient beamformer selection for a given channel. Also, we propose a condition number (CN) based beamformer selection method with low computational complexity and its performance improvement is numerically verified.
