Evaluation of CT Scan Usability for Saudi Arabian Users

- Like consumer electronic products, medical devices are becoming more complicated, with performance doubling every two years. With multiple commands and systems to negotiate, cognitive load can make it difficult for users to execute commands effectively. In the case of medical devices, which use advanced technology and require multidisciplinary inputs for design and development, cognitive workload is a significant factor. As these devices are very expensive and operators require specialized training, effective and economical methods are needed to evaluate the user experience. Heuristic evaluation is an effective method of identifying major usability problems and related issues. This study used heuristic evaluation to assess the usability of a CT scan and associated physical and mental loads for Saudi Arabian users. The findings indicate a gender difference in terms of consistency, flexibility, and document attributes, with a statistically significant gender difference in mental load.
