Convexity Shape Prior for Level Set based Image Segmentation Method

We propose a geometric convexity shape prior preservation method for variational level set based image segmentation methods. Our method is built upon the fact that the level set of a convex signed distanced function must be convex. This property enables us to transfer a complicated geometrical convexity prior into a simple inequality constraint on the function. An active set based Gauss-Seidel iteration is used to handle this constrained minimization problem to get an efficient algorithm. We apply our method to region and edge based level set segmentation models including Chan-Vese (CV) model with guarantee that the segmented region will be convex. Experimental results show the effectiveness and quality of the proposed model and algorithm.
