Of Wines and Reviews: Measuring and Modeling the Vivino Wine Social Network

This paper presents an analysis of social experiences around wine consumption through the lens of Vivino, a social network for wine enthusiasts with over 26 million users worldwide. We compare users' perceptions of various wine types and regional styles across both New and Old World wines, examining them across price ranges, vintages, regions, varietals, and blends. Among other things, we find that ratings provided by Vivino users are not biased by cost. We then study how wine characteristics, language in wine reviews, and the distribution of wine ratings can be combined to develop prediction models. More specifically, we model user behavior to develop a regression model for predicting wine ratings, and a classifier for determining user review preferences.
