Learning to Singulate Objects using a Push Proposal Network

Learning to act in unstructured environments, such as cluttered piles of objects, poses a substantial challenge for manipulation robots. We present a novel neural network-based approach that separates unknown objects in clutter by selecting favourable push actions. Our network is trained from data collected through autonomous interaction of a PR2 robot with randomly organized tabletop scenes. The model is designed to propose meaningful push actions based on over-segmented RGB-D images. We evaluate our approach by singulating up to 8 unknown objects in clutter. We demonstrate that our method enables the robot to perform the task with a high success rate and a low number of required push actions. Our results based on real-world experiments show that our network is able to generalize to novel objects of various sizes and shapes, as well as to arbitrary object configurations.
