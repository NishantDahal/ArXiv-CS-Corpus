Distributed Frequency Offsets Estimation

In this paper, we provide a distributed frequency offset estimation algorithm based on a variant of belief propagation (BP). Each agent in the network pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that there is no frequency offset from the desired carrier frequency between each pair of transceiver. The pre-compensated offset for each agent is computed in a distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed network. The updating procedure of the variant of BP is designed in a broadcasting fashion to reduce communication burden. It is rigorously proved that the proposed algorithm is convergence guaranteed. Simulations show that this method achieves almost the optimal frequency compensation accuracy with an error approaching the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound.
