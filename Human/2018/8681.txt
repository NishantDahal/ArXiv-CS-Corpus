Review on Optical Image Hiding and Watermarking Techniques

Information security is a critical issue in modern society and image watermarking can effectively prevent unauthorized information access. Optical image watermarking techniques generally have advantages of parallel high-speed processing and multi-dimensional capabilities compared with digital approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the research works related to optical image hiding and watermarking techniques conducted in the past decade. The past research works are focused on two major aspects, various optical systems for image hiding and the methods for embedding optical system output into a host image. A summary of the state-of-the-art works is made from these two perspectives.
