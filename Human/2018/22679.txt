Inverse analysis of traction-separation relationship based on sequentially linear approach

Traction-separation relationship is an important material characteristic describing the fracture behaviour of quasi-brittle solids. A new numerical scheme for identification of the traction-separation relation by inverse analysis of data obtained from various types of fracture tests is proposed. Due to employing the concept of sequentially linear analysis, the method exhibits a superior numerical stability and versatility. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on examples involving identification of the traction-separation relationship using experimental data from various test configurations.
