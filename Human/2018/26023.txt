Finding all Maximal Area Parallelograms in a Convex Polygon

Polygon inclusion problems have been studied extensively in geometric optimization. In this paper, we consider the variant of computing the maximum area parallelograms (MAPs) and all the locally maximal area parallelograms (LMAPs) in a given convex polygon. By proving and utilizing several structural properties of the LMAPs, we compute all of them (including all the MAPs) in $O(n^2)$ time, where $n$ denotes the number of edges of the given polygon. In addition, we prove that the LMAPs interleave each other and thus the number of LMAPs is $O(n)$. We discuss applications of our result to, among others, the problem of computing the maximum area centrally-symmetric convex body inside a convex polygon, and the simplest case of the Heilbronn triangle problem.
