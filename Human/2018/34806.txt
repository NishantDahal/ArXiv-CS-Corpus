Quantum Authentication Protocols for GSM

Security deficiencies and bugs in the Authentication of SIM cards in Global Systems for Mobile (GSM) have led us to present new protocols for these networks using the principles of quantum cryptography. In this paper first, we provide a protocol for detecting and removing SIM card that has a copy, using three entangle particles source and quantum channel when the original SIM card and its copy simultaneously logging in the mobile network. Then, another protocol based on the use of quantum memory (which is embedded in the SIM card) is presented. Both of these protocols can use to authenticate and remove SIM card that has a copy.
