Low-Rank Inducing Norms with Optimality Interpretations

Optimization problems with rank constraints appear in many diverse fields such as control, machine learning and image analysis. Since the rank constraint is non-convex, these problems are often approximately solved via convex relaxations. Nuclear norm regularization is the prevailing convexifying technique for dealing with these types of problem. This paper introduces a family of low-rank inducing norms and regularizers which includes the nuclear norm as a special case. A posteriori guarantees on solving an underlying rank constrained optimization problem with these convex relaxations are provided. We evaluate the performance of the low-rank inducing norms on three matrix completion problems. In all examples, the nuclear norm heuristic is outperformed by convex relaxations based on other low-rank inducing norms. For two of the problems there exist low-rank inducing norms that succeed in recovering the partially unknown matrix, while the nuclear norm fails. These low-rank inducing norms are shown to be representable as semi-definite programs. Moreover, these norms have cheaply computable proximal mappings, which makes it possible to also solve problems of large size using first-order methods.
