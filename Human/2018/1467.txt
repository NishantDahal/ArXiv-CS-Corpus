Semantic Modeling with Foundries

We analyze challenges for the development of the Human Activities and Infrastructures Foundry. We explore a rich semantic modeling approach to describe two Korean ceramic water droppers used to mix ink for calligraphy, how they were produced and the reasons for their differing aesthetic. Our modeling supports schema and allows for transitions of Entities based on the relationships to other Entities with which they are associated. We explore the similarity of our approach to object-oriented analysis and modeling.
