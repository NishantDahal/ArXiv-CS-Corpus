Kalman-based Spectro-Temporal ECG Analysis using Deep Convolutional Networks for Atrial Fibrillation Detection

In this article, we propose a novel ECG classification framework for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection using spectro-temporal representation (i.e., time varying spectrum) and deep convolutional networks. In the first step we use a Bayesian spectro-temporal representation based on the estimation of time-varying coefficients of Fourier series using Kalman filter and smoother. Next, we derive an alternative model based on a stochastic oscillator differential equation to accelerate the estimation of the spectro-temporal representation in lengthy signals. Finally, after comparative evaluations of different convolutional architectures, we propose an efficient deep convolutional neural network to classify the 2D spectro-temporal ECG data.
  The ECG spectro-temporal data are classified into four different classes: AF, non-AF normal rhythm (Normal), non-AF abnormal rhythm (Other), and noisy segments (Noisy). The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated and scored with the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2017 dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the overall F1 score of 80.2%, which is in line with the state-of-the-art algorithms.
