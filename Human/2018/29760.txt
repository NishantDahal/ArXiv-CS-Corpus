Tracking Systems as Thinging Machine: A Case Study of a Service Company

Object tracking systems play important roles in tracking moving objects and overcoming problems such as safety, security and other location-related applications. Problems arise from the difficulties in creating a well-defined and understandable description of tracking systems. Nowadays, describing such processes results in fragmental representation that most of the time leads to difficulties creating documentation. Additionally, once learned by assigned personnel, repeated tasks result in them continuing on autopilot in a way that often degrades their effectiveness. This paper proposes the modeling of tracking systems in terms of a new diagrammatic methodology to produce engineering-like schemata. The resultant diagrams can be used in documentation, explanation, communication, education and control.
