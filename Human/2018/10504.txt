Introducing an innovative robot-based mobile platform for programming learning

The present study introduces an Android based application that focuses on promoting students' learning experience when interacting with Lego Mindstorms Robotic Kit NXT. A thorough investigation of the current literature reveals that there are numerous applications attempting to overcome the limitations of Lego platform which, however, appear to only partially succeed in significantly improving children's engagement in fruitful learning. Their main limitations are that they either function on an elemental level or suffer from a general lack of creating effectively room for children to test their abilities and other curiosities. Aiming at confronting these limitations, the proposed android application, which is referred to as MyNXT, was created and presented. MyNXT offers direct access control along with the choice to program using simple linear logic through an easy and a user friendly environment with built in instructions for all ages. Concluding, the proposed application constitutes a stepping to an educating platform, which can facilitate the learning needs of children in contemporary times.
