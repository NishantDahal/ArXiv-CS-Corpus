Asynchronous Neighbor Discovery Using Coupled Compressive Sensing

The neighbor discovery paradigm finds wide application in Internet of Things networks, where the number of active devices is orders of magnitude smaller than the total device population. Designing low-complexity schemes for asynchronous neighbor discovery has recently gained significant attention from the research community. Concurrently, a divide-and-conquer framework, referred to as coupled compressive sensing, has been introduced for the synchronous massive random access channel. This work adapts this novel algorithm to the problem of asynchronous neighbor discovery with unknown transmission delays. Simulation results suggest that the proposed scheme requires much fewer transmissions to achieve a performance level akin to that of state-of-the-art techniques.
