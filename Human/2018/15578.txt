Developing Cyber Peacekeeping: Observation, Monitoring and Reporting

Cyber peacekeeping is an emerging and multi-disciplinary field of research, touching upon technical, political and societal domains of thought. In this article we build upon previous works by developing the cyber peacekeeping activity of observation, monitoring and reporting. We take a practical approach: describing a scenario in which two countries request UN support in drawing up and overseeing a ceasefire which includes cyber terms. We explore how a cyber peacekeeping operation could start up and discuss the challenges it will face. The article makes a number of proposals, including the use of a virtual collaborative environment to bring multiple benefits. We conclude by summarising our findings, and describing where further work lies.
