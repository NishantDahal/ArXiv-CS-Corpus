Twisted Gabidulin Codes in the GPT Cryptosystem

In this paper, we investigate twisted Gabidulin codes in the GPT code-based public-key cryptosystem. We show that Overbeck's attack is not feasible for a subfamily of twisted Gabidulin codes. The resulting key sizes are significantly lower than in the original McEliece system and also slightly smaller than in Loidreau's unbroken GPT variant.
