Analytical Models of the Performance of C-V2X Mode 4 Vehicular Communications

The C-V2X or LTE-V standard has been designed to support V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications. The standard is an evolution of LTE, and it has been published by the 3GPP in Release 14. This new standard introduces the C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4 that is specifically designed for V2V communications using the PC5 sidelink interface without any cellular infrastructure support. In Mode 4, vehicles autonomously select and manage their radio resources. Mode 4 is highly relevant since V2V safety applications cannot depend on the availability of infrastructure-based cellular coverage. This paper presents the first analytical models of the communication performance of C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. In particular, the paper presents analytical models for the average PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver, and for the four different types of transmission errors that can be encountered in C-V2X Mode 4. The models are validated for a wide range of transmission parameters and traffic densities. To this aim, this study compares the results obtained with the analytical models to those obtained with a C-V2X Mode 4 simulator implemented over Veins.
