Turbo-like Iterative Multi-user Receiver Design for 5G Non-orthogonal Multiple Access

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NoMA) as an efficient way of radio resource sharing has been identified as a promising technology in 5G to help improving system capacity, user connectivity, and service latency in 5G communications. This paper provides a brief overview of the progress of NoMA transceiver study in 3GPP, with special focus on the design of turbo-like iterative multi-user (MU) receivers. There are various types of MU receivers depending on the combinations of MU detectors and interference cancellation (IC) schemes. Link-level simulations show that expectation propagation algorithm (EPA) with hybrid parallel interference cancellation (PIC) is a promising MU receiver, which can achieve fast convergence and similar performance as message passing algorithm (MPA) with much lower complexity.
