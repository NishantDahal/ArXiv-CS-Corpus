To Post or Not to Post: Using Online Trends to Predict Popularity of Offline Content

Predicting the popularity of online content has attracted much attention in the past few years. In news rooms, for instance, journalists and editors are keen to know, as soon as possible, the articles that will bring the most traffic into their website. The relevant literature includes a number of approaches and algorithms to perform this forecasting. Most of the proposed methods require monitoring the popularity of content during some time after it is posted, before making any longer-term prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach for predicting the popularity of news articles before they go online. Our approach complements existing content-based methods, and is based on a number of observations regarding article similarity and topicality. First, the popularity of a new article is correlated with the popularity of similar articles of recent publication. Second, the popularity of the new article is related to the recent historical popularity of its main topic. Based on these observations, we use time series forecasting to predict the number of visits an article will receive. Our experiments, conducted on a real data collection of articles in an international news website, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
