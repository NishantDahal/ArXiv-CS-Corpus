Query-Efficient Black-box Adversarial Examples (superceded)

Note that this paper is superceded by "Black-Box Adversarial Attacks with Limited Queries and Information."
  Current neural network-based image classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples, even in the black-box setting, where the attacker is limited to query access without access to gradients. Previous methods --- substitute networks and coordinate-based finite-difference methods --- are either unreliable or query-inefficient, making these methods impractical for certain problems.
  We introduce a new method for reliably generating adversarial examples under more restricted, practical black-box threat models. First, we apply natural evolution strategies to perform black-box attacks using two to three orders of magnitude fewer queries than previous methods. Second, we introduce a new algorithm to perform targeted adversarial attacks in the partial-information setting, where the attacker only has access to a limited number of target classes. Using these techniques, we successfully perform the first targeted adversarial attack against a commercially deployed machine learning system, the Google Cloud Vision API, in the partial information setting.
