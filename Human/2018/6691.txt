Boosting the Performance of Content Centric Networking using Delay Tolerant Networking Mechanisms

Content-centric networking (CCN) introduces a paradigm shift from a host centric to an information centric communication model for future Internet architectures. It supports the retrieval of a particular content regardless of the physical location of the content. Content caching and content delivery networks are the most popular approaches to deal with the inherent issues of content delivery on the Internet that are caused by its design. Moreover, intermittently connected mobile environments or disruptive networks present a significant challenge to CCN deployment. In this paper, we consider the possibility of using mobile users in improving the efficiency of content delivery. Mobile users are producing a significant fraction of the total Internet traffic, and modern mobile devices have enough storage to cache the downloaded content that may interest other mobile users for a short period too. We present an analytical model of the CCN framework that integrates a delay tolerant networking architecture into the native CCN, and we present large-scale simulation results. Caching on mobile devices can improve the content retrieval time by more than 50%, while the fraction of the requests that are delivered from other mobile devices can be more than 75% in many cases.
