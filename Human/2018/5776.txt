Image Registration Based Flicker Solving in Video Face Replacement and Analysis Based Sub-pixel Image Registration

In this paper, a framework of video face replacement is proposed and it deals with the flicker of swapped face in video sequence. This framework contains two main innovations: 1) the technique of image registration is exploited to align the source and target video faces for eliminating the flicker or jitter of the segmented video face sequence; 2) a fast subpixel image registration method is proposed for farther accuracy and efficiency. Unlike the priori works, it minimizes the overlapping region and takes spatiotemporal coherence into account. Flicker in resulted videos is usually caused by the frequently changed bound of the blending target face and unregistered faces between and along video sequences. The subpixel image registration method is proposed to solve the flicker problem. During the alignment process, integer pixel registration is formulated by maximizing the similarity of images with down sampling strategy speeding up the process and sub-pixel image registration is a single-step image match via analytic method. Experimental results show the proposed algorithm reduces the computation time and gets a high accuracy when conducting experiments on different data sets.
