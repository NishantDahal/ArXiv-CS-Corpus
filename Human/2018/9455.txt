Short Proofs for Some Symmetric Quantified Boolean Formulas

We exploit symmetries to give short proofs for two prominent formula families of QBF proof complexity. On the one hand, we employ symmetry breakers. On the other hand, we enrich the (relatively weak) QBF resolution calculus Q-Res with the symmetry rule and obtain separations to powerful QBF calculi.
