Constructing LDPC Codes from Partition and Latin-Style Splicing

A novel method guaranteeing nondecreasing girth is presented for constructing longer low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from shorter ones. The parity-check matrix of a shorter base code is decomposed into N (N>=2) non-overlapping components with the same size. Then, these components are combined together to form the parity-check matrix of a longer code, according to a given N*N Latin square. To illustrate this method, longer quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes are obtained with girth at least eight and satisfactory performance, via shorter QC-LDPC codes with girth eight but poor performance. The proposed method naturally includes several well-known methods as special cases, but is much more general compared with these existing approaches.
