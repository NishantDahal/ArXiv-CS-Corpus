Iterative Antenna Selection for Secrecy Enhancement in Massive MIMO Wiretap Channels

The growth of interest in massive MIMO systems is accompanied with hardware cost and computational complexity. Antenna selection is an efficient approach to overcome this cost-plus-complexity issue which also enhances the secrecy performance in wiretap settings. Optimal antenna selection requires exhaustive search which is computationally infeasible for settings with large dimensions. This paper develops an iterative algorithm for antenna selection in massive multiuser MIMO wiretap settings. The algorithm takes a stepwise approach to find a suitable subset of transmit antennas. Numerical investigations depict a significant enhancement in the secrecy performance.
