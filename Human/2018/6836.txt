Fast and Accurate Reconstruction of Compressed Color Light Field

Light field photography has been studied thoroughly in recent years. One of its drawbacks is the need for multi-lens in the imaging. To compensate that, compressed light field photography has been proposed to tackle the trade-offs between the spatial and angular resolutions. It obtains by only one lens, a compressed version of the regular multi-lens system. The acquisition system consists of a dedicated hardware followed by a decompression algorithm, which usually suffers from high computational time. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient neural network that recovers a high-quality color light field from a single coded image. Unlike previous works, we compress the color channels as well, removing the need for a CFA in the imaging system. Our approach outperforms existing solutions in terms of recovery quality and computational complexity. We propose also a neural network for depth map extraction based on the decompressed light field, which is trained in an unsupervised manner without the ground truth depth map.
