Joint Power and Time Allocation for NOMA-MEC Offloading

This paper considers non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted mobile edge computing (MEC), where the power and time allocation is jointly optimized to reduce the energy consumption of offloading. Closed-form expressions for the optimal power and time allocation solutions are obtained and used to establish the conditions for determining whether conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA), pure NOMA or hybrid NOMA should be used for MEC offloading.
