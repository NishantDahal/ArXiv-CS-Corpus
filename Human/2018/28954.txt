The Secure Two-Receiver Broadcast Channel With One-Sided Receiver Side Information

This paper studies the problem of secure communcation over the two-receiver discrete memoryless broadcast channel with one-sided receiver side information and with a passive eavesdropper. We proposed a coding scheme which is based upon the superposition-Marton framework. Secrecy techniques such as the one-time pad, Carleial-Hellman secrecy coding and Wyner serecy coding are applied to ensure individual secrecy. This scheme is shown to be capacity achieving for some cases of the degraded broadcast channel. We also notice that one-sided receiver side information provides the advantage of rate region improvement, in particular when it is available at the weaker legitimate receiver.
