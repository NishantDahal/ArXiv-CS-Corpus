A continuum of incomplete intermediate logics

This paper generalizes the 1977 paper of V.B. Shehtman, which constructed the first Kripke incomplete intermediate logic, by presenting a continuum of such logics. This version fixes an error in my simplified proof of incompleteness of Shehtman's original logic.
