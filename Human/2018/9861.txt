Optical Network Programmability - Requirements and Applications

Datacenter operators and internet content providers require optical network programmability to efficiently interconnect distributed datacenters. This paper describes the requirements, applications and use cases for optical network programmability. Based on application scenarios, open northbound APIs with different levels of control and abstraction to address different network operator requirements which are defined. For their illustration, use cases for optical network programmability show current research directions.
