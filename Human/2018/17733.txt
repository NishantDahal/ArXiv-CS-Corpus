Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection via End-to-end Deep Learning of Convolutional Neural Networks

This article presents the design, experiments and results of our solution submitted to the 2018 ISIC challenge: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection. We design a pipeline using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for a Lesion Boundary Segmentation task and a Lesion Diagnosis task.
