Matching Convolutional Neural Networks without Priors about Data

We propose an extension of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to graph-structured data, including strided convolutions and data augmentation on graphs.
  Our method matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art CNNs when applied on images, without any prior about their 2D regular structure.
  On fMRI data, we obtain a significant gain in accuracy compared with existing graph-based alternatives.
