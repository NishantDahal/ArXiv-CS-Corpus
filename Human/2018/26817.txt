Cops and Robbers on Toroidal Chess Graphs

We investigate multiple variants of the game Cops and Robbers. Playing it on an $n \times n$ toroidal chess graph, the game is varied by defining moves for cops and robbers differently, always mimicking moves of certain chess pieces. In these cases, the cop number is completely determined.
