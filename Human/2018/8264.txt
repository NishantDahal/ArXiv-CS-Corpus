Modelling customer online behaviours with neural networks: applications to conversion prediction and advertising retargeting

In this paper, we apply neural networks into digital marketing world for the purpose of better targeting the potential customers. To do so, we model the customer online behaviours using dedicated neural network architectures. Starting from user searched keywords in a search engine to the landing page and different following pages, until the user left the site, we model the whole visited journey with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), together with Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) that can take into account of the semantic meaning of user searched keywords and different visited page names. With such model, we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the conversion rates of each potential customer in the future visiting. We believe our concept and the preliminary promising results in this paper enable the use of largely available customer online behaviours data for advanced digital marketing analysis.
