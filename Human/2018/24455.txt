Wideband mmWave Channel Estimation for Hybrid Massive MIMO with Low-Precision ADCs

In this article, we investigate channel estimation for wideband millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) under hybrid architecture with lowprecision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To design channel estimation for the hybrid structure, both analog processing components and frequency-selective digital combiners need to be optimized. The proposed channel estimator follows the typical linear-minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) structure and applies for an arbitrary channel model. Moreover, for sparsity channels as in mmWave, the proposed estimator performs more efficiently by incorporating orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) to mitigate quantization noise caused by low-precision ADCs. Consequently, the proposed estimator outperforms conventional ones as demonstrated by computer simulation results.
