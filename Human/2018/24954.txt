Emergence of Human-comparable Balancing Behaviors by Deep Reinforcement Learning

This paper presents a hierarchical framework based on deep reinforcement learning that learns a diversity of policies for humanoid balance control. Conventional zero moment point based controllers perform limited actions during under-actuation, whereas the proposed framework can perform human-like balancing behaviors such as active push-off of ankles. The learning is done through the design of an explainable reward based on physical constraints. The simulated results are presented and analyzed. The successful emergence of human-like behaviors through deep reinforcement learning proves the feasibility of using an AI-based approach for learning humanoid balancing control in a unified framework.
