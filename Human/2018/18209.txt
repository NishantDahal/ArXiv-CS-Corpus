QoS management mechanisms for Enhanced Living Environments in IoT

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is expected to bring ubiquitous intelligence through new applications in order to enhance living and other environments. Several research and standardization studies are now focused on the Middleware level of the underlying communication system. For this level, several challenges need to be considered, among them the Quality of Service (QoS) issue. The Autonomic Computing paradigm is now recognized as a promising approach to help communication and other systems to self-adapt when the context is changing. With the aim to promote the vision of an autonomic Middleware-level QoS management for IoT-based systems, this paper proposes a set of QoS-oriented mechanisms that can be dynamically executed at the Middleware level to correct QoS degradation. The benefits of the proposed mechanisms are also illustrated for a concrete case of Enhanced Living Environment.
