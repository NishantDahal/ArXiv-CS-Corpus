Intracranial Error Detection via Deep Learning

Deep learning techniques have revolutionized the field of machine learning and were recently successfully applied to various classification problems in noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). However, these methods were so far only rarely evaluated for use in intracranial EEG. We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and characterize the error-related brain response as measured in 24 intracranial EEG recordings. Decoding accuracies of CNNs were significantly higher than those of a regularized linear discriminant analysis. Using time-resolved deep decoding, it was possible to classify errors in various regions in the human brain, and further to decode errors over 200 ms before the actual erroneous button press, e.g., in the precentral gyrus. Moreover, deeper networks performed better than shallower networks in distinguishing correct from error trials in all-channel decoding. In single recordings, up to 100 % decoding accuracy was achieved. Visualization of the networks' learned features indicated that multivariate decoding on an ensemble of channels yields related, albeit non-redundant information compared to single-channel decoding. In summary, here we show the usefulness of deep learning for both intracranial error decoding and mapping of the spatio-temporal structure of the human error processing network.
