Locally Recoverable codes from algebraic curves with separated variables

A Locally Recoverable code is an error-correcting code such that any erasure in a single coordinate of a codeword can be recovered from a small subset of other coordinates. We study Locally Recoverable Algebraic Geometry codes arising from certain curves defined by equations with separated variables. The recovery of erasures is obtained by means of Lagrangian interpolation in general, and simply by one addition in some particular cases.
