Deep Learning For Computer Vision Tasks: A review

Deep learning has recently become one of the most popular sub-fields of machine learning owing to its distributed data representation with multiple levels of abstraction. A diverse range of deep learning algorithms are being employed to solve conventional artificial intelligence problems. This paper gives an overview of some of the most widely used deep learning algorithms applied in the field of computer vision. It first inspects the various approaches of deep learning algorithms, followed by a description of their applications in image classification, object identification, image extraction and semantic segmentation in the presence of noise. The paper concludes with the discussion of the future scope and challenges for construction and training of deep neural networks.
