Local Homology of Word Embeddings

Topological data analysis (TDA) has been widely used to make progress on a number of problems. However, it seems that TDA application in natural language processing (NLP) is at its infancy. In this paper we try to bridge the gap by arguing why TDA tools are a natural choice when it comes to analysing word embedding data. We describe a parallelisable unsupervised learning algorithm based on local homology of datapoints and show some experimental results on word embedding data. We see that local homology of datapoints in word embedding data contains some information that can potentially be used to solve the word sense disambiguation problem.
