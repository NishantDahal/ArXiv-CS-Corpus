Reduced Dimensional Optimal Vector Linear Index Codes for Index Coding Problems with Symmetric Neighboring and Consecutive Side-information

A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information (SNCS) has $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_k$ wanting the $k$th message $x_k$ and having the side-information $\mathcal{K}_k=\{x_{k-U},\dots,x_{k-2},x_{k-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+1}, x_{k+2},\dots,x_{k+D}\}$. The single unicast index coding problem with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information, SUICP(SNCS), is motivated by topological interference management problems in wireless communication networks. Maleki, Cadambe and Jafar obtained the symmetric capacity of this SUICP(SNCS) and proposed optimal length codes by using Vandermonde matrices. In our earlier work, we gave optimal length $(U+1)$-dimensional vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNCS) satisfying some conditions on $K,D$ and $U$ \cite{VaR1}. In this paper, for SUICP(SNCS) with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we construct optimal length $\frac{U+1}{\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)}$-dimensional vector linear index codes. We prove that the constructed vector linear index code is of minimal dimension if $\text{gcd}(K-D+U,U+1)$ is equal to $\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)$. The proposed construction gives optimal length scalar linear index codes for the SUICP(SNCS) if $(U+1)$ divides both $K$ and $D-U$. The proposed construction is independent of field size and works over every field. We give a low-complexity decoding for the SUICP(SNCS). By using the proposed decoding method, every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols).
