A Fuzzy System based Approach to Extend Network Lifetime for En-Route Filtering Schemes in WSNs

Wireless sensor networks suffer from false report injection attacks. This results in energy drain over sensor nodes on the event traversal route. Novel en-route filtering schemes counter this problem by filtering these attacks on designated verification nodes. However, these filtering schemes among other limitations inherently are network lifetime inefficient. Generally, report traversal paths and verification nodes are also fixed. In this paper, we cater these limitations in our proposed scheme. Simulation experiments results show that proposed schemes outperforms existing en-route filtering schemes in networks lifetime. We employed a Fuzzy Logic System to select forwarding nodes from candidate nodes based on current network conditions. Proposed scheme gains in network lifetime, and energy-efficiency while having comparable false report filtering efficiency.
