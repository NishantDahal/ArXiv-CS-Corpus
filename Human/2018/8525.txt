Three-Dimensional GPU-Accelerated Active Contours for Automated Localization of Cells in Large Images

Cell segmentation in microscopy is a challenging problem, since cells are often asymmetric and densely packed. This becomes particularly challenging for extremely large images, since manual intervention and processing time can make segmentation intractable. In this paper, we present an efficient and highly parallel formulation for symmetric three-dimensional (3D) contour evolution that extends previous work on fast two-dimensional active contours. We provide a formulation for optimization on 3D images, as well as a strategy for accelerating computation on consumer graphics hardware. The proposed software takes advantage of Monte-Carlo sampling schemes in order to speed up convergence and reduce thread divergence. Experimental results show that this method provides superior performance for large 2D and 3D cell segmentation tasks when compared to existing methods on large 3D brain images.
