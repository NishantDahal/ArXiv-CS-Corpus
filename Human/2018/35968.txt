Scheduling Distributed Resources in Heterogeneous Private Clouds

We first consider the static problem of allocating resources to ( i.e. , scheduling) multiple distributed application framework s, possibly with different priorities and server preferences , in a private cloud with heterogeneous servers. Several fai r scheduling mechanisms have been proposed for this purpose. We extend pr ior results on max-min and proportional fair scheduling to t his constrained multiresource and multiserver case for generi c fair scheduling criteria. The task efficiencies (a metric r elated to proportional fairness) of max-min fair allocations found b y progressive filling are compared by illustrative examples . They show that "server specific" fairness criteria and those that are b ased on residual (unreserved) resources are more efficient.
