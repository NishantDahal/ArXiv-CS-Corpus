Single Snapshot Super-Resolution DOA Estimation for Arbitrary Array Geometries

We address the problem of search-free direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sensor arrays of arbitrary geometry under the challenging conditions of a single snapshot and coherent sources. We extend a method of searchfree super-resolution beamforming, originally applicable only for uniform linear arrays, to arrays of arbitrary geometry. The infinite dimensional primal atomic norm minimization problem in continuous angle domain is converted to a dual problem. By exploiting periodicity, the dual function is then represented with a trigonometric polynomial using a truncated Fourier series. A linear rule of thumb is derived for selecting the minimum number of Fourier coefficients required for accurate polynomial representation, based on the distance of the farthest sensor from a reference point. The dual problem is then expressed as a semidefinite program and solved efficiently. Finally, the searchfree DOA estimates are obtained through polynomial rooting, and source amplitudes are recovered through least squares. Simulations using circular and random planar arrays show perfect DOA estimation in noise-free cases.
