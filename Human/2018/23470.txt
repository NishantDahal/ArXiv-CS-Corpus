On recovery of signals with single point spectrum degeneracy

The paper study recovery problem for discrete time signals with a finite number of missing values. The paper establishes recoverability of these missing values for signals with Z-transform vanishing with a certain rate at a single point.
  The transfer functions for the corresponding recovering kernels are presented explicitly.
  Some robustness of the recovery with respect to data truncation or noise contamination is established.
