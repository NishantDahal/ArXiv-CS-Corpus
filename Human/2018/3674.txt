Optimal Scheduling across Heterogeneous Air Interfaces of LTE/WiFi Aggregation

LTE/WiFi Aggregation (LWA) provides a promising approach to relieve data traffic congestion in licensed bands by leveraging unlicensed bands. Critical challenges arise from provisioning quality-of-service (QoS) through heterogenous interfaces of licensed and unlicensed bands. In this paper, we minimize the required licensed spectrum without degrading the QoS in the presence of multiple users. Specifically, the aggregated effective capacity of LWA is firstly derived by developing a new semi-Markov model. Multi-band resource allocation with the QoS guarantee between the licensed and unlicensed bands is formulated to minimize the licensed bandwidth, convexified by exploiting Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and difference of two convex functions (DC) programming, and solved efficiently with a new iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance gain of the proposed approach over heuristic alternatives.
