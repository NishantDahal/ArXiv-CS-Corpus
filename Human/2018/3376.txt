Same Same, but Different: A Descriptive Differentiation of Intra-cloud Iaas Services

Users of cloud computing are overwhelmed with choice, even within the services offered by one provider. As such, many users select cloud services based on description alone. We investigate the degree to which such strategy is optimal. In this quantitative study, we investigate the services of 2 of major IaaS providers. We use 2 representative applications to obtain longitudinal observations over 7 days of the week and over different times of the day, totalling over 14,000 executions. We give evidence of significant variations of performance offered within IaaS services, calling for brokers to use automated and adaptive decision making processes with means for incorporating expressive user constraints.
