Untangling the GDPR Using ConRelMiner

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) poses enormous challenges on companies and organizations with respect to understanding, implementing, and maintaining the contained constraints. We report on how the ConRelMiner method can be used for untangling the GDPR. For this, the GDPR is filtered and grouped along the roles mentioned by the GDPR and the reduction of sentences to be read by analysts is shown. Moreover, the output of the ConRelMiner - a cluster graph with relations between the sentences - is displayed and interpreted. Overall the goal is to illustrate how the effort for implementing the GDPR can be reduced and a structured and meaningful representation of the relevant GDPR sentences can be found.
