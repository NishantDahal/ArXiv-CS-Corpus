The information-theoretic meaning of Gagliardo--Nirenberg type inequalities

Gagliardo--Nirenberg inequalities are interpolation inequalities which were proved independently by Gagliardo and Nirenberg in the late fifties. In recent years, their connections with theoretic aspects of information theory and nonlinear diffusion equations allowed to obtain some of them in optimal form, by recovering both the sharp constants and the explicit form of the optimizers. In this note, at the light of these recent researches, we review the main connections between Shannon-type entropies, diffusion equations and a class of these inequalities.
