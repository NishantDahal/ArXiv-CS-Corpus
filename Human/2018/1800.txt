A fast coset-translation algorithm for computing the cycle structure of Comer relation algebras over $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$

Proper relation algebras can be constructed using $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ as a base set using a method due to Comer. The cycle structure of such an algebra must, in general, be determined \emph{a posteriori}, normally with the aid of a computer. In this paper, we give an improved algorithm for checking the cycle structure that reduces the time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(p^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(p)$.
