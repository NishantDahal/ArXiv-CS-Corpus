Light Field Neural Network

We introduce an optical neural network system made by off-the-shelf components. In order to test the evaluate the physical property of the proposed system, we are making a prototype. After further discussions with our cooperators, we are agreed that the prototype implementation may take longer time than we expected earlier. Therefore we reach a consensus on withdrawing the paper until the physical data is available.
