Graph Compact Orthogonal Layout Algorithm

There exist many orthogonal graph drawing algorithms that minimize edge crossings or edge bends, however they produce unsatisfactory drawings in many practical cases. In this paper we present a grid-based algorithm for drawing orthogonal graphs with nodes of prescribed size. It distinguishes by creating pleasant and compact drawings in relatively small running time. The main idea is to minimize the total edge length that implicitly minimizes crossings and makes the drawing easy to comprehend. The algorithm is based on combining local and global improvements. Local improvements are moving each node to a new place and swapping of nodes. Global improvement is based on constrained quadratic programming approach that minimizes the total edge length while keeping node relative positions.
