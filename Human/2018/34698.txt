Formal Synthesis of Analytic Controllers for Sampled-Data Systems via Genetic Programming

This paper presents an automatic formal controller synthesis method for nonlinear sampled-data systems with safety and reachability specifications. Fundamentally, the presented method is not restricted to polynomial systems and controllers. We consider periodically switched controllers based on a Control Lyapunov Barrier-like functions. The proposed method utilizes genetic programming to synthesize these functions as well as the controller modes. Correctness of the controller are subsequently verified by means of a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver. Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on multiple systems.
