Cross-Domain Transfer in Reinforcement Learning using Target Apprentice

In this paper, we present a new approach to Transfer Learning (TL) in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for cross-domain tasks. Many of the available techniques approach the transfer architecture as a method of speeding up the target task learning. We propose to adapt and reuse the mapped source task optimal-policy directly in related domains. We show the optimal policy from a related source task can be near optimal in target domain provided an adaptive policy accounts for the model error between target and source. The main benefit of this policy augmentation is generalizing policies across multiple related domains without having to re-learn the new tasks. Our results show that this architecture leads to better sample efficiency in the transfer, reducing sample complexity of target task learning to target apprentice learning.
