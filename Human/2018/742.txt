Socialbots whitewashing contested elections; a case study from Honduras

We analyze socialbots active tweeting in relation to Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez, the recently re-elected president of Honduras. We find a clear bimodal separation between humans and bots, using Botometer and its classifiers. Around one hundred separate communities of socialbots are identified and visualized, detected through the analysis of temporally coordinated retweets.
