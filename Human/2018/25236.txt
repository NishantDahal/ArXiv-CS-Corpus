Optical Flow Super-Resolution Based on Image Guidence Using Convolutional Neural Network

The convolutional neural network model for optical flow estimation usually outputs a low-resolution(LR) optical flow field. To obtain the corresponding full image resolution,interpolation and variational approach are the most common options, which do not effectively improve the results. With the motivation of various convolutional neural network(CNN) structures succeeded in single image super-resolution(SISR) task, an end-to-end convolutional neural network is proposed to reconstruct the high resolution(HR) optical flow field from initial LR optical flow with the guidence of the first frame used in optical flow estimation. Our optical flow super-resolution(OFSR) problem differs from the general SISR problem in two main aspects. Firstly, the optical flow includes less texture information than image so that the SISR CNN structures can't be directly used in our OFSR problem. Secondly, the initial LR optical flow data contains estimation error, while the LR image data for SISR is generally a bicubic downsampled, blurred, and noisy version of HR ground truth. We evaluate the proposed approach on two different optical flow estimation mehods and show that it can not only obtain the full image resolution, but generate more accurate optical flow field (Accuracy improve 15% on FlyingChairs, 13% on MPI Sintel) with sharper edges than the estimation result of original method.
