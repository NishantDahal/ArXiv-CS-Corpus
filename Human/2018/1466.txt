Accounting for hidden common causes when inferring cause and effect from observational data

Identifying causal relationships from observation data is difficult, in large part, due to the presence of hidden common causes. In some cases, where just the right patterns of conditional independence and dependence lie in the data---for example, Y-structures---it is possible to identify cause and effect. In other cases, the analyst deliberately makes an uncertain assumption that hidden common causes are absent, and infers putative causal relationships to be tested in a randomized trial. Here, we consider a third approach, where there are sufficient clues in the data such that hidden common causes can be inferred.
