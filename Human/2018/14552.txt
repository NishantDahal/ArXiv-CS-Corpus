Correcting an ordered deletion-erasure

In this paper, we show that the single deletion correcting Varshamov-Tenengolts code, with minor modifications, can also correct an ordered deletion-erasure pattern where one deletion and at most one erasure occur and the deletion always occurs before the erasure. For large code lengths, the constructed code has the same logarithmic redundancy as optimal codes.
