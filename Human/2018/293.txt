Linear Complexity and Autocorrelation of two Classes of New Interleaved Sequences of Period $2N$

The autocorrelation and the linear complexity of a key stream sequence in a stream cipher are important cryptographic properties. Many sequences with these good properties have interleaved structure, three classes of binary sequences of period $4N$ with optimal autocorrelation values have been constructed by Tang and Gong based on interleaving certain kinds of sequences of period $N$. In this paper, we use the interleaving technique to construct a binary sequence with the optimal autocorrelation of period $2N$, then we calculate its autocorrelation values and its distribution, and give a lower bound of linear complexity. Results show that these sequences have low autocorrelation and the linear complexity satisfies the requirements of cryptography.
