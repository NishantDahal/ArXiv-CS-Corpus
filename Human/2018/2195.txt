Programming Languages for Scientific Computing

Scientific computation is a discipline that combines numerical analysis, physical understanding, algorithm development, and structured programming. Several yottacycles per year on the world's largest computers are spent simulating problems as diverse as weather prediction, the properties of material composites, the behavior of biomolecules in solution, and the quantum nature of chemical compounds. This article is intended to review specfic languages features and their use in computational science. We will review the strengths and weaknesses of different programming styles, with examples taken from widely used scientific codes.
