Agilit{é} de d{é}veloppement des SI informatis{é}s et outils MDE : d{é}marche p{é}dagogique dans un cours de conception de syst{è}mes d'information informatis{é}s

In software development, business rules implemented by hand using programming code hinder agility of companies. Are our students in information systems aware of that? Do our lessons promote this realization ? We use model driven concepts (MDA, MDE) in order to demonstrate, with practical examples, that source code can be automatically generated as far as formal specification are sufficient and accurate. We have extended usual representation conventions of conceptual data modeling and developed a transformer tool. This make our students observing themselves that no source code need necessarily to be rewrite when a change of business rule occurs, but just an adaptation of the model and a new run of generation of code. In this way, they finally understand more easily the benefits of MDE tools.
