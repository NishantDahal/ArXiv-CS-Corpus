Quasi-polynomial time approximation schemes for packing and covering problems in planar graphs

We consider two optimization problems in planar graphs. In Maximum Weight Independent Set of Objects we are given a graph $G$ and a family $\mathcal{D}$ of objects, each being a connected subgraph of $G$ with a prescribed weight, and the task is to find a maximum-weight subfamily of $\mathcal{D}$ consisting of pairwise disjoint objects. In Minimum Weight Distance Set Cover we are given an edge-weighted graph $G$, two sets $\mathcal{D},\mathcal{C}$ of vertices of $G$, where vertices of $\mathcal{D}$ have prescribed weights, and a nonnegative radius $r$. The task is to find a minimum-weight subset of $\mathcal{D}$ such that every vertex of $\mathcal{C}$ is at distance at most $r$ from some selected vertex. Via simple reductions, these two problems generalize a number of geometric optimization tasks, notably Maximum Weight Independent Set for polygons in the plane and Weighted Geometric Set Cover for unit disks and unit squares. We present quasi-polynomial time approximation schemes (QPTASs) for both of the above problems in planar graphs: given an accuracy parameter $ε>0$ we can compute a solution whose weight is within multiplicative factor of $(1+ε)$ from the optimum in time $2^{\mathrm{poly}(1/ε,\log |\mathcal{D}|)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input graph. Our main technical contribution is to transfer the techniques used for recursive approximation schemes for geometric problems due to Adamaszek, Har-Peled, and Wiese to the setting of planar graphs. In particular, this yields a purely combinatorial viewpoint on these methods.
