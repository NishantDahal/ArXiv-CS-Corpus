A Fully Automated System for Sizing Nasal PAP Masks Using Facial Photographs

We present a fully automated system for sizing nasal Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) masks. The system is comprised of a mix of HOG object detectors as well as multiple convolutional neural network stages for facial landmark detection. The models were trained using samples from the publicly available PUT and MUCT datasets while transfer learning was also employed to improve the performance of the models on facial photographs of actual PAP mask users. The fully automated system demonstrated an overall accuracy of 64.71% in correctly selecting the appropriate mask size and 86.1% accuracy sizing within 1 mask size.
