Optimal Scheduling of Electrolyzer in Power Market with Dynamic Prices

Optimal scheduling of hydrogen production in dynamic pricing power market can maximize the profit of hydrogen producer; however, it highly depends on the accurate forecast of hydrogen consumption. In this paper, we propose a deep leaning based forecasting approach for predicting hydrogen consumption of fuel cell vehicles in future taxi industry. The cost of hydrogen production is minimized by utilizing the proposed forecasting tool to reduce the hydrogen produced during high cost on-peak hours and guide hydrogen producer to store sufficient hydrogen during low cost off-peak hours.
