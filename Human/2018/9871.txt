Efficient Adaptive Detection of Complex Event Patterns

Complex event processing (CEP) is widely employed to detect occurrences of predefined combinations (patterns) of events in massive data streams. As new events are accepted, they are matched using some type of evaluation structure, commonly optimized according to the statistical properties of the data items in the input stream. However, in many real-life scenarios the data characteristics are never known in advance or are subject to frequent on-the-fly changes. To modify the evaluation structure as a reaction to such changes, adaptation mechanisms are employed. These mechanisms typically function by monitoring a set of properties and applying a new evaluation plan when significant deviation from the initial values is observed. This strategy often leads to missing important input changes or it may incur substantial computational overhead by over-adapting. In this paper, we present an efficient and precise method for dynamically deciding whether and how the evaluation structure should be reoptimized. This method is based on a small set of constraints to be satisfied by the monitored values, defined such that a better evaluation plan is guaranteed if any of the constraints is violated. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed mechanism is the first to provably avoid false positives on reoptimization decisions. We formally prove this claim and demonstrate how our method can be applied on known algorithms for evaluation plan generation. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets confirms the superiority of our strategy over existing methods in terms of performance and accuracy.
