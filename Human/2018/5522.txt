Forward Link Interference Mitigation in Mobile Interactive Satellite Systems

We present the results of the performance evaluation of polarization-time coding and soft interference cancellation in multi-beam satellite systems affected by co-channel interference in realistic setups. The standard of Broadband Global Area Network service (BGAN) has been considered as reference for the physical layer and realistic interference and channel models have been adopted. The work has been carried out in the framework of the Next Generation Waveform for Increased Spectral Efficiency (NGWISE) project founded by the European Space Agency (ESA).
