BubbleTouch: A Quasi-Static Tactile Skin Simulator

We present BubbleTouch, an open source quasi-static simulator for robotic tactile skins. BubbleTouch can be used to simulate contact with a robot's tactile skin patches as it interacts with humans and objects. The simulator creates detailed traces of contact forces that can be used in experiments in tactile contact activities. We summarize the design of BubbleTouch and highlight our recent work that uses BubbleTouch for experiments with tactile object recognition.
