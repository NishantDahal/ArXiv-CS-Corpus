Automatic Assessment of Artistic Quality of Photos

This paper proposes a technique to assess the aesthetic quality of photographs. The goal of the study is to predict whether a given photograph is captured by professional photographers, or by common people, based on a measurement of artistic quality of the photograph. We propose a Multi-Layer-Perceptron based system to analyze some low, mid and high level image features and find their effectiveness to measure artistic quality of the image and produce a measurement of the artistic quality of the image on a scale of 10. We validate the proposed system on a large dataset, containing images downloaded from the internet. The dataset contains some images captured by professional photographers and the rest of the images captured by common people. The proposed measurement of artistic quality of images provides higher value of photo quality for the images captured by professional photographers, compared to the values provided for the other images.
