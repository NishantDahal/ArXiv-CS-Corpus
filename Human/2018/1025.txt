A Software-defined SoC Memory Bus Bridge Architecture for Disaggregated Computing

Disaggregation and rack-scale systems have the potential of drastically decreasing TCO and increasing utilization of cloud datacenters, while maintaining performance. While the concept of organising resources in separate pools and interconnecting them together on demand is straightforward, its materialisation can be radically different in terms of performance and scale potential.
  In this paper, we present a memory bus bridge architecture which enables communication between 100s of masters and slaves in todays complex multiprocessor SoCs, that are physically intregrated in different chips and even different mainboards. The bridge tightly couples serial transceivers and a circuit network for chip-to-chip transfers. A key property of the proposed bridge architecture is that it is software-defined and thus can be configured at runtime, via a software control plane, to prepare and steer memory access transactions to remote slaves. This is particularly important because it enables datacenter orchestration tools to manage the disaggregated resource allocation. Moreover, we evaluate a bridge prototype we have build for ARM AXI4 memory bus interconnect and we discuss application-level observed performance.
