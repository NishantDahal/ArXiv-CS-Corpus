A Recruitment and Human Resource Management Technique Using Blockchain Technology for Industry 4.0

Application of Information Technology (IT) in the domain of Human Resource Management (HRM) systems is a sine qua non for any organization for successfully adopting and implementing Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). However, these systems are required to ensure non-biased, efficient, transparent and secure environment. Blockchain, a technology based on distributed digital ledgers, can help facilitate the process of successfully effectuating these specifications. A detailed literature review has been conducted to identify the current status of usage of Information Technology in the domain of Human Resource Management and how Blockchain can help achieve a smart, cost-effective, efficient, transparent and secure factory management system. A Blockchain based Recruitment Management System (BcRMS) as well as Blockchain based Human Resource Management System (BcHRMS) algorithm have been proposed. From the analysis of the results obtained through the case study, it is evident that the proposed system holds definite advantages compared to the existing recruitment systems. Future research directions have also been identified and advocated.
