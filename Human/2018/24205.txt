A blockchain framework for smart mobility

A blockchain framework is presented for addressing the privacy and security challenges associated with the Big Data in smart mobility. It is composed of individuals, companies, government and universities where all the participants collect, own, and control their data. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the blockchain network and can make information transactions with other participants as long as both party agrees to the transaction rules (smart contract) issued by the owner of the data. Data ownership, transparency, auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart mobility Big Data.
