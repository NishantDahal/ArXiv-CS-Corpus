Graph Based Power Flow Calculation for Energy Management System

Power flow calculation in EMS is required to accommodate a large and complex power system. To achieve a faster than real-time calculation, a graph based power flow calculation is proposed in this paper. Graph database and graph computing advantages in power system calculations are presented. A linear solver for power flow application is formulated and decomposed in nodal parallelism and hierarchical parallelism to fully utilize graph parallel computing capability. Comparison of the algorithm with traditional sequential programs shows significant benefits on computation efficiency. Case studies on practical large-scale systems provide supporting evidence that the new algorithm is promising for online computing for EMS.
