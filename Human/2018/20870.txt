Propagation Measurement System and Approach at 140 GHz-Moving to 6G and Above 100 GHz

With the relatively recent realization that millimeter wave frequencies are viable for mobile communications, extensive measurements and research have been conducted on frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz, and several global wireless standard bodies have proposed channel models for frequencies below 100 GHz. Presently, little is known about the radio channel above 100 GHz where there are much wider unused bandwidth slots available. This paper summarizes wireless communication research and activities above 100 GHz, overviews the results of previously published propagation measurements at D-band (110-170 GHz), provides the design of a 140 GHz wideband channel sounder system, and proposes indoor wideband propagation measurements and penetration measurements for common materials at 140 GHz which were not previously investigated.
