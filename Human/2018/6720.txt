Massive MIMO for Ultra-reliable Communications with Constellations for Dual Coherent-noncoherent Detection

The stringent requirements of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) require rethinking of the physical layer transmission techniques. Massive antenna arrays are seen as an enabler of the emerging $5^\text{th}$ generation systems, due to increases in spectral efficiency and degrees of freedom for transmissions, which can greatly improve reliability under demanding latency requirements. Massive array coherent processing relies on accurate channel state information (CSI) in order to achieve high reliability. In this paper, we investigate the impact of imperfect CSI in a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system on the coherent receiver. An amplitude-phase keying (APK) symbol constellation is proposed, where each two symmetric symbols reside on distinct power levels. The symbols are demodulated using a dual-stage non-coherent and coherent detection strategy, in order to improve symbol reliability. By means of analysis and simulation, we find an adequate scaling of the constellation and show that for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and inaccurate CSI regime, the proposed scheme enhances receiver performance.
