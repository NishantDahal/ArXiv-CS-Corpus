Reservoir computing with simple oscillators: Virtual and real networks

The reservoir computing scheme is a machine learning mechanism which utilizes the naturally occuring computational capabilities of dynamical systems. One important subset of systems that has proven powerful both in experiments and theory are delay-systems. In this work, we investigate the reservoir computing performance of hybrid network-delay systems systematically by evaluating the NARMA10 and the Sante Fe task.. We construct 'multiplexed networks' that can be seen as intermediate steps on the scale from classical networks to the 'virtual networks' of delay systems. We find that the delay approach can be extended to the network case without loss of computational power, enabling the construction of faster reservoir computing substrates.
