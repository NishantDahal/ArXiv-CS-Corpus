A Class of MSR Codes for Clustered Distributed Storage

Clustered distributed storage models real data centers where intra- and cross-cluster repair bandwidths are different. In this paper, exact-repair minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes achieving capacity of clustered distributed storage are designed. Focus is given on two cases: $ε=0$ and $ε=1/(n-k)$, where $ε$ is the ratio of the available cross- and intra-cluster repair bandwidths, $n$ is the total number of distributed nodes and $k$ is the number of contact nodes in data retrieval. The former represents the scenario where cross-cluster communication is not allowed, while the latter corresponds to the case of minimum cross-cluster bandwidth that is possible under the minimum storage overhead constraint. For the $ε=0$ case, two types of locally repairable codes are proven to achieve the MSR point. As for $ε=1/(n-k)$, an explicit MSR coding scheme is suggested for the two-cluster situation under the specific condition of $n = 2k$.
