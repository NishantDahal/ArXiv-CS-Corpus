Online Multi-Object Tracking with Historical Appearance Matching and Scene Adaptive Detection Filtering

In this paper, we propose the methods to handle temporal errors during multi-object tracking. Temporal error occurs when objects are occluded or noisy detections appear near the object. In those situations, tracking may fail and various errors like drift or ID-switching occur. It is hard to overcome temporal errors only by using motion and shape information. So, we propose the historical appearance matching method and joint-input siamese network which was trained by 2-step process. It can prevent tracking failures although objects are temporally occluded or last matching information is unreliable. We also provide useful technique to remove noisy detections effectively according to scene condition. Tracking performance, especially identity consistency, is highly improved by attaching our methods.
