Neural Network-based exploration of construct validity for Russian version of the 10-item Big Five Inventory

This study aims to present a new method of exploring construct validity of questionnaires based on neural network. Using this test we further explore convergent validity for Russian adaptation of TIPI (Ten-Item Personality Inventory by Gosling, Rentfrow, and Swann). Due to small number of questions TIPI-RU can be used as an express-method for surveying large number of people, especially in the Internet-studies. It can be also used with other translations of the same questionnaire in the intercultural studies. The neural network test for construct validity can be used as more convenient substitute for path model.
