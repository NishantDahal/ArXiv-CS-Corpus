Improved multipath time delay estimation using cepstrum subtraction

When a motor-powered vessel travels past a fixed hydrophone in a multipath environment, a Lloyd's mirror constructive/destructive interference pattern is observed in the output spectrogram. The power cepstrum detects the periodic structure of the Lloyd's mirror pattern by generating a sequence of pulses (rahmonics) located at the fundamental quefrency (periodic time) and its multiples. This sequence is referred to here as the `rahmonic component' of the power cepstrum. The fundamental quefrency, which is the reciprocal of the frequency difference between adjacent interference fringes, equates to the multipath time delay. The other component of the power cepstrum is the non-rahmonic (extraneous) component, which combines with the rahmonic component to form the (total) power cepstrum. A data processing technique, termed `cepstrum subtraction', is described. This technique suppresses the extraneous component of the power cepstrum, leaving the rahmonic component that contains the desired multipath time delay information. This technique is applied to real acoustic recordings of motor-vessel transits in a shallow water environment, where the broadband noise radiated by the vessel arrives at the hydrophone via a direct ray path and a time-delayed multipath. The results show that cepstrum subtraction improves multipath time delay estimation by a factor of two for the at-sea experiment.
