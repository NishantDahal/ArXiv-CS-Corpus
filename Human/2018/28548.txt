Stronger Cryptography For Every Device, Everywhere

Generating secure random numbers is a central problem in cryptography that needs a reliable source of enough computing entropy. Without enough entropy available - meaning no good source of secure random numbers - a device is susceptible to cryptographic protocol failures such as weak, factorable, or predictable keys, which lead to various security and privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, the author presents a significant improvement: a reliable way for any CPU-powered device - from the small, simple CPUs in embedded devices, to larger, more complex CPUs in modern servers - to collect virtually unlimited entropy through side channel measurements of trivial CPU operations, making the generation of secure random numbers an easy, safe, and reliable operation.
