A Navigational Approach to Health

What if an app could guide you to better health, similar to how GPS navigation directs you to your desired destination? What if the app could use real-time information to redirect you around a disease, just as you're rerouted to avoid traffic? What if the app could provide step-by-step directions to get you to your optimal health state, whether you're a professional athlete or retires school teacher? We discuss how this navigational approach to healthcare could become a reality by combining technology with well-established cybernetics principles.
