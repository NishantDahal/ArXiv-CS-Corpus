Resource Optimization with Flexible Numerology and Frame Structure for Heterogeneous Services

We explore the potential of optimizing resource allocation with flexible numerology in frequency domain and variable frame structure in time domain, in presence of services with different types of requirements. We analyze the computational complexity and propose a scalable optimization algorithm based on searching in both the primal space and dual space that are complementary to each other. Numerical results show significant advantages of adopting flexibility in both time and frequency domains for capacity enhancement and meeting the requirements of mission critical services.
