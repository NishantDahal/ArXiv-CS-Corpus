Fast Approximate Counting and Leader Election in Populations

We study the problems of leader election and population size counting for population protocols: networks of finite-state anonymous agents that interact randomly under a uniform random scheduler. We show a protocol for leader election that terminates in $O(\log_m(n) \cdot \log_2 n)$ parallel time, where $m$ is a parameter, using $O(\max\{m,\log n\})$ states. By adjusting the parameter $m$ between a constant and $n$, we obtain a single leader election protocol whose time and space can be smoothly traded off between $O(\log^2 n)$ to $O(\log n)$ time and $O(\log n)$ to $O(n)$ states. Finally, we give a protocol which provides an upper bound $\hat{n}$ of the size $n$ of the population, where $\hat{n}$ is at most $n^a$ for some $a>1$. This protocol assumes the existence of a unique leader in the population and stabilizes in $Θ{(\log{n})}$ parallel time, using constant number of states in every node, except the unique leader which is required to use $Θ{(\log^2{n})}$ states.
