Comparative Analysis of Human Movement Prediction: Space Syntax and Inverse Reinforcement Learning

Space syntax matrix has been the main approach for human movement prediction in the urban environment. An alternative, relatively new methodology is an agent-based pedestrian model constructed using machine learning techniques. Even though both approaches have been studied intensively, the quantitative comparison between them has not been conducted. In this paper, comparative analysis of space syntax metrics and maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MEIRL) is performed. The experimental result on trajectory data of artificially generated pedestrian agents shows that MEIRL outperforms space syntax matrix. The possibilities for combining two methods are drawn out as conclusions, and the relative challenges with the data collection are highlighted.
