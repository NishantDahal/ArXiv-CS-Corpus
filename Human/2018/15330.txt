Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation in Downlink NOMA Multiuser MIMO Networks

In this paper, a novel joint design of beamforming and power allocation is proposed for a multi-cell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network. In this network, base stations (BSs) adopt coordinated multipoint (CoMP) for downlink transmission. We study a new scenario where the users are divided into two groups according to their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, rather than their channel qualities as investigated in the literature. Our proposed joint design aims to maximize the sum-rate of the users in one group with the best-effort while guaranteeing the minimum required target rates of the users in the other group. The joint design is formulated as a non-convex NP-hard problem. To make the problem tractable, a series of transformations are adopted to simplify the design problem. Then, an iterative suboptimal resource allocation algorithm based on successive convex approximation is proposed. In each iteration, a rank-constrained optimization problem is solved optimally via semidefinite program relaxation. Numerical results reveal that the proposed scheme offers significant sum-rate gains compared to the existing schemes and converges fast to a suboptimal solution.
