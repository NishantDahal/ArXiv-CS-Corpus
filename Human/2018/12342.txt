A construction of product blocks with a fixed block size

Let $M(n,d)$ be the maximum size of a permutation array on $n$ symbols with pairwise Hamming distance at least $d$. Some permutation arrays can be constructed using blocks of certain type [2] called product blocks in this paper. We study the problem of designing $(q,k)$-product blocks with a fixed block size $k$.
