Right-to-left online construction of parameterized position heaps

Two strings of equal length are said to parameterized match if there is a bijection that maps the characters of one string to those of the other string, so that two strings become identical. The parameterized pattern matching problem is, given two strings $T$ and $P$, to find the occurrences of substrings in $T$ that parameterized match $P$. Diptarama et al. [Position Heaps for Parameterized Strings, CPM 2017] proposed an indexing data structure called parameterized position heaps, and gave a left-to-right online construction algorithm. In this paper, we present a right-to-left online construction algorithm for parameterized position heaps. For a text string $T$ of length $n$ over two kinds of alphabets $Σ$ and $Π$ of respective size $σ$ and $π$, our construction algorithm runs in $O(n \log(σ+ π))$ time with $O(n)$ space. Our right-to-left parameterized position heaps support pattern matching queries in $O(m \log (σ+ π) + m π+ \mathit{pocc}))$ time, where $m$ is the length of a query pattern $P$ and $\mathit{pocc}$ is the number of occurrences to report. Our construction and pattern matching algorithms are as efficient as Diptarama et al.'s algorithms.
