Note on Representing attribute reduction and concepts in concepts lattice using graphs

Mao H. (2017, Representing attribute reduction and concepts in concept lattice using graphs. Soft Computing 21(24):7293--7311) claims to make contributions to the study of reduction of attributes in concept lattices by using graph theory. We show that her results are either trivial or already well-known and all three algorithms proposed in the paper are incorrect.
