Modelling Microbial Fuel Cells using lattice Boltzmann methods

An accurate modelling of bio-electrochemical processes that govern Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) and mapping their behaviour according to several parameters will enhance the development of MFC technology and enable their successful implementation in well defined applications. The geometry of the electrodes is among key parameters determining efficiency of MFCs due to the formation of a biofilm of anodophilic bacteria on the anode electrode, which is a decisive factor for the functionality of the device. We simulate the bio-electrochemical processes in an MFC while taking into account the geometry of the electrodes. Namely, lattice Boltzmann methods are used to simulate the fluid dynamics and the advection-diffusion phenomena in the anode compartment. The model is verified on voltage and current outputs of a single MFC derived from laboratory experiments under continuous flow.
