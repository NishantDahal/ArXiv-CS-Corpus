Bitcoin With Heterogeneous Block Sizes: A Scaling Proposal

The block is redefined as a sequence of sub-blocks of increasing sizes that coexist as different levels of compromise between decentralization and transactions throughput. Miners and users can decide individually the sizes they use without affecting others in the network.
