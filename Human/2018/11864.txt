Improved ASR for Under-Resourced Languages Through Multi-Task Learning with Acoustic Landmarks

Furui first demonstrated that the identity of both consonant and vowel can be perceived from the C-V transition; later, Stevens proposed that acoustic landmarks are the primary cues for speech perception, and that steady-state regions are secondary or supplemental. Acoustic landmarks are perceptually salient, even in a language one doesn't speak, and it has been demonstrated that non-speakers of the language can identify features such as the primary articulator of the landmark. These factors suggest a strategy for developing language-independent automatic speech recognition: landmarks can potentially be learned once from a suitably labeled corpus and rapidly applied to many other languages. This paper proposes enhancing the cross-lingual portability of a neural network by using landmarks as the secondary task in multi-task learning (MTL). The network is trained in a well-resourced source language with both phone and landmark labels (English), then adapted to an under-resourced target language with only word labels (Iban). Landmark-tasked MTL reduces source-language phone error rate by 2.9% relative, and reduces target-language word error rate by 1.9%-5.9% depending on the amount of target-language training data. These results suggest that landmark-tasked MTL causes the DNN to learn hidden-node features that are useful for cross-lingual adaptation.
