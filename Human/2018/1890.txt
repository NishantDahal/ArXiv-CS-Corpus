Capacity and Achievable Rate Regions for Linear Network Coding over Ring Alphabets

The rate of a network code is the ratio of the block size of the network's messages to that of its edge codewords. We compare the linear capacities and achievable rate regions of networks using finite field alphabets to the more general cases of arbitrary ring and module alphabets. For non-commutative rings, two-sided linearity is allowed. Specifically, we prove the following for directed acyclic networks:
  (i) The linear rate region and the linear capacity of any network over a finite field depend only on the characteristic of the field. Furthermore, any two fields with different characteristics yield different linear capacities for at least one network.
  (ii) Whenever the characteristic of a given finite field divides the size of a given finite ring, each network's linear rate region over the ring is contained in its linear rate region over the field. Thus, any network's linear capacity over a field is at least its linear capacity over any other ring of the same size. An analogous result also holds for linear network codes over module alphabets.
  (iii) Whenever the characteristic of a given finite field does not divide the size of a given finite ring, there is some network whose linear capacity over the ring is strictly greater than its linear capacity over the field. Thus, for any finite field, there always exist rings over which some networks have higher linear capacities than over the field.
