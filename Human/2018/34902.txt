A Duality-Based Unified Approach to Bayesian Mechanism Design

We provide a unified view of many recent developments in Bayesian mechanism design, including the black-box reductions of Cai et al. [CDW13b], simple auctions for additive buyers [HN12], and posted-price mechanisms for unit-demand bidders [CHK07]. Additionally, we show that viewing these three previously disjoint lines of work through the same lens leads to new developments as well. First, we provide a duality framework for Bayesian mechanism design, which naturally accommodates multiple agents and arbitrary objectives/feasibility constraints. Using this, we prove that either a posted-price mechanism or the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction with per-bidder entry fees achieves a constant-factor of the optimal revenue achievable by a Bayesian Incentive Compatible mechanism whenever buyers are unit-demand or additive, unifying previous breakthroughs of Chawla et al. [CHMS10] and Yao [Yao15], and improving both approximation ratios (from 30 to 24 and 69 to 8, respectively). Finally, we show that this view also leads to improved structural characterizations in the Cai et al. framework.
