Expected Coverage of Random Walk Mobility Algorithm

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly used for exploring areas. Many mobility algorithms were designed to achieve a fast coverage of a given area. We focus on analysing the expected coverage of the symmetric random walk mobility algorithm with independent mobility. Therefore we proof the dependence of certain events and develop Markov models, in order to provide an analytical solution for the expected coverage. The analytic solution is afterwards compared to those of another work and to simulation results.
