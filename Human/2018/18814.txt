Design of Low-Complexity Convolutional Codes over GF(q)

This paper proposes a new family of recursive systematic convolutional codes, defined in the non-binary domain over different Galois fields GF(q) and intended to be used as component codes for the design of non-binary turbo codes. A general framework for the design of the best codes over different GF(q) is described. The designed codes offer better performance than the non-binary convolutional codes found in the literature. They also outperform their binary counterparts when combined with their corresponding QAM modulation or with lower order modulations.
