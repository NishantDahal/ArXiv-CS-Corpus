QoS-Aware Routing in Wireless Networks Using Aerial Vehicles

The next generation wireless networks need efficient mechanisms for data dissemination that should support users with better Quality of Service (QoS). Nevertheless, the existing solutions are unable to handle this demand and require either network redeployment or replanning. Moreover, this upsurges the overall operational cost and complexity of the network. This problem can be addressed by deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which can act as on-demand relays in next generation wireless networks. In this work, a novel strategy comprising a series of algorithms based on neural networks is devised, which resolves the issues related to data dissemination, QoS, capacity, and coverage. When compared with the existing methods, the proposed approach demonstrates better outcomes for various parameters, namely, throughput, message disseminations, service dissemination rate, UAV allocation time, route acquisition delay, link utilization and signal to noise ratio for end users. The experimental results exhibit the fact that the proposed approach utilizes 39.6%, 41.6%, 43.5%, 44.4%, and 46.9% lesser iterations than the EEDD, A-Star, OCD, GPCR, and GyTAR, respectively. Therefore, it is evident that the proposed approach surpasses the existing methods by means of superior performance and augmented efficiency.
