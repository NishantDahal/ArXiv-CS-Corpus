How to design browser security and privacy alerts

It is important to design browser security and privacy alerts so as to maximise their value to the end user, and their efficacy in terms of communicating risk. We derived a list of design guidelines from the research literature by carrying out a systematic review. We analysed the papers both quantitatively and qualitatively to arrive at a comprehensive set of guidelines. Our findings aim to to provide designers and developers with guidance as to how to construct privacy and security alerts. We conclude by providing an alert template,highlighting its adherence to the derived guidelines.
