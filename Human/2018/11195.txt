Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Graphical Bandits Without the Graphs

We study multi-armed bandit problems with graph feedback, in which the decision maker is allowed to observe the neighboring actions of the chosen action, in a setting where the graph may vary over time and is never fully revealed to the decision maker. We show that when the feedback graphs are undirected, the original Thompson Sampling achieves the optimal (within logarithmic factors) regret $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{β_0(G)T}\right)$ over time horizon $T$, where $β_0(G)$ is the average independence number of the latent graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing that the original Thompson Sampling is optimal for graphical bandits in the undirected setting. A slightly weaker regret bound of Thompson Sampling in the directed setting is also presented. To fill this gap, we propose a variant of Thompson Sampling, that attains the optimal regret in the directed setting within a logarithmic factor. Both algorithms can be implemented efficiently and do not require the knowledge of the feedback graphs at any time.
