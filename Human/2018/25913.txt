Comment Generation for Source Code: State of the Art, Challenges and Opportunities

Researches have shown that most effort of today's software development is maintenance and evolution. Developers often use integrated development environments, debuggers, and tools for code search, testing, and program understanding to reduce the tedious tasks. One way to make software development more efficient is to make the program more readable. There have been many approaches proposed and developed for this purpose. Among these approaches, comment generation for source code is gaining more and more attention and has become a popular research area. In this paper, the state of art in comment generation research area are summarized and the challenges and future opportunities are discussed.
