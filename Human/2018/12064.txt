Proceedings Joint Workshop on Handling IMPlicit and EXplicit knowledge in formal system development (IMPEX) and Formal and Model-Driven Techniques for Developing Trustworthy Systems (FM&MDD)

This volume contains the joint proceedings of IMPEX 2017, the first workshop on Handling IMPlicit and EXplicit knowledge in formal system development   and FM&MDD, the second workshop on  Formal and Model-Driven Techniques for Developing Trustworthy Systems (FM&MDD) held together on November 16, 2017 in Xi'an, China, as part of ICFEM 2017, 19th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods.
  IMPEX  emphasises  mechanisms for reducing heterogeneity of models  induced by the absence  of explicit semantics expression in the formal techniques used to specify these models. More precisely, the meeting  targets to highlight the  advances in handling both implicit  and explicit  semantics in formal  system developments. 
  The aims of FM&MDD  are to advance the understanding in the area of developing and applying formal and model-driven techniques for designing trustworthy systems, to discuss the emerging issues in the area, to improve the dialog between different research communities and between academia and industry,  to discuss a roadmap of the future research in the area and  to create a forum for discussing and disseminating the new ideas and the research results in the area
