Genetic algorithm for optimal distribution in cities

The problem to deal with in this project is the problem of routing electric vehicles, which consists of finding the best routes for this type of vehicle, so that they reach their destination, without running out of power and optimizing to the maximum transportation costs. The importance of this problem is mainly in the sector of shipments in the recent future, when obsolete energy sources are replaced with renewable sources, where each vehicle contains a number of packages that must be delivered at specific points in the city , but, being electric, they do not have an optimal battery life, so having the ideal routes traced is a vital aspect for the proper functioning of these. Now days you can see applications of this problem in the cleaning sector, specifically with the trucks responsible for collecting garbage, which aims to travel the entire city in the most efficient way, without letting excessive garbage accumulate.
