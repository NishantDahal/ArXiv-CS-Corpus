Artificial Intelligence Paradigm for Customer Experience Management in Next-Generation Networks: Challenges and Perspectives

With advancements of next-generation programmable networks a traditional rule-based decision-making may not be able to adapt effectively to changing network and customer requirements and provide optimal customer experience. Customer experience management (CEM) components and implementation challenges with respect to operator, network, and business requirements must be understood to meet required demands. This paper gives an overview of CEM components and their design challenges. We elaborate on data analytics and artificial intelligence driven CEM and their functional differences. This overview provides a path toward autonomous CEM framework in next-generation networks and sets the groundwork for future enhancements.
