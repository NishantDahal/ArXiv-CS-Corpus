Learning Vision-based Cohesive Flight in Drone Swarms

This paper presents a data-driven approach to learning vision-based collective behavior from a simple flocking algorithm. We simulate a swarm of quadrotor drones and formulate the controller as a regression problem in which we generate 3D velocity commands directly from raw camera images. The dataset is created by simultaneously acquiring omnidirectional images and computing the corresponding control command from the flocking algorithm. We show that a convolutional neural network trained on the visual inputs of the drone can learn not only robust collision avoidance but also coherence of the flock in a sample-efficient manner. The neural controller effectively learns to localize other agents in the visual input, which we show by visualizing the regions with the most influence on the motion of an agent. This weakly supervised saliency map can be computed efficiently and may be used as a prior for subsequent detection and relative localization of other agents. We remove the dependence on sharing positions among flock members by taking only local visual information into account for control. Our work can therefore be seen as the first step towards a fully decentralized, vision-based flock without the need for communication or visual markers to aid detection of other agents.
