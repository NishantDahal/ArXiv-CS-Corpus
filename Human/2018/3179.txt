Broadband MIMO Couplers Characterization and Comparison

This paper focuses on MIMO Power Line Communication (PLC) to provide increased performance. In MIMO PLC, appropriate coupling methods are necessary in order to enable the effective injection of the signal through the broad band PLC channel so that high data rates can be achieved. In this paper, we want to analytically characterize strengths and weaknesses of each coupler design (topology) from an electrical circuit perspective. We dwell on the description and analysis of the three main and common configurations used for the MIMO couplers: star (S), triangle ($Î”$) and T.
