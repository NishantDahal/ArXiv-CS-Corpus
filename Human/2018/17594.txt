Are RLL Codes Suitable for Simultaneous Energy and Information Transfer?

Run-length limited (RLL) codes are a well-studied class of constrained codes having application in diverse areas such as optical and magnetic data recording systems, DNA-based storage, and visible light communication. RLL codes have also been proposed for the emerging area of simultaneous energy and information transfer, where the receiver uses the received signal for decoding information as well as for harvesting energy to run its circuitry. In this paper, we show that RLL codes are not the best codes for simultaneous energy and information transfer, in terms of the maximum number of codewords which avoid energy outage, i.e., outage-constrained capacity. Specifically, we show that sliding window constrained (SWC) codes and subblock energy constrained (SEC) codes have significantly higher outage-constrained capacities than RLL codes.
