Right to Sign: Safeguarding data immutability in blockchain systems with cryptographic signatures over a broad range of available consensus finding scenarios

The choice of the consensus method ultimately determines throughput, scalability, tamper resistance, and consistency of a blockchain system. However, across all the types of blockchain (private, semi-private, consortium, or public), there is no consensus method that uniformly addresses all these traits. Verifiable lottery algorithms (Proof of ...) increase tamper resistance but show weakness in throughput and scalability, while established methods like PAXOS and RAFT provide no additional protection against tampering. In this paper, we introduce Right to Sign which aims to provide additional tamper resistance by cryptographic signatures over a broad range of available consensus finding methods.
