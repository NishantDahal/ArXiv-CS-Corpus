SRDA: Generating Instance Segmentation Annotation Via Scanning, Reasoning And Domain Adaptation

Instance segmentation is a problem of significance in computer vision. However, preparing annotated data for this task is extremely time-consuming and costly. By combining the advantages of 3D scanning, reasoning, and GAN-based domain adaptation techniques, we introduce a novel pipeline named SRDA to obtain large quantities of training samples with very minor effort. Our pipeline is well-suited to scenes that can be scanned, i.e. most indoor and some outdoor scenarios. To evaluate our performance, we build three representative scenes and a new dataset, with 3D models of various common objects categories and annotated real-world scene images. Extensive experiments show that our pipeline can achieve decent instance segmentation performance given very low human labor cost.
