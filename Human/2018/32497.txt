Research on Artificial Intelligence Ethics Based on the Evolution of Population Knowledge Base

The unclear development direction of human society is a deep reason for that it is difficult to form a uniform ethical standard for human society and artificial intelligence. Since the 21st century, the latest advances in the Internet, brain science and artificial intelligence have brought new inspiration to the research on the development direction of human society. Through the study of the Internet brain model, AI IQ evaluation, and the evolution of the brain, this paper proposes that the evolution of population knowledge base is the key for judging the development direction of human society, thereby discussing the standards and norms for the construction of artificial intelligence ethics.
