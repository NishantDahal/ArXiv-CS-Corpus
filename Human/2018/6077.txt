Context-aware Human Intent Inference for Improving Human Machine Cooperation

The ability of human beings to precisely recog- nize others intents is a significant mental activity in reasoning about actions, such as, what other people are doing and what they will do next. Recent research has revealed that human intents could be inferred by measuring human cognitive activities through heterogeneous body and brain sensors (e.g., sensors for detecting physiological signals like ECG, brain signals like EEG and IMU sensors like accelerometers and gyros etc.). In this proposal, we aim at developing a computa- tional framework for enabling reliable and precise real-time human intent recognition by measuring human cognitive and physiological activities through the heterogeneous body and brain sensors for improving human machine interactions, and serving intent-based human activity prediction.
