Effects of Memristors on Fully Differential Transimpedance Amplifier Performance

The progress of the Internet of Things(IoT) technologies and applications requires the efficient low power circuits and architectures to maintain and improve the performance of the increasingly growing data processing systems. Memristive circuits and substitution of energy-consuming devices with memristors is a promising solution to reduce on-chip area and power dissipation of the architectures. In this paper, we proposed a CMOS-memristive fully differential transimpedance amplifier and assess the impact of memristors on the amplifier performance. The fully differential amplifiers were simulated using 180nm CMOS technology and have 5.3-23MHz bandwidths and 2.3-5.7k$Î©$ transimpedance gains with a 1pF load. We compare the memristor based amplifier with conventional architecture. The gain, frequency response, linear range, power consumption, area, total harmonic distortion and performance variations with temperature are reported.
