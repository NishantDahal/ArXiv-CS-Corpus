L'acceptation et l'appropriation des ENT (Espaces Num{Ã©}riques de Travail) par les enseignants du primaire

This article presents an evaluation of the conditions of use of a VWE (Virtual Work Environment) by primary school teachers. To this end, we conducted two studies and used activity theory as theoretical framework. Our first study aims to assess real practices carried out with the VWE and analyzed publications' content in order to understand how users appropriate the tool. The second study describes how teachers perceive the role of the VWE in the evolution of their working prac-tices (maintaining, transforming and restricting the existent practices). These stud-ies indicate that technological appropriation is achieved through instructional and communicational uses. The acceptance of this VWE is due to its ease of use and interface adequacy to teachers and young children.
