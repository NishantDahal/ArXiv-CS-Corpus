Hybrid approach for transliteration of Algerian arabizi: a primary study

A hybrid approach for the transliteration of Algerian Arabizi: A primary study In this paper, we present a hybrid approach for the transliteration of the Algerian Arabizi. We define a set of rules enable us the passage from Arabizi to Arabic. Through these rules, we generate a set of candidates for the transliteration of each Arabizi word into arabic. Then, we extract the best candidate. This approach was evaluated by using three test corpora, and the obtained results show an improvement of the precision score which is equal to 75.11% for the best result. These results allow us to verify that our approach is very competitive comparing to others works that treat Arabizi transliteration in general.
