Player preferences in $N$-player games

In this paper we describe several player preferences in games with $N \geq 2$ players, in particular the case $N = 3$, and use them to simplify game trees, using the game of Clobber as our example. We show that, using a fixed starting player and a certain ruleset, any short game can be simplified to a value in a very concise set. Omitting the fixed starting player and generalising the theory to more than 3 players remains a challenge.
