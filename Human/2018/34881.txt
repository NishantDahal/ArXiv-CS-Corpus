FineFool: Fine Object Contour Attack via Attention

Machine learning models have been shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks launched by adversarial examples which are carefully crafted by attacker to defeat classifiers. Deep learning models cannot escape the attack either. Most of adversarial attack methods are focused on success rate or perturbations size, while we are more interested in the relationship between adversarial perturbation and the image itself. In this paper, we put forward a novel adversarial attack based on contour, named FineFool. Finefool not only has better attack performance compared with other state-of-art white-box attacks in aspect of higher attack success rate and smaller perturbation, but also capable of visualization the optimal adversarial perturbation via attention on object contour. To the best of our knowledge, Finefool is for the first time combines the critical feature of the original clean image with the optimal perturbations in a visible manner. Inspired by the correlations between adversarial perturbations and object contour, slighter perturbations is produced via focusing on object contour features, which is more imperceptible and difficult to be defended, especially network add-on defense methods with the trade-off between perturbations filtering and contour feature loss. Compared with existing state-of-art attacks, extensive experiments are conducted to show that Finefool is capable of efficient attack against defensive deep models.
