Transceiver Design for GFDM with Index Modulation in Multi-user Networks

Index modulation (IM) techniques can be applied to the different media in order to achieve spectral- and energy-efficient communication as well as to the indices of the subcarriers of a generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) data block. In this work, a novel transceiver architecture for multi-user GFDM-IM system is introduced. The performance of the GFDM-IM is studied by considering the bit error rate (BER) as performance metric. It is shown that better BER performance than the classical GFDM and the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with IM can be achieved by employing IM to the GFDM.
