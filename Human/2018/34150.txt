DiscreteZOO: a Fingerprint Database of Discrete Objects

In this paper, we present DiscreteZOO, a project which illustrates some of the possibilities for computer-supported management of collections of finite combinatorial (discrete) objects, in particular graphs with a high degree of symmetry. DiscreteZOO encompasses a data repository, a website and a SageMath Package.
