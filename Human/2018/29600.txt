A Survey on High-Capacity OFDM-based Passive Optical Networks

The exponential growth of demand for high-speed internet and high bandwidth applications such as interactive entertainment in access networks mandates the requirement for higher optical signal speeds. On the other hand, since cost and energy efficiency should be concurrently preserved in access networks, PONs have emerged as a breakthrough solution. This survey shows that future-proof PONs should be supported by an adaptively modulated WDM-OFDM architecture to maximize signal capacity and transmission-reach, while the employment of reflective semiconductor optical amplification and re-modulation can potentially prevent the employment of an additional light source.
