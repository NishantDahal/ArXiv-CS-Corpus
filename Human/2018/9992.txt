Non-branching tree-decompositions

We prove that if a graph has a tree-decomposition of width at most w, then it has a tree-decomposition of width at most w with certain desirable properties. We will use this result in a subsequent paper to show that every 2-connected graph of large path-width has a minor isomorphic to either a large tree with a vertex attached to every vertex of the tree or a large outerplanar graph.
