Generative Models for Stochastic Processes Using Convolutional Neural Networks

The present paper aims to demonstrate the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks as a generative model for stochastic processes, enabling researchers from a wide range of fields (such as quantitative finance and physics) to develop a general tool for forecasts and simulations without the need to identify/assume a specific system structure or estimate its parameters.
