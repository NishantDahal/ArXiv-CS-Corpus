Social software and strategy

Aligning interests, motivating contributions to knowledge work, and giving direction to multiple business units and market initiatives represent daily challenges facing the strategist in most companies. The diversity of contexts within an organization has thus led critical management thinkers to suggest that in the presence of multiple initiatives and discourses, the introduction of a new technology has multiple unintended consequences for organization. New technology is regularly subject to power struggles, conflicting goals, and discrepant events (Markus, 1983; Barley, 1986; Orlikowski, 1992; Ciborra, 1996; Leonardi, 2008) which impact on how strategies are shaped within organizations.
