A Deep Learning Approach with an Attention Mechanism for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification

Automatic sleep staging is a challenging problem and state-of-the-art algorithms have not yet reached satisfactory performance to be used instead of manual scoring by a sleep technician. Much research has been done to find good feature representations that extract the useful information to correctly classify each epoch into the correct sleep stage. While many useful features have been discovered, the amount of features have grown to an extent that a feature reduction step is necessary in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality. One reason for the need of such a large feature set is that many features are good for discriminating only one of the sleep stages and are less informative during other stages. This paper explores how a second feature representation over a large set of pre-defined features can be learned using an auto-encoder with a selective attention for the current sleep stage in the training batch. This selective attention allows the model to learn feature representations that focuses on the more relevant inputs without having to perform any dimensionality reduction of the input data. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a large data set of polysomnography (PSG) night recordings of patients with sleep-disordered breathing. The performance of the auto-encoder with selective attention is compared with a regular auto-encoder and previous works using a deep belief network (DBN).
