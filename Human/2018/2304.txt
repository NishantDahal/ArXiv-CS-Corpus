Linear codes with few weights over $\mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2$

In this paper, we construct an infinite family of five-weight codes from trace codes over the ring $R=\mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2$, where $u^2=0.$ The trace codes have the algebraic structure of abelian codes. Their Lee weight is computed by using character sums. Combined with Pless power moments and Newton's Identities, the weight distribution of the Gray image of trace codes was present. Their support structure is determined. An application to secret sharing schemes is given.
