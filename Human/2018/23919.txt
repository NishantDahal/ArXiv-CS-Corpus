Towards Large-Scale Video Video Object Mining

We propose to leverage a generic object tracker in order to perform object mining in large-scale unlabeled videos, captured in a realistic automotive setting. We present a dataset of more than 360'000 automatically mined object tracks from 10+ hours of video data (560'000 frames) and propose a method for automated novel category discovery and detector learning. In addition, we show preliminary results on using the mined tracks for object detector adaptation.
