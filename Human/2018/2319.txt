Polar codes for empirical coordination over noisy channels with strictly causal encoding

In this paper, we propose a coding scheme based on polar codes for empirical coordination of autonomous devices. We consider a two-node network with a noisy link in which the input and output signals have to be coordinated with the source and the reconstruction. In the case of strictly causal encoding, we show that polar codes achieve the empirical coordination region, provided that a vanishing rate of common randomness is available.
