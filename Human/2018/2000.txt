On the Optimality of Secret Key Agreement via Omniscience

For the multiterminal secret key agreement problem under a private source model, it is known that the maximum key rate, i.e., the secrecy capacity, can be achieved through communication for omniscience, but the omniscience strategy can be strictly suboptimal in terms of minimizing the public discussion rate. While a single-letter characterization is not known for the minimum discussion rate needed for achieving the secrecy capacity, we derive single-letter lower and upper bounds that yield some simple conditions for omniscience to be discussion-rate optimal. These conditions turn out to be enough to deduce the optimality of omniscience for a large class of sources including the hypergraphical sources. Through conjectures and examples, we explore other source models to which our methods do not easily extend.
