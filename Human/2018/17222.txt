Transportation Modes Classification Using Feature Engineering

Predicting transportation modes from GPS (Global Positioning System) records is a hot topic in the trajectory mining domain. Each GPS record is called a trajectory point and a trajectory is a sequence of these points. Trajectory mining has applications including but not limited to transportation mode detection, tourism, traffic congestion, smart cities management, animal behaviour analysis, environmental preservation, and traffic dynamics are some of the trajectory mining applications. Transportation modes prediction as one of the tasks in human mobility and vehicle mobility applications plays an important role in resource allocation, traffic management systems, tourism planning and accident detection. In this work, the proposed framework in Etemad et al. is extended to consider other aspects in the task of transportation modes prediction. Wrapper search and information retrieval methods were investigated to find the best subset of trajectory features. Finding the best classifier and the best feature subset, the framework is compared against two related papers that applied deep learning methods. The results show that our framework achieved better performance. Moreover, the ground truth noise removal improved accuracy of transportation modes prediction task; however, the assumption of having access to test set labels in pre-processing task is invalid. Furthermore, the cross validation approaches were investigated and the performance results show that the random cross validation method provides optimistic results.
