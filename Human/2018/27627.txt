Characterising epithelial tissues using persistent entropy

In this paper, we apply persistent entropy, a novel topological statistic, for characterization of images of epithelial tissues. We have found out that persistent entropy is able to summarize topological and geometric information encoded by Î±-complexes and persistent homology. After using some statistical tests, we can guarantee the existence of significant differences in the studied tissues.
