Novel Compliant omnicrawler-wheel transforming module

This paper presents a novel design of a crawler robot which is capable of transforming its chassis from an Omni crawler mode to a large-sized wheel mode using a novel mechanism. The transformation occurs without any additional actuators. Interestingly the robot can transform into a large diameter and small width wheel which enhances its maneuverability like small turning radius and fast/efficient locomotion. This paper contributes on improving the locomotion mode of previously developed hybrid compliant omnicrawler robot CObRaSO. In addition to legged and tracked mechanism, CObRaSO can now display large wheel mode which contributes to its locomotion capabilities. Mechanical design of the robot has been explained in a detailed manner in this paper and also the transforming experiment and torque analysis has been shown clearly
