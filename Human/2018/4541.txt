Obstructions for three-coloring and list three-coloring $H$-free graphs

A graph is $H$-free if it has no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$. We characterize all graphs $H$ for which there are only finitely many minimal non-three-colorable $H$-free graphs. Such a characterization was previously known only in the case when $H$ is connected. This solves a problem posed by Golovach et al. As a second result, we characterize all graphs $H$ for which there are only finitely many $H$-free minimal obstructions for list 3-colorability.
