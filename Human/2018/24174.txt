Comparison of Deep Learning and the Classical Machine Learning Algorithm for the Malware Detection

Recently, Deep Learning has been showing promising results in various Artificial Intelligence applications like image recognition, natural language processing, language modeling, neural machine translation, etc. Although, in general, it is computationally more expensive as compared to classical machine learning techniques, their results are found to be more effective in some cases. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated and compared one of the Deep Learning Architecture called Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the classical Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for the malware classification. We studied the performance of the classical RF and DNN with 2, 4 & 7 layers architectures with the four different feature sets, and found that irrespective of the features inputs, the classical RF accuracy outperforms the DNN.
