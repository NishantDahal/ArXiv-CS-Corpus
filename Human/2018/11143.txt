Recent Advances in DRAM and Flash Memory Architectures

This article features extended summaries and retrospectives of some of the recent research done by our group, SAFARI, on (1) understanding, characterizing, and modeling various critical properties of modern DRAM and NAND flash memory, the dominant memory and storage technologies, respectively; and (2) several new mechanisms we have proposed based on our observations from these analyses, characterization, and modeling, to tackle various key challenges in memory and storage scaling. In order to understand the sources of various bottlenecks of the dominant memory and storage technologies, these works perform rigorous studies of device-level and application-level behavior, using a combination of detailed simulation and experimental characterization of real memory and storage devices.
