ATENSOR - REDUCE program for tensor simplification

The paper presents a REDUCE program for the simplification of tensor expressions that are considered as formal indexed objects. The proposed algorithm is based on the consideration of tensor expressions as vectors in some linear space. This linear space is formed by all the elements of the group algebra of the corresponding tensor expression. Such approach permits us to simplify the tensor expressions possessing symmetry properties, summation (dummy) indices and multiterm identities by unify manner. The canonical element for the tensor expression is defined in terms of the basic vectors of this linear space. The main restriction of the algorithm is the dimension of the linear space that is equal to N!, where N is a number of indices of the tensor expression. The program uses REDUCE as user interface.
