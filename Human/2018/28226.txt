On Demand Cell Sectoring Based Fractional Frequency Reuse in Wireless Networks

In this paper, a dynamic channel assigning along with dynamic cell sectoring model has been proposed that focuses on the Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) not only for interference mitigation but also for enhancement of overall system capacity in wireless networks. We partition the cells in a cluster into two part named centre user part (CUP) and edge user part (EUP). Instead of huge traffic, there may be unoccupied channels in the EUPs of the cells. These unoccupied channels of the EUPs can assist the excessive number of users if these channels are assigned with proper interference management. If the number of traffic of a cell surpasses the number of channels of the EUP, then the cell assigns the channels from the EUP of other cells in the cluster. To alleviate the interference, we propose a dynamic cell sectoring scheme. The scheme sectors the EUP of the cell which assigns channels that the assigned channels are provided to the sectored part where these channels receive negligible interference. The performance analysis illustrates reduced call blocking probability as well as better signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) without sacrificing bandwidth utilization. Besides, the proposed model ensures lower outage probability.
