Data Shuffling in Wireless Distributed Computing via Low-Rank Optimization

Intelligent mobile platforms such as smart vehicles and drones have recently become the focus of attention for onboard deployment of machine learning mechanisms to enable low latency decisions with low risk of privacy breach. However, most such machine learning algorithms are both computation-and-memory intensive, which makes it highly difficult to implement the requisite computations on a single device of limited computation, memory, and energy resources. Wireless distributed computing presents new opportunities by pooling the computation and storage resources among devices. For low-latency applications, the key bottleneck lies in the exchange of intermediate results among mobile devices for data shuffling. To improve communication efficiency, we propose a co-channel communication model and design transceivers by exploiting the locally computed intermediate values as side information. A low-rank optimization model is proposed to maximize the achieved degrees-of-freedom (DoF) by establishing the interference alignment condition for data shuffling. Unfortunately, existing approaches to approximate the rank function fail to yield satisfactory performance due to the poor structure in the formulated low-rank optimization problem. In this paper, we develop an efficient DC algorithm to solve the presented low-rank optimization problem by proposing a novel DC representation for the rank function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DC approach can significantly improve the communication efficiency whereas the achievable DoF almost remains unchanged when the number of mobile devices grows.
