Distinguishing between Communicating Transactions

Communicating transactions is a form of distributed, non-isolated transactions which provides a simple construct for building concurrent systems. In this paper we develop a logical framework to express properties of the observable behaviour of such systems. This comprises three nominal modal logics which share standard communication modalities but have distinct past and future modalities involving transactional commits. All three logics have the same distinguishing power over systems because their associated weak bisimulations coincide with contextual equivalence. Furthermore, they are equally expressive because there are semantics-preserving translations between their formulae. Using the logics we can clearly exhibit subtle example inequivalences. This work presents the first property logics for non-isolated transactions.
