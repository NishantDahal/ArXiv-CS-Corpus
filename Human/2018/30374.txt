Linear Differential Equations as a Data-Structure

A lot of information concerning solutions of linear differential equations can be computed directly from the equation. It is therefore natural to consider these equations as a data-structure, from which mathematical properties can be computed. A variety of algorithms has thus been designed in recent years that do not aim at "solving", but at computing with this representation. Many of these results are surveyed here.
