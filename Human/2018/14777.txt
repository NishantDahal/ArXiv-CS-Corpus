Towards an efficient deep learning model for musical onset detection

In this paper, we propose an efficient and reproducible deep learning model for musical onset detection (MOD). We first review the state-of-the-art deep learning models for MOD, and identify their shortcomings and challenges: (i) the lack of hyper-parameter tuning details, (ii) the non-availability of code for training models on other datasets, and (iii) ignoring the network capability when comparing different architectures. Taking the above issues into account, we experiment with seven deep learning architectures. The most efficient one achieves equivalent performance to our implementation of the state-of-the-art architecture. However, it has only 28.3% of the total number of trainable parameters compared to the state-of-the-art. Our experiments are conducted using two different datasets: one mainly consists of instrumental music excerpts, and another developed by ourselves includes only solo singing voice excerpts. Further, inter-dataset transfer learning experiments are conducted. The results show that the model pre-trained on one dataset fails to detect onsets on another dataset, which denotes the importance of providing the implementation code to enable re-training the model for a different dataset. Datasets, code and a Jupyter notebook running on Google Colab are publicly available to make this research understandable and easy to reproduce.
