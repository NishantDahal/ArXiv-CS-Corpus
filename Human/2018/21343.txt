Shedding Light on Black Box Machine Learning Algorithms: Development of an Axiomatic Framework to Assess the Quality of Methods that Explain Individual Predictions

From self-driving vehicles and back-flipping robots to virtual assistants who book our next appointment at the hair salon or at that restaurant for dinner - machine learning systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. The main reason for this is that these methods boast remarkable predictive capabilities. However, most of these models remain black boxes, meaning that it is very challenging for humans to follow and understand their intricate inner workings. Consequently, interpretability has suffered under this ever-increasing complexity of machine learning models. Especially with regards to new regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the necessity for plausibility and verifiability of predictions made by these black boxes is indispensable. Driven by the needs of industry and practice, the research community has recognised this interpretability problem and focussed on developing a growing number of so-called explanation methods over the past few years. These methods explain individual predictions made by black box machine learning models and help to recover some of the lost interpretability. With the proliferation of these explanation methods, it is, however, often unclear, which explanation method offers a higher explanation quality, or is generally better-suited for the situation at hand. In this thesis, we thus propose an axiomatic framework, which allows comparing the quality of different explanation methods amongst each other. Through experimental validation, we find that the developed framework is useful to assess the explanation quality of different explanation methods and reach conclusions that are consistent with independent research.
