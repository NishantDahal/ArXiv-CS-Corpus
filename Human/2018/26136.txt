InfiniteBoost: building infinite ensembles with gradient descent

In machine learning ensemble methods have demonstrated high accuracy for the variety of problems in different areas. Two notable ensemble methods widely used in practice are gradient boosting and random forests. In this paper we present InfiniteBoost - a novel algorithm, which combines important properties of these two approaches. The algorithm constructs the ensemble of trees for which two properties hold: trees of the ensemble incorporate the mistakes done by others; at the same time the ensemble could contain the infinite number of trees without the over-fitting effect. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the regression, classification, and ranking tasks using large scale, publicly available datasets.
