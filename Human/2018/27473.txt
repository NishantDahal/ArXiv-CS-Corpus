Cyber-Physical Systems, a new formal paradigm to model redundancy and resiliency

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems composed by a physical component that is controlled or monitored by a cyber-component, a computer-based algorithm. Advances in CPS technologies and science are enabling capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will far exceed the simple embedded systems of today. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems. New smart CPS are driving innovation in various sectors such as agriculture, energy, transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing. They are leading the 4-th Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) that is having benefits thanks to the high flexibility of production. The Industry 4.0 production paradigm is characterized by high intercommunicating properties of its production elements in all the manufacturing processes. This is the reason it is a core concept how the systems should be structurally optimized to have the adequate level of redundancy to be satisfactorily resilient. This goal can benefit from formal methods well known in various scientific domains such as artificial intelligence. So, the current research concerns the proposal of a CPS meta-model and its instantiation. In this way it lists all kind of relationships that may occur between the CPSs themselves and between their (cyber-and physical-) components. Using the CPS meta-model formalization, with an adaptation of the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formal approach, this paper presents a way to optimize the modelling of CPS systems emphasizing their redundancy and their resiliency.
