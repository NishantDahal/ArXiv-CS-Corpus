Image Cartoon-Texture Decomposition Using Isotropic Patch Recurrence

Aiming at separating the cartoon and texture layers from an image, cartoon-texture decomposition approaches resort to image priors to model cartoon and texture respectively. In recent years, patch recurrence has emerged as a powerful prior for image recovery. However, the existing strategies of using patch recurrence are ineffective to cartoon-texture decomposition, as both cartoon contours and texture patterns exhibit strong patch recurrence in images. To address this issue, we introduce the isotropy prior of patch recurrence, that the spatial configuration of similar patches in texture exhibits the isotropic structure which is different from that in cartoon, to model the texture component. Based on the isotropic patch recurrence, we construct a nonlocal sparsification system which can effectively distinguish well-patterned features from contour edges. Incorporating the constructed nonlocal system into morphology component analysis, we develop an effective method to both noiseless and noisy cartoon-texture decomposition. The experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method to the existing ones, as well as the effectiveness of the isotropic patch recurrence prior.
