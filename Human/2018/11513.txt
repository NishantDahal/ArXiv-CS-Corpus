Incept-N: A Convolutional Neural Network based Classification Approach for Predicting Nationality from Facial Features

The nationality of a human being is a well-known identifying characteristic used for every major authentication purpose in every country. Albeit advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision in different aspects, its contribution to this specific security procedure is yet to be cultivated. With a goal to successfully applying computer vision techniques to predict the nationality of a person based on his facial features, we have proposed this novel method and have achieved an average of 93.6% accuracy with very low misclassification rate.
