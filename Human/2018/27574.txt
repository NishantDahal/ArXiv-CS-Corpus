A Low Overhead Cooperative-based Authentication Protocol for VANETs

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have been proposed to automate transportation industry in order to increase its accuracy, efficiency, throughput, and specially safety. Security plays an Undeniable important role on implementing VANETs in real life. Authentication is one of the basic elements of VANETs security. Proposed authentications protocols suffer from high overhead and cost. This paper presents a computation division based authentication which divide signature approvals between neighbor vehicles consequently decrease vehicles computation load. Simulation shows presented protocol propose an almost constant latency and closely zero message loss ratio related to traffic load, and improved efficiency compared with GSIS protocol.
