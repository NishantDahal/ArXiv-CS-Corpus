Heuristics for publishing dynamic content as structured data with schema.org

Publishing fast changing dynamic data as open data on the web in a scalable manner is not trivial. So far the only approaches describe publishing as much data as possible, which then leads to problems, like server capacity overload, network latency or unwanted knowledge disclosure. With this paper we show ways how to publish dynamic data in a scalable, meaningful manner by applying context-dependent publication heuristics. The outcome shows that the application of the right publication heuristics in the right domain can improve the publication performance significantly. Good knowledge about the domain help choosing the right publication heuristic and hence lead to very good publication results.
