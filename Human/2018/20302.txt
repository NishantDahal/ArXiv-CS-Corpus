Victory Probability in the Fire Emblem Arena

We demonstrate how to efficiently compute the probability of victory in Fire Emblem arena battles. The probability can be expressed in terms of a multivariate recurrence relation which lends itself to a straightforward dynamic programming solution. Some implementation issues are addressed, and a full implementation is provided in code.
