Security Mental Model: Cognitive map approach

Security models have been designed to ensure data is accessed and used in proper manner according to the security policies. Unfortunately, human role in designing security models has been ignored. Human behavior relates to many security breaches and plays a significant part in many security situations.In this paper, we study users' security decision making toward security and usability through the mental model approach. To elicit and depict users' security and usability mental models, crowd sourcing techniques and cognitive map method are applied and we have performed an experiment to evaluate our findings using Amazon MTurk.
