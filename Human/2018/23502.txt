Towards Game-based Metrics for Computational Co-creativity

We propose the following question: what game-like interactive system would provide a good environment for measuring the impact and success of a co-creative, cooperative agent? Creativity is often formulated in terms of novelty, value, surprise and interestingness. We review how these concepts are measured in current computational intelligence research and provide a mapping from modern electronic and tabletop games to open research problems in mixed-initiative systems and computational co-creativity. We propose application scenarios for future research, and a number of metrics under which the performance of cooperative agents in these environments will be evaluated.
