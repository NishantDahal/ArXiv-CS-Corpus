Wikistat 2.0: Educational Resources for Artificial Intelligence

Big data, data science, deep learning, artificial intelligence are the key words of intense hype related with a job market in full evolution, that impose  to adapt the contents of our university professional trainings. Which artificial intelligence is mostly concerned by the job offers? Which methodologies and technologies should be favored in the training programs? Which objectives, tools and educational resources do we needed to put in place to meet these pressing needs? We answer these questions in describing the contents and operational resources in the Data Science  orientation of  the specialty  Applied Mathematics at INSA Toulouse.  We focus on basic mathematics training (Optimization, Probability, Statistics), associated with the practical implementation of the most performing statistical learning algorithms, with the most appropriate technologies and on real examples. Considering the huge volatility of the technologies, it is imperative to train students in seft-training, this will be their technological watch tool when they will be in professional activity. This  explains  the structuring of the educational site github.com/wikistat into a set of tutorials. Finally, to motivate the thorough practice of these tutorials, a serious game is organized each year in the form of a prediction contest between students of Master degrees in Applied Mathematics for IA.
