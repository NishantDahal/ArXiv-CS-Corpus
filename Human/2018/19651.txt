On the linear complexity for multidimensional sequences

In this paper, we define the linear complexity for multidimensional sequences over finite fields, generalizing the one-dimensional case. We give some lower and upper bounds, valid with large probability, for the linear complexity and $k$-error linear complexity of multidimensional periodic sequences.
