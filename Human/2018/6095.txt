Regular cylindrical algebraic decomposition

We show that a strong well-based cylindrical algebraic decomposition P of a bounded semi-algebraic set is a regular cell decomposition, in any dimension and independently of the method by which P is constructed. Being well-based is a global condition on P that holds for the output of many widely used algorithms. We also show the same for S of dimension at most 3 and P a strong cylindrical algebraic decomposition that is locally boundary simply connected: this is a purely local extra condition.
