In Defense of Single-column Networks for Crowd Counting

Crowd counting usually addressed by density estimation becomes an increasingly important topic in computer vision due to its widespread applications in video surveillance, urban planning, and intelligence gathering. However, it is essentially a challenging task because of the greatly varied sizes of objects, coupled with severe occlusions and vague appearance of extremely small individuals. Existing methods heavily rely on multi-column learning architectures to extract multi-scale features, which however suffer from heavy computational cost, especially undesired for crowd counting. In this paper, we propose the single-column counting network (SCNet) for efficient crowd counting without relying on multi-column networks. SCNet consists of residual fusion modules (RFMs) for multi-scale feature extraction, a pyramid pooling module (PPM) for information fusion, and a sub-pixel convolutional module (SPCM) followed by a bilinear upsampling layer for resolution recovery. Those proposed modules enable our SCNet to fully capture multi-scale features in a compact single-column architecture and estimate high-resolution density map in an efficient way. In addition, we provide a principled paradigm for density map generation and data augmentation for training, which shows further improved performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our SCNet delivers new state-of-the-art performance and surpasses previous methods by large margins, which demonstrates the great effectiveness of SCNet as a single-column network for crowd counting.
