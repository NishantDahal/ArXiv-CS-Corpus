Network-Coding Approach for Information-Centric Networking

The current internet architecture is inefficient in fulfilling the demands of newly emerging internet applications. To address this issue, several over-the-top (OTT) application-level solutions have been employed, making the overall architecture very complex. Information-centric-networking (ICN) architecture has emerged as a promising alternative solution. The ICN architecture decouples the content from the host at the network level and supports the temporary storage of content in an in-network cache. Fundamentally, the ICN can be considered a multisource, multicast content-delivery solution. Because of the benefits of network coding in multicasting scenarios and proven benefits in distributed storage networks, the network coding is apt for the ICN architecture. In this study, we propose a solvable linear network-coding scheme for the ICN architecture. We also propose a practical implementation of the network-coding scheme for the ICN, particularly for the content-centric network (CCN) architecture, which is termed the coded CCN (CCCN). The performance results show that the network-coding scheme improves the performance of the CCN and significantly reduces the network traffic and average download delay.
