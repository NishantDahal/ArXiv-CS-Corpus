An Overview on Data Security in Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing refers to the use of computer resources as a service on-demand via internet. It is mainly based on data and applications outsourcing, traditionally stored on users' computers, to remote servers (datacenters) owned, administered and managed by third parts. This paper is an overview of data security issues in the cloud computing. Its objective is to highlight the principal issues related to data security that raised by cloud environment. To do this, these issues was classified into three categories: 1-data security issues raised by single cloud characteristics compared to traditional infrastructure, 2-data security issues raised by data life cycle in cloud computing (stored, used and transferred data), 3-data security issues associated to data security attributes (confidentiality, integrity and availability). For each category, the common solutions used to secure data in the cloud were emphasized.
