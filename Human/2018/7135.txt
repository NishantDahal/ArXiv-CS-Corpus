Recomputation Enabled Efficient Checkpointing

Systematic checkpointing of the machine state makes restart of execution from a safe state possible upon detection of an error. The time and energy overhead of checkpointing, however, grows with the frequency of checkpointing. Amortizing this overhead becomes especially challenging, considering the growth of expected error rates, as checkpointing frequency tends to increase with increasing error rates. Based on the observation that due to imbalanced technology scaling, recomputing a data value can be more energy efficient than retrieving (i.e., loading) a stored copy, this paper explores how recomputation of data values (which otherwise would be read from a checkpoint from memory or secondary storage) can reduce the machine state to be checkpointed, and thereby reduce the checkpointing overhead. Specifically, the resulting amnesic checkpointing framework AmnesiCHK can reduce the storage overhead by up to 23.91%; time overhead, by 11.92%; and energy overhead, by 12.53%, respectively, even in a relatively small scale system.
