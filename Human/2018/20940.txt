Identifying High-Quality Chinese News Comments Based on Multi-Target Text Matching Model

With the development of information technology, there is an explosive growth in the number of online comment concerning news, blogs and so on. The massive comments are overloaded, and often contain some misleading and unwelcome information. Therefore, it is necessary to identify high-quality comments and filter out low-quality comments. In this work, we introduce a novel task: high-quality comment identification (HQCI), which aims to automatically assess the quality of online comments. First, we construct a news comment corpus, which consists of news, comments, and the corresponding quality label. Second, we analyze the dataset, and find the quality of comments can be measured in three aspects: informativeness, consistency, and novelty. Finally, we propose a novel multi-target text matching model, which can measure three aspects by referring to the news and surrounding comments. Experimental results show that our method can outperform various baselines by a large margin on the news dataset.
