Triangle-mapping Analysis on Spatial Competition and Cooperation of Chinese Cities

In this paper, we empirically analyze the spatial distribution of Chinese cities using a method based on triangle transition. This method uses a regular triangle mapping from the observed cities and its three neighboring cities to analyze their distribution of mapping positions. We find that obvious center-gathering tendency for the relationship between cities and its nearest three cities, indicating the spatial competition between cities. Moreover, we observed the competitive trends between neighboring cities with similar economic volume, and the remarkable cooperative tendency between neighboring cities with large difference on economy. The threshold of the ratio of the two cities' economic volume on the transition from competition to cooperation is about 1.2. These findings are helpful in the understanding of the cities economic relationship, especially in the study of competition and cooperation between cities.
