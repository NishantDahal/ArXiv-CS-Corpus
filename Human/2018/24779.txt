Age of Information in Poisson Networks

The age of information (AoI) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, few works have focused on the analysis of AoI in large wireless networks. In this work, we analyze this metric to characterize timeliness in a Poisson bipolar network, in which spatial distribution, fading, and interference are taken into consideration. We further study the effect of deadline constraint on the AoI. We derive upper and lower bounds for the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the average age in network. Numerical results show that the inclusion of deadline constraint can substantially improve the performance of the system.
