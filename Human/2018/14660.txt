G-BAM: A Generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model for IP/MPLS/DS-TE Networks

Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) configure and handle resource allocation (bandwidth, LSPs, fiber) in networks in general (IP/MPLS/DS-TE, optical domain, other). BAMs currently available for IP/MPLS/DS-TE networks (MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing) basically define resource restrictions (bandwidth) by class (traffic class, application class, user class or other grouping criteria) and allocate on demand this resource. There is a BAM allocation policy inherent for each existing model which behaves differently under distinct network state, such as heavy traffic loads and dynamic traffic and/or application scenarios. A generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model (G-BAM) is proposed in this paper. G-BAM, firstly, incorporates the inherent behavior of currently used BAMs such as MAM, RDM, G-RDM and AllocTC-Sharing in IP/MPLS/DS-TE context. G-BAM, secondly, proposes a new policy/ behavior allocation in addition to existing ones in which additional private resources are incorporated. G-BAM, thirdly, allows a smoother BAM policy transition among existing policy alternatives resulting from MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing adoption independently. The paper focuses on the first characteristics of G-BAM which is to reproduce MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing behaviors. As such, the required configuration to achieve MAM, RDM and AllocTC-Sharing behaviors is presented followed by a proof of concept. Authors argue that the G-BAM reproducibility characteristics may improve overall network resource utilization under distinct traffic profiles.
