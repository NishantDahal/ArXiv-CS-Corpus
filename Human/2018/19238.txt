Mechanical Engineers Training in Using Cloud and Mobile Services in Professional Activity

The purpose of this article is to identify mobile and cloud services of mechanical engineers professional activity and the principles of their use in higher technical education. There have been defined the criteria for evaluation of the tools for edu-cational and professional activities. On the basis of this criteria, more than 30 var-ious cloud services and mobile applications have been analyzed. The analysis has shown that the use of Autodesk cloud services and their integration with cloud services Google is appropriate for professional and practical training of special-ists in applied mechanics, and it promotes an effective development of mechanical engineers ICT competence. The learning tools integrated system model was pro-posed.
