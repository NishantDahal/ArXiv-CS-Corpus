Constraining the Synopsys Pin Access Checker Utility for Improved Standard Cells Library Verification Flow

While standard cell layouts are drawn with minimum design rules for maximum benefit of design area shrinkage, the complicated design rules begin to cause difficulties with signal routes accessing the pins in standard cell layouts. Multiple design iterations are required to resolve routing issues, thus increasing the runtime and the overall chip area. To optimize the chip performance, power and area (PPA) and improve the routability, it is necessary to consider the pin accessibility during standard cell development phase so that each cell is designed to maximize the number of feasible pin-access solutions available to the router. As part of the Synopsys IC Compiler Library Preparation Reference Methodology, the Synopsys Pin Access Checker (PAC) reports DRC violations associated with the standard cell. Based on Synopsys PAC's methodology, we demonstrate several methods to improve the probability of detecting pin accessibility issues, such as reducing the number of cells required for each Synopsys 'testcell', increasing the complexity of the pin connectivity assignment and recommending the router constraints.
