Intelligence Graph

In fact, there exist three genres of intelligence architectures: logics (e.g. \textit{Random Forest, A$^*$ Searching}), neurons (e.g. \textit{CNN, LSTM}) and probabilities (e.g. \textit{Naive Bayes, HMM}), all of which are incompatible to each other. However, to construct powerful intelligence systems with various methods, we propose the intelligence graph (short as \textbf{\textit{iGraph}}), which is composed by both of neural and probabilistic graph, under the framework of forward-backward propagation. By the paradigm of iGraph, we design a recommendation model with semantic principle. First, the probabilistic distributions of categories are generated from the embedding representations of users/items, in the manner of neurons. Second, the probabilistic graph infers the distributions of features, in the manner of probabilities. Last, for the recommendation diversity, we perform an expectation computation then conduct a logic judgment, in the manner of logics. Experimentally, we beat the state-of-the-art baselines and verify our conclusions.
