VLSI Design Of Advanced Digital Filters

The Cascaded Integrator Comb filters (CIC) find many applications in recent electronic devices such as frequency selection functions in a digital radio or modem and any filter structure that is required to efficiently process large sample rate factor. These filters are normally located after the sigma-delta modulator and have a regular structure. These types of filters do not require multipliers and the coefficient storage unlike in the normal digital FIR and IIR filters because of all filter coefficients are unity. Hence, it can be efficiently implemented to operate at high speed. Hence, this book describes the Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) implementation of the CIC filters that are suitable for high-performance audio applications.
