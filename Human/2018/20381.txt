Configuration Space Singularities of The Delta Manipulator

We investigate the configuration space of the Delta-Manipulator, identify 24 points in the configuration space, where the Jacobian of the Constraint Equations looses rank and show, that these are not manifold points of the Real Algebraic Set, which is defined by the Constraint Equations.
