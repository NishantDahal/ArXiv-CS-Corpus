Water Disaggregation via Shape Features based Bayesian Discriminative Sparse Coding

As the issue of freshwater shortage is increasing daily, it is critical to take effective measures for water conservation. According to previous studies, device level consumption could lead to significant freshwater conservation. Existing water disaggregation methods focus on learning the signatures for appliances; however, they are lack of the mechanism to accurately discriminate parallel appliances' consumption. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Discriminative Sparse Coding model using Laplace Prior (BDSC-LP) to extensively enhance the disaggregation performance. To derive discriminative basis functions, shape features are presented to describe the low-sampling-rate water consumption patterns. A Gibbs sampling based inference method is designed to extend the discriminative capability of the disaggregation dictionaries. Extensive experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model using both real-world and synthetic datasets.
