Automatic streetlights that glow on detecting night and object using Arduino

Our manuscript aims to develop a system which will lead to energy conservation and by doing so, we would be able to lighten few more homes. The proposed work is accomplished by using Arduino microcontroller and sensors that will control the electricity based on night and object's detection. Meanwhile, a counter is set that will count the number of objects passed through the road. The beauty of the proposed work is that the wastage of unused electricity can be reduced, lifetime of the streetlights gets enhance because the lights do not stay ON during the whole night, and helps to increase safety measurements. We are confident that the proposed idea will be beneficial in the future applications of microcontrollers and sensors etc.
