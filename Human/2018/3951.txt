Pilot-Assisted Short-Packet Transmission over Multiantenna Fading Channels: A 5G Case Study

Leveraging recent results in finite-blocklength information theory, we investigate the problem of designing a control channel in a 5G system. The setup involves the transmission, under stringent latency and reliability constraints, of a short data packet containing a small information payload, over a propagation channel that offers limited frequency diversity and no time diversity. We present an achievability bound, built upon the random-coding union bound with parameter $s$ (Martinez & Guillén i Fàbregas, 2011), which relies on quadrature phase-shift keying modulation, pilot-assisted transmission to estimate the fading channel, and scaled nearest-neighbor decoding at the receiver. Using our achievability bound, we determine how many pilot symbols should be transmitted to optimally trade between channel-estimation errors and rate loss due to pilot overhead. Our analysis also reveals the importance of using multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or the receiver to provide the spatial diversity needed to meet the stringent reliability constraint.
