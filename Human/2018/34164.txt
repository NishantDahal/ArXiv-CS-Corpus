Smart Humans... WannaDie?

It won't be long until our prostheses, ECG personal monitors, subcutaneous insulin infusors, glasses, etc. become devices of the Internet of Things (IoT), always connected for monitoring, maintenance, charging and tracking. This will be the dawn of the Smart Human, not just a user of the IoT but a Thing in the Internet. How long would it then take for hackers to attack us like they have been attacking IoT devices? What would happen if hackers were able to blackmail us threatening our IoT body parts? Smart Humans may become victims of the devastating attack of WannaDie, a new ransomware that could provide the plot-line for a possible future episode of the Black Mirror TV series.
