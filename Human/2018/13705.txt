Eigenvalues of weakly balanced signed graphs and graphs with negative cliques

In a signed graph $G$, an induced subgraph is called a negative clique if it is a complete graph and all of its edges are negative. In this paper, we give the characteristic polynomials and the eigenvalues of some signed graphs having negative cliques. This includes cycle graphs, path graphs, complete graphs with vertex-disjoint negative cliques of different orders, and star block graphs with negative cliques. Interestingly, if we reverse the signs of the edges of these graphs, we get the families of weakly balanced signed graphs, thus the eigenvalues of wide classes of weakly balanced signed graphs are also calculated. In social network theory, the eigenvalues of the signed graphs play an important role in determining their stability and developing the measures for the degree of balance.
