2D Hybrid chaos map for image security transform based on framelet and cellular automata

In this paper, we provide some safe ways to transfer images securely by using cryptography and steganography methods. In order to enhance the security of the image transmission, we introduce a new type of uniformly distributed 2D-hybrid chaos map based on Logistic, Sine and Tent maps, and use the cellular automata and discrete framelet transform in the proposed algorithms and also mix the position of the image pixels by apply kinds of shifts. To show that the proposed algorithms are able to resist various attacks, different types of simulation results and security analysis are used.
