Some Issues on the Theory of the Mimic-Computing-Oriented Automata

A mimic computing oriented automaton can directly portray the behaviors of a mimic computing system. In this paper, we investigate the following theoretical problems on this type of automata: operational semantics and computational ability. First, we model a systematic structure of mimic computing via a mimic automaton. Second, we propose the operational semantics of the automaton in this scene. Third, the computational ability of this type of automata is studied.
