Driven tabu search: a quantum inherent optimisation

Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Common digital computing encodes the data into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits (qubits). A circuit-based qubit quantum computer exists and is available for experiments via cloud, the IBM quantum experience project. We implemented a Quantum Tabu Search in order to obtain a quantum combinatorial optimisation, suggesting that an entanglement-metaheuristic can display optimal solutions and accelerate the optimisation process by using entangled states. We show by building optimal coupling maps that the distribution of our results gave similar shape as shown previous results in an existing teleport circuit. Our research aims to find which graph of coupling better matches a quantum circuit.
