3D Consistent Biventricular Myocardial Segmentation Using Deep Learning for Mesh Generation

We present a novel automated method to segment the myocardium of both left and right ventricles in MRI volumes. The segmentation is consistent in 3D across the slices such that it can be directly used for mesh generation. Two specific neural networks with multi-scale coarse-to-fine prediction structure are proposed to cope with the small training dataset and trained using an original loss function. The former segments a slice in the middle of the volume. Then the latter iteratively propagates the slice segmentations towards the base and the apex, in a spatially consistent way. We perform 5-fold cross-validation on the 15 cases from STACOM to validate the method. For training, we use real cases and their synthetic variants generated by combining motion simulation and image synthesis. Accurate and consistent testing results are obtained.
