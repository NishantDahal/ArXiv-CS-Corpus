Case for the double-blind peer review

Peer review is a process designed to produce a fair assessment of research quality before the publication of scholarly work in a journal. Demographics, nepotism, and seniority have been all shown to affect reviewer behavior suggesting the most common, single-blind review method (or the less common open review method) might be biased. A survey of current research indicates that double-blind review offers a solution to many biases stemming from author's gender, seniority, or location without imposing any significant downsides.
