Energy Efficiency of Server-Centric PON Data Center Architecture for Fog Computing

In this paper, we utilize Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models to compare the energy efficiency and performance of a server-centric Passive Optical Networks (PON)-based data centers design with different data centers networking topologies for the use in fog computing. For representative MapReduce workloads, completion time results indicate that the server-centric PON-based design achieves 67% reduction in the energy consumption compared to DCell with equivalent performance.
