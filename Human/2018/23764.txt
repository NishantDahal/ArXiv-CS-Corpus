Using JSON-LD to Compose Different IoT and Cloud Services

Internet of things and cloud computing are in the widespread use today, and often work together to accomplish complex business task and use cases. This paper propose the framework and its practical implementation to compose different things as services and cloud services. The ontology based approach and JSON-LD was used to semantically annotate both types of services, and enable the mechanism to semi-automatically compose these services. The use case and proof-of-concept application that use the proposed theoretical approach is also described in this work.
