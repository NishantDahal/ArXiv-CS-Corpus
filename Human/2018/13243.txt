Individual testing is optimal for nonadaptive group testing in the linear regime

We consider nonadaptive probabilistic group testing in the linear regime, where each of n items is defective independently with probability p in (0,1), and p is a constant independent of n. We show that testing each item individually is optimal, in the sense that with fewer than n tests the error probability is bounded away from zero.
