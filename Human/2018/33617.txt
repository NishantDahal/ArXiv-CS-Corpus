On Testing Quantum Programs

A quantum computer (QC) can solve many computational problems more efficiently than a classic one. The field of QCs is growing: companies (such as DWave, IBM, Google, and Microsoft) are building QC offerings. We position that software engineers should look into defining a set of software engineering practices that apply to QC's software. To start this process, we give examples of challenges associated with testing such software and sketch potential solutions to some of these challenges.
