Citation Data-set for Machine Learning Citation Styles and Entity Extraction from Citation Strings

Citation parsing is fundamental for search engines within academia and the protection of intellectual property. Meticulous extraction is further needed when evaluating the similarity of documents and calculating their citation impact. Citation parsing involves the identification and dissection of citation strings into their bibliography components such as "Author", "Volume","Title", etc. This meta-data can be difficult to acquire accurately due to the thousands of different styles and noise that can be applied to a bibliography to create the citation string. Many approaches exist already to accomplish accurate parsing of citation strings. This dissertation describes the creation of a large data-set which can be used to aid in the training of these approaches which have limited data.It also describes the investigation into if the downfall of these approaches to citation parsing and in particular the machine learning based approaches is because of the lack of size associated to the data used to train them.
