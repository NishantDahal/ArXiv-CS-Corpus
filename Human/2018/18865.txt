Digital Geometry, a Survey

This paper provides an overview of modern digital geometry and topology through mathematical principles, algorithms, and measurements. It also covers recent developments in the applications of digital geometry and topology including image processing, computer vision, and data science. Recent research strongly showed that digital geometry has made considerable contributions to modelings and algorithms in image segmentation, algorithmic analysis, and BigData analytics.
