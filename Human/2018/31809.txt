Cocktail BPSK: Energy Reused Scheme for High Achievable Data Rates

The present paper proposes a novel transmission strategy, referred to as cocktail BPSK, whereat two independent BPSKs are superposed with the non-orthogonal basis in a parallel transmission. In contrast to the conventional signal superpositions, the proposed scheme avoids the interference between the two symbols, allows the symbol-energy-reuse of each other and gains the extra energy. Based on the formulation of the mutual informations, the theoretical analysis shows that the cocktail BPSK scheme can achieve high data rate beyond the channel capacity at very low SNR, and the numerical results confirm this approach eventually.
