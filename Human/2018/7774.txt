An Integrative Introduction to Human Augmentation Science

Human Augmentation (HA) spans several technical fields and methodological approaches, including Experimental Psychology, Human-Computer Interaction, Psychophysiology, and Artificial Intelligence. Augmentation involves various strategies for optimizing and controlling cognitive states, which requires an understanding of biological plasticity, dynamic cognitive processes, and models of adaptive systems. As an instructive lesson, we will explore a few HA-related concepts and outstanding issues. Next, we focus on inducing and controlling HA using experimental methods by introducing three techniques for HA implementation: learning augmentation, augmentation using physical media, and extended phenotype modeling. To conclude, we will review integrative approaches to augmentation, which transcend specific functions.
