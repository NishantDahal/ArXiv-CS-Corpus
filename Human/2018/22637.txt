Temporal Correlation of Interference in Vehicular Networks with Shifted-Exponential Time Headways

We consider a one-dimensional vehicular network where the time headway (time difference between successive vehicles as they pass a point on the roadway) follows the shifted-exponential distribution. We show that neglecting the impact of shift in the deployment model, which degenerates the distribution of vehicles to a Poisson Point Process, overestimates the temporal correlation of interference at the origin. The estimation error becomes large at high traffic conditions and small time-lags.
