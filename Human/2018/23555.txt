Co-Creative Level Design via Machine Learning

Procedural Level Generation via Machine Learning (PLGML), the study of generating game levels with machine learning, has received a large amount of recent academic attention. For certain measures these approaches have shown success at replicating the quality of existing game levels. However, it is unclear the extent to which they might benefit human designers. In this paper we present a framework for co-creative level design with a PLGML agent. In support of this framework we present results from a user study and results from a comparative study of PLGML approaches.
