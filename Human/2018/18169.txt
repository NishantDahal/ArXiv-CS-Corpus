Faster than Nyquist Transmission by Non-Orthogonal Time Division Multiplexing of Nyquist Sinc Sequences

One possibility to break down the capacity limit in optical transmission systems are higher spectral efficiencies, enabled by Faster-than-Nyquist signaling. Here we present the utilization of non-orthogonal time division multiplexing of sinc pulse sequences for this purpose. The mathematical expression, with a representation of the Nyquist sinc sequence by a cosine Fourier series and simulation results show that non-orthogonal time-division multiplexing increases the transmittable symbol rate by up to 25%.
