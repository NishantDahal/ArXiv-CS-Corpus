Explaining Deep Learning Models using Causal Inference

Although deep learning models have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, due to the millions of parameters, they are becoming increasingly opaque and complex. In order to establish trust for their widespread commercial use, it is important to formalize a principled framework to reason over these models. In this work, we use ideas from causal inference to describe a general framework to reason over CNN models. Specifically, we build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) as an abstraction over a specific aspect of the CNN. We also formulate a method to quantitatively rank the filters of a convolution layer according to their counterfactual importance. We illustrate our approach with popular CNN architectures such as LeNet5, VGG19, and ResNet32.
