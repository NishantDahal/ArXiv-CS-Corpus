BER measurements in the evaluation of operation correctness of VSAT modem traffic interfaces

This paper presents using bit error rate (BER) measurements to evaluate operation correctness of traffic (input-output) interfaces in modem of very small aperture terminal (VSAT). Such functional tests are carried out, for example, when purchasing communication equipment for armed forces. Generally, available standards do not describe measurement procedures in this area. In this case, accredited laboratories should develop dedicated assessment methodologies. In this paper, we show the methodology for the VSAT modems, which is based on the BER measurements.
