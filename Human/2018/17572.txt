Skin disease identification from dermoscopy images using deep convolutional neural network

In this paper, a deep neural network based ensemble method is experimented for automatic identification of skin disease from dermoscopic images. The developed algorithm is applied on the task3 of the ISIC 2018 challenge dataset (Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection).
