Isogeometric Mortar Coupling for Electromagnetic Problems

This paper discusses and analyses two domain decomposition approaches for electromagnetic problems that allow the combination of domains discretised by either Nédélec-type polynomial finite elements or spline-based isogeometric analysis. The first approach is a new isogeometric mortar method and the second one is based on a modal basis for the Lagrange multiplier space, called state-space concatenation in the engineering literature. Spectral correctness and in particular inf-sup stability of both approaches are analytically and numerically investigated. The new mortar method is shown to be unconditionally stable. Its construction of the discrete Lagrange multiplier space takes advantage of the high continuity of splines, and does not have an analogue for Nédélec finite elements. On the other hand, the approach with modal basis is easier to implement but relies on application knowledge to ensure stability and correctness.
