Energy-Efficient Soft-Assisted Product Decoders

We implement a 1-Tb/s 0.63-pJ/bit soft-assisted product decoder in a 28-nm technology. The decoder uses one bit of soft information to improve its net coding gain by 0.2 dB, reaching 10.3-10.4 dB, which is similar to that of more complex hard-decision staircase decoders.
