Graph Convolutional Neural Networks via Scattering

We generalize the scattering transform to graphs and consequently construct a convolutional neural network on graphs. We show that under certain conditions, any feature generated by such a network is approximately invariant to permutations and stable to graph manipulations. Numerical results demonstrate competitive performance on relevant datasets.
