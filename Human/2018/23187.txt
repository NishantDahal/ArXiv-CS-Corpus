A Preliminary Report on Probabilistic Attack Normal Form for Constellation Semantics

After Dung's founding work in Abstract Argumentation Frameworks there has been a growing interest in extending the Dung's semantics in order to describe more complex or real life situations. Several of these approaches take the direction of weighted or probabilistic extensions. One of the most prominent probabilistic approaches is that of constellation Probabilistic Abstract Argumentation Frameworks from Li~et~al. In this paper, we present a normal form for constellation probabilistic abstract argumentation frameworks. Furthermore, we present a transformation from general constellation probabilistic abstract argumentation frameworks to the presented normal form. In this way we illustrate that the simpler normal form has equal representation power with the general one.
