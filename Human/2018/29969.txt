Finite-time Heterogeneous Cyclic Pursuit with Application to Target Interception

This paper presents a finite-time heterogeneous cyclic pursuit scheme that ensures consensus among agents modelled as integrators. It is shown that for the proposed sliding mode control, even when the gains corresponding to each agent are non-identical, consensus results within a finite-time provided all the gains are positive. An algorithm is presented to compute the consensus value and consensus time for a given set of gains and initial states of the agents. The set of values where consensus can occur, by varying the gains, has been derived and a second algorithm aids in determining the gains that enable consensus at any point in the aforementioned set, within a given finite-time. As an application, the finite-time consensus in line-of-sight (LOS) rates, over a cycle digraph, for a group of interceptors is shown to be effective in ensuring co-operative collision-free interception of a target, for both kinematic and realistic models of the interceptors. Simulations vindicate the theoretical results.
