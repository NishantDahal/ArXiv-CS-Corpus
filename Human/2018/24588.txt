Integration of Relational and Graph Databases Functionally

A significant category of NoSQL approaches is known as graph da-tabases. They are usually represented by one property graph. We introduce a functional approach to modelling relations and property graphs. Single-valued and multivalued functions will be sufficient in this case. Then, a typed Î»-calculus, i.e., the language of lambda terms, will be used as a data manipulation lan-guage. Some integration options at the query language level are discussed.
