Connected greedy coloring $H$-free graphs

A connected ordering $(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n)$ of $V(G)$ is an ordering of the vertices such that $v_i$ has at least one neighbour in $\{v_1, \ldots, v_{i - 1}\}$ for every $i \in \{2, \ldots, n\}$. A connected greedy coloring (CGC for short) is a coloring obtained by applying the greedy algorithm to a connected ordering. This has been first introduced in 1989 by Hertz and de Werra, but still very little is known about this problem. An interesting aspect is that, contrary to the traditional greedy coloring, it is not always true that a graph has a connected ordering that produces an optimal coloring; this motivates the definition of the connected chromatic number of $G$, which is the smallest value $χ_c(G)$ such that there exists a CGC of $G$ with $χ_c(G)$ colors. An even more interesting fact is that $χ_c(G) \le χ(G)+1$ for every graph $G$ (Benevides et. al. 2014).
  In this paper, in the light of the dichotomy for the coloring problem restricted to $H$-free graphs given by Král et.al. in 2001, we are interested in investigating the problems of, given an $H$-free graph $G$: (1). deciding whether $χ_c(G)=χ(G)$; and (2). given also a positive integer $k$, deciding whether $χ_c(G)\le k$. We have proved that Problem (2) has the same dichotomy as the coloring problem (i.e., it is polynomial when $H$ is an induced subgraph of $P_4$ or of $P_3+K_1$, and it is NP-complete otherwise). As for Problem (1), we have proved that $χ_c(G) = χ(G)$ always hold when $G$ is an induced subgraph of $P_5$ or of $P_4+K_1$, and that it is NP-hard to decide whether $χ_c(G)=χ(G)$ when $H$ is not a linear forest or contains an induced $P_9$. We mention that some of the results actually involve fixed $k$ and fixed $χ(G)$.
