Cooperative Communication based Connectivity Recovery for UAV Networks

UAV networks often partition into separated clusters due to the high node and link dynamic. As a result, network connectivity recovery is an important issue in this area. Existing solutions always need excessive movement of nodes and thus lead to low recovery efficiency in terms of the time and energy consumption. In this paper, we for the first time study the issue of how to utilize cooperative communication technology to improve the connectivity recovery efficiency in UAV networks. We propose a Cooperative Communication based Connectivity Recovery algorithm for UAV Networks, named C3RUN. The key novelty is C3RUN not only uses cooperative communication to enlarge node's communication range and thus achieve quick repair of network connectivity, but also enables nodes to proactively move to better places for ensuring the establishment of cooperative communication links. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of C3RUN. The simulation results reveal that C3RUN can not only achieve connectivity recovery with less nodes and shorter distance to move, but also always finish recovery with less time, when comparing with existing work. Furthermore, C3RUN can achieve 100% success ratio for connectivity recovery.
