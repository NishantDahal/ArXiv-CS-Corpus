Classification Algorithms for Semi-Blind Uplink/Downlink Decoupling in sub-6 GHz/mmWave 5G Networks

Reliability and latency challenges in future mixed sub-6 GHz/millimeter wave (mmWave) fifth generation (5G) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks is to guarantee a fast radio resource management in both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), while tackling the corresponding propagation imbalance that may arise in blockage situations. In this context, we introduce a semi-blind UL/DL decoupling concept where, after its initial activation, the central processing unit (CPU) gathers measurements of the Rician $K$-factor---reflecting the line-of-sight (LOS) condition of the user equipment (UE)---as well as the DL reference signal receive power (RSRP) for both 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz frequency bands, and then train a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The CPU finally stops the measurements of mmWave definitely, and apply the trained SVM algorithm on the 2.6 GHz data to blindly predict the target frequencies and access points (APs) that can be independently used for the UL and DL. The accuracy score of the proposed classifier reaches $95\%$ for few training samples.
