SideRand: A Heuristic and Prototype of a Side-Channel-Based Cryptographically Secure Random Seeder Designed to Be Platform- and Architecture-Agnostic

Generating secure random numbers is vital to the security and privacy infrastructures we rely on today. Having a computer system generate a secure random number is not a trivial problem due to the deterministic nature of computer systems. Servers commonly deal with this problem through hardware-based random number generators, which can come in the form of expansion cards, dongles, or integrated into the CPU itself. With the explosion of network- and internet-connected devices, however, the problem of cryptography is no longer a server-centric problem; even small devices need a reliable source of randomness for cryptographic operations - for example, network devices and appliances like routers, switches and access points, as well as various Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices for security and remote management. This paper proposes a software solution based on side-channel measurements as a source of high-quality entropy (nicknamed "SideRand"), that can theoretically be applied to most platforms (large servers, appliances, even maker boards like RaspberryPi or Arduino), and generates a seed for a regular CSPRNG to enable proper cryptographic operations for security and privacy. This paper also proposes two criteria - openness and auditability - as essential requirements for confidence in any random generator for cryptographic use, and discusses how SideRand meets the two criteria (and how most hardware devices do not).
