Real-time Analog Pixel-to-pixel Dynamic Frame Differencing with Memristive Sensing Circuits

In this paper, we propose an analog pixel differencing circuit for differentiating pixels between frames directly from CMOS pixels. The analog information processing at sensor is a topic of growing appeal to develop edge AI devices. The proposed circuit is integrated into a pixel-parallel and pixel-column architectures. The proposed system is design using TSMC $180nm$ CMOS technology. The power dissipation of the proposed circuit is $96.64mW$, and on-chip ares is $531.66 Î¼m^2$. The architectures are tested for moving object detection application.
