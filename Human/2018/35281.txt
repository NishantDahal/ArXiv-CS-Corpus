Boosting Model Performance through Differentially Private Model Aggregation

A key factor in developing high performing machine learning models is the availability of sufficiently large datasets. This work is motivated by applications arising in Software as a Service (SaaS) companies where there exist numerous similar yet disjoint datasets from multiple client companies. To overcome the challenges of insufficient data without explicitly aggregating the clients' datasets due to privacy concerns, one solution is to collect more data for each individual client, another is to privately aggregate information from models trained on each client's data. In this work, two approaches for private model aggregation are proposed that enable the transfer of knowledge from existing models trained on other companies' datasets to a new company with limited labeled data while protecting each client company's underlying individual sensitive information. The two proposed approaches are based on state-of-the-art private learning algorithms: Differentially Private Permutation-based Stochastic Gradient Descent and Approximate Minima Perturbation. We empirically show that by leveraging differentially private techniques, we can enable private model aggregation and augment data utility while providing provable mathematical guarantees on privacy. The proposed methods thus provide significant business value for SaaS companies and their clients, specifically as a solution for the cold-start problem.
