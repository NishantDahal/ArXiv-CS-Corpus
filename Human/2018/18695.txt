Corrigendum to New Generalized Cyclotomic Binary Sequences of Period $p^2$

New generalized cyclotomic binary sequences of period $p^2$ are proposed in this paper, where $p$ is an odd prime. The sequences are almost balanced and their linear complexity is determined. The result shows that the proposed sequences have very large linear complexity if $p$ is a non-Wieferich prime.
