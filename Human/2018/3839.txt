On taking advantage of multiple requests in error correcting codes

In most notions of locality in error correcting codes -- notably locally recoverable codes (LRCs) and locally decodable codes (LDCs) -- a decoder seeks to learn a single symbol of a message while looking at only a few symbols of the corresponding codeword. However, suppose that one wants to recover r > 1 symbols of the message. The two extremes are repeating the single-query algorithm r times (this is the intuition behind LRCs with availability, primitive multiset batch codes, and PIR codes) or simply running a global decoding algorithm to recover the whole thing. In this paper, we investigate what can happen in between these two extremes: at what value of r does repetition stop being a good idea? In order to begin to study this question we introduce robust batch codes, which seek to find r symbols of the message using m queries to the codeword, in the presence of erasures. We focus on the case where r = m, which can be seen as a generalization of the MDS property. Surprisingly, we show that for this notion of locality, repetition is optimal even up to very large values of $r = Î©(k)$.
