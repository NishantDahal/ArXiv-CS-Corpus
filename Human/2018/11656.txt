Interference Analysis in Dynamic TDD System Combined or not With Cell Clustering Scheme

Dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) has been introduced as a solution to deal with the uplink and downlink traffic asymmetry, mainly observed for dense heterogeneous network deployments. However, the use of this feature requires new interference mitigation schemes capable to handle two additional types of interferences between cells in opposite transmission cycle: downlink to uplink and uplink to downlink interferences. Among them, Cell clustering has been proposed as an efficient solution to minimize inter-cell interferences in opposite transmission directions and somehow responds to the requirements of enhanced Interference Mitigation and Traffic Adaptation (eIMTA) problem. This work is devoted to provide a new analytical approach to model inter-cell interferences and quantify performances of Dynamic TDD system in terms of SINR (Signal to Interferences plus Noise Ratio) distribution. Analytical system performance investigation concerns two scenarios: i) basic Dynamic TDD without any other feature and ii) Dynamic TDD with interference mitigation schemes.
