Melanoma Recognition with an Ensemble of Techniques for Segmentation and a Structural Analysis for Classification

An approach to lesion recognition is described that for lesion localization uses an ensemble of segmentation techniques and for lesion classification an exhaustive structural analysis. For localization, candidate regions are obtained from global thresholding of the chromatic maps and from applying the K-Means algorithm to the RGB image; the candidate regions are then integrated. For classification, a relatively exhaustive structural analysis of contours and regions is carried out.
