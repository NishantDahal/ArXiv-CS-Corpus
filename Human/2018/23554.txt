Towards Automated Let's Play Commentary

We introduce the problem of generating Let's Play-style commentary of gameplay video via machine learning. We propose an analysis of Let's Play commentary and a framework for building such a system. To test this framework we build an initial, naive implementation, which we use to interrogate the assumptions of the framework. We demonstrate promising results towards future Let's Play commentary generation.
