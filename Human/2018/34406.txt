Exploration Bonus for Regret Minimization in Undiscounted Discrete and Continuous Markov Decision Processes

We introduce and analyse two algorithms for exploration-exploitation in discrete and continuous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) based on exploration bonuses. SCAL$^+$ is a variant of SCAL (Fruit et al., 2018) that performs efficient exploration-exploitation in any unknown weakly-communicating MDP for which an upper bound C on the span of the optimal bias function is known. For an MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions and $Γ\leq S$ possible next states, we prove that SCAL$^+$ achieves the same theoretical guarantees as SCAL (i.e., a high probability regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(C\sqrt{ΓSAT})$), with a much smaller computational complexity. Similarly, C-SCAL$^+$ exploits an exploration bonus to achieve sublinear regret in any undiscounted MDP with continuous state space. We show that C-SCAL$^+$ achieves the same regret bound as UCCRL (Ortner and Ryabko, 2012) while being the first implementable algorithm with regret guarantees in this setting. While optimistic algorithms such as UCRL, SCAL or UCCRL maintain a high-confidence set of plausible MDPs around the true unknown MDP, SCAL$^+$ and C-SCAL$^+$ leverage on an exploration bonus to directly plan on the empirically estimated MDP, thus being more computationally efficient.
