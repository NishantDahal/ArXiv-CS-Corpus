Acquisition and use of knowledge over a restricted domain by intelligent agents

This short paper provides a description of an architecture to acquisition and use of knowledge by intelligent agents over a restricted domain of the Internet Infrastructure. The proposed architecture is added to an intelligent agent deployment model over a very useful server for Internet Autonomous System administrators. Such servers, which are heavily dependent on arbitrary and eventual updates of human beings, become unreliable. This is a position paper that proposes three research questions that are still in progress.
