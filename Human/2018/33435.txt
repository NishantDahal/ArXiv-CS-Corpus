Éléments pour la conception de Jeux Éducatifs sur Mobile

School classrooms are equipped with more and more mobile devices. However, the latest studies show that their use by teachers is still very limited because of a lack of resources and applications adapted to use these artifacts in education. Among the new directions of use, research conducted on Mobile Learning Games (MLGs) seems very promising. In this article we propose to identify the MLGs from the most referenced research articles and that have proven their value in educational context, in order to determine their features and impact on learners. This study will then allow us to define the common characteristics of these MLGs and identify the main problems that occur when they are used by teachers.
