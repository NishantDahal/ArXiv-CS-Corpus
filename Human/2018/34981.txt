Making BREAD: Biomimetic strategies for Artificial Intelligence Now and in the Future

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution foretold of during the 1960s is well underway in the second decade of the 21st century. Its period of phenomenal growth likely lies ahead. Still, we believe, there are crucial lessons that biology can offer that will enable a prosperous future for AI. For machines in general, and for AI's especially, operating over extended periods or in extreme environments will require energy usage orders of magnitudes more efficient than exists today. In many operational environments, energy sources will be constrained. Any plans for AI devices operating in a challenging environment must begin with the question of how they are powered, where fuel is located, how energy is stored and made available to the machine, and how long the machine can operate on specific energy units. Hence, the materials and technologies that provide the needed energy represent a critical challenge towards future use-scenarios of AI and should be integrated into their design. Here we make four recommendations for stakeholders and especially decision makers to facilitate a successful trajectory for this technology. First, that scientific societies and governments coordinate Biomimetic Research for Energy-efficient, AI Designs (BREAD); a multinational initiative and a funding strategy for investments in the future integrated design of energetics into AI. Second, that biomimetic energetic solutions be central to design consideration for future AI. Third, that a pre-competitive space be organized between stakeholder partners and fourth, that a trainee pipeline be established to ensure the human capital required for success in this area.
