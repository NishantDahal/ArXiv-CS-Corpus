Evolutionary Centrality and Maximal Cliques in Mobile Social Networks

This paper introduces an evolutionary approach to enhance the process of finding central nodes in mobile networks. This can provide essential information and important applications in mobile and social networks. This evolutionary approach considers the dynamics of the network and takes into consideration the central nodes from previous time slots. We also study the applicability of maximal cliques algorithms in mobile social networks and how it can be used to find the central nodes based on the discovered maximal cliques. The experimental results are promising and show a significant enhancement in finding the central nodes.
