Climate Anomalies vs Air Pollution: Carbon Emissions and Anomaly Networks

This project aims to shed light on how man-made carbon emissions are affecting global wind patterns by looking for temporal and geographical correlations between carbon emissions, surface temperatures anomalies, and wind speed anomalies at high altitude. We use a networks-based approach and daily data from 1950 to 2010 [1-3] to model and draw correlations between disparate regions of the globe.
