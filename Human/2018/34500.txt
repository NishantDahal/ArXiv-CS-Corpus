Ramp-based Twin Support Vector Clustering

Traditional plane-based clustering methods measure the cost of within-cluster and between-cluster by quadratic, linear or some other unbounded functions, which may amplify the impact of cost. This letter introduces a ramp cost function into the plane-based clustering to propose a new clustering method, called ramp-based twin support vector clustering (RampTWSVC). RampTWSVC is more robust because of its boundness, and thus it is more easier to find the intrinsic clusters than other plane-based clustering methods. The non-convex programming problem in RampTWSVC is solved efficiently through an alternating iteration algorithm, and its local solution can be obtained in a finite number of iterations theoretically. In addition, the nonlinear manifold-based formation of RampTWSVC is also proposed by kernel trick. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show the better performance of our RampTWSVC compared with other plane-based clustering methods.
