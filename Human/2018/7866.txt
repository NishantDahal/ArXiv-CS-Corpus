System Description of CITlab's Recognition & Retrieval Engine for ICDAR2017 Competition on Information Extraction in Historical Handwritten Records

We present a recognition and retrieval system for the ICDAR2017 Competition on Information Extraction in Historical Handwritten Records which successfully infers person names and other data from marriage records. The system extracts information from the line images with a high accuracy and outperforms the baseline. The optical model is based on Neural Networks. To infer the desired information, regular expressions are used to describe the set of feasible words sequences.
