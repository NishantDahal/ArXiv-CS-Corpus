The AAU Multimodal Annotation Toolboxes: Annotating Objects in Images and Videos

This tech report gives an introduction to two annotation toolboxes that enable the creation of pixel and polygon-based masks as well as bounding boxes around objects of interest. Both toolboxes support the annotation of sequential images in the RGB and thermal modalities. Each annotated object is assigned a classification tag, a unique ID, and one or more optional meta data tags. The toolboxes are written in C++ with the OpenCV and Qt libraries and are operated by using the visual interface and the extensive range of keyboard shortcuts. Pre-built binaries are available for Windows and MacOS and the tools can be built from source under Linux as well. So far, tens of thousands of frames have been annotated using the toolboxes.
