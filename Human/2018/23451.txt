Multi-Cell Multi-User Massive FD-MIMO: Downlink Precoding and Throughput Analysis

In this paper, downlink (DL) precoding and power allocation strategies are identified for a time-division-duplex (TDD) multi-cell multi-user massive Full-Dimension MIMO (FD-MIMO) network. Utilizing channel reciprocity, DL channel state information (CSI) feedback is eliminated and the DL multi-user MIMO precoding is linked to the uplink (UL) direction of arrival (DoA) estimation through estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT). Assuming non-orthogonal/non-ideal spreading sequences of the UL pilots, the performance of the UL DoA estimation is analytically characterized and the characterized DoA estimation error is incorporated into the corresponding DL precoding and power allocation strategy. Simulation results verify the accuracy of our analytical characterization of the DoA estimation and demonstrate that the introduced multi-user MIMO precoding and power allocation strategy outperforms existing zero-forcing based massive MIMO strategies.
