A Deep Learning Strategy for Vehicular Floating Content Management

Floating Content (FC) is a communication paradigm for the local dissemination of contextualized information through D2D connectivity, in a way which minimizes the use of resources while achieving some specified performance target. Existing approaches to FC dimensioning are based on unrealistic system assumptions that make them, highly inaccurate and overly conservative when applied in realistic settings. In this paper, we present a first step towards the development of a cognitive approach to efficient dynamic management of FC. We propose a deep learning strategy for FC dimensioning, which exploits a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to efficiently modulate over time the resources employed by FC in a QoS-aware manner. Numerical evaluations show that our approach achieves a maximum rejection rate of3%, and resource savings of 37.5% with respect to the benchmark strategy
