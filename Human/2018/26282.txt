Computing Vertex Centrality Measures in Massive Real Networks with a Neural Learning Model

Vertex centrality measures are a multi-purpose analysis tool, commonly used in many application environments to retrieve information and unveil knowledge from the graphs and network structural properties. However, the algorithms of such metrics are expensive in terms of computational resources when running real-time applications or massive real world networks. Thus, approximation techniques have been developed and used to compute the measures in such scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze the use of neural network learning algorithms to tackle such task and compare their performance in terms of solution quality and computation time with other techniques from the literature. Our work offers several contributions. We highlight both the pros and cons of approximating centralities though neural learning. By empirical means and statistics, we then show that the regression model generated with a feedforward neural networks trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is not only the best option considering computational resources, but also achieves the best solution quality for relevant applications and large-scale networks.
