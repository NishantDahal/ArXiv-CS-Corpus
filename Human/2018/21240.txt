Constant Arboricity Spectral Sparsifiers

We show that every graph is spectrally similar to the union of a constant number of forests. Moreover, we show that Spielman-Srivastava sparsifiers are the union of O(logn) forests. This result can be used to estimate boundaries of small subsets of vertices in nearly optimal query time.
