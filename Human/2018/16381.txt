Teaching Machines to Code: Neural Markup Generation with Visual Attention

We present a neural transducer model with visual attention that learns to generate LaTeX markup of a real-world math formula given its image. Applying sequence modeling and transduction techniques that have been very successful across modalities such as natural language, image, handwriting, speech and audio; we construct an image-to-markup model that learns to produce syntactically and semantically correct LaTeX markup code over 150 words long and achieves a BLEU score of 89%; improving upon the previous state-of-art for the Im2Latex problem. We also demonstrate with heat-map visualization how attention helps in interpreting the model and can pinpoint (detect and localize) symbols on the image accurately despite having been trained without any bounding box data.
