Differential quadrature element for second strain gradient beam theory

In this paper, first we present the variational formulation for a second strain gradient Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for the first time. The governing equation and associated classical and non-classical boundary conditions are obtained. Later, we propose a novel and efficient differential quadrature element based on Lagrange interpolation to solve the eight order partial differential equation associated with the second strain gradient Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The second strain gradient theory has displacement, slope, curvature and triple displacement derivative as degrees of freedom. A generalize scheme is proposed herein to implement these multi-degrees of freedom in a simplified and efficient way. The proposed element is based on the strong form of governing equation and has displacement as the only degree of freedom in the domain, whereas, at the boundaries it has displacement, slope, curvature and triple derivative of displacement. A novel DQ framework is presented to incorporate the classical and non-classical boundary conditions by modifying the conventional weighting coefficients. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed element is demonstrated through numerical examples on static, free vibration and stability analysis of second strain gradient elastic beams for different boundary conditions and intrinsic length scale values.
