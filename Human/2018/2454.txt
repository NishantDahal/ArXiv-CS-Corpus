Privacy Leakages in Approximate Adders

Approximate computing has recently emerged as a promising method to meet the low power requirements of digital designs. The erroneous outputs produced in approximate computing can be partially a function of each chip's process variation. We show that, in such schemes, the erroneous outputs produced on each chip instance can reveal the identity of the chip that performed the computation, possibly jeopardizing user privacy. In this work, we perform simulation experiments on 32-bit Ripple Carry Adders, Carry Lookahead Adders, and Han-Carlson Adders running at over-scaled operating points. Our results show that identification is possible, we contrast the identifiability of each type of adder, and we quantify how success of identification varies with the extent of over-scaling and noise. Our results are the first to show that approximate digital computations may compromise privacy. Designers of future approximate computing systems should be aware of the possible privacy leakages and decide whether mitigation is warranted in their application.
