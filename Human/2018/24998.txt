Driving Experience Transfer Method for End-to-End Control of Self-Driving Cars

In this paper, we present a transfer learning method for the end-to-end control of self-driving cars, which enables a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a source domain to be utilized for the same task in a different target domain. A conventional CNN for the end-to-end control is designed to map a single front-facing camera image to a steering command. To enable the transfer learning, we let the CNN produce not only a steering command but also a lane departure level (LDL) by adding a new task module, which takes the output of the last convolutional layer as input. The CNN trained on the source domain, called source network, is then utilized to train another task module called target network, which also takes the output of the last convolutional layer of the source network and is trained to produce a steering command for the target domain. The steering commands from the source and target network are finally merged according to the LDL and the merged command is utilized for controlling a car in the target domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we utilized two simulators, TORCS and GTAV, for the source and the target domains, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of stable and safe control of cars.
