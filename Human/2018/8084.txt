Feasibility of sensor-based technology for monitoring health in developing countries - cost analysis and user perception aspects

Understanding the financial burden of chronic diseases in developing regions still remains an important economical factor which influences the successful implementation of sensor based applications for continuous monitoring of chronic conditions. Our research focused on a comparison of literature-based data with real costs of the management and treatment of chronic diseases in a developing country, and we are using Kosovo as an example here. The results reveal that the actual living costs exceed the minimum expenses that chronic diseases impose. Following the potential of a positive economic impact of sensor based platforms for monitoring chronic conditions, we further examined the users perception of digital technology. The purpose of this paper is to present the varying cost levels of treating chronic diseases, identify the users concerns and requirements towards digital technology and discuss issues and challenges that the application of sensor based platforms imply in low and middle income countries.
