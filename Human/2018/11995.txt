Lehmer Transform and its Theoretical Properties

We propose a new class of transforms that we call {\it Lehmer Transform} which is motivated by the {\it Lehmer mean function}. The proposed {\it Lehmer transform} decomposes a function of a sample into their constituting statistical moments. Theoretical properties of the proposed transform are presented. This transform could be very useful to provide an alternative method in analyzing non-stationary signals such as brain wave EEG.
