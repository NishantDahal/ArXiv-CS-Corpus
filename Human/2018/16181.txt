A Fast Hierarchically Preconditioned Eigensolver Based On Multiresolution Matrix Decomposition

In this paper we propose a new iterative method to hierarchically compute a relatively large number of leftmost eigenpairs of a sparse symmetric positive matrix under the multiresolution operator compression framework. We exploit the well-conditioned property of every decomposition components by integrating the multiresolution framework into the Implicitly restarted Lanczos method. We achieve this combination by proposing an extension-refinement iterative scheme, in which the intrinsic idea is to decompose the target spectrum into several segments such that the corresponding eigenproblem in each segment is well-conditioned. Theoretical analysis and numerical illustration are also reported to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of this algorithm.
