Full-Duplex Heterogeneous Networks with Decoupled User Association: Rate Analysis and Traffic Scheduling

Full-duplex (FD) transmission in a point-to-point (P2P) link, wherein bidirectional traffic flows simultaneously share the same spectrum, has the capability of doubling the link rate by completely removing self-interferences. However, the rate gain of FD transmission in an interference-limited network is not as clear as a P2P link due to the interferences induced by complex FD and half-duplex (HD) transmission behaviors in the network. To thoroughly investigate the achievable link rates of users and base stations (BSs) in a heterogeneous network (HetNet) with decoupled user association, a general approach is proposed to model a HetNet in which all BSs and users can perform HD or FD transmission depending on their traffic patterns. We first characterize the decoupled rate-optimal user association scheme and use it to define the downlink and uplink rates in the HetNet. The tight lower bounds on the link rates of the FD users and BSs are found in a neat form that characterizes general channel fading, user and BS intensities and imperfect self-interference cancellation. These bounds outline the rate regions of the FD users that inspire proposing the opportunistic FD scheduling algorithms maximizing the sum rate of each bidirectional traffic and stabilize each of the queues in the HetNet.
