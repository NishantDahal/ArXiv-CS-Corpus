Real-time Local Noise Filter in 3D Visualization of CT Data

Removing noise in computer tomography (CT) data for real-time 3D visualization is vital to improving the quality of the final display. However, the CT noise cannot be removed by straight averaging because the noise has a broadband spatial frequency that is overlapping with the interesting signal frequencies. To improve the display of structures and features contained in the data, we present spatially variant filtering that performs averaging of sub-regions around a central region. We compare our filter with four other similar spatially variant filters regarding entropy and processing time. The results demonstrate significant improvement of the visual quality with processing time still within the millisecond range.
