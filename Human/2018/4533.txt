Network structure from rich but noisy data

Driven by growing interest in the sciences, industry, and among the broader public, a large number of empirical studies have been conducted in recent years of the structure of networks ranging from the internet and the world wide web to biological networks and social networks. The data produced by these experiments are often rich and multimodal, yet at the same time they may contain substantial measurement error. In practice, this means that the true network structure can differ greatly from naive estimates made from the raw data, and hence that conclusions drawn from those naive estimates may be significantly in error. In this paper we describe a technique that circumvents this problem and allows us to make optimal estimates of the true structure of networks in the presence of both richly textured data and significant measurement uncertainty. We give example applications to two different social networks, one derived from face-to-face interactions and one from self-reported friendships.
