Non-parametric Estimation of Mutual Information with Application to Nonlinear Optical Fibers

This paper compares and evaluates a set of non-parametric mutual information estimators with the goal of providing a novel toolset to progress in the analysis of the capacity of the nonlinear optical channel, which is currently an open problem. In the first part of the paper, the methods of the study are presented. The second part details their application to several optically-related channels to highlight their features.
