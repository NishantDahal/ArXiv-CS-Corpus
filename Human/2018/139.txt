Object-based reasoning in VQA

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a novel problem domain where multi-modal inputs must be processed in order to solve the task given in the form of a natural language. As the solutions inherently require to combine visual and natural language processing with abstract reasoning, the problem is considered as AI-complete. Recent advances indicate that using high-level, abstract facts extracted from the inputs might facilitate reasoning. Following that direction we decided to develop a solution combining state-of-the-art object detection and reasoning modules. The results, achieved on the well-balanced CLEVR dataset, confirm the promises and show significant, few percent improvements of accuracy on the complex "counting" task.
