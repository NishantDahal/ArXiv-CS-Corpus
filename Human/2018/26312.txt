DCLab: A Web-based System for Digital Logic Experiment Teaching

This Research-to-Practice Work in Progress paper presents DCLab, a web-based system for conducting digital logic experiments online, to improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of digital logic experiment teaching. DCLab covers all experimental contents required by traditional digital logic experiment classes. It allows the students to draw circuit diagrams or to write VHDL code to design their own circuits, and it provides complete simulation functions. DCLab records the progress of each student and makes it convenient for a student to review the history of his practice. Furthermore, for the instructors, they are able to post homework assignments on DCLab, and the system will automatically add homework projects to the students' home pages. Statistics about how the students perform on the homework will be displayed to the instructors, which may help them develop more effective courses. We have tested DCLab among students in the digital logic course, and the results have confirmed its validity.
