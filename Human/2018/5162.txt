Deep Representation for Patient Visits from Electronic Health Records

We show how to learn low-dimensional representations (embeddings) of patient visits from the corresponding electronic health record (EHR) where International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes are removed. We expect that these embeddings will be useful for the construction of predictive statistical models anticipated to drive personalized medicine and improve healthcare quality. These embeddings are learned using a deep neural network trained to predict ICD diagnosis categories. We show that our embeddings capture relevant clinical informations and can be used directly as input to standard machine learning algorithms like multi-output classifiers for ICD code prediction. We also show that important medical informations correspond to particular directions in our embedding space.
