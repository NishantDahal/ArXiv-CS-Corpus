Multicast Networks Solvable over Every Finite Field

In this work, it is revealed that an acyclic multicast network that is scalar linearly solvable over Galois Field of two elements, GF(2), is solvable over all higher finite fields. An algorithm which, given a GF(2) solution for an acyclic multicast network, computes the solution over any arbitrary finite field is presented. The concept of multicast matroid is introduced in this paper. Gammoids and their base-orderability along with the regularity of a binary multicast matroid are used to prove the results.
