Mechanisms for producing a working knowledge: Enacting, orchestrating and organizing

Given that knowledge (intensive) work takes place immersed in truly heterogenous networks of knowledge representations (codified, narrative, embedded in routines, inscribed in artefacts), our analysis is geared towards how the transformation of these resources are enacted in the practise of everyday, knowledge work. First, we discuss the work, strategies and mechanisms implied in rendering knowledge as credible, trustworthy and relevant. Second, we analyse how sediments of historically superimposed layers of knowledge representations need to be enacted through selective repetitions, omittance and highlighting to preserve it as living knowledge. Third, supplementing the more cognitivelly oriented aspects of knowledge work, we discuss how codified knowledge representations organise, coordinate and delegate work. Empirically, we study clinical work in large hospitals, a type of work, we argue, that unduely has been left out of traditional listings of knowledge work
