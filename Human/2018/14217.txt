Theory of Machine Networks: A Case Study

We propose a simplification of the Theory-of-Mind Network architecture, which focuses on modeling complex, deterministic machines as a proxy for modeling nondeterministic, conscious entities. We then validate this architecture in the context of understanding engines, which, we argue, meet the required internal and external complexity to yield meaningful abstractions.
