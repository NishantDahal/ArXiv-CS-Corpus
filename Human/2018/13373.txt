Budget-Aware Activity Detection with A Recurrent Policy Network

In this paper, we address the challenging problem of efficient temporal activity detection in untrimmed long videos. While most recent work has focused and advanced the detection accuracy, the inference time can take seconds to minutes in processing each single video, which is too slow to be useful in real-world settings. This motivates the proposed budget-aware framework, which learns to perform activity detection by intelligently selecting a small subset of frames according to a specified time budget. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, and adopt a recurrent network to model the frame selection policy. We derive a recurrent policy gradient based approach to approximate the gradient of the non-decomposable and non-differentiable objective defined in our problem. In the extensive experiments, we achieve competitive detection accuracy, and more importantly, our approach is able to substantially reduce computation time and detect multiple activities with only 0.35s for each untrimmed long video.
