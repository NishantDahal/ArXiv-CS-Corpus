Management of Network Slicing in 5G Radio Access Networks: Functional Framework and Information Models

Network slicing is one of the key features for 5G networks to be able to accommodate the anticipated diversity of applications and business actors in a resource-efficient manner. While significant progress has already been achieved at 3GPP specifications level with regard to the system architectural and functional aspects for the realisation of network slicing in 5G networks, management solutions for the exploitation of this feature in the Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) are still at a very incipient stage. In this context, this paper presents a framework for the management of network slicing in a NG-RAN infrastructure, identifying the functions, interfaces and information models that are necessary to enable the automation of the RAN slicing provisioning and management processes. Accordingly, a plausible information model intended to describe the manageable characteristics and behaviour of a RAN slice is developed and its applicability discussed in an illustrative neutral host provider scenario.
