Improving brain computer interface performance by data augmentation with conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

One of the big restrictions in brain computer interface field is the very limited training samples, it is difficult to build a reliable and usable system with such limited data. Inspired by generative adversarial networks, we propose a conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial (cDCGAN) Networks method to generate more artificial EEG signal automatically for data augmentation to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks in brain computer interface field and overcome the small training dataset problems. We evaluate the proposed cDCGAN method on BCI competition dataset of motor imagery. The results show that the generated artificial EEG data from Gaussian noise can learn the features from raw EEG data and has no less than the classification accuracy of raw EEG data in the testing dataset. Also by using generated artificial data can effectively improve classification accuracy at the same model with limited training data.
