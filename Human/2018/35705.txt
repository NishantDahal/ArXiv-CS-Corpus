Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: New uses for old QA resources

We investigate applying repurposed generic QA data and models to a recently proposed relation extraction task. We find that training on SQuAD produces better zero-shot performance and more robust generalisation compared to the task specific training set. We also show that standard QA architectures (e.g. FastQA or BiDAF) can be applied to the slot filling queries without the need for model modification.
