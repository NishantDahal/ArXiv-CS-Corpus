X-FDR: A Cross-Layer Routing Protocol for Multi-hop Full-Duplex Wireless Networks

The recent developments in self-interference (SI) cancellation techniques have led to the practical realization of full-duplex (FD) radios that can perform simultaneous transmission and reception. FD technology is attractive for various legacy communications standards. In this paper, after discussing the opportunities of FD technology at the network layer, we present a cross-layer aided routing protocol, termed as X-FDR, for multi-hop FD wireless networks. X-FDR exploits a Physical (PHY) layer model capturing imperfection of SI cancellation. At the medium access control (MAC) layer, X-FDR adopts an optimized MAC protocol which implements a power control mechanism without creating the hidden terminal problem. X-FDR exploits the unique characteristics of FD technology at the network layer to construct energy-efficient and low end-to-end latency routes in the network. Performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of X-FDR in achieving the gains of FD at higher layers of the protocol stack.
