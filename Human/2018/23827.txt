Revenue Maximization in an Optical Router Node Using Multiple Wavelengths

In this paper, an optical router node with multiple wavelengths is considered. We introduce revenue for successful transmission and study the ensuing revenue maximization problem. We present an efficient and accurate heuristic procedure for solving the NP-hard revenue maximization problem and investigate the advantage offered by having multiple wavelengths.
