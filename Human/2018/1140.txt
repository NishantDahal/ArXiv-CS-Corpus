An enhanced Multipath Strategy in Mobile Ad hoc Routing Protocols

The various routing protocols in Mobile Ad hoc Networks follow different strategies to send the information from one node to another. The nodes in the network are non static and they move randomly and are prone to link failure which makes always to find new routes to the destination. This research mainly focused on the study of the characteristics of multipath routing protocols in MANETS. Two of the multipath routing protocols were investigated and a comparative study along with simulation using NS2 was done between DSR and AODV to propose an enhanced approach to reach the destination maintaining the QoS. A possible optimization to the DSR and AODV routing protocols was proposed to make no node to be overburdened by distributing the load after finding the alternate multipath routes which were discovered in the Route discovery process. The simulation shows that the differences in the protocol highlighted major differences with the protocol performance. These differences have been analyzed with various network size, mobility, and network load. A new search table named Search of Next Node Enquiry Table (SONNET) was proposed to find the best neighbor node. Using SONNET the node selects the neighbor which can be reached in less number of hops and with less time delay and maintaining the QoS.
