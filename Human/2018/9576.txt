Graph-Based Deep Modeling and Real Time Forecasting of Sparse Spatio-Temporal Data

We present a generic framework for spatio-temporal (ST) data modeling, analysis, and forecasting, with a special focus on data that is sparse in both space and time. Our multi-scaled framework is a seamless coupling of two major components: a self-exciting point process that models the macroscale statistical behaviors of the ST data and a graph structured recurrent neural network (GSRNN) to discover the microscale patterns of the ST data on the inferred graph. This novel deep neural network (DNN) incorporates the real time interactions of the graph nodes to enable more accurate real time forecasting. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on both crime and traffic forecasting.
