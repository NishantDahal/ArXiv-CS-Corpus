A Mixed Classification-Regression Framework for 3D Pose Estimation from 2D Images

3D pose estimation from a single 2D image is an important and challenging task in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving, robot manipulation and augmented reality. Since 3D pose is a continuous quantity, a natural formulation for this task is to solve a pose regression problem. However, since pose regression methods return a single estimate of the pose, they have difficulties handling multimodal pose distributions (e.g. in the case of symmetric objects). An alternative formulation, which can capture multimodal pose distributions, is to discretize the pose space into bins and solve a pose classification problem. However, pose classification methods can give large pose estimation errors depending on the coarseness of the discretization. In this paper, we propose a mixed classification-regression framework that uses a classification network to produce a discrete multimodal pose estimate and a regression network to produce a continuous refinement of the discrete estimate. The proposed framework can accommodate different architectures and loss functions, leading to multiple classification-regression models, some of which achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Pascal3D+ dataset.
