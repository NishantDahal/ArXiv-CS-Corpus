A Generation Method of Filtering Rules of Twitter Via Smartphone Based Participatory Sensing System for Tourist by Interactive GHSOM and C4.5

Mobile Phone based Participatory Sensing (MPPS) systems involve a community of users sending personal information and participating in autonomous sensing through their mobile phones. Sensed data can also be obtained from external sensing devices that can communicate wirelessly to the phone. We have developed the tourist subjective data collection system with Android smartphone. The tourist can tweet the information of sightseeing spots by using the application. The application can determine the filtering rules to provide the important information of sightseeing spot. The rules are automatically generated by Interactive Growing Hierarchical SOM and C4.5.
