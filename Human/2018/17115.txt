Security Solutions for Local Wireless Networks in Control Applications based on Physical Layer Security

The Design of new wireless communication systems for industrial applications, e.g. control applications, is currently a hot research topic, as they deal as a key enabler for more flexible solutions at a lower cost compared to systems based on wired communication. However, one of their main drawbacks is, that they provide a huge potential for miscellaneous cyber attacks due to the open nature of the wireless channel in combination with the huge economic potential they are able to provide. Therefore, security measures need to be taken into account for the design of such systems. Within this work, an approach for the security architecture of local wireless systems with respect to the needs of control applications is presented and discussed. Further, new security solutions based on Physical Layer Security are introduced in order to overcome the drawbacks of state of the art security technologies within that scope.
