Restoration of Pansharpened Images by Conditional Filtering in the PCA Domain

Pansharpening techniques aim at fusing low-resolution multispectral (MS) images and high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to produce high-resolution MS images. Despite significant progress in the field, spectral and spatial distortions might still compromise the quality of the results. We introduce a restoration strategy to mitigate artifacts of fused products. After applying the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transform to a pansharpened image, the chromatic components are filtered conditionally to the geometry of PAN. The structural component is then replaced by the locally histogram-matched PAN for spatial enhancement. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed restoration chain.
