A Game Theory Interpretation for Multiple Access in Cognitive Radio Networks with Random Number of Secondary Users

In this paper a new multiple access algorithm for cognitive radio networks based on game theory is presented. We address the problem of a multiple access system where the number of users and their types are unknown. In order to do this, the framework is modelled as a non-cooperative Poisson game in which all the players are unaware of the total number of devices participating (population uncertainty). We propose a scheme where failed attempts to transmit (collisions) are penalized. In terms of this, we calculate the optimum penalization in mixed strategies. The proposed scheme conveys to a Nash equilibrium where a maximum in the possible throughput is achieved.
