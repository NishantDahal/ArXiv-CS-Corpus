Establishing digital molecular communications in blood vessels

In this paper we propose a solution for transmitting digital information within the cardiocirculatory system. In particular, we make use of a channel delivering burst of molecules, emitted by mobile transmitters, which diffuse in the blood towards fixed receivers, that are attached to the vessel walls. This communication scheme has been inspired by the real signaling between platelets and endothelial cells, the behavior of which has been investigated experimentally. We thus believe that our proposal can be successfully deployed in living bodies. On the basis of the results achieved through simulations on the communication system capabilities, we propose a simple but effective receiver scheme, and we outline the future research directions.
