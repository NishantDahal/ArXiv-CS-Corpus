Transition Semantics - The Dynamics of Dependence Logic

We examine the relationship between Dependence Logic and game logics. A variant of Dynamic Game Logic, called Transition Logic, is developed, and we show that its relationship with Dependence Logic is comparable to the one between First-Order Logic and Dynamic Game Logic discussed by van Benthem. This suggests a new perspective on the interpretation of Dependence Logic formulas, in terms of assertions about reachability in games of im- perfect information against Nature. We then capitalize on this intuition by developing expressively equivalent variants of Dependence Logic in which this interpretation is taken to the foreground.
