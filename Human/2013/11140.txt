Searching and Establishment of S-P-O Relationships for Linked RDF Graphs : An Adaptive Approach

In the coming era of semantic web linked data analysis is a very burning issue for efficient searching and retrieval of information. One way of establishing this link is to implement subject predicate object relationship through Set Theory approach which is already done in our previous work. For analyzing inter relationship between two RDF Graphs, RDF- Schema (RDFS) should also be taken care of. In the present paper, an adaptive combination rule based framework has been proposed for establishment of S P O relationship and RDF Graph searching is reported. Hence the identification of criteria for inter-relationship of RDF Graphs opens up new road in semantic search.
