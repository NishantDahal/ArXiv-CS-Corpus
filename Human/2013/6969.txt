An Integrated System for 3D Gaze Recovery and Semantic Analysis of Human Attention

This work describes a computer vision system that enables pervasive mapping and monitoring of human attention. The key contribution is that our methodology enables full 3D recovery of the gaze pointer, human view frustum and associated human centered measurements directly into an automatically computed 3D model in real-time. We apply RGB-D SLAM and descriptor matching methodologies for the 3D modeling, localization and fully automated annotation of ROIs (regions of interest) within the acquired 3D model. This innovative methodology will open new avenues for attention studies in real world environments, bringing new potential into automated processing for human factors technologies.
