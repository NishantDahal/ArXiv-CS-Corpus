A Cooperation Model Towards the Federated Internet of Applications

As Internet is changing from network of data into network of functionalities, a federated Internet of applications, that every application can cooperate with each other smoothly, is a natural trending topic. However, existing integration techniques did not pay enough attention to multiple control domains for participants, i.e. application providers and end-users. In this study, we advocate a global cooperation model for all the participants counts. In particular, we propose a hybrid model to manage the cooperation among applications to achieve more optimized allocation of efforts, which means users perform lighter actions and application providers concerning less uncontrollable information. In addition, we implement the required system and show a case study which demonstrates the effectiveness of this model.
