Marrying Many-core Accelerators and InfiniBand for a New Commodity Processor

During the last 15 years, the supercomputing industry has been using mass-produced, off-the-shelf components to build cluster computers. Such components are not perfect for HPC purposes, but are cheap due to effect of scale in their production. The coming exa-scale era changes the landscape: exa-scale computers will contain components in quantities large enough to justify their custom development and production.
  We propose a new heterogeneous processor, equipped with a network controller and designed specifically for HPC. We then show how it can be used for enterprise computing market, guaranteeing its widespread adoption and therefore low production costs.
