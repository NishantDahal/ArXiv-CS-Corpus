Reputation Algebra for Cloud-based Anonymous Data Storage Systems

Given a cloud-based anonymous data storage system, there are two ways for managing the nodes involved in file transfers. One of them is using reputations and the other uses a micropayment system. In reputation-based approach, each node has a reputation associated with it, which is used as a currency or feedback collection for file exchange operations. There have been several attempts over the years to develop a strong and efficient reputation system that provides credibility, fairness, and accountability. One such attempt was the Free Haven Project that provides a strong foundation for cloud-based anonymous data storage systems. The work proposed in this paper is motivated by the Free Haven Project aimed at developing a reputation system that facilitates dynamic operations such as adding servers, removing servers and changing role of authorities. The proposed system also provides algorithm for scoring and maintaining reputations of the servers in order to achieve credibility, accountability and fairness.
