Branching MERA codes: a natural extension of polar codes

We introduce a new class of circuits for constructing efficiently decodable error-correction codes, based on a recently discovered contractible tensor network. We perform an in-depth study of a particular example that can be thought of as an extension to Arikan's polar code. Notably, our numerical simulation show that this code polarizes the logical channels more strongly while retaining the log-linear decoding complexity using the successive cancellation decoder. These codes also display improved error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity. Efficient decoding is realized using powerful graphical calculus tools developed in the field of quantum many-body physics. In a companion paper, we generalize our construction to the quantum setting and describe more in-depth the relation between classical and quantum error correction and the graphical calculus of tensor networks.
