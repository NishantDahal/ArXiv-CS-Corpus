A reduction of 3-SAT problem to Buchberger algorithm

There is a number of known NP class problems, and majority of them have been shown to be equivalent to others. In particular now it is clear that construction of a Gr√∂bner basis (or Buchberger algorithm) must be one of equivalent problems, but there was no example. In the following paper the reduction is constructed.
