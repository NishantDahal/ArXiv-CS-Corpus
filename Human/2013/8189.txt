A Novel Method for Image Integrity Authentication Based on Fixed Point Theory

Based on fixed point theory, this paper proposes a simple but efficient method for image integrity authentication, which is different from Digital Signature and Fragile Watermarking. By this method, any given image can be transformed into a fixed point of a well-chosen function, which can be constructed with periodic functions. The authentication can be realized due to the fragility of the fixed points. The experiments show that 'Fixed Point Image' performs well in security, transparence, fragility and tampering localization.
