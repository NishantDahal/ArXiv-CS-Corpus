Clustering of Complex Networks and Community Detection Using Group Search Optimization

Group Search Optimizer(GSO) is one of the best algorithms, is very new in the field of Evolutionary Computing. It is very robust and efficient algorithm, which is inspired by animal searching behaviour. The paper describes an application of GSO to clustering of networks. We have tested GSO against five standard benchmark datasets, GSO algorithm is proved very competitive in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.
