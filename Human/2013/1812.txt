Adaptive Space-Time Beamforming in Radar Systems

The goal of this chapter is to review the recent work and advances in the area of space-time beamforming algorithms and their application to radar systems. These systems include phased-array \cite{melvin} and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar systems \cite{haimo_08}, mono-static and bi-static radar systems and other configurations \cite{melvin}. Furthermore, this chapter also describes in detail some of the most successful space-time beamforming algorithms that exploit low-rank and sparsity properties as well as the use of prior-knowledge to improve the performance of STAP algorithms in radar systems.
