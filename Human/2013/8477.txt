An Adaptable Fast Matrix Multiplication Algorithm, Going Beyond the Myth of Decimal War

In this paper we present an adaptable fast matrix multiplication (AFMM) algorithm, for two nxn dense matrices which computes the product matrix with average complexity Tavg(n) = d1d2n3 with the acknowledgement that the average count is obtained for addition as the basic operation rather than multiplication which is probably the unquestionable choice for basic operation in existing matrix multiplication algorithms.
