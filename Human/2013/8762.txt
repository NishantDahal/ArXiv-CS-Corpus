Bounded Choice Queries for Logic Programming

Adding versatile interactions to goals and queries in logic programming is an essential task. Unfortunately, existing logic languages can take input from the user only via the $read$ construct.
  We propose to add a new interactive goal to allow for more controlled and more guided participation from the user. We illustrate our idea via \muprolog, an extension of Prolog with bounded choice goals.
