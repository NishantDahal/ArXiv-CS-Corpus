Lay-up Optimization of Laminated Composites: Mixed Approach with Exact Feasibility Bounds on Lamination Parameters

We suggest modified bi-level approach for finding the best stacking sequence of laminated composite structures subject to mechanical, blending and manufacturing constraints. We propose to use both the number of plies laid up at predefined angles and lamination parameters as independent variables at outer (global) stage of bi-level scheme aimed to satisfy buckling, strain and percentage constraints. Our formulation allows precise definition of the feasible region of lamination parameters and greatly facilitates the solution of inner level problem of finding the optimal stacking sequence.
