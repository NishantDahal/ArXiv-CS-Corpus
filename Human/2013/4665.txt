A tournament of order 24 with two disjoint TEQ-retentive sets

Brandt et al. (2013) have recently disproved a conjecture by Schwartz (1990) by non-constructively showing the existence of a counterexample with about 10^136 alternatives. We provide a concrete counterexample for Schwartz's conjecture with only 24 alternatives.
