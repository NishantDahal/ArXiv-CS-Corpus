Proceedings 5th Workshop on Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software

PLACES 2013 (full title: Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency- and Communication-cEntric Software) was the sixth edition of the PLACES workshop series. After the first PLACES, which was affiliated to DisCoTec in 2008, the workshop has been part of ETAPS every year since 2009 and is now an established part of the ETAPS satellite events. This year, PLACES was the best attended workshop at ETAPS 2013.
  The workshop series was started in order to promote the application of novel programming language ideas to the increasingly important problem of developing software for systems in which concurrency and communication are intrinsic aspects. This includes software for multi- and many-core systems, accelerators and large-scale distributed and/or service-oriented systems. The scope of PLACES includes new programming language features, whole new programming language designs, new type systems, new semantic approaches, new program analysis techniques, and new implementation mechanisms.
