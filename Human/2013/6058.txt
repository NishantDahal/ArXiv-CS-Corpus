A Comparative study of Analog and digital Controller On DC/DC Buck-Boost Converter Four Switch for Mobile Device Applications

This paper presents comparative performance between Analog and digital controller on DC/DC buck-boost converter four switch. The design of power electronic converter circuit with the use of closed loop scheme needs modeling and then simulating the converter using the modeled equations. This can easily be done with the help of state equations and MATLAB/SIMULINK as a tool for simulation of those state equations. DC/DC Buckboost converter in this study is operated in buck (step-down) and boost (step-up) modes.
