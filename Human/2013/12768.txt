Code Coverage Based Test Case Selection and Prioritization

Regression Testing is exclusively executed to guarantee the desirable functionality of existing software after pursuing quite a few amendments or variations in it. Perhaps, it testifies the quality of the modified software by concealing the regressions or software bugs in both functional and non-functional applications of the system. In fact, the maintenance of test suite is enormous as it necessitates a big investment of time and money on test cases on a large scale. So, minimizing the test suite becomes the indispensable requisite to lessen the budget on regression testing. Precisely, this research paper aspires to present an innovative approach for the effective selection and prioritization of test cases which in return may procure a maximum code average.
