Deterministic Sequences for Compressive MIMO Channel Estimation

This paper considers the problem of pilot design for compressive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. In particular, we are interested in estimating the channels for multiple transmitters simultaneously when the pilot sequences are shorter than the combined channels. Existing works on this topic demonstrated that tools from compressed sensing theory can yield accurate multichannel estimation provided that each pilot sequence is randomly generated. Here, we propose constructing the pilot sequence for each transmitter from a small set of deterministic sequences. We derive a theoretical lower bound on the length of the pilot sequences that guarantees the multichannel estimation with high probability. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.
