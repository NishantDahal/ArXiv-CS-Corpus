IRM4MLS: the influence reaction model for multi-level simulation

In this paper, a meta-model called IRM4MLS, that aims to be a generic ground to specify and execute multi-level agent-based models is presented. It relies on the influence/reaction principle and more specifically on IRM4S. Simulation models for IRM4MLS are defined. The capabilities and possible extensions of the meta-model are discussed.
