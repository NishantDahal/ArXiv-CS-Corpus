On the Approximation of Submodular Functions

Submodular functions are a fundamental object of study in combinatorial optimization, economics, machine learning, etc. and exhibit a rich combinatorial structure. Many subclasses of submodular functions have also been well studied and these subclasses widely vary in their complexity. Our motivation is to understand the relative complexity of these classes of functions. Towards this, we consider the question of how well can one class of submodular functions be approximated by another (simpler) class of submodular functions. Such approximations naturally allow algorithms designed for the simpler class to be applied to the bigger class of functions. We prove both upper and lower bounds on such approximations.
  Our main results are:
  1. General submodular functions can be approximated by cut functions of directed graphs to a factor of $n^2/4$, which is tight.
  2. General symmetric submodular functions$^{1}$ can be approximated by cut functions of undirected graphs to a factor of $n-1$, which is tight up to a constant.
  3. Budgeted additive functions can be approximated by coverage functions to a factor of $e/(e-1)$, which is tight.
  Here $n$ is the size of the ground set on which the submodular function is defined.
  We also observe that prior works imply that monotone submodular functions can be approximated by coverage functions with a factor between $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and $Î©(n^{1/3} /\log^2 n) $.
