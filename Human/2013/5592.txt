A 2.0 Gb/s Throughput Decoder for QC-LDPC Convolutional Codes

This paper propose a decoder architecture for low-density parity-check convolutional code (LDPCCC). Specifically, the LDPCCC is derived from a quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC block code. By making use of the quasi-cyclic structure, the proposed LDPCCC decoder adopts a dynamic message storage in the memory and uses a simple address controller. The decoder efficiently combines the memories in the pipelining processors into a large memory block so as to take advantage of the data-width of the embedded memory in a modern field-programmable gate array (FPGA). A rate-5/6 QC-LDPCCC has been implemented on an Altera Stratix FPGA. It achieves up to 2.0 Gb/s throughput with a clock frequency of 100 MHz. Moreover, the decoder displays an excellent error performance of lower than $10^{-13}$ at a bit-energy-to-noise-power-spectral-density ratio ($E_b/N_0$) of 3.55 dB.
