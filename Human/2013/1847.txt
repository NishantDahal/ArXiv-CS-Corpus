Improving success probability and embedding efficiency in code based steganography

For stegoschemes arising from error correcting codes, embedding depends on a decoding map for the corresponding code. As decoding maps are usually not complete, embedding can fail. We propose a method to ensure or increase the probability of embedding success for these stegoschemes. This method is based on puncturing codes. We show how the use of punctured codes may also increase the embedding efficiency of the obtained stegoschemes.
