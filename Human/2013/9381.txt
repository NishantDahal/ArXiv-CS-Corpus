SEEDS: Superpixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling

Superpixel algorithms aim to over-segment the image by grouping pixels that belong to the same object. Many state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms rely on minimizing objective functions to enforce color ho- mogeneity. The optimization is accomplished by sophis- ticated methods that progressively build the superpix- els, typically by adding cuts or growing superpixels. As a result, they are computationally too expensive for real-time applications. We introduce a new approach based on a simple hill-climbing optimization. Starting from an initial superpixel partitioning, it continuously refines the superpixels by modifying the boundaries. We define a robust and fast to evaluate energy function, based on enforcing color similarity between the bound- aries and the superpixel color histogram. In a series of experiments, we show that we achieve an excellent com- promise between accuracy and efficiency. We are able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of- the-art, but in real-time on a single Intel i7 CPU at 2.8GHz.
