Wavelet and Fast Fourier Transform based analysis of Solar Image

Both of Wavelet and Fast Fourier Transform are strong signal processing tools in the field of Data Analysis. In this paper fast fourier transform (FFT) and Wavelet Transform are employed to observe some important features of Solar image (December, 2004). We have tried to find out the periodicity and coherence of different sections of the solar image. We plotted the distribution of energy in solar surface by analyzing the solar image with scalograms and 3D-coefficient plots.
