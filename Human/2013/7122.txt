Composing a Publication List for Individual Researcher Assessment by Merging Information from Different Sources

Citation and publication profiles are gaining importance for the evaluation of top researchers when it comes to the appropriation of funding for excellence programs or career promotion judgments. Indicators like the Normalized Mean Citation Rate, the hindex or other distinguishing measures are increasingly used to picture the characteristics of individual scholars. Using bibliometric techniques for individual assessment is known to be particularly delicate, as the chance of errors being averaged away becomes smaller whereas a minor incompleteness can have a significant influence on the evaluation outcome. The quality of the data becomes as such crucial to the legitimacy of the methods used.
