Effort-Oriented Classification Matrix of Web Service Composition

Within the service-oriented computing domain, Web service composition is an effective realization to satisfy the rapidly changing requirements of business. Therefore, the research into Web service composition has unfolded broadly. Since examining all of the related work in this area becomes a mission next to impossible, the classification of composition approaches can be used to facilitate multiple research tasks. However, the current attempts to classify Web service composition do not have clear objectives. Furthermore, the contexts and technologies of composition approaches are confused in the existing classifications. This paper proposes an effort-oriented classification matrix for Web service composition, which distinguishes between the context and technology dimension. The context dimension is aimed at analyzing the environment influence on the effort of Web service composition, while the technology dimension focuses on the technique influence on the effort. Consequently, besides the traditional classification benefits, this matrix can be used to build the basis of cost estimation for Web service composition in future research.
