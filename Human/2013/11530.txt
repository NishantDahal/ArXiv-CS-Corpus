Infrastructure Logicielle d un Environnement Hospitalier Intelligent

The impact of new technologies in the field of healthcare has been proven to be satisfactory in improving the quality of care and services for patients. The hospital environment is undoubtedly one of the environments where human or hardware errors can cause harmful damage. It is therefore very useful for the sector to be at the forefront of technology and use the strongest and most efficient means since it is supposed to be an environment of reliability, trust and is legally responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of all patient information. In this project we have proposed and developed a smart hospital enviornement that allows both, detecting patien fall and send alerts to the suitable parties, and securing patien stored data through RFID technology.
