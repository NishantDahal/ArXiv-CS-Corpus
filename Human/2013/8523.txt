Citation Counts and Evaluation of Researchers in the Internet Age

Bibliometric measures derived from citation counts are increasingly being used as a research evaluation tool.

We focus on evaluation of researchers, but several of our arguments may be applied also to evaluation of research institutions as well as of journals and conferences.
