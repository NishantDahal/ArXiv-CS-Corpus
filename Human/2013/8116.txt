Adaptive detection and severity level characterization algorithm for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) via oximetry signal analysis

In this paper, an abstract definition and formal specification is presented for the task of adaptive-threshold OSAHS events detection and severity characterization. Specifically, a low-level pseudocode is designed for the algorithm of raw oximetry signal pre-processing, calculation of the 'drop' and 'rise' frames in the related time series, detection of valid apnea/hypopnea events via SpO2 saturation level tracking, as well as calculation of corresponding event rates for OSAHS severity characterization. The designed algorithm can be used as the first module in a machine learning application where these data can be used as inputs or encoded into higher-level statistics (features) for pattern classifiers, in the context of computer-aided or fully automated diagnosis of OSAHS and related pathologies.
