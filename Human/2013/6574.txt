Information sharing and sorting in a community

We present the results of detailed numerical study of a model for the sharing and sorting of informations in a community consisting of a large number of agents. The information gathering takes place in a sequence of mutual bipartite interactions where randomly selected pairs of agents communicate with each other to enhance their knowledge and sort out the common information. Though our model is less restricted compared to the well established naming game, yet the numerical results strongly indicate that the whole set of exponents characterizing this model are different from those of the naming game and they assume non-trivial values. Finally it appears that in analogy to the emergence of clusters in the phenomenon of percolation, one can define clusters of agents here having the same information. We have studied in detail the growth of the largest cluster in this article and performed its finite-size scaling analysis.
