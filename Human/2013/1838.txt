Gaussian State Amplification with Noisy State Observations

The problem of simultaneous message transmission and state amplification in a Gaussian channel with additive Gaussian state is studied when the sender has imperfect noncausal knowledge of the state sequence. Inner and outer bounds to the rate--state-distortion region are provided. The coding scheme underlying the inner bound combines analog signaling and Gelfand-Pinsker coding, where the latter deviates from the operating point of Costa's dirty paper coding.
