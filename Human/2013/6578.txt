Analog Turbo Codes: Turning Chaos to Reliability

Analog error correction codes, by relaxing the source space and the codeword space from discrete fields to continuous fields, present a generalization of digital codes. While linear codes are sufficient for digital codes, they are not for analog codes, and hence nonlinear mappings must be employed to fully harness the power of analog codes. This paper demonstrates new ways of building effective (nonlinear) analog codes from a special class of nonlinear, fast-diverging functions known as the chaotic functions. It is shown that the "butterfly effect" of the chaotic functions matches elegantly with the distance expansion condition required for error correction, and that the useful idea in digital turbo codes can be exploited to construct efficient turbo-like chaotic analog codes. Simulations show that the new analog codes can perform on par with, or better than, their digital counter-parts when transmitting analog sources.
