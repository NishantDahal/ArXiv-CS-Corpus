On Classical and Quantum MDS-Convolutional BCH Codes

Several new families of multi-memory classical convolutional Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes as well as families of unit-memory quantum convolutional codes are constructed in this paper. Our unit-memory classical and quantum convolutional codes are optimal in the sense that they attain the classical (quantum) generalized Singleton bound. The constructions presented in this paper are performed algebraically and not by computational search.
