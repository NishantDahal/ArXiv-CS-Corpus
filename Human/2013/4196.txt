An analytic study of a distributed EDCA-based QoS mapping for layered video delivery in WLAN

One of the key challenges in multimedia networks is video delivery over wireless channels. MRC (Multi-Resolution Coding) Layered video, divides video into a base layer and multiple enhancement layers. In this paper, we aim to improve video quality, impacted by high channel contention, through mapping individual video layers to EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access) access categories in order to maximize the average number of reconstructed video layers. We propose an adaptive cross layer video layers mapping technique that optimally enhances the QoS of wireless video transmission over IEEE 802.11e EDCA priority queues. The optimization is based on a dynamic program that takes into account the EDCA parameters and the layered dependency nature of layered video delivery. Our proposed technique makes use of a channel delay estimation model and an estimation of average video useful layers delivered. The optimal mapping strategies are selected by an optimization module based on the information from the analytical model. The accuracy of our optimized mapping technique performance is verified through extensive simulations. The obtained results illustrate significant trade-off between complexity and delivered video quality for canonical mapping schemes.
