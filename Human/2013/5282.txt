A fast method for implementation of the property lists in programming languages

One of the major challenges in programming languages is to support different data structures and their variations in both static and dynamic aspects. One of the these data structures is the property list which applications use it as a convenient way to store, organize, and access standard types of data. In this paper, the standards methods for implementation of the Property Lists, including the Static Array, Link List, Hash and Tree are reviewed. Then an efficient method to implement the property list is presented. The experimental results shows that our method is fast compared with the existing methods.
