Improving Data Security in Infrastructure Networks Based on Unipath Routing

An infrastructure network is a self-organizing network which uses Access Point (AP) of wireless links that connecting one node with another. These nodes can communicate without using ad hoc, instead these nodes form an arbitrary topology (BSS/ESS) in which these nodes play the role of routers. Though the efficiency of Infrastructure networks is high, they are highly vulnerable to security attacks. Detecting/Preventing these attacks over the network is highly challenging task. Many solutions are proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion avoidance in infrastructure networks. Providing security in such dynamically changing networks is a hard task. Characteristic of infrastructure network should also be taken into consideration in order to design efficient solutions. In this study, we focus on efficiently increasing the flow transmission confidentiality in infrastructure networks based on multi-path routing. In order to increase confidentiality of transmitted data, we take advantage of the existence of multiple paths between nodes in an infrastructure network with the help of Access Point. In this approach the original data is split into package and are forwarded through access point. The encrypted packets are then forwarded in different disjoint paths that exist between sender and receiver. Even if an attacker succeeds to obtain one or more transmitted packets, the probability of reconstructing the original message is very low.
