A discrete analysis of metal-v belt drive

The metal-V belt drive includes a large number of parts which interact between them to transmit power from the input to the output pulleys. A compression belt composed of a great number of struts is maintained by a tension flat belt. Power is them shared into the two belts that moves generally in opposite directions. Due to the particular geometry of the elements and to the great number of parts, a numerical approach achieves the global equilibrium of the mechanism from the elementary part equilibrium. Sliding arc on each pulley can be thus defined both for the compression and tension belts. Finally, power sharing can be calculated as differential motion between the belts, is defined. The first part of the paper will present the different steps of the quasi-static mechanical analysis and their numerical implementations. Load distributions, speed profiles and sliding angle values will be discussed. The second part of the paper will deal to a systematic use of the computer software. Speed ratio, transmitted torque, strut geometry and friction coefficients effect will be analysed with the output parameter variations. Finally, the effect pulley deformable flanges will be discussed.
