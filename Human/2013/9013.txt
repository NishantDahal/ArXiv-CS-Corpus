A Cache Reconfiguration Approach for Saving Leakage and Refresh Energy in Embedded DRAM Caches

In recent years, the size and leakage energy consumption of large last level caches (LLCs) has increased. To address this, embedded DRAM (eDRAM) caches have been considered which have lower leakage energy consumption; however eDRAM caches consume a significant amount of energy in the form of refresh energy. In this paper, we present a technique for saving both leakage and refresh energy in eDRAM caches. We use dynamic cache reconfiguration approach to intelligently turn-off part of the cache to save leakage energy and refresh only valid data of the active (i.e. not turned-off) cache to save refresh energy. We evaluate our technique using an x86-64 simulator and SPEC2006 benchmarks and compare it with a recently proposed technique for saving refresh energy, named Refrint. The experiments have shown that our technique provides better performance and energy efficiency than Refrint. Using our technique, for a 2MB LLC and 40 micro-seconds eDRAM refresh period, the average saving in energy over eDRAM baseline (which periodically refreshes all cache lines) is 22.8%.
