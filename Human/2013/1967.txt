Semantic integration process of business components to support information system designers

The present work is inscribed within the intersection of two scientific thematic: the engineering by reuse of components and ontologies alignment. The integration of Business Components (BC) is a research problem that has been identified in the field of engineering by reuse. Our proposal aims to provide assistance to designers of information systems in the integration phase. It is a process guided by domain ontology to provide semantic integration of BC. This process allows the detection and resolution of semantic conflicts naming type encountered in the process of integration of BC.
