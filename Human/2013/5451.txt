A Method for Visuo-Spatial Classification of Freehand Shapes Freely Sketched

We present the principle and the main steps of a new method for the visuo-spatial analysis of geometrical sketches recorded online. Visuo-spatial analysis is a necessary step for multi-level analysis. Multi-level analysis simultaneously allows classification, comparison or clustering of the constituent parts of a pattern according to their visuo-spatial properties, their procedural strategies, their structural or temporal parameters, or any combination of two or more of those parameters. The first results provided by this method concern the comparison of sketches to some perfect patterns of simple geometrical figures and the measure of dissimilarity between real sketches. The mean rates of good decision higher than 95% obtained are promising in both cases.
