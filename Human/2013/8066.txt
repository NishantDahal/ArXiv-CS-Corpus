Transforming planar graph drawings while maintaining height

There are numerous styles of planar graph drawings, notably straight-line drawings, poly-line drawings, orthogonal graph drawings and visibility representations. In this note, we show that many of these drawings can be transformed from one style to another without changing the height of the drawing. We then give some applications of these transformations.
