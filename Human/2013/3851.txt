Quantum Circuits for GCD Computation with $O(n \log n)$ Depth and O(n) Ancillae

GCD computations and variants of the Euclidean algorithm enjoy broad uses in both classical and quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose quantum circuits for GCD computation with $O(n \log n)$ depth with O(n) ancillae. Prior circuit construction needs $O(n^2)$ running time with O(n) ancillae. The proposed construction is based on the binary GCD algorithm and it benefits from log-depth circuits for 1-bit shift, comparison/subtraction, and managing ancillae. The worst-case gate count remains $O(n^2)$, as in traditional circuits.
