Explicit Lower Bounds via Geometric Complexity Theory

We prove the lower bound R(M_m) \geq 3/2 m^2 - 2 on the border rank of m x m matrix multiplication by exhibiting explicit representation theoretic (occurence) obstructions in the sense of the geometric complexity theory (GCT) program. While this bound is weaker than the one recently obtained by Landsberg and Ottaviani, these are the first significant lower bounds obtained within the GCT program. Behind the proof is the new combinatorial concept of obstruction designs, which encode highest weight vectors in Sym^d\otimes^3(C^n)^* and provide new insights into Kronecker coefficients.
