Assessment of OpenStreetMap Data - A Review

The meaning and purposes of web has been changing and evolving day by day. Web 2. 0 encouraged more contribution by the end users. This movement provided revolutionary methods of sharing and computing data by crowdsourcing such as OpenStreetmap, also called "the wikification of maps" by some researchers. When crowdsourcing collects huge data with help of general public with varying level of mapping experience, the focus of researcher should be on analysing the data rather than collecting it. Researchers have assessed the quality of OpenStreetMap data by comparing it with proprietary data or data of governmental map agencies. This study reviews the research work for assessment of Open- StreetMap Data and also discusses about the future directions.
