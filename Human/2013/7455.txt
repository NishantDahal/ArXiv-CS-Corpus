Report: A Model for Remote Parental Control System Using Smartphones

The mammoth growth in the information technology sector in terms of both quantity and pervasiveness has opened up a Pandora's Box of issues which are relevant in technical and social aspects. This paper attempts to address one of the critical issues among them which is concerned with the proper utilization of computer systems and mobile devices by children and teens. This paper proposes a model termed "RePort (Remote Parental Control System using Smartphones)" which is aimed towards monitoring the access behaviour of computers and smartphones in general and internet to be specific, by teens and children in a private environment. The model is built such that the access behaviour shall be monitored from a remote location with the help of smartphone devices. The access- characteristics are modelled using various parameters in four different layers of the model.The proposed model is validated with a prototype implementation in the Android platform for smartphones and as a background service for computer systems. Various experiments were conducted on the prototype implementation and results of the experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed model with respect to user's relevancy metric which is computed as 93.46%.
