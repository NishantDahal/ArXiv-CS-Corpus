Query Processing Performance and Searching Over Encrypted Data By Using An Efficient Algorithm

Data is the central asset of today's dynamically operating organization and their business. This data is usually stored in database. A major consideration is applied on the security of that data from the unauthorized access and intruders. Data encryption is a strong option for security of data in database and especially in those organizations where security risks are high. But there is a potential disadvantage of performance degradation. When we apply encryption on database then we should compromise between the security and efficient query processing. The work of this paper tries to fill this gap. It allows the users to query over the encrypted column directly without decrypting all the records. It's improves the performance of the system. The proposed algorithm works well in the case of range and fuzzy match queries.
