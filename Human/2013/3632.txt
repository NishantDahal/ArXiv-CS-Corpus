A Framework for Investigating the Performance of Chaotic-Map Truly Random Number Generators

In this paper, we approximate the hidden Markov model of chaotic-map truly random number generators (TRNGs) and describe its fundamental limits based on the approximate entropy-rate of the underlying bit-generation process. We demonstrate that entropy-rate plays a key role in the performance and robustness of chaotic-map TRNGs, which must be taken into account in the circuit design optimization. We further derive optimality conditions for post-processing units that extract truly random bits from a raw-RNG.
