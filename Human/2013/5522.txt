Characterizing and Evaluation :Temporal properties of real and synthetic datasets for DTN

Nodes movements play a significant role in disseminating messages in the sparse mobile ad-hoc network. In the network scenarios, where traditional end-to-end paths do not exist, mobility creates opportunities for nodes to connect and communicate when they are encountered. A series of encountering opportunities spread a message among many nodes and eventually deliver to the destination. Further improvements to the performance of message delivery can come from exploiting temporal mobility properties. It is modeled as time varying graph, where, moving nodes are considered as vertices and contact opportunity to other nodes as an edge. The paper discusses about characterization and design of the temporal algorithm. Then, evaluating temporal distance, diameter and centrality of real and synthetic mobility data sets.
