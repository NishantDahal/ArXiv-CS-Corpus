Polylogarithmic Gap between Meshes with Reconfigurable Row/Column Buses and Meshes with Statically Partitioned Buses

This paper studies the difference in computational power between the mesh-connected parallel computers equipped with dynamically reconfigurable bus systems and those with static ones. The mesh with separable buses (MSB) is the mesh-connected parallel computer with dynamically reconfigurable row/column buses. The broadcast buses of the MSB can be dynamically sectioned into smaller bus segments by program control. We show that the MSB of size $n \times n$ can work with$O(\log^2 n)$ step even if its dynamic reconfigurable function is disabled. Here, we assume the word-model broadcast buses, and use the relation between the word-model bus and the bit-model bus.
