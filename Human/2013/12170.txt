Learning Temporal Logical Properties Discriminating ECG models of Cardiac Arrhytmias

We present a novel approach to learn the formulae characterising the emergent behaviour of a dynamical system from system observations. At a high level, the approach starts by devising a statistical dynamical model of the system which optimally fits the observations. We then propose general optimisation strategies for selecting high support formulae (under the learnt model of the system) either within a discrete set of formulae of bounded complexity, or a parametric family of formulae. We illustrate and apply the methodology on an in-depth case study of characterising cardiac malfunction from electro-cardiogram data, where our approach enables us to quantitatively determine the diagnostic power of a formula in discriminating between different cardiac conditions.
