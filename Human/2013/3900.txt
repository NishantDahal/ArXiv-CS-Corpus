Proceedings International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and its Applications

This volume contains the proceedings of the Eleventh International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and its Applications, held on May 30 and 31, 2013, in Laramie, Wyoming, USA.
  ACL2 is an industrial-strength automated reasoning system, the latest in the Boyer-Moore family of theorem provers.  The ACL2 workshop is the major technical forum for users of the ACL2 theorem proving system to present research on the prover and its applications.  
  This year's workshop received 15 submissions covering a wide range of applications, libraries, prover enhancements, interfaces, and experience reports.  11 papers were selected by the program committee for presentation at the workshop.
