Effective factors in agile transformation process from change management perspective

After introducing agile approach in 2001, several agile methods were founded over the last decade. Agile values such as customer collaboration, embracing changes, iteration and frequent delivery, continuous integration, etc. motivate all software stakeholders to use these methods in their projects. The main issue is that for using these methods instead of traditional methods in software development, companies should change their approach from traditional to agile. This change is a fundamental and critical mutation. Several studies have been done for investigating of barriers, challenges and issues in agile movement process and also in how to use agile methods in companies. The main issue is altering attitude from traditional to agile approach. We believe that before managing agile transformation process, its related factors should be studied in deep. This study focuses on different dimensions of changing approach to agile from change management perspective. These factors are how to being agile, method selection and awareness of challenges and issues. These fundamental factors encompass many items for agile movement and adoption process. However these factors may change in different organization, but they should be studied in deep before any action plan for designing a change strategy. The main contribution of this paper is introducing and these factors and discuss on them deeply.
