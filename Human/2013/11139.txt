Theories of Hypergraph-Graph (HG(2)) Data Structure

Current paper introduces a Hypergraph Graph model of data storage which can be represented as a hybrid data structure based on Hypergraph and Graph. The pro-posed data structure is claimed to realize complex combinatorial structures. The formal definition of the data structure is presented along with the proper justification from real world scenarios. The paper reports some elementary concepts of Hypergraph and presents theoretical aspects of the proposed data structure including the concepts of Path, Cycle etc. The detailed analysis of weighted HG 2 is presented along with discussions on Cost involved with HG 2 paths.
