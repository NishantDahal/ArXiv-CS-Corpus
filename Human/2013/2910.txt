RES - a Relative Method for Evidential Reasoning

In this paper we describe a novel method for evidential reasoning [1].  It involves modelling the process of evidential reasoning in three steps, namely, evidence structure construction, evidence accumulation, and decision making.  The proposed method, called RES, is novel in that evidence strength is associated with an evidential support relationship (an argument) between a pair of statements and such strength is carried by comparison between arguments.  This is in contrast to the onventional approaches, where evidence strength is represented numerically and is associated with a statement.
