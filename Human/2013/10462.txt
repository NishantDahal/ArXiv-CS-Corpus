New Ways to Promote Sustainability and Social Well-Being in a Complex, Strongly Interdependent World: The FuturICT Approach

FuturICT is one of six proposals currently being considered for support within the European Commission's Flagship Initiative (see Box 1). The vision of the FuturICT project is to develop new science and new information and communication systems that will promote social self-organization, self-regulation, well-being, sustainability, and resilience. One of the main aims of the approach is to increase individual opportunities for social, economic and political participation, combined with the creation of collective awareness of the impact that human actions have on our world. This requires us to mine large datasets ("Big Data") and to develop new methods and tools: a Planetary Nervous System (PNS) to answer "What is (the state of the world)..." questions, a Living Earth Simulator (LES) to study "What ... if ..." scenarios, and a Global Participatory Platform (GPP) for social exploration and interaction.
