A Multi-Swarm Cellular PSO based on Clonal Selection Algorithm in Dynamic Environments

Many real-world problems are dynamic optimization problems. In this case, the optima in the environment change dynamically. Therefore, traditional optimization algorithms disable to track and find optima. In this paper, a new multi-swarm cellular particle swarm optimization based on clonal selection algorithm (CPSOC) is proposed for dynamic environments. In the proposed algorithm, the search space is partitioned into cells by a cellular automaton. Clustered particles in each cell, which make a sub-swarm, are evolved by the particle swarm optimization and clonal selection algorithm. Experimental results on Moving Peaks Benchmark demonstrate the superiority of the CPSOC its popular methods.
