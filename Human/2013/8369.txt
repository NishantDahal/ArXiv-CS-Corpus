Consistency Analysis of Sensor Data Distribution

In this paper we analyze the probability of consistency of sensor data distribution systems (SDDS), and determine suitable evaluation models. This problem is typically difficult, since a reliable model taking into account all parameters and processes which affect the system consistency is unavoidably very complex. The simplest candidate approach consists of modeling the state sojourn time, or holding time, as memoryless, and resorting to the well known solutions of Markovian processes. Nevertheless, it may happen that this approach does not fit with some working conditions. In particular, the correct modeling of the SDDS dynamics requires the introduction of a number of parameters, such as the packet transfer time or the packet loss probability, the value of which may determine the suitability of unsuitability of the Markovian model. Candidate alternative solutions include the Erlang phase-type approximation of nearly constant state holding time and a more refined model to account for overlapping events in semi-Markov processes.
