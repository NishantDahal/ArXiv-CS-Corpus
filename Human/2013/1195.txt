The effect of quantum fluctuations on the coloring of random graphs

We present a study of the coloring problem (antiferromagnetic Potts model) of random regular graphs, submitted to quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse field, using the quantum cavity method and quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. We determine the order of the quantum phase transition encountered at low temperature as a function of the transverse field and discuss the structure of the quantum spin glass phase. In particular, we conclude that the quantum adiabatic algorithm would fail to solve efficiently typical instances of these problems because of avoided level crossings within the quantum spin glass phase, caused by a competition between energetic and entropic effects.
