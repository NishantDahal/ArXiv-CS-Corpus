Evolution of Communities with Focus on Stability (extended abstract)

The detection of communities is an important tool used to analyze the social graph of mobile phone users. Within each community, customers are susceptible of attracting new ones, retaining old ones and/or accepting new products or services through the leverage of mutual influences. The communities of users are smaller units, easier to grasp, and allow for example the computation of role analysis -- based on the centrality of an actor within his community.
  The problem of finding communities in static graphs has been widely studied. However, from the point of view of a telecom analyst, to be really useful, the detected communities must evolve as the social graph of communications changes over time -- for example, in order to perform marketing actions on communities and track the results of those actions over time. Additionally the behaviors of communities of users over time can be used to predict future activity that interests the telecom operators, such as subscriber churn or handset adoption. Similary group evolution can provide insights for designing strategies, such as the early warning of group churn.
  Stability is a crucial issue: the analysis performed on a given community will be lost, if the analyst cannot keep track of this community in the following time steps. This is the particular use case that we tackle in this paper: tracking the evolution of communities in dynamic scenarios with focus on stability.
  We propose two modifications to a widely used static community detection algorithm. We then describe experiments to study the stability and quality of the resulting partitions on real-world social networks, represented by monthly call graphs for millions of subscribers.
