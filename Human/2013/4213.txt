A Web-based Adaptive and Intelligent Tutor by Expert Systems

Todays, Intelligent and web-based E-learning is one of regarded topics. So researchers are trying to optimize and expand its application in the field of education. The aim of this paper is developing of E-learning software which is customizable, dynamic, intelligent and adaptive with Pedagogy view for learners in intelligent schools. This system is an integration of adaptive web-based E-learning with expert systems as well. Learning process in this system is as follows. First intelligent tutor determines learning style and characteristics of learner by a questionnaire and then makes his model. After that the expert system simulator plans a pre-test and then calculates his score. If the learner gets the required score, the concept will be trained. Finally the learner will be evaluated by a post-test. The proposed system can improves the education efficiency highly as well as de-creases the costs and problems of an expert tutor. As a result, every time and eve-rywhere (ETEW) learning would be provided via web in this system. Moreover the learners can enjoy a cheap remote learning even at home in a virtual simulated physical class. So they can learn thousands courses very simple and fast.
