Improved Median Polish Kriging for Simulation Metamodeling

In simulation, Median Polish Kriging is a technique used to predict unobserved data points in two-dimensional space. The linear behavior of the traditional Median Polish Kriging in the estimation of the mean function in a high grid makes the interpolation of O(1) which has a low order in the prediction and that leads to a high prediction error. Therefore, an improvement in the estimation of the mean function has been introduced using Biharmonic spline interpolation and the new technique has been called Improved Median Polish Kriging (IMPK). The IMPK has been applied to the standard coal-ash data in two-dimension. The novel method gave much better results according to the cross validation results that were obtained when compared with the traditional Median Polish Kriging.
