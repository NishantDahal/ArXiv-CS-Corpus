Improved Multiuser Detection in Asynchronous Flat-Fading Non-Gaussian Channels

In this paper, a new M-estimator based multiuser detection in asynchronous flat-fading non-Gaussian CDMA channels is considered. A new closed-form expression is derived for the characteristic function of the multiple-access interference signals. Simulation results are provided to prove the effectiveness of the derived bit-error probabilities obtained with this expression in asynchronous flat-fading non-Gaussian CDMA channels.
