Greedy Approach for Low-Rank Matrix Recovery

We describe the Simple Greedy Matrix Completion Algorithm providing an efficient method for restoration of low-rank matrices from incomplete corrupted entries.
  We provide numerical evidences that, even in the simplest implementation, the greedy approach may increase the recovery capability of existing algorithms significantly.
