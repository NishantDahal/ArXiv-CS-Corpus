A Constructive Characterisation of Circuits in the Simple (2,2)-sparsity Matroid

We provide a constructive characterisation of circuits in the simple (2,2)-sparsity matroid. A circuit is a simple graph G=(V,E) with |E|=2|V|-1 and the number of edges induced by any $X \subsetneq V$ is at most 2|X|-2. Insisting on simplicity results in the Henneberg operation being enough only when the graph is sufficiently connected. Thus we introduce 3 different join operations to complete the characterisation. Extensions are discussed to when the sparsity matroid is connected and this is applied to the theory of frameworks on surfaces to provide a conjectured characterisation of when frameworks on an infinite circular cylinder are generically globally rigid.
