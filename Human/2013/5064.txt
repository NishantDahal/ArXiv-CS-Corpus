Using LDGM Codes and Sparse Syndromes to Achieve Digital Signatures

In this paper, we address the problem of achieving efficient code-based digital signatures with small public keys. The solution we propose exploits sparse syndromes and randomly designed low-density generator matrix codes. Based on our evaluations, the proposed scheme is able to outperform existing solutions, permitting to achieve considerable security levels with very small public keys.
