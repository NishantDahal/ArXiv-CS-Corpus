Some Combinatorial Problems on Binary Matrices in Programming Courses

The study proves the existence of an algorithm to receive all elements of a class of binary matrices without obtaining redundant elements, e. g. without obtaining binary matrices that do not belong to the class. This makes it possible to avoid checking whether each of the objects received possesses the necessary properties. This significantly improves the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the criterion of time. Certain useful educational effects related to the analysis of such problems in programming classes are also pointed out.
