Efficient Algorithms for Privately Releasing Marginals via Convex Relaxations

Consider a database of $n$ people, each represented by a bit-string of length $d$ corresponding to the setting of $d$ binary attributes. A $k$-way marginal query is specified by a subset $S$ of $k$ attributes, and a $|S|$-dimensional binary vector $β$ specifying their values. The result for this query is a count of the number of people in the database whose attribute vector restricted to $S$ agrees with $β$.
  Privately releasing approximate answers to a set of $k$-way marginal queries is one of the most important and well-motivated problems in differential privacy. Information theoretically, the error complexity of marginal queries is well-understood: the per-query additive error is known to be at least $Ω(\min\{\sqrt{n},d^{\frac{k}{2}}\})$ and at most $\tilde{O}(\min\{\sqrt{n} d^{1/4},d^{\frac{k}{2}}\})$. However, no polynomial time algorithm with error complexity as low as the information theoretic upper bound is known for small $n$. In this work we present a polynomial time algorithm that, for any distribution on marginal queries, achieves average error at most $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^{\frac{\lceil k/2 \rceil}{4}})$. This error bound is as good as the best known information theoretic upper bounds for $k=2$. This bound is an improvement over previous work on efficiently releasing marginals when $k$ is small and when error $o(n)$ is desirable. Using private boosting we are also able to give nearly matching worst-case error bounds.
  Our algorithms are based on the geometric techniques of Nikolov, Talwar, and Zhang. The main new ingredients are convex relaxations and careful use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for constrained convex minimization. To design our relaxations, we rely on the Grothendieck inequality from functional analysis.
