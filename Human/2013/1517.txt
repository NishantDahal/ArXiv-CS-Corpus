Bar 1-Visibility Drawings of 1-Planar Graphs

A bar 1-visibility drawing of a graph $G$ is a drawing of $G$ where each vertex is drawn as a horizontal line segment called a bar, each edge is drawn as a vertical line segment where the vertical line segment representing an edge must connect the horizontal line segments representing the end vertices and a vertical line segment corresponding to an edge intersects at most one bar which is not an end point of the edge. A graph $G$ is bar 1-visible if $G$ has a bar 1-visibility drawing. A graph $G$ is 1-planar if $G$ has a drawing in a 2-dimensional plane such that an edge crosses at most one other edge. In this paper we give linear-time algorithms to find bar 1-visibility drawings of diagonal grid graphs and maximal outer 1-planar graphs. We also show that recursive quadrangle 1-planar graphs and pseudo double wheel 1-planar graphs are bar 1-visible graphs.
