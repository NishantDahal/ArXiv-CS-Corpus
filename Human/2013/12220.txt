Mixture model-based functional discriminant analysis for curve classification

Statistical approaches for Functional Data Analysis concern the paradigm for which the individuals are functions or curves rather than finite dimensional vectors. In this paper, we particularly focus on the modeling and the classification of functional data which are temporal curves presenting regime changes over time. More specifically, we propose a new mixture model-based discriminant analysis approach for functional data using a specific hidden process regression model. Our approach is particularly adapted to both handle the problem of complex-shaped classes of curves, where each class is composed of several sub-classes, and to deal with the regime changes within each homogeneous sub-class. The model explicitly integrates the heterogeneity of each class of curves via a mixture model formulation, and the regime changes within each sub-class through a hidden logistic process. The approach allows therefore for fitting flexible curve-models to each class of complex-shaped curves presenting regime changes through an unsupervised learning scheme, to automatically summarize it into a finite number of homogeneous clusters, each of them is decomposed into several regimes. The model parameters are learned by maximizing the observed-data log-likelihood for each class by using a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Comparisons on simulated data and real data with alternative approaches, including functional linear discriminant analysis and functional mixture discriminant analysis with polynomial regression mixtures and spline regression mixtures, show that the proposed approach provides better results regarding the discrimination results and significantly improves the curves approximation.
