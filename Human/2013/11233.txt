Web-page Indexing based on the Prioritize Ontology Terms

In this world, globalization has become a basic and most popular human trend. To globalize information, people are going to publish the documents in the internet. As a result, information volume of internet has become huge. To handle that huge volume of information, Web searcher uses search engines. The Webpage indexing mechanism of a search engine plays a big role to retrieve Web search results in a faster way from the huge volume of Web resources. Web researchers have introduced various types of Web-page indexing mechanism to retrieve Webpages from Webpage repository. In this paper, we have illustrated a new approach of design and development of Webpage indexing. The proposed Webpage indexing mechanism has applied on domain specific Webpages and we have identified the Webpage domain based on an Ontology. In our approach, first we prioritize the Ontology terms that exist in the Webpage content then apply our own indexing mechanism to index that Webpage. The main advantage of storing an index is to optimize the speed and performance while finding relevant documents from the domain specific search engine storage area for a user given search query.
