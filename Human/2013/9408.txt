Dead Zone Penetration Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks

Current routing protocols for cognitive radio networks are severely affected by the frequent activity of primary users. Nodes that are in the interference range of an appearing primary user are not allowed to transmit, and therefore existing routes which utilize such nodes are obliged to undergo a route maintenance phase. This naturally provides other routes to the destination that may incur extra delay or increase packet queuing overhead. In this work, a novel route maintenance protocol is proposed that allows existing routes to endure the event of primary user presence by forming cooperative links between neighboring nodes and nulling out transmission at the primary receiver using cooperative beamforming. Our proposed protocol can be used in conjunction with any of the existing routing protocols, thus achieving modularity. Extensive simulations are done which prove that our proposed protocol outperforms existing route maintenance techniques in terms of end-to-end delay and loss ratio, with minimal incurred overhead.
