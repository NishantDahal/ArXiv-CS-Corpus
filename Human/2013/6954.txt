The homology graph of a higher dimensional automaton

Higher dimensional automata, i.e. labelled precubical sets, model concurrent systems. We introduce the homology graph of an HDA, which is a directed graph whose nodes are the homology classes of the HDA. We show that the homology graph is invariant under homeomorphic abstraction, i.e. under weak morphisms that are homeomorphisms.
