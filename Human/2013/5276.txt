Refinement in the Tableau Synthesis Framework

This paper is concerned with the possibilities of refining and improving calculi generated in the tableau synthesis framework. A general method in the tableau synthesis framework allows to reduce the branching factor of tableau rules and preserves completeness if a general rule refinement condition holds. In this paper we consider two approaches to satisfy this general rule refinement condition.
