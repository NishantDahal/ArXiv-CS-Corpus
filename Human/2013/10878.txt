Intertwining Laplace Transformations of Linear Partial Differential Equations

We propose a generalization of Laplace transformations to the case of linear partial differential operators (LPDOs) of arbitrary order in R^n. Practically all previously proposed differential transformations of LPDOs are particular cases of this transformation (intertwining Laplace transformation, ILT). We give a complete algorithm of construction of ILT and describe the classes of operators in R^n suitable for this transformation.
