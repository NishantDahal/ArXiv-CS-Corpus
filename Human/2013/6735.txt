Curves on Flat Tori and Analog Source-Channel Codes

In this paper we consider the problem of transmitting a continuous alphabet discrete-time source over an AWGN channel. We propose a constructive scheme based on a set of curves on the surface of a N-dimensional sphere. Our approach shows that the design of good codes for this communication problem is related to geometrical properties of spherical codes and projections of N-dimensional rectangular lattices. Theoretical comparisons with some previous works in terms of the mean square error as a function of the channel SNR as well as simulations are provided.
