More Classes of Complete Permutation Polynomials over $\F_q$

In this paper, by using a powerful criterion for permutation polynomials given by Zieve, we give several classes of complete permutation monomials over $\F_{q^r}$. In addition, we present a class of complete permutation multinomials, which is a generalization of recent work.
