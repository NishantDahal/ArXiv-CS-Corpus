Bounded rationality in a dynamic alternate game

From the standpoint of game theory, dominoes is a game that has not received much attention (specially the variety known as draw). It is usually thought that this game is already solved, given general results in game theory. However, the determination of equilibria is not feasible for the general case because of the well known problem of node explosion in the tree expressing the game. We propose a new model based in limited forecast as a kind of bounded rationality for dynamic alternate games.
