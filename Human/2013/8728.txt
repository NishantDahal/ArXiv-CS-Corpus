Study of Encryption and Decryption of Wave File in Image Formats

This paper describes a novel method of encrypting wave files in popular image formats like JPEG, TIF and PNG along with retrieving them from these image files. MATLAB software is used to perform matrix manipulation to encrypt and decrypt sound files into and from image files. This method is not only a stenographic means but also a data compression technique.
