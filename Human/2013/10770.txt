The complex-valued encoding for dicision-making based on aliasing data

It is proposed a complex valued channel encoding for multidimensional data. The basic approach contains overlapping of complex nonlinear mappings. Its development leads to sparse representation of multi-channel data, increasing their dimensions and the distance between the images.
