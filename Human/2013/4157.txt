Coding for Memory with Stuck-at Defects

In this paper, we propose an encoding scheme for partitioned linear block codes (PLBC) which mask the stuck-at defects in memories. In addition, we derive an upper bound and the estimate of the probability that masking fails. Numerical results show that PLBC can efficiently mask the defects with the proposed encoding scheme. Also, we show that our upper bound is very tight by using numerical results.
