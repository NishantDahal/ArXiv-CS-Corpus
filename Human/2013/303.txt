The Importance of Continuous Value Based Project Management in the Context of Requirements Engineering

Despite several scientific achievements in the last years, there are still a lot of IT projects that fail. Researchers found that one out of five IT-projects run out of time, budget or value. Major reasons for this failure are unexpected economic risk factors that emerge during the runtime of projects. In order to be able to identify emerging risks early and to counteract reasonably, financial methods for a continuous IT-project-steering are necessary, which as of today to the best of our knowledge are missing within scientific literature.
