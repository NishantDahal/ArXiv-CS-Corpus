Optimizing Cost, Delay, Packet Loss and Network Load in AODV Routing Protocol

AODV is Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector.A mobile ad-hoc network is a self-configuring network of mobile devices connected by wireless. MANET does not have any fixed infrastructure. The device in a MANET is free to move in any direction and will form the connection as per the requirement of the network. Due to changing topology maintenance of factors like Packet loss, End to End Delay, Number of hops, delivery ratio and controlling the network load is of great challenge. This paper mainly concentrates on reducing the factors such as cost, End-to-End Delay, Network Load and Packet loss in AODV routing protocol. The NS-2 is used for the simulation purpose.
