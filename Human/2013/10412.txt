Lyapunov-based Low-thrust Optimal Orbit Transfer: An approach in Cartesian coordinates

This paper presents a simple approach to low-thrust optimal-fuel and optimal-time transfer problems between two elliptic orbits using the Cartesian coordinates system. In this case, an orbit is described by its specific angular momentum and Laplace vectors with a free injection point. Trajectory optimization with the pseudospectral method and nonlinear programming are supported by the initial guess generated from the Chang-Chichka-Marsden Lyapunov-based transfer controller. This approach successfully solves several low-thrust optimal problems. Numerical results show that the Lyapunov-based initial guess overcomes the difficulty in optimization caused by the strong oscillation of variables in the Cartesian coordinates system. Furthermore, a comparison of the results shows that obtaining the optimal transfer solution through the polynomial approximation by utilizing Cartesian coordinates is easier than using orbital elements, which normally produce strongly nonlinear equations of motion. In this paper, the Earth's oblateness and shadow effect are not taken into account.
