Ergo: A Graphical Environment for Constructing Bayesian

We describe an environment that considerably simplifies the process of generating Bayesian belief networks. The system has been implemented on readily available, inexpensive hardware, and provides clarity and high performance. We present an introduction to Bayesian belief networks, discuss algorithms for inference with these networks, and delineate the classes of problems that can be solved with this paradigm. We then describe the hardware and software that constitute the system, and illustrate Ergo's use with several example
