The weight Enumerator of some irreducible cyclic codes

Irreducible cyclic codes are one of the largest known classes of block codes which have been investigated for a long time. However, their weight distributions are known only for a few cases. In this paper, a class of irreducible cyclic codes are studied and their weight distributions are determined. Moreover, all codewords of some irreducible cyclic codes are obtained through programming in order to explain their distributions. The number of distinct nonzero weights in these codes dealt with in this paper varies among 1,2,3,6,8.
