Analysis Of The Girth For Regular Bi-partite Graphs With Degree 3

The goal of this paper is to derive the detailed description of the Enumeration Based Search Algorithm from the high level description provided in [16], analyze the experimental results from our implementation of the Enumeration Based Search Algorithm for finding a regular bi-partite graph of degree 3, and compare it with known results from the available literature. We show that the values of m for a given girth g for (m, 3) BTUs are within the known mathematical bounds for regular bi-partitite graphs from the available literature.
