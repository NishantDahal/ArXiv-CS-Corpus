History Based Coalition Formation in Hedonic Context Using Trust

In this paper we address the problem of coalition formation in hedonic context. Our modelling tries to be as realistic as possible. In previous models, once an agent joins a coalition it would not be able to leave the coalition and join the new one; in this research we made it possible to leave a coalition but put some restrictions to control the behavior of agents. Leaving or staying of an agent in a coalition will affect on the trust of the other agents included in this coalition. Agents will use the trust values in computing the expected utility of coalitions. Three different risk behaviors are introduced for agents that want to initiate a coalition. Using these risk behaviors, some simulations are made and results are analyzed.
