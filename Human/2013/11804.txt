Optimizing data collection for object tracking in wireless sensor networks

In this paper some modifications are proposed to optimize an algorithm of object tracking in wireless sensor network (WSN). The task under consideration is to control movement of a mobile sink, which has to reach a target in the shortest possible time. Utilization of the WSN resources is optimized by transferring only selected data readings (target locations) to the mobile sink. Simulations were performed to evaluate the proposed modifications against state-of-the-art methods. The obtained results show that the presented tracking algorithm allows for substantial reduction of data collection costs with no significant increase in the amount of time that it takes to catch the target.
