Synthesizing Switching Controllers for Hybrid Systems by Continuous Invariant Generation

We extend a template-based approach for synthesizing switching controllers for semi-algebraic hybrid systems, in which all expressions are polynomials. This is achieved by combining a QE (quantifier elimination)-based method for generating continuous invariants with a qualitative approach for predefining templates. Our synthesis method is relatively complete with regard to a given family of predefined templates. Using qualitative analysis, we discuss heuristics to reduce the numbers of parameters appearing in the templates. To avoid too much human interaction in choosing templates as well as the high computational complexity caused by QE, we further investigate applications of the SOS (sum-of-squares) relaxation approach and the template polyhedra approach in continuous invariant generation, which are both well supported by efficient numerical solvers.
