Queuing Methodology Based Power Efficient Routing Protocol for Reliable Data Communications in Manets

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a wireless network that uses multi-hop peer-to- peer routing instead of static network infrastructure to provide network connectivity. MANETs have applications in rapidly deployed and dynamic military and civilian systems. The network topology in a MANET usually changes with time. Therefore, there are new challenges for routing protocols in MANETs since traditional routing protocols may not be suitable for MANETs. In recent years, a variety of new routing protocols targeted specifically at this environment have been developed, but little performance information on each protocol and no realistic performance comparison between them is available. This paper presents the results of a detailed packet-level simulation comparing three multi-hop wireless ad hoc network routing protocols that cover a range of design choices: DSR, NFPQR, and clustered NFPQR. By applying queuing methodology to the introduced routing protocol the reliability and throughput of the network is increased.
