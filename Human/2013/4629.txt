First and High Order Sliding Mode-Multimodel Stabilizing Control Synthesis using Single and Several Sliding Surfaces for Nonlinear Systems: Simulation on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV)

This paper provides new analytic tools for a rigorous control formulation and stability analysis of sliding mode-multimodel controller (SM-MMC). In this way to minimise the chattering effect we will adopt as a starting point the multimodel approach to change the commutation of the sliding mode control (SMC) into fusion using a first order then a high order sliding mode control with single sliding surface and, then, with several sliding surfaces. For that the stability conditions invoke the existence of two Lyapunov-type functions, the first associated to the passage to the sliding set in finite time, and the second with convergence to the desired state. The approaches presented in this work are simulated on the immersion control of a submarine mobile which presents a problem for the actuators because of the high level of system non linearity and because of the external disturbances. Simulation results show that this control strategy can attain excellent performances with no chattering problem and low control level.
