Minimal Indices for Successor Search

We give a new successor data structure which improves upon the index size of the Pǎtraşcu-Thorup data structures, reducing the index size from $O(n w^{4/5})$ bits to $O(n \log w)$ bits, with optimal probe complexity. Alternatively, our new data structure can be viewed as matching the space complexity of the (probe-suboptimal) $z$-fast trie of Belazzougui et al. Thus, we get the best of both approaches with respect to both probe count and index size. The penalty we pay is an extra $O(\log w)$ inter-register operations. Our data structure can also be used to solve the weak prefix search problem, the index size of $O(n \log w)$ bits is known to be optimal for any such data structure.
  The technical contributions include highly efficient single word indices, with out-degree $w/\log w$ (compared to the $w^{1/5}$ out-degree of fusion tree based indices). To construct such high efficiency single word indices we device highly efficient bit selectors which, we believe, are of independent interest.
