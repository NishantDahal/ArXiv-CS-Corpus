An update on domineering on rectangular boards

Domineering is a combinatorial game played on a subset of a rectangular grid between two players. Each board position can be put into one of four outcome classes based on who the winner will be if both players play optimally. In this note, we review previous work, establish the outcome classes for several dimensions of rectangular board, and restrict the outcome class in several more.
