A decidable class of (nominal) omega-regular languages over an infinite alphabet

We define a class of languages of infinite words over infinite alphabets, and the corresponding automata. The automata used for recognition are a generalisation of deterministic Muller automata to the setting of nominal sets. Remarkably, the obtained languages are determined by their ultimately periodic fragments, as in the classical case. Closure under complement, union and intersection, and decidability of emptiness and equivalence are preserved by the generalisation. This is shown by using finite representations of the (otherwise infinite-state) defined class of automata.
