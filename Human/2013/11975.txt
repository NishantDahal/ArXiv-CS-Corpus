Fast Reconstruction of Compact Context-Specific Metabolic Network Models

Systemic approaches to the study of a biological cell or tissue rely increasingly on the use of context-specific metabolic network models. The reconstruction of such a model from high-throughput data can routinely involve large numbers of tests under different conditions and extensive parameter tuning, which calls for fast algorithms. We present FASTCORE, a generic algorithm for reconstructing context-specific metabolic network models from global genome-wide metabolic network models such as Recon X. FASTCORE takes as input a core set of reactions that are known to be active in the context of interest (e.g., cell or tissue), and it searches for a flux consistent subnetwork of the global network that contains all reactions from the core set and a minimal set of additional reactions. Our key observation is that a minimal consistent reconstruction can be defined via a set of sparse modes of the global network, and FASTCORE iteratively computes such a set via a series of linear programs. Experiments on liver data demonstrate speedups of several orders of magnitude, and significantly more compact reconstructions, over a chief rival method. Given its simplicity and its excellent performance, FASTCORE can form the backbone of many future metabolic network reconstruction algorithms.
