A Heuristic Bayesian Approach to Knowledge Acquisition: Application to Analysis of Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator

This paper describes a heuristic Bayesian method for computing probability distributions from experimental data, based upon the multivariate normal form of the influence diagram. An example illustrates its use in medical technology assessment. This approach facilitates the integration of results from different studies, and permits a medical expert to make proper assessments without considerable statistical training.
