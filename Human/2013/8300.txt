Gcube Indexing

Spatial Online Analytical Processing System involves the non-categorical attribute information also whereas standard Online Analytical Processing System deals with only categorical attributes. Providing spatial information to the data warehouse (DW); two major challenges faced are;1.Defining and Aggregation of Spatial/Continues values and 2.Representation, indexing, updating and efficient query processing. In this paper, we present GCUBE(Geographical Cube) storage and indexing procedure to aggregate the spatial information/Continuous values. We employed the proposed approach storing and indexing using synthetic and real data sets and evaluated its build, update and Query time. It is observed that the proposed procedure offers significant performance advantage.
