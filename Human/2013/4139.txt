The Tap code - a code similar to Morse code for communication by tapping

A code is presented for fast, easy and efficient communication over channels that allow only two signal types: a single sound (e.g. a knock), or no sound (i.e. silence). This is a true binary code while Morse code is a ternary code and does not work in such situations. Thus the presented code is more universal than Morse and can be used in much more situations. Additionally it is very tolerant to variations in signal strength or duration. The paper contains various ways in which the code can be derived, that all lead to the same code. It also contains a comparison to other, similar codes, including the Morse code, in regards to efficiency and other attributes. The replacement of Morse code with Tap code is not proposed.
