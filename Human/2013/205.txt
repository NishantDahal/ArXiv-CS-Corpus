Self-Organizing Map and social networks: Unfolding online social popularity

The present study uses the Kohonen self organizing map (SOM) to represent the popularity patterns of Myspace music artists from their attributes on the platform and their position in the social network. The method is applied to cluster the profiles (the nodes of the social network) and the best friendship links (the edges). It shows that the SOM is an efficient tool to interpret the complex links between the audience and the influence of the musicians. It finally provides a robust classifier of the online social network behaviors.
