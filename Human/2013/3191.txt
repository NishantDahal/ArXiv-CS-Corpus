Automatic Detection of Non-deverbal Event Nouns for Quick Lexicon Production

In this work we present the results of our experimental work on the develop-ment of lexical class-based lexica by automatic means. The objective is to as-sess the use of linguistic lexical-class based information as a feature selection methodology for the use of classifiers in quick lexical development. The results show that the approach can help in re-ducing the human effort required in the development of language resources sig-nificantly.
