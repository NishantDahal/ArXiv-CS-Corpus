Expressing Second-order Sentences in Intuitionistic Dependence Logic

Intuitionistic dependence logic was introduced by Abramsky and Vaananen (2009) as a variant of dependence logic under a general construction of Hodges' (trump) team semantics. It was proven that there is a translation from intuitionistic dependence logic sentences into second order logic sentences. In this paper, we prove that the other direction is also true, therefore intuitionistic dependence logic is equivalent to second order logic on the level of sentences.
