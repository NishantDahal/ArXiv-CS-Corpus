Facilitating Machine to Machine (M2M) Communication using GSM Network

In this paper a method to facilitate M2M communication using existing GSM networks is proposed - as M2M devices primarily use SMS as their data bearer, the focus is on increasing the number of devices that can use the associated GSM signaling channels at a time. This is achieved by defining a new class of low mobility, static M2M devices which use a modified physical layer control frame structure. The proposal is expected to aid a quick, reliable and cost-effective deployment of M2M devices in the existing GSM networks.
