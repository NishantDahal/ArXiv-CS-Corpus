The Web Geometry Laboratory Project

The "Web Geometry Laboratory" (WGL) project's goal is to build an adaptive and collaborative blended-learning Web-environment for geometry. In its current version (1.0) the WGL is already a collaborative blended-learning Web-environment integrating a dynamic geometry system (DGS) and having some adaptive features. All the base features needed to implement the adaptive module and to allow the integration of a geometry automated theorem prover (GATP) are also already implemented. The actual testing of the WGL platform by high-school teachers is underway and a field-test with high-school students is being prepared. The adaptive module and the GATP integration will be the next steps of this project.
