Circuit proposition for copying the value of a resistor into a memristive device supported by HSPICE simulation

Memristor is the fourth fundamental passive circuit element with potential applications in development of analog memories, artificial brains (with the capacity of hardware training) and neuro-science. In most of these applications the memristance of the device should be set to the desired value, which is currently performed by trial and error. The aim of this paper is to propose a circuit for copying the value of the given resistor into a memristive device. HSPICE simulations are also presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed circuit.
