A Conceptual E-Governance Framework for Improving Child Immunization Process in India

India is country having high population and great variations in the educational level, economic conditions, population densities, cultures and awareness levels. Due to these variations the immunization process is not so much successful as per expectations of the state and central governments. In some zones the significant amount of vaccines are wasted whereas some are running out of vaccines. One of the reasons for such an imbalance is improper quantity estimation of vaccines in a particular zone. Further a huge amount of liquidity will be wasted in the form of vaccines. If we inculcate ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in the process of immunization then the problem can be rectified to some extent and hence we are proposing a conceptual model using ICT to improve the process of vaccination.
