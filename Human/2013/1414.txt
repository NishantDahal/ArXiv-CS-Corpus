The Jordan-Brouwer theorem for the digital normal n-space Zn

In this paper we investigate properties of digital spaces which are represented by graphs. We find conditions for digital spaces to be digital n-manifolds and n-spheres. We study properties of partitions of digital spaces and prove a digital analog of the Jordan-Brouwer theorem for the normal digital n-space Zn.
