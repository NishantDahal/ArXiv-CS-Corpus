Vers une Substitution des Services Web sans Inconsistance SÃ©mantique

In order to ensure high availability of Web services, recently, a new approach was proposed based on the use of communities. In composition, this approach consists in replacing the failed Web service by another web service joining a community offering the same functionality of the service failed. However, this substitution may cause inconsistency in the semantic composition and alter its mediation initially taken to resolve the semantic heterogeneities between Web services. This paper presents a context oriented solution to this problem by forcing the community to adopt the semantic of the failed web service before the substitution in which all inputs and outputs to/from the latter must be converted according to this adopted semantic, avoiding any alteration of a semantic mediation in web service composition.
