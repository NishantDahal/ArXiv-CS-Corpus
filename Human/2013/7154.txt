Relative Performance of a Multi-level Cache with Last-Level Cache Replacement: An Analytic Review

Current day processors employ multi-level cache hierarchy with one or two levels of private caches and a shared last-level cache (LLC). An efficient cache replacement policy at LLC is essential for reducing the off-chip memory transfer as well as conflict for memory bandwidth. Cache replacement techniques for inclusive LLCs may not be efficient for multilevel cache as it can be shared by enormous applications with varying access behavior, running simultaneously. One application may dominate another by flooding of cache requests and evicting the useful data of the other application. From the performance point of view, an exclusive LLC make the replacement policies more demanding, as compared to an inclusive LLC. This paper analyzes some of the existing replacement techniques on the LLC with their performance assessment.
