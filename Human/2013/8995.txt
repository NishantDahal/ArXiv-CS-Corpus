A General Stochastic Information Diffusion Model in Social Networks based on Epidemic Diseases

Social networks are an important infrastructure for information, viruses and innovations propagation. Since users behavior has influenced by other users activity, some groups of people would be made regard to similarity of users interests. On the other hand, dealing with many events in real worlds, can be justified in social networks; spreading disease is one instance of them. People manner and infection severity are more important parameters in dissemination of diseases. Both of these reasons derive, whether the diffusion leads to an epidemic or not. SIRS is a hybrid model of SIR and SIS disease models to spread contamination. A person in this model can be returned to susceptible state after it removed. According to communities which are established on the social network, we use the compartmental type of SIRS model. During this paper, a general compartmental information diffusion model would be proposed and extracted some of the beneficial parameters to analyze our model. To adapt our model to realistic behaviors, we use Markovian model, which would be helpful to create a stochastic manner of the proposed model. In the case of random model, we can calculate probabilities of transaction between states and predicting value of each state. The comparison between two mode of the model shows that, the prediction of population would be verified in each state.
