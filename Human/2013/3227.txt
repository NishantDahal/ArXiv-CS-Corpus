An efficient cntfet-based 7-input minority gate

Complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology (CMOS) has been faced critical challenges in nano-scale regime. CNTFET (Carbon Nanotube Field effect transistor) technology is a promising alternative for CMOS technology. In this paper, we proposed a novel 7-input minority gate in CNTFET technology that has only 9 CNTFETs. Minority function is utilized in the voting systems for decision making and also it is used in data mining. This proposed 7-input minority gate is utilized less fewer transistors than the conventional CMOS method which utilizes many transistors for implementing sum of products. By means of this proposed 7-input minority gate, a 4-input NAND gate can be implemented, which gets better the conventional design in terms of delay and energy efficiency and has much more deriving power at its output.
