Joint Transmit Diversity Optimization and Relay Selection for Cooperative MIMO Systems using Discrete Stochastic Algorithms

We propose a joint discrete stochastic optimization based transmit diversity selection (TDS) and relay selection (RS) algorithm for decode-and-forward (DF), cooperative MIMO systems with a non-negligible direct path. TDS and RS are performed jointly with continuous least squares channel estimation (CE), linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers are used at all nodes and no inter-relay communication is required. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via bit-error rate (BER) comparisons and diversity analysis, and is shown to converge to the optimum exhaustive solution.
