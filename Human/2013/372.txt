A DSL for Mapping Abstract Syntax Models to Concrete Syntax Models in ModelCC

ModelCC is a model-based parser generator that decouples language design from language processing. ModelCC provides two different mechanisms to specify the mapping from an abstract syntax model to a concrete syntax model: metadata annotations defined on top of the abstract syntax model specification and a domain-specific language for defining ASM-CSM mappings. Using a domain-specific language to specify the mapping from abstract to concrete syntax models allows the definition of multiple concrete syntax models for the same abstract syntax model. In this paper, we describe the ModelCC domain-specific language for abstract syntax model to concrete syntax model mappings and we showcase its capabilities by providing a meta-definition of that domain-specific language.
