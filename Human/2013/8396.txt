Detecting Data Races on OpenCL Kernels with Symbolic Execution

We present an automatic analysis technique for checking data races on OpenCL kernels. Our method defines symbolic execution techniques based on separation logic with suitable abstractions to automatically detect non-benign racy behaviours on kernel
