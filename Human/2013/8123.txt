Micro Spitbol

A compact version of MACRO SPITBOL, a compiler/ interpreter for a variant of SNOBOL4, has been developed for use on microcomputer systems. The techniques for producing an implementation are largely automatic in order to preserve the integrity and portability of the SPITBOL system. These techniques are discussed along with a description of an initial implementation on a 65K byte minicomputer. An interesting theoretical problem which arises when using procedures which compact the interpretive object code is also analyzed.
