On sequences of projections of the cubic lattice

In this paper we study sequences of lattices which are, up to similarity, projections of $\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ onto a hyperplane $\bm{v}^{\perp}$, with $\bm{v} \in \mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$ and converge to a target lattice $Î›$ which is equivalent to an integer lattice. We show a sufficient condition to construct sequences converging at rate $O(1/ |\bm{v}|^{2/n})$ and exhibit explicit constructions for some important families of lattices.
