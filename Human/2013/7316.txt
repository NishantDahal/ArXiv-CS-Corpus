Extending the ER Model to relational Model novel transformation Algorithm: transforming relationship Types among Subtypes

A novel approach for creating ER conceptual models and an algorithm for transforming them to the relational model has been developed by modifying and extending the existing methods. A part of the new algorithm has previously been presented. This paper presents the rest of the algorithm. One of the objectives of this paper is to use it as a supportive document for ongoing empirical evaluations of the new approach being conducted using the cognitive engagement method and with the participation of different segments of the field as respondents.
