K-Algorithm A Modified Technique for Noise Removal in Handwritten Documents

OCR has been an active research area since last few decades. OCR performs the recognition of the text in the scanned document image and converts it into editable form. The OCR process can have several stages like pre-processing, segmentation, recognition and post processing. The pre-processing stage is a crucial stage for the success of OCR, which mainly deals with noise removal. In the present paper, a modified technique for noise removal named as K-Algorithm has been proposed, which has two stages as filtering and binarization. The proposed technique shows improvised results in comparison to median filtering technique.
