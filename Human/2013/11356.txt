Simultaneous Greedy Analysis Pursuit for Compressive Sensing of Multi-Channel ECG Signals

This paper addresses compressive sensing for multi-channel ECG. Compared to the traditional sparse signal recovery approach which decomposes the signal into the product of a dictionary and a sparse vector, the recently developed cosparse approach exploits sparsity of the product of an analysis matrix and the original signal. We apply the cosparse Greedy Analysis Pursuit (GAP) algorithm for compressive sensing of ECG signals. Moreover, to reduce processing time, classical signal-channel GAP is generalized to the multi-channel GAP algorithm, which simultaneously reconstructs multiple signals with similar support. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the classical sparse multi-channel greedy algorithms in terms of accuracy and the single-channel cosparse approach in terms of processing speed.
