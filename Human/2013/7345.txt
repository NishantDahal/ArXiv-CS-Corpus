H Index of scientific Nursing journals according to Google Scholar Metrics (2007-2011)

The aim of this report is to present a ranking of Nursing journals covered in Google Scholar Metrics (GSM), a Google product launched in 2012 to assess the impact of scientific journals from citation counts this receive on Google Scholar. Google has chosen to include only those journals that have published at least 100 papers and have at least one citation in a period of five years (2007-2011). Journal rankings are sorted by languages (showing the 100 papers with the greatest impact). This tool allows to sort by subject areas and disciplines, but only in the case of journals in English. In this case, it only shows the 20 journals with the highest h index. This option is not available for journals in the other nine languages present in Google (Chinese, Portuguese, German, Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, Dutch and Italian).
  Google Scholar Metrics doesnt currently allow to group and sort all journals belonging to a scientific discipline. In the case of Nursing, in the ten listings displayed by GSM we can only locate 34 journals. Therefore, in an attempt to overcome this limitation, we have used the diversity of search procedures allowed by GSM to identify the greatest number of scientific journals of Nursing with h index calculated by this bibliometric tool. Bibliographic searches were conducted between 10th and 30th May 2013.
  The result is a ranking of 337 nursing journals sorted by the same h index, and mean as discriminating value. Journals are also grouped by quartiles.
