A Comparison of Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter, Hugin, and Shenoy-Shafer Architectures for Computing Marginals of Probability Distributions

In the last decade, several architectures have been proposed for exact computation of marginals using local computation. In this paper, we compare three architectures - Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter, Hugin, and Shenoy-Shafer - from the perspective of graphical structure for message propagation, message-passing scheme, computational efficiency, and storage efficiency.
