Channel Service Based High Speed Railway Base Station Arrangement

With the rapid development of high-speed railways, demands on high mobility wireless communication increase greatly. To provide stable and high data rate wireless access for users in the train, it is necessary to properly deploy base stations along the railway. In this paper, we consider this issue from the perspective of channel service which is defined as the integral of the time-varying instantaneous channel capacity. It will show that the total service quantity of each base station is a constant. In order to keep high service efficiency of the railway communication system with multiple base stations along the railway, we need to use the time division to schedule the multiple stations and allow one base station to work when the train is running close to it. In this way, we find a fact that if the ratio of the service quantity provided by each station to its total service quantity is given, the base station interval(i.e. the distance between two adjacent base stations) is a constant, regardless of the speed of the train. On the other hand, interval between two neighboring base stations will increase with the speed of the train. Furthermore, using the concept of channel service, we also analyze the transmission strategy of base stations.
