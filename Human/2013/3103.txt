Performance Analysis of LMS Filter for SSPA Linearization in Different Modulation Conditions

The SSPA has wide application in Communication system, but its high output power varies due to its non linear gain. Pre-distortion method plays major role in power amplifier linearization. Polynomial is one of the methods used. The error estimation in Polynomial method is carried out by LMS Filter. Our main work is to analysis the error estimation performance of the LMS Filter for the Solid state power amplifiers (SSPA) in different modulation conditions. Here we are calculating the ACP and analyzing how effectively the memoryless non linearity has been reduced for all digital modulation techniques. All the analysis and results are taken using Matlab software.
