A Three-class ROC for Evaluating Doubletalk Detectors in Acoustic Echo Cancellation

Doubletalk detector (DTD) is essential to keep adaptive filter from diverging in the presence of near-end speech in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and there was a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to characterize DTD performance. However, the traditional ROC for evaluating DTD used a static time-invariant room acoustic impulse response and could not evaluate DTDs which distinguish echo path change from doubletalk. We solve these problems by extending the traditional binary detection ROC to three class, and simulations show the efficiency of the proposed method.
