Multi Constraint Satisfying AODV routing using Fuzzy Logic

Mobile Networks are in need of what we call as an e-age. There have been numerous advancements in this field and soft computing has gained roots in this Mobile Ad-hoc Network domain. This documents studies the use of fuzzy logic over Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance vector Routing. The evaluation of the network using fuzzy logic over AODV has been conducted using selective criterion. Both the terms come from two different computing environments, but when combined together can achieve better results; when it comes to QoS based upon selective parameters. The crisp the rules formed in fuzzy logic, better the performance or quality will be achieved in AODV routing mechanism of MANET.
