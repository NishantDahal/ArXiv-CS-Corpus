Digital Circuits Implementation On Rpga Simulator

For Reversible computing, Target technology is yet to become available. Adequate tools are not yet developed for reversible technology. Simulation is still under development. Classical logic synthesis methods and simulation tools can not be used in reversible computing. Because these work on irreversible logic blocks but in reversible computing reversible logic blocks are used for design and implementation. So, we need a simulation platform to analysis and development in this area. So, we worked on this area and developed a GUI based simulator. In the Dissertation work, we undertook simulation of RPGA, reversible alternative to FPGA. We developed a RPGA simulator in our project. RPGA simulator combines the technology of PLD/FPGA/SYSTOLIC array. Our RPGA simulator, implements a given symmetric reversible Circuit on a RPGA structure. We also worked on RPGA structure gates (picton and kerntopf gates) to develop a better RPGA structure. Stepwise execution on RPGA structure is also performed in RPGA simulator. We also designed new algorithms for Truth Table generation and symmetry analysis. The dissertation work aims to develop entire simulator is GUI based and easy to learn that makes it user friendly. User can easily view all simulation results in GUI of our RPGA simulator.
