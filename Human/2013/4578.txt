Improved Analytical Delay Models for RC-Coupled Interconnects

As the process technologies scale into deep submicron region, crosstalk delay is becoming increasingly severe, especially for global on-chip buses. To cope with this problem, accurate delay models of coupled interconnects are needed. In particular, delay models based on analytical approaches are desirable, because they not only are largely transparent to technology, but also explicitly establish the connections between delays of coupled interconnects and transition patterns, thereby enabling crosstalk alleviating techniques such as crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs). Unfortunately, existing analytical delay models, such as the widely cited model in [1], have limited accuracy and do not account for loading capacitance. In this paper, we propose analytical delay models for coupled interconnects that address these disadvantages. By accounting for more wires and eschewing the Elmore delay, our delay models achieve better accuracy than the model in [1].
