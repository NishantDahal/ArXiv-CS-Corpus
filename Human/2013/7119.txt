Output and citation impact of interdisciplinary networks: Experiences from a dedicated funding program

In a context of ever more specialized scientists, interdisciplinarity receives increasing attention as innovating ideas are often situated where the disciplines meet. In many countries science policy makers installed dedicated funding programs and policies. This induces a need for specific tools for their support. There is however not yet a generally accepted quantitative method or set of criteria to recognize and evaluate interdisciplinary research outputs (Tracking and evaluating interdisciplinary research: metrics and maps, 12th ISSI Conference, 2009). Interdisciplinarity also takes on very different forms, as distinguished in overviews from the first codifications (Klein, 1990) to the latest reference work (Frodeman et al., 2010). In the specific context of research measurement and evaluation, interdisciplinarity was discussed e.g. by Rinia (2007) and Porter et al. (2006). This empirical study aims to contribute to the understanding and the measuring of interdisciplinary research at the micro level, in the form of new synergies between disciplines. Investigation of a specialized funding program shows how a new interdisciplinary synergy and its citation impact are visible in co-publications and cocitations, and that these are important parameters for assessment. The results also demonstrate the effect of funding, which is clearly present after about three years.
