Harvesting Resource Allocation in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks

Considering an energy harvesting sensor network, the overall probability of event loss is derived. Based on this result, a variety of harvesting resource allocation schemes (sizing the energy storages and the harvesting devices, under a total cost constraint) are provided. Their performances are verified and compared through simulations.
