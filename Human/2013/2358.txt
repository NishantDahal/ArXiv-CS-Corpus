Evidential Reasoning in Parallel Hierarchical Vision Programs

This paper presents an efficient adaptation and application of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, one that can be used effectively in a massively parallel hierarchical system for visual pattern perception. It describes the techniques used, and shows in an extended example how they serve to improve the system's performance as it applies a multiple-level set of processes.
