On a numerical algorithm for computing topological characteristics of three-dimensional bodies

We present an algorithm for computing the main topological characteristics of three-dimensional bodies. The algorithm is based on a discretization of Morse theory and uses discrete analogs of smooth functions with only nondegenerate (Morse) and the simplest degenerate critical points.
