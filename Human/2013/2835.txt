A Probabilistic Analysis of Marker-Passing Techniques for Plan-Recognition

Useless paths are a chronic problem for marker-passing techniques.  We use a probabilistic analysis to justify a method for quickly identifying and rejecting useless paths.  Using the same analysis, we identify key conditions and assumptions necessary for marker-passing to perform well.
