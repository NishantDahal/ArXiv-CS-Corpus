Utility-based Decision-making in Distributed Systems Modelling

We consider a calculus of resources and processes as a basis for modelling decision-making in multi-agent systems. The calculus represents the regulation of agents' choices using utility functions that take account of context. Associated with the calculus is a (Hennessy Milner-style) context sensitive modal logic of state. As an application, we show how a notion of `trust domain' can be defined for multi-agent systems.
