Web Synchronization Simulations using the ResourceSync Framework

Maintenance of multiple, distributed up-to-date copies of collections of changing Web resources is important in many application contexts and is often achieved using ad hoc or proprietary synchronization solutions. ResourceSync is a resource synchronization framework that integrates with the Web architecture and leverages XML sitemaps. We define a model for the ResourceSync framework as a basis for understanding its properties. We then describe experiments in which simulations of a variety of synchronization scenarios illustrate the effects of model configuration on consistency, latency, and data transfer efficiency. These results provide insight into which congurations are appropriate for various application scenarios.
