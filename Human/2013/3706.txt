Information Geometric Superactivation of Asymptotic Quantum Capacity and Classical Zero-Error Capacity of Zero-Capacity Quantum Channels

The superactivation of zero-capacity quantum channels makes it possible to use two zero-capacity quantum channels with a positive joint capacity at the output. Currently, we have no theoretical background for describing all possible combinations of superactive zero-capacity channels; hence, there may be many other possible combinations. In this PhD Thesis I provide an algorithmic solution to the problem of superactivation and prove that superactivation effect is rooted in information geometric issues.
