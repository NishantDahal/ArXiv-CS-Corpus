Transfers of entanglement qudit states in quantum networks

The issue of quantum states' transfer -- in particular, for so-called Perfect State Transfer (PST) -- in the networks represented by the spin chains seems to be one of the major concerns in quantum computing. Especially, in the context of future communication methods that can be used in broadly defined computer science. The chapter presents a definition of Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of quantum data transfer in one-dimensional spin chain, which is able to transfer the state of unknown qudits. The main part of the chapter is the discussion about possibility of entangled states' perfect transfer, in particular, for the generalized Bell states for qudits. One of the sections also contains the results of numerical experiments for the transmission of quantum entangled state in a noisy quantum channel.
