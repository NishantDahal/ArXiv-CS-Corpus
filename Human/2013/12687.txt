A New Variable Step-size Zero-point Attracting Projection Algorithm

This paper proposes a new variable step-size (VSS) scheme for the recently introduced zero-point attracting projection (ZAP) algorithm. The proposed variable step-size ZAPs are based on the gradient of the estimated filter coefficients sparseness that is approximated by the difference between the sparseness measure of current filter coefficients and an averaged sparseness measure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides both faster convergence rate and better tracking ability than previous ones.
