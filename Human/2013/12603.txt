Constrained Colluding Eavesdroppers: An Information-Theoretic Model

We study the secrecy capacity in the vicinity of colluding eavesdroppers. Contrary to the perfect collusion assumption in previous works, our new information-theoretic model considers constraints in collusion. We derive the achievable secure rates (lower bounds on the perfect secrecy capacity), both for the discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels. We also compare the proposed rates to the non-colluding and perfect colluding cases.
