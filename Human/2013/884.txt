Crossings in Grid Drawings

We prove crossing number inequalities for geometric graphs whose vertex sets are taken from a d-dimensional grid of volume N and give applications of these inequalities to counting the number of non-crossing geometric graphs that can be drawn on such grids.
  In particular, we show that any geometric graph with m >= 8N edges and with vertices on a 3D integer grid of volume N, has Ω((m^2/n)\log(m/n)) crossings. In d-dimensions, with d >= 4, this bound becomes Ω(m^2/n). We provide matching upper bounds for all d. Finally, for d >= 4 the upper bound implies that the maximum number of crossing-free geometric graphs with vertices on some d-dimensional grid of volume N is n^Θ(n). In 3 dimensions it remains open to improve the trivial bounds, namely, the 2^Ω(n) lower bound and the n^O(n) upper bound.
