From EGEE OPerations Portal towards EGI OPerations Portal

EGEE to EGI structure based on NGIs evolution induces a large move from the operations that will rely on a sustainable and largely decentralized model. One of the key evolutions for the challenge in the regionalisation relies in the scalability and the flexibility required regarding information source types and information handling. For 5 years, we have developed and maintained a standard-based component that allows us to address both theses issues. This open-source tool, named Lavoisier, has been a critical success factor for the operations dashboard, one of the Operations Portal main features. Indeed, it enables coherent efficient and reliable data handling which is customizable and scalable, as Lavoisier is an extensible service designed to provide a unified view of data collected from multiple heterogeneous data sources. Data views are represented and accessed as XML documents through standard languages such as XSLT, XPath. Moreover, scalability and reliability are enforced by a caching mechanism adaptable to specific data sources and use-cases. We will namely expose how the concept and the implementation enable clear roles separation between plug-in developer, service configuration administrator or end-user. Also, maintainability of the portal code has increased dramatically as the latter is now independent from the data sources technology or from the cache management policies. Finally, integration of data has recently been simplified as the service administrator proceeds now through web interfaces
