Clustering for high-dimension, low-sample size data using distance vectors

In high-dimension, low-sample size (HDLSS) data, it is not always true that closeness of two objects reflects a hidden cluster structure. We point out the important fact that it is not the closeness, but the "values" of distance that contain information of the cluster structure in high-dimensional space. Based on this fact, we propose an efficient and simple clustering approach, called distance vector clustering, for HDLSS data. Under the assumptions given in the work of Hall et al. (2005), we show the proposed approach provides a true cluster label under milder conditions when the dimension tends to infinity with the sample size fixed. The effectiveness of the distance vector clustering approach is illustrated through a numerical experiment and real data analysis.
