Underwater Efficient Energy Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks

This paper will focus on the energy efficiency issue in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks. In underwater environment, the two main issues are namely: reliability and energy efficiency. These two issues are twisted pair. Reliability requires error correction, and error-correction requires energy. More reliability tends to imply higher energy consumption, causing difficulty in applications that require nodes to be operated underwater for long periods of time without batteries recharging, and in aquatic environments that render hard the task of recharging or replacing batteries. Appropriate strategy must therefore be in-place to ensure reliable data transmission, while conserving energy. We propose a mathematical function of the efficiency of acoustic data communication in real underwater environment. We did the analysis of existing error-correction techniques, and then propose a new technique that is the hybrid error correction technique that improves the efficiency among the existing techniques.
