Minimum-Variance Importance-Sampling Bernoulli Estimator for Fast Simulation of Linear Block Codes over Binary Symmetric Channels

In this paper the choice of the Bernoulli distribution as biased distribution for importance sampling (IS) Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of linear block codes over binary symmetric channels (BSCs) is studied. Based on the analytical derivation of the optimal IS Bernoulli distribution, with explicit calculation of the variance of the corresponding IS estimator, two novel algorithms for fast-simulation of linear block codes are proposed. For sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) one of the proposed algorithm is SNR-invariant, i.e. the IS estimator does not depend on the cross-over probability of the channel. Also, the proposed algorithms are shown to be suitable for the estimation of the error-correcting capability of the code and the decoder. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is confirmed through simulation results in comparison to standard Monte Carlo method.
