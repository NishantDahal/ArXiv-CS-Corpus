Contrast Enhancement And Brightness Preservation Using Multi- Decomposition Histogram Equalization

Histogram Equalization (HE) has been an essential addition to the Image Enhancement world. Enhancement techniques like Classical Histogram Equalization (CHE), Adaptive Histogram Equalization (ADHE), Bi-Histogram Equalization (BHE) and Recursive Mean Separate Histogram Equalization (RMSHE) methods enhance contrast, however, brightness is not well preserved with these methods, which gives an unpleasant look to the final image obtained. Thus, we introduce a novel technique Multi-Decomposition Histogram Equalization (MDHE) to eliminate the drawbacks of the earlier methods. In MDHE, we have decomposed the input sixty-four parts, applied CHE in each of the sub-images and then finally interpolated them in correct order. The final image after MDHE results in contrast enhanced and brightness preserved image compared to all other techniques mentioned above. We have calculated the various parameters like PSNR, SNR, RMSE, MSE, etc. for every technique. Our results are well supported by bar graphs, histograms and the parameter calculations at the end.
