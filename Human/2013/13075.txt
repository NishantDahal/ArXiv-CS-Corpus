Hierarchical structuring of Cultural Heritage objects within large aggregations

Huge amounts of cultural content have been digitised and are available through digital libraries and aggregators like Europeana.eu. However, it is not easy for a user to have an overall picture of what is available nor to find related objects. We propose a method for hier- archically structuring cultural objects at different similarity levels. We describe a fast, scalable clustering algorithm with an automated field selection method for finding semantic clusters. We report a qualitative evaluation on the cluster categories based on records from the UK and a quantitative one on the results from the complete Europeana dataset.
