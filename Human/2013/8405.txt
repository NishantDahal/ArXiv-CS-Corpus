System and Methods for Converting Speech to SQL

This paper concerns with the conversion of a Spoken English Language Query into SQL for retrieving data from RDBMS. A User submits a query as speech signal through the user interface and gets the result of the query in the text format. We have developed the acoustic and language models using which a speech utterance can be converted into English text query and thus natural language processing techniques can be applied on this English text query to generate an equivalent SQL query. For conversion of speech into English text HTK and Julius tools have been used and for conversion of English text query into SQL query we have implemented a System which uses rule based translation to translate English Language Query into SQL Query. The translation uses lexical analyzer, parser and syntax directed translation techniques like in compilers. JFLex and BYACC tools have been used to build lexical analyzer and parser respectively. System is domain independent i.e. system can run on different database as it generates lex files from the underlying database.
