A Review of Privacy Essentials for Confidential Mobile Data Transactions

The increasingly rapid use of mobile devices for data transaction around the world has consequently led to a new problem, and that is, how to engage in mobile data transactions while maintaining an acceptable level of data privacy and security. While most mobile devices engage in data transactions through a data cloud or a set of data servers, it is still possible to apply data confidentiality across data servers, and, as such, preserving privacy in any mobile data transaction. Yet still, it is essential that a review of data privacy, data utility, the techniques, and methodologies employed in the data privacy process, is done, as the underlying data privacy principles remain the same. In this paper, as a contribution, we present a review of data privacy essentials that are fundamental in delivering any appropriate analysis and specific methodology implementation for various data privacy needs in mobile data transactions and computation.
