A Meta-heuristically Approach of the Spatial Assignment Problem of Human Resources in Multi-sites Enterprise

The aim of this work is to present a meta-heuristically approach of the spatial assignment problem of human resources in multi-sites enterprise. Usually, this problem consists to move employees from one site to another based on one or more criteria. Our goal in this new approach is to improve the quality of service and performance of all sites with maximizing an objective function under some managers imposed constraints. The formulation presented here of this problem coincides perfectly with a Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP) which is in the most cases NP-hard to solve optimally. To avoid this difficulty, we have opted to use a meta-heuristic popular method, which is the genetic algorithm, to solve this problem in concrete cases. The results obtained have shown the effectiveness of our approach, which remains until now very costly in time. But the reduction of the time can be obtained by different ways that we plan to do in the next work.
