Repairing and Inpainting Damaged Images using Diffusion Tensor

Removing or repairing the imperfections of a digital images or videos is a very active and attractive field of research belonging to the image inpainting technique. This later has a wide range of applications, such as removing scratches in old photographic image, removing text and logos or creating cartoon and artistic effects. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to repair a damaged image based on a non linear diffusion tensor. The idea is to track perfectly the local geometry of the damaged image and allowing diffusion only in the isophotes curves direction. To illustrate the effective performance of our method, we present some experimental results on test and real photographic color images
