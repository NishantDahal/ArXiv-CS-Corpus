Scalar Compandor Design Based on Optimal Compressor Function Approximating by Spline Functions

In this paper the approximation of the optimal compressor function using the first-degree spline functions and quadratic spline functions is done. Coefficients on which we form approximative spline functions are determined by solving equation systems that are formed from treshold conditions. For Gaussian source at the input of the quantizer, using the obtained approximate spline functions a companding quantizer designing is done. On the basis of the comparison with the SQNR of the optimal compandor it can be noticed that the proposed companding quantizer based on approximate spline functions achieved SQNR arbitrary close to that of the optimal compandor.
