An Improved Approach for Word Ambiguity Removal

Word ambiguity removal is a task of removing ambiguity from a word, i.e. correct sense of word is identified from ambiguous sentences. This paper describes a model that uses Part of Speech tagger and three categories for word sense disambiguation (WSD). Human Computer Interaction is very needful to improve interactions between users and computers. For this, the Supervised and Unsupervised methods are combined. The WSD algorithm is used to find the efficient and accurate sense of a word based on domain information. The accuracy of this work is evaluated with the aim of finding best suitable domain of word.
