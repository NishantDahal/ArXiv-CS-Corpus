The Mapping of Simulated Climate-Dependent Building Innovations

Performances of building energy innovations are most of the time dependent on the external climate conditions. This means a high performance of a specific innovation in a certain part of Europe, does not imply the same performances in other regions. The mapping of simulated building performances at the EU scale could prevent the waste of potential good ideas by identifying the best region for a specific innovation. This paper presents a methodology for obtaining maps of performances of building innovations that are virtually spread over whole Europe. It is concluded that these maps are useful for finding regions at the EU where innovations have the highest expected performances.
