On a question of Babadi and Tarokh

In a recent remarkable paper, Babadi and Tarokh proved the "randomness" of sequences arising from binary linear block codes in the sense of spectral distribution, provided that their dual distances are sufficiently large. However, numerical experiments conducted by the authors revealed that Gold sequences which have dual distance 5 also satisfy such randomness property. Hence the interesting question was raised as to whether or not the stringent requirement of large dual distances can be relaxed in the theorem in order to explain the randomness of Gold sequences. This paper improves their result on several fronts and provides an affirmative answer to this question.
