Cellular Automata based Feedback Mechanism in Strengthening biological Sequence Analysis Approach to Robotic Soccer

This paper reports on the application of sequence analysis algorithms for agents in robotic soccer and a suitable representation is proposed to achieve this mapping. The objective of this research is to generate novel better in-game strategies with the aim of faster adaptation to the changing environment. A homogeneous non-communicating multi-agent architecture using the representation is presented. To achieve real-time learning during a game, a bucket brigade algorithm is used to reinforce Cellular Automata Based Classifier. A technique for selecting strategies based on sequence analysis is adopted.
