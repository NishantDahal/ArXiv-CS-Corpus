Semantic Advertising

We present the concept of Semantic Advertising which we see as the future of online advertising. Semantic Advertising is online advertising powered by semantic technology which essentially enables us to represent and reason with concepts and the meaning of things. This paper aims to 1) Define semantic advertising, 2) Place it in the context of broader and more widely used concepts such as the Semantic Web and Semantic Search, 3) Provide a survey of work in related areas such as context matching, and 4) Provide a perspective on successful emerging technologies and areas of future work. We base our work on our experience as a company developing semantic technologies aimed at realizing the full potential of online advertising.
