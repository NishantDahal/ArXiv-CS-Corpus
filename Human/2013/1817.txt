Analysis of Evidence Using Formal Event Reconstruction

This paper expands upon the finite state machine approach for the formal analysis of digital evidence. The proposed method may be used to support the feasibility of a given statement by testing it against a relevant system model. To achieve this, a novel method for modeling the system and evidential statements is given. The method is then examined in a case study example.
