Genetic Algorithm for Designing a Convenient Facility Layout for a Circular Flow Path

In this paper, we present a heuristic for designing facility layouts that are convenient for designing a unidirectional loop for material handling. We use genetic algorithm where the objective function and crossover and mutation operators have all been designed specifically for this purpose. Our design is made under flexible bay structure and comparisons are made with other layouts from the literature that were designed under flexible bay structure.
