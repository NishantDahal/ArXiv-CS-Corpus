Comprehensive Border Bases for Zero Dimensional Parametric Polynomial Ideals

In this paper, we extend the idea of comprehensive Gröbner bases given by Weispfenning (1992) to border bases for zero dimensional parametric polynomial ideals. For this, we introduce a notion of comprehensive border bases and border system, and prove their existence even in the cases where they do not correspond to any term order. We further present algorithms to compute comprehensive border bases and border system. Finally, we study the relation between comprehensive Gröbner bases and comprehensive border bases w.r.t. a term order and give an algorithm to compute such comprehensive border bases from comprehensive Gröbner bases.
