Statistical Mechanics Algorithm for Response to Targets (SMART)

It is proposed to apply modern methods of nonlinear nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to develop software algorithms that will optimally respond to targets within short response times with minimal computer resources. This Statistical Mechanics Algorithm for Response to Targets (SMART) can be developed with a view towards its future implementation into a hardwired Statistical Algorithm Multiprocessor (SAM) to enhance the efficiency and speed of response to targets (SMART_SAM).
