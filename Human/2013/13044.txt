On the partition of R^n by hyperplanes

The partitioning of space by hyperplanes in the context of discrete classification problem is considered. We obtain some relations for the number of partitions and establish a recurrence relation for the maximal number of partitions of R^n by m hyperplanes. We rederive an explicit formula for the number of components into which the space can be partitioned by m hyperplanes.
