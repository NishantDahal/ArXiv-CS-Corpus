An Experience based Evaluation Process for ERP bids

Enterprise Resource Planning ERP systems integrate information across an entire organization that automate core activities such as finance accounting, human resources, manufacturing, production and supply chain management etc. to facilitate an integrated centralized system and rapid decision making resulting in cost reduction, greater planning, and increased control. Many organizations are updating their current management information systems with ERP systems. This is not a trivial task. They have to identify the organizations objectives and satisfy a myriad of stakeholders. They have to understand what business processes they have, how they can be improved, and what particular systems would best suit their needs. They have to understand how an ERP system is built, it involves the modification of an existing system with its own set of business rules. Deciding what to ask for and how to select the best option is a very complex operation and there is limited experience with this type of contracting in organizations. In this paper we discuss a particular experience with contracting out an ERP system, provide some lessons learned, and offer suggestions in how the RFP and bid selection processes could have been improved.
