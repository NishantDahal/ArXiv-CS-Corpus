Automated Verification of Quantum Protocols by Equivalence Checking

In this paper we introduce a technique and a tool for formal verification of various quantum information processing protocols. The tool uses stabilizer formalism and is capable of representing concurrent quantum protocol, thus is more expressive than quantum circuits. We also report on experimental results of using our Quantum Equivalence Checker (QEC) to analyse a range of quantum information processing protocols.
