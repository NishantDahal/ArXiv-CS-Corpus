Learning to answer questions

We present an open-domain Question-Answering system that learns to answer questions based on successful past interactions. We follow a pattern-based approach to Answer-Extraction, where (lexico-syntactic) patterns that relate a question to its answer are automatically learned and used to answer future questions. Results show that our approach contributes to the system's best performance when it is conjugated with typical Answer-Extraction strategies. Moreover, it allows the system to learn with the answered questions and to rectify wrong or unsolved past questions.
