Performance Evaluation of Video Communications over 4G Network

With exponential increase in the volumes of video traffic in cellular net-works, there is an increasing need for optimizing the quality of video delivery. 4G networks (Long Term Evolution Advanced or LTE A) are being introduced in many countries worldwide, which allow a downlink speed of upto 1 Gbps and uplink of 100 Mbps over a single base station. In this paper, we characterize the performance of LTE A physical layer in terms of transmitted video quality when the channel condi-tions and LTE settings are varied. We test the performance achieved as the channel quality is changed and HARQ features are enabled in physical layer. Blocking and blurring metrics were used to model image quality.
