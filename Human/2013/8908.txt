Verification, Validation and Testing of Kinetic Mechanisms of Hydrogen Combustion in Fluid Dynamic Computations

A one-step, a two-step, an abridged, a skeletal and four detailed kinetic schemes of hydrogen oxidation have been tested. A new skeletal kinetic scheme of hydrogen oxidation has been developed. The CFD calculations were carried out using ANSYS CFX software. Ignition delay times and speeds of flames were derived from the computational results. The computational data obtained using ANSYS CFX and CHEMKIN, and experimental data were compared. The precision, reliability, and range of validity of the kinetic schemes in CFD simulations were estimated. The impact of kinetic scheme on the results of computations was discussed. The relationship between grid spacing, timestep, accuracy, and computational cost were analyzed.
