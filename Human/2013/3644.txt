Vortexje - An Open-Source Panel Method for Co-Simulation

This paper discusses the use of the 3-dimensional panel method for dynamical system simulation. Specifically, the advantages and disadvantages of model exchange versus co-simulation of the aerodynamics and the dynamical system model are discussed. Based on a trade-off analysis, a set of recommendations for a panel method implementation and for a co-simulation environment is proposed. These recommendations are implemented in a C++ library, offered on-line under an open source license. This code is validated against XFLR5, and its suitability for co-simulation is demonstrated with an example of a tethered wing, i.e, a kite. The panel method implementation and the co-simulation environment are shown to be able to solve this stiff problem in a stable fashion.
