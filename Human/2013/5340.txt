Fibonacci Graphs and their Expressions

The paper investigates relationship between algebraic expressions and graphs. We consider a digraph called a Fibonacci graph which gives a generic example of non-series-parallel graphs. Our intention in this paper is to simplify the expressions of Fibonacci graphs and eventually find their shortest representations. With that end in view, we describe the number of methods for generating Fibonacci graph expressions and carry out their comparative analysis.
