Automatic energy saving (AES) modelto boost ubiquitous wireless sensor networks (WSNs)

We deploy BT node (sensor) that offers passive and active sensing capability to save energy. BT node works in passive mode for outdoor communication and active for indoor communication. The BT node is supported with novel automatic energy saving (AES) mathematical model to decide either modes. It provides robust and faster communication with less energy consumption. To validate this approach, network simulator-2 (ns2) simulation is used to simulate the behavior of network with the supporting mathematical model. The main objective of this research is to remotely access different types of servers, laptops, desktops and other static and moving objects. This prototype is initially deployed to control MSCS [13] & [14] from remote place through mobile devices. The prototype can further be enhanced to handle several objects simultaneously consuming less energy and resources.
