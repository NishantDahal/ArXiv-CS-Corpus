Review of simulating four classes of window materials for daylighting with non-standard BSDF using the simulation program Radiance

This review describes the currently available simulation models for window material to calculate daylighting with the program "Radiance". The review is based on four abstract and general classes of window materials, depending on their scattering and redirecting properties (bidirectional scatter distribution function, BSDF). It lists potential and limits of the older models and includes the most recent additions to the software. All models are demonstrated using an exemplary indoor scene and two typical sky conditions. It is intended as clarification for applying window material models in project work or teaching. The underlying algorithmic problems apply to all lighting simulation programs, so the scenarios of materials and skies are applicable to other lighting programs.
