Oracle Tractability of Skew Bisubmodular Functions

In this paper we consider skew bisubmodular functions as introduced in [9]. We construct a convex extension of a skew bisubmodular function which we call Lov√°sz extension in correspondence to the submodular case. We use this extension to show that skew bisubmodular functions given by an oracle can be minimised in polynomial time.
