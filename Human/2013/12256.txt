Dihedral angles and orthogonal polyhedra

Consider an orthogonal polyhedron, i.e., a polyhedron where (at least after a suitable rotation) all faces are perpendicular to a coordinate axis, and hence all edges are parallel to a coordinate axis. Clearly, any facial angle and any dihedral angle is a multiple of $π/2$.
  In this note we explore the converse: if the facial and/or dihedral angles are all multiples of $π/2$, is the polyhedron necessarily orthogonal? The case of facial angles was answered previously. In this note we show that if both the facial and dihedral angles are multiples of $π/2$ then the polyhedron is orthogonal (presuming connectivity), and we give examples to show that the condition for dihedral angles alone does not suffice.
