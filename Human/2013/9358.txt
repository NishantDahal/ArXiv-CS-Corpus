An Investigation of Data Privacy and Utility Preservation using KNN Classification as a Gauge

It is obligatory that organizations by law safeguard the privacy of individuals when handling data sets containing personal identifiable information (PII). Nevertheless, during the process of data privatization, the utility or usefulness of the privatized data diminishes. Yet achieving the optimal balance between data privacy and utility needs has been documented as an NP-hard challenge. In this study, we investigate data privacy and utility preservation using KNN machine learning classification as a gauge.
