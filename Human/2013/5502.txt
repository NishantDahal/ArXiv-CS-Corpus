Hybridization of Otsu Method and Median Filter for Color Image Segmentation

In this article a novel algorithm for color image segmentation has been developed. The proposed algorithm based on combining two existing methods in such a novel way to obtain a significant method to partition the color image into significant regions. On the first phase, the traditional Otsu method for gray channel image segmentation were applied for each of the R,G, and B channels separately to determine the suitable automatic threshold for each channel. After that, the new modified channels are integrated again to formulate a new color image. The resulted image suffers from some kind of distortion. To get rid of this distortion, the second phase is arise which is the median filter to smooth the image and increase the segmented regions. This process looks very significant by the ocular eye. Experimental results were presented on a variety of test images to support the proposed algorithm.
