Implementation of Hand Detection based Techniques for Human Computer Interaction

The computer industry is developing at a fast pace. With this development almost all of the fields under computers have advanced in the past couple of decades. But the same technology is being used for human computer interaction that was used in 1970s. Even today the same type of keyboard and mouse is used for interacting with computer systems. With the recent boom in the mobile segment touchscreens have become popular for interaction with cell phones. But these touchscreens are rarely used on traditional systems. This paper tries to introduce methods for human computer interaction using the users hand which can be used both on traditional computer platforms as well as cell phones. The methods explain how the users detected hand can be used as input for applications and also explain applications that can take advantage of this type of interaction mechanism.
