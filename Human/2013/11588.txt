Self-Dual codes from $(-1,1)$-matrices of skew symmetric type

Previously, self-dual codes have been constructed from weighing matrices, and in particular from conference matrices (skew and symmetric). In this paper, codes constructed from matrices of skew symmetric type whose determinants reach the Ehlich-Wojtas' bound are presented. A necessary and sufficient condition for these codes to be self-dual is given, and examples are provided for lengths up to 52.
