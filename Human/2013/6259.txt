Impact of Gate Assignment on Gate-Holding Departure Control Strategies

Gate holding reduces congestion by reducing the number of aircraft present on the airport surface at any time, while not starving the runway. Because some departing flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving flights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared. This is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that minimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time gap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment robust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to simulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The model is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia Airport (LGA) and a U.S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates the airport departure process with the current gate assignment and a robust gate assignment to assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The results show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate conflicts caused by gate holding compared to the current gate assignment. Therefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with gate-holding departure control to improve operations at congested airports with limited gate resources.
