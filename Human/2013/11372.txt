On 'A Kalman Filter-Based Algorithm for IMU-Camera Calibration: Observability Analysis and Performance Evaluation'

The above-mentioned work [1] in IEEE-TR'08 presented an extended Kalman filter for calibrating the misalignment between a camera and an IMU. As one of the main contributions, the locally weakly observable analysis was carried out using Lie derivatives. The seminal paper [1] is undoubtedly the cornerstone of current observability work in SLAM and a number of real SLAM systems have been developed on the observability result of this paper, such as [2, 3]. However, the main observability result of this paper [1] is founded on an incorrect proof and actually cannot be acquired using the local observability technique therein, a fact that is apparently not noticed by the SLAM community over a number of years.
