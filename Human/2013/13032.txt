A complementary construction using mutually unbiased bases

We present a construction for complementary pairs of arrays that exploits a set of mutually-unbiased bases, and enumerate these arrays as well as the corresponding set of complementary sequences obtained from the arrays by projection. We also sketch an algorithm to uniquely generate these sequences. The pairwise squared inner-product of members of the sequence set is shown to be $\frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, a subset of the set can be viewed as a codebook that asymptotically achieves $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$ times the Welch bound.
