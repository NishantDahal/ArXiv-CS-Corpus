Auditory Brain-Computer Interface Paradigm with Head Related Impulse Response-based Spatial Cues

The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive test of head related impulse response (HRIR) for an auditory spatial speller brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm. The study is conducted with six users in an experimental set up based on five Japanese hiragana vowels. Auditory evoked potentials resulted with encouragingly good and stable "aha-" or P300-responses in real-world online BCI experiments. Our case study indicated that the auditory HRIR spatial sound reproduction paradigm could be a viable alternative to the established multi-loudspeaker surround sound BCI-speller applications, as far as healthy pilot study users are concerned.
