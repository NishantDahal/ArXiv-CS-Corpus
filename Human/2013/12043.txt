Upper Bounds on the Number of Codewords of Some Separating Codes

Separating codes have their applications in collusion-secure fingerprinting for generic digital data, while they are also related to the other structures including hash family, intersection code and group testing. In this paper we study upper bounds for separating codes. First, some new upper bound for restricted separating codes is proposed. Then we illustrate that the Upper Bound Conjecture for separating Reed-Solomon codes inherited from Silverberg's question holds true for almost all Reed-Solomon codes.
