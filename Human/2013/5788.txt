Choose Outsiders First: a mean 2-approximation random algorithm for covering problems

A high number of discrete optimization problems, including Vertex Cover, Set Cover or Feedback Vertex Set, can be unified into the class of covering problems. Several of them were shown to be inapproximable by deterministic algorithms. This article proposes a new random approach, called Choose Outsiders First, which consists in selecting randomly ele- ments which are excluded from the cover. We show that this approach leads to random outputs which mean size is at most twice the optimal solution.
