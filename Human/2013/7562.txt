Effective System for Simulating Dust Continuum Observations on Distributed Computing Resources

We present an effective system for simulating dust continuum observations by radiative transfer simulations. By using workflow management system RENKEI-WFT, we utilized distributed computing resources and automated a sequence of computational tasks required for radiative transfer modeling, namely, main radiative transfer simulations, pre-/post-processes, and data transfer between computing resources. Our system simultaneously executes a lot of radiative transfer simulations with different input parameters on distributed computing resources. This capability of our system enables us to conduct effective research by radiative transfer simulation. As a demonstration of our system, we simulated dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disk. We performed hydrodynamic simulation modeling photoevaporating protoplanetary disk irradiated by ultra violet radiation from nearby massive stars. Results of this hydrodynamic simulation were used as input data for radiative transfer simulations. Expected spectral energy distributions and intensity maps were obtained by our system.
