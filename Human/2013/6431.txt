Enhancement of a Novel Method for Mutational Disease Prediction using Bioinformatics Techniques and Backpropagation Algorithm

The noval method for mutational disease prediction using bioinformatics tools and datasets for diagnosis the malignant mutations with powerful Artificial Neural Network (Backpropagation Network) for classifying these malignant mutations are related to gene(s) (like BRCA1 and BRCA2) cause a disease (breast cancer). This noval method did not take in consideration just like adopted for dealing, analyzing and treat the gene sequences for extracting useful information from the sequence, also exceeded the environment factors which play important roles in deciding and calculating some of genes features in order to view its functional parts and relations to diseases. This paper is proposed an enhancement of a novel method as a first way for diagnosis and prediction the disease by mutations considering and introducing multi other features show the alternations, changes in the environment as well as genes, comparing sequences to gain information about the structure or function of a query sequence, also proposing optimal and more accurate system for classification and dealing with specific disorder using backpropagation with mean square rate 0.000000001.
