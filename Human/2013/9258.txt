A Calibration Algorithm for Microelectromechanical Systems Accelerometers in Inertial Navigation Sensors

In the present work we develop an algorithm for calibrating MEMS sensors, which accounts for the nonorthogonality of the accelerometers' axis, as well as for the constant bias and scaling errors. We derive an explicit formula for computing the calibrated acceleration, given data from the sensors. We also study the error, that is caused by the nonorthogonality of the axis.
