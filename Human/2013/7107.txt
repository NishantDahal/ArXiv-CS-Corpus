Memcapacitive neural networks

We show that memcapacitive (memory capacitive) systems can be used as synapses in artificial neural networks. As an example of our approach, we discuss the architecture of an integrate-and-fire neural network based on memcapacitive synapses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spike-timing-dependent plasticity can be simply realized with some of these devices. Memcapacitive synapses are a low-energy alternative to memristive synapses for neuromorphic computation.
