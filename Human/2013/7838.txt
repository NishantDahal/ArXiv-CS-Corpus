Mapping EINS -- An exercise in mapping the Network of Excellence in Internet Science

This paper demonstrates the application of bibliometric mapping techniques in the area of funded research networks. We discuss how science maps can be used to facilitate communication inside newly formed communities, but also to account for their activities to funding agencies. We present the mapping of EINS as case -- an FP7 funded Network of Excellence. Finally, we discuss how these techniques can be used to serve as knowledge maps for interdisciplinary working experts.
