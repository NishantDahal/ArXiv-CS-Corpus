Classification of Angle-Symmetric 6R Linkage

In this paper, we consider a special kind of overconstrained 6R closed linkages which we call angle-symmetric 6R linkages. These are linkages with the property that the rotation angles are equal for each of the three pairs of opposite joints. We give a classification of these linkages. It turns that there are three types. First, we have the linkages with line symmetry. The second type is new. The third type is related to cubic motion polynomials.
