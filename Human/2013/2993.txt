Medical Process Modeling: an Artifact-Centric Approach

In this position paper we argue that just as traditional business process modeling has been adopted to deal with clinical pathways, also the artifact-centric process modeling technique may be successfully used to model various kinds of medical processes: physiological processes, disease behavior and treatment processes. We also discuss how a proposed approach may be used to deal with an interplay of all the processes a patient is subject to and what are the queries that might be imposed over an overall patient model.
