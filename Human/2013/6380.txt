Image segmentation by optimal and hierarchical piecewise constant approximations

Piecewise constant image approximations of sequential number of segments or clusters of disconnected pixels are treated. The method of majorizing of optimal approximation sequence by hierarchical sequence of image approximations is proposed. A generalization for multidimensional case of color and multispectral images is foreseen.
