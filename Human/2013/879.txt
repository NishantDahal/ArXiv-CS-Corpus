Constacyclic Codes over Finite Fields

An equivalence relation called isometry is introduced to classify constacyclic codes over a finite field; the polynomial generators of constacyclic codes of length $\ell^tp^s$ are characterized, where $p$ is the characteristic of the finite field and $\ell$ is a prime different from $p$.
