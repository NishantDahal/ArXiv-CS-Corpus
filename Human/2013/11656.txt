Proactive bottleneck performance analysis in parallel computing using openMP

The aim of parallel computing is to increase an application performance by executing the application on multiple processors. OpenMP is an API that supports multi platform shared memory programming model and shared-memory programs are typically executed by multiple threads. The use of multi threading can enhance the performance of application but its excessive use can degrade the performance. This paper describes a novel approach to avoid bottlenecks in application and provide some techniques to improve performance in OpenMP application. This paper analyzes bottleneck performance as bottleneck inhibits performance. Performance of multi threaded applications is limited by a variety of bottlenecks, e.g. critical sections, barriers and so on. This paper provides some tips how to avoid performance bottleneck problems. This paper focuses on how to reduce overheads and overall execution time to get better performance of application.
