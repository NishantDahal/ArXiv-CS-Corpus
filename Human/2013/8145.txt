Affordable Virtual Reality System Architecture for Representation of Implicit Object Properties

A flexible, scalable and affordable virtual reality software system architecture is proposed. This solution can be easily implemented on different hardware configurations: on a single computer or on a computer cluster. The architecture is aimed to be integrated in the workflow for solving engineering tasks and oriented towards presenting implicit object properties through multiple sensorial channels (visual, audio and haptic). Implicit properties represent hidden object features (i.e. magnetization, radiation, humidity, toxicity, etc.) which cannot be perceived by the observer through his or her senses but require specialized equipment in order to expand the sensory ability of the observer. Our approach extends the underlying general scene graph structure incorporating additional effects nodes for implicit properties representation.
