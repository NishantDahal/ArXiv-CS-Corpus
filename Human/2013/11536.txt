Proceedings 1st Workshop on Advances in Systems of Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of the first workshop on Advances in Systems of Systems (AISOS'13), held in Roma, Italy, March 16.  System-of-Systems describes the large scale integration of many independent self-contained systems to satisfy global needs or multi-system requests. Examples are smart grid, intelligent buildings, smart cities, transport systems, etc. There is a need for new modeling formalisms, analysis methods and tools to help make trade-off decisions during design and evolution avoiding leading to sub-optimal design and rework during integration and in service. The workshop should focus on the modeling and analysis of System of Systems. AISOS'13 aims to gather people from different communities in order to encourage exchange of methods and views.
