Infrastructure to Vehicle Real Time Secured Communication

Among civilian communication systems, vehicular networks emerge as one of the most is convincing and yet most challenging instantiations of the mobile ad hoc networking technology. Towards the deployment of vehicular communication systems, security and privacy are critical factors and significant challenges to be met. This Vehicular communication (VC) system has the potential to improve road safety and driving comfort. Nevertheless, securing the operation is a prerequisite for deployment so in this paper we are focusing on real time experimental design of infrastructure to vehicle communication. We outline how VANET will be a better option than GPS technology. We also try to discuss IP address passing using DHCP in the network and the security issues.
