New Approach of Estimating PSNR-B For De-blocked Images

Measurement of image quality is very crucial to many image processing applications. Quality metrics are used to measure the quality of improvement in the images after they are processed and compared with the original images. Compression is one of the applications where it is required to monitor the quality of decompressed or decoded image. JPEG compression is the lossy compression which is most prevalent technique for image codecs. But it suffers from blocking artifacts. Various deblocking filters are used to reduce blocking artifacts. The efficiency of deblocking filters which improves visual signals degraded by blocking artifacts from compression will also be studied. Objective quality metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and PSNRB for analyzing the quality of deblocked images will be studied. We introduce a new approach of PSNR-B for analyzing quality of deblocked images. Simulation results show that new approach of PSNR-B called modified PSNR-B. it gives even better results compared to existing well known blockiness specific indices
