Attaining High-performing Software Teams with Agile and Lean Practices: An Empirical Case Study

This paper presents an empirical study on how self- organized software teams could attain high performance using agile and lean practices. In particular, the paper qualitatively examines characteristics of high performance and self- organization in one project team. The case under study is a customer-driven student project, carried out to develop an alpha-version prototype. The paper also studies how certain agile software practices aid in initialising self-organization in the team. The main results indicate that self-organization as supported by certain Agile and Lean practices helps teams in achieving higher performance.
