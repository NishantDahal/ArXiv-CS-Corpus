Outer Bounds for Multiterminal Source Coding via a Strong Data Processing Inequality

An intuitive outer bound for the multiterminal source coding problem is given. The proposed bound explicitly couples the rate distortion functions for each source and correlation measures which derive from a "strong" data processing inequality. Unlike many standard outer bounds, the proposed bound is not parameterized by a continuous family of auxiliary random variables, but instead only requires maximizing two ratios of divergences which do not depend on the distortion functions under consideration.
