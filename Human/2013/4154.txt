Hands-free Evolution of 3D-printable Objects via Eye Tracking

Interactive evolution has shown the potential to create amazing and complex forms in both 2-D and 3-D settings. However, the algorithm is slow and users quickly become fatigued. We propose that the use of eye tracking for interactive evolution systems will both reduce user fatigue and improve evolutionary success. We describe a systematic method for testing the hypothesis that eye tracking driven interactive evolution will be a more successful and easier-to-use design method than traditional interactive evolution methods driven by mouse clicks. We provide preliminary results that support the possibility of this proposal, and lay out future work to investigate these advantages in extensive clinical trials.
