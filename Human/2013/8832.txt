Convolutional Codes Derived From Group Character Codes

New families of unit memory as well as multi-memory convolutional codes are constructed algebraically in this paper. These convolutional codes are derived from the class of group character codes. The proposed codes have basic generator matrices, consequently, they are non catastrophic. Additionally, the new code parameters are better than the ones available in the literature.
