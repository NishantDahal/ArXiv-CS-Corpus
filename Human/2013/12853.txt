Yao's millionaires' problem and decoy-based public key encryption by classical physics

We use various laws of classical physics to offer several solutions of Yao's millionaires' problem without using any one-way functions. We also describe several informationally secure public key encryption protocols, i.e., protocols secure against passive computationally unbounded adversary. This introduces a new paradigm of decoy-based cryptography, as opposed to "traditional" complexity-based cryptography. In particular, our protocols do not employ any one-way functions.
