General Quantum Hilbert Space Modeling Scheme for Entanglement

We work out a classification scheme for quantum modeling in Hilbert space of any kind of composite entity violating Bell's inequalities and exhibiting entanglement. Our theoretical framework includes situations with entangled states and product measurements ('customary quantum situation'), and also situations with both entangled states and entangled measurements ('nonlocal box situation', 'nonlocal non-marginal box situation'). We show that entanglement is structurally a joint property of states and measurements. Furthermore, entangled measurements enable quantum modeling of situations that are usually believed to be 'beyond quantum'. Our results are also extended from pure states to quantum mixtures.
