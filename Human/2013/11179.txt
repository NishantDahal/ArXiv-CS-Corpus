A Class of Orthogonal Sequences

This paper presents a class of random orthogonal sequences associated with the number theoretic Hilbert transform. We present a constructive procedure for finding the random sequences for different modulus values. These random sequences have autocorrelation function that is zero everywhere excepting at the origin. These sequences may be used as keys and in other cryptography applications.
