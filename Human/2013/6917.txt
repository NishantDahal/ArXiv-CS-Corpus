Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Collaborative Innovation Networks COINs13, Santiago de Chile, August 11-13, 2013

Where science, design, business and art meet, COINs13 looks at the emerging forces behind the phenomena of open-source, creative, entrepreneurial and social movements. COINs13 combines a wide range of interdisciplinary fields such as social network analysis, group dynamics, design and visualization, information systems, collective action and the psychology and sociality of collaboration. The COINs13 conference theme is Learning from the Swarm. The papers in this volume explore what is relevant with regard to the innovative powers of creative and civic swarms, what are the observable qualities of virtual collaboration and mobilization, and how does the quest for global cooperation affect local networks.
