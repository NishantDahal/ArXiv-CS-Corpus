Performances of Low Temperature Radiant Heating Systems

Low temperature heating panel systems offer distinctive advantages in terms of thermal comfort and energy consumption, allowing work with low exergy sources. The purpose of this paper is to compare floor, wall, ceiling, and floor-ceiling panel heating systems in terms of energy, exergy and CO2 emissions. Simulation results for each of the analyzed panel system are given by its energy (the consumption of gas for heating, electricity for pumps and primary energy) and exergy consumption, the price of heating, and its carbon dioxide emission. Then, the values of the air temperatures of rooms are investigated and that of the surrounding walls and floors. It is found that the floor-ceiling heating system has the lowest energy, exergy, CO2 emissions, operating costs, and uses boiler of the lowest power. The worst system by all these parameters is the classical ceiling heating
