An electronic digital combination lock: A precise and reliable security system

The increasing rate of crime, attacks by thieves, intruders and vandals, despite all forms of security gadgets and locks still need the attention of researchers to find a permanent solution to the well being of lives and properties of individuals. To this end, we design a cheap and effective security system for buildings, cars, safes, doors and gates, so as to prevent unauthorized person from having access to ones properties through the use of codes, we therefore experiment the application of electronic devices as locks. However, a modular approach was employed in the design in which the combination lock was divided into units and each unit designed separately before being coupled to form a whole functional system. During the design, we conducted Twenty tests with the first eight combinations being four in number, the next seven tests being five and the last five combinations being six. This was done because of the incorporation of 2 dummy switches in the combinations. From the result obtained, combinations 8, 11, 13 gave the correct output combination. However, 8 being the actual combination gave the required output. The general operation of the system and performance is dependent on the key combinations. The overall system was constructed and tested and it works perfectly.
