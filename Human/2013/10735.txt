Touch-enabled Programming for the Lab of Things

Lab of Things (LoT, lab-of-things.com) is a research platform for interconnection, programming, and large scale deployment of devices and sensors. These devices and sensors can then be used for deployment of field studies in a variety of research areas including elderly care, energy management, and the like. LoT is built on top of HomeOS, a middle-ware component, making interconnection of a wide range of devices possible. LoT also provides cloud storage and remote monitoring capabilities. Traditionally programming on the LoT platform has been done using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio. While LoT programs developed on the .NET framework offer a rich set of functionality, writing programs on LoT can be challenging for developers who are not experienced with the technology involved. In this demonstration, we introduce an innovative programming approach on the LoT platform by building a Generic Application and creating corresponding libraries on the user-friendly TouchDevelop (touchdevelop.com) programming environment. As an example, we implemented the same functionality of the Lab of Things Alerts application using the new Generic App. In addition to a touch-enabled programming environment, the new approach also significantly saves time and effort developers have to devote when creating a customized Lab of Things application.
