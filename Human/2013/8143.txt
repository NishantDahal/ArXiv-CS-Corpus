Post-processing of Engineering Analysis Results for Visualization in VR Systems

The applicability of Virtual Reality for evaluating engineering analysis results is beginning to receive increased appreciation in the last years. The problem many engineers are still facing is how to import their model together with the analysis results in a virtual reality environment for exploration and results validation. In this paper we propose an algorithm for transforming model data and results from finite element analysis (FEA) solving application to a format easily interpretable by a virtual reality application. The algorithm includes also steps for reducing the face-count of the resulting mesh by eliminating faces from the inner part of the model in the cases when only the surfaces of the model is analyzed. We also describe a possibility for simultaneously assessing multiple analysis results relying on multimodal results presentation by stimulating different senses of the operator.
