The Optimal Mechanism in Differential Privacy

We derive the optimal $ε$-differentially private mechanism for single real-valued query function under a very general utility-maximization (or cost-minimization) framework. The class of noise probability distributions in the optimal mechanism has {\em staircase-shaped} probability density functions which are symmetric (around the origin), monotonically decreasing and geometrically decaying. The staircase mechanism can be viewed as a {\em geometric mixture of uniform probability distributions}, providing a simple algorithmic description for the mechanism. Furthermore, the staircase mechanism naturally generalizes to discrete query output settings as well as more abstract settings. We explicitly derive the optimal noise probability distributions with minimum expectation of noise amplitude and power. Comparing the optimal performances with those of the Laplacian mechanism, we show that in the high privacy regime ($ε$ is small), Laplacian mechanism is asymptotically optimal as $ε\to 0$; in the low privacy regime ($ε$ is large), the minimum expectation of noise amplitude and minimum noise power are $Θ(Δe^{-\fracε{2}})$ and $Θ(Δ^2 e^{-\frac{2ε}{3}})$ as $ε\to +\infty$, while the expectation of noise amplitude and power using the Laplacian mechanism are $\fracΔε$ and $\frac{2Δ^2}{ε^2}$, where $Δ$ is the sensitivity of the query function. We conclude that the gains are more pronounced in the low privacy regime.
