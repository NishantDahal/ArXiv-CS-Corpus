Interaction Nets in Russian

Draft translation to Russian of Chapter 7, Interaction-Based Models of Computation, from Models of Computation: An Introduction to Computability Theory by Maribel Fernandez. "In this chapter, we study interaction nets, a model of computation that can be seen as a representative of a class of models based on the notion of 'computation as interaction'. Interaction nets are a graphical model of computation devised by Yves Lafont in 1990 as a generalisation of the proof structures of linear logic. It can be seen as an abstract formalism, used to define algorithms and analyse their cost, or as a low-level language into which other programming languages can be compiled. This is fruitful because interaction nets can be implemented with reasonable efficiency."
