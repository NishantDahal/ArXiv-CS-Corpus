Creative Telescoping for Holonomic Functions

The aim of this article is twofold: on the one hand it is intended to serve as a gentle introduction to the topic of creative telescoping, from a practical point of view; for this purpose its application to several problems is exemplified. On the other hand, this chapter has the flavour of a survey article: the developments in this area during the last two decades are sketched and a selection of references is compiled in order to highlight the impact of creative telescoping in numerous contexts.
