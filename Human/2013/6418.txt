Analytical Coexistence Benchmark for Assessing the Utmost Interference Tolerated by IEEE 802.20

Whether it is crosstalk, harmonics, or in-band operation of wireless technologies, interference between a reference system and a host of offenders is virtually unavoidable. In past contributions, a benchmark has been established and considered for coexistence analysis with a number of technologies including FWA, UMTS, and WiMAX. However, the previously presented model does not take into account the mobility factor of the reference node in addition to a number of interdependent requirements regarding the link direction, channel state, data rate and system factors; hence limiting its applicability for the MBWA (IEEE 802.20) standard. Thus, over diverse modes, in this correspondence we analytically derived the greatest aggregate interference level tolerated for high-fidelity transmission tailored specifically for the MBWA standard. Our results, in the form of benchmark indicators, should be of particular interest to peers analyzing and researching RF coexistence scenarios with this new protocol.
