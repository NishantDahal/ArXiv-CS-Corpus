TwitterCrowds: Techniques for Exploring Topic and Sentiment in Microblogging Data

Analysts and social scientists in the humanities and industry require techniques to help visualize large quantities of microblogging data. Methods for the automated analysis of large scale social media data (on the order of tens of millions of tweets) are widely available, but few visualization techniques exist to support interactive exploration of the results. In this paper, we present extended descriptions of ThemeCrowds and SentireCrowds, two tag-based visualization techniques for this data. We subsequently introduce a new list equivalent for both of these techniques and present a number of case studies showing them in operation. Finally, we present a formal user study to evaluate the effectiveness of these list interface equivalents when comparing them to ThemeCrowds and SentireCrowds. We find that discovering topics associated with areas of strong positive or negative sentiment is faster when using a list interface. In terms of user preference, multilevel tag clouds were found to be more enjoyable to use. Despite both interfaces being usable for all tested tasks, we have evidence to support that list interfaces can be more efficient for tasks when an appropriate ordering is known beforehand.
