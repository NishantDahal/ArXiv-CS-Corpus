Noninterference with Local Policies

We develop a theory for state-based noninterference in a setting where different security policies---we call them local policies---apply in different parts of a given system. Our theory comprises appropriate security definitions, characterizations of these definitions, for instance in terms of unwindings, algorithms for analyzing the security of systems with local policies, and corresponding complexity results.
