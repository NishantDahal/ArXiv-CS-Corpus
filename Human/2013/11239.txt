Linking Software Development and Business Strategy Through Measurement

Most of today's products and services are software-based. Organizations that develop software want to maintain and improve their competitiveness by controlling software-related risks. To do this, they need to align their business goals with software development strategies and translate them into quantitative project management. There is also an increasing need to justify cost and resources for software and system development and other IT services by demonstrating their impact on an organisation's higher-level goals. For both, linking business goals and software-related efforts in an organization is necessary. However, this is a challenging task, and there is a lack of methods addressing this gap. The GQM+Strategies approach effectively links goals and strategies on all levels of an organization by means of goal-oriented measurement. The approach is based on rationales for deciding about options when operationalizing goals and for evaluating the success of strategies with respect to goals.
