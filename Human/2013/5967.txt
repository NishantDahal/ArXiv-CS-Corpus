Playing cooperatively with possibly treacherous partner

We investigate an alternative concept of Nash equilibrium, m-equilibrium, which slightly resembles Harsanyi-Selten risk dominant equilibrium although it is a different notion. M-equilibria provide nontrivial solutions of normal form games as shown by comparison of the Prisoner's Dilemma with the Traveler's Dilemma. They are also resistant on the deep iterated elimination of dominated strategies.
