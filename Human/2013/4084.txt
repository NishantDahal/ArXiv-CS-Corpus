Enacting Social Argumentative Machines in Semantic Wikipedia

This research advocates the idea of combining argumentation theory with the social web technology, aiming to enact large scale or mass argumentation. The proposed framework allows mass-collaborative editing of structured arguments in the style of semantic wikipedia. The long term goal is to apply the abstract machinery of argumentation theory to more practical applications based on human generated arguments, such as deliberative democracy, business negotiation, or self-care. The ARGNET system was developed based on ther Semantic MediaWiki framework and on the Argument Interchange Format (AIF) ontology.
