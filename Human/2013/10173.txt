Ceteris Paribus Structure in Logics of Game Forms

The article introduces a ceteris paribus modal logic interpreted on the equivalence classes induced by sets of propositional atoms. This logic is used to embed two logics of agency and games, namely atemporal STIT and the coalition logic of propositional control (CL-PC). The embeddings highlight a common ceteris paribus structure underpinning the key modal operators of both logics, they clarify the relationship between STIT and CL-PC, and enable the transfer of complexity results to the ceteris paribus logic.
