Brain MRI Segmentation with Fast and Globally Convex Multiphase Active Contours

Multiphase active contour based models are useful in identifying multiple regions with different characteristics such as the mean values of regions. This is relevant in brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs), allowing the differentiation of white matter against gray matter. We consider a well defined globally convex formulation of Vese and Chan multiphase active contour model for segmenting brain MRI images. A well-established theory and an efficient dual minimization scheme are thoroughly described which guarantees optimal solutions and provides stable segmentations. Moreover, under the dual minimization implementation our model perfectly describes disjoint regions by avoiding local minima solutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach provides better accuracy than other related multiphase active contour algorithms even under severe noise, intensity inhomogeneities, and partial volume effects.
