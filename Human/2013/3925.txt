A bibliometric index based on the complete list of cited publications

We propose a new index, the $j$-index, which is defined for an author as the sum of the square roots of the numbers of citations to each of the author's publications. The idea behind the $j$-index it to remedy a drawback of the $h$-index $-$ that the $h$-index does not take into account the full citation record of a researcher. The square root function is motivated by our desire to avoid the possible bias that may occur with a simple sum when an author has several very highly cited papers. We compare the $j$-index to the $h$-index, the $g$-index and the total citation count for three subject areas using several association measures.
  Our results indicate that that the association between the $j$-index and the other indices varies according to the subject area. One explanation of this variation may be due to the proportion of citations to publications of the researcher that are in the $h$-core. The $j$-index is {\em not} an $h$-index variant, and as such is intended to complement rather than necessarily replace the $h$-index and other bibliometric indicators, thus providing a more complete picture of a researcher's achievements.
