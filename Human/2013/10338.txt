Dynamic Extraction of Key Paper from the Cluster Using Variance Values of Cited Literature

When looking into recent research trends in the field of academic landscape, citation network analysis is common and automated clustering of many academic papers has been achieved by making good use of various techniques. However, specifying the features of each area identified by automated clustering or dynamically extracted key papers in each research area has not yet been achieved. In this study, therefore, we propose a method for dynamically specifying the key papers in each area identified by clustering. We will investigate variance values of the publication year of the cited literature and calculate each cited paper's importance by applying the variance values to the PageRank algorithm.
