CAPTCHA Based on Human Cognitive Factor

A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is an automatic security mechanism used to determine whether the user is a human or a malicious computer program. It is a program that generates and grades tests that are human solvable, but intends to be beyond the capabilities of current computer programs. CAPTCHA should be designed to be very easy for humans but very hard for machines. Unfortunately, the existing CAPTCHA systems while trying to maximize the difficulty for automated programs to pass tests by increasing distortion or noise have consequently, made it also very difficult for potential users. To address the issue, this paper addresses an alternative form of CAPTCHA that provides a variety of questions from mathematical, logical and general problems which only human can understand and answer correctly in a given time. The proposed framework supports diversity in choosing the questions to be answered and a user-friendly framework to the users. A user-study is also conducted to judge the performance of the developed system with different background. The study shows the efficacy of the implemented system with a good level of user satisfaction over traditional CAPTCHA available today.
