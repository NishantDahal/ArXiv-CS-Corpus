Expressando Atributos Não-Funcionais em Workflows Científicos

In this paper we present OSC, a scientific workflow specification language based on software architecture principles. In contrast with other approaches, OSC employs connectors as first-class constructs. In this way, we leverage reusability and compositionality in the workflow modeling process, specially in the configuration of mechanisms that manage non-functional attributes.
