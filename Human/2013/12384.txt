Dual Layer Textual Message Cryptosystem with Randomized Sequence of Symmetric Key

This paper introduces a new concept of textual message encryption and decryption through a pool of randomized symmetric key and the dual layer cryptosystem with the concept of visual cryptography and steganography. A textual message is converted into two image slides, and the images are encrypted through two different randomized sequences of symmetric key. The decryption is done in the reverse way. The encrypted images are decrypted by those two symmetric keys. The decrypted image slides are merged together and converted into textual message. Here the image sharing is done through the concept of visual cryptography and the textual message to image conversion is done through the concept of steganography.
