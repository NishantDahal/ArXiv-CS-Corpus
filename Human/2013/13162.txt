Repeated games of incomplete information with large sets of states

The famous theorem of R.Aumann and M.Maschler states that the sequence of values of an N-stage zero-sum game G_N with incomplete information on one side converges as N tends to infinity, and the error term is bounded by a constant divided by square root of N if the set of states K is finite. The paper deals with the case of infinite K. It turns out that for countably-supported prior distribution p with heavy tails the error term can decrease arbitrarily slowly. The slowest possible speed of the decreasing for a given p is determined in terms of entropy-like family of functionals. Our approach is based on the well-known connection between the behavior of the maximal variation of measure-valued martingales and asymptotic properties of repeated games with incomplete information.
