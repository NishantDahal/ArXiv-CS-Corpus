Model Checking Contest @ Petri Nets, Report on the 2013 edition

This document presents the results of the Model Checking Contest held at Petri Nets 2013 in Milano. This contest aimed at a fair and experimental evaluation of the performances of model checking techniques applied to Petri nets. This is the third edition after two successful editions in 2011 and 2012.
  The participating tools were compared on several examinations (state space generation and evaluation of several types of formul√¶ -- reachability, LTL, CTL for various classes of atomic propositions) run on a set of common models (Place/Transition and Symmetric Petri nets).
  After a short overview of the contest, this paper provides the raw results from the contest, model per model and examination per examination. An HTML version of this report is also provided (http://mcc.lip6.fr).
