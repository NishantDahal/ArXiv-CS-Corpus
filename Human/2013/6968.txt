Proceedings Sixth Workshop on Intersection Types and Related Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Intersection Types and Related Systems (ITRS 2012). The workshop was held in Dubrovnik (Croatia) on June 29th, 2012, affiliated to Twenty-Seventh Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2012).  The ITRS workshop aims to bring together researchers working on both the theory and practical applications of systems based on intersection types and related approaches (e.g., union types, refinement types, behavioural types, recursive types, and so on).
