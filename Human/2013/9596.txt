Fast ranking algorithm for very large data

In this paper, we propose a new ranking method inspired from previous results on the diffusion approach to solve linear equation. We describe new mathematical equations corresponding to this method and show through experimental results the potential computational gain. This ranking method is also compared to the well known PageRank model.
