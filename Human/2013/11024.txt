(Dual) Hoops Have Unique Halving

Continuous logic extends the multi-valued Lukasiewicz logic by adding a halving operator on propositions. This extension is designed to give a more satisfactory model theory for continuous structures. The semantics of these logics can be given using specialisations of algebraic structures known as hoops. As part of an investigation into the metatheory of propositional continuous logic, we were indebted to Prover9 for finding a proof of an important algebraic law.
