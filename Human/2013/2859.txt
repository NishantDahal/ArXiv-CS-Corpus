On the stretch factor of the Theta-4 graph

In this paper we show that the θ-graph with 4 cones has constant stretch factor, i.e., there is a path between any pair of vertices in this graph whose length is at most a constant times the Euclidean distance between that pair of vertices. This is the last θ-graph for which it was not known whether its stretch factor was bounded.
