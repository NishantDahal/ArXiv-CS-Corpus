Modelling of the gravity compensators in robotic manufacturing cells

The paper deals with the modeling and identification of the gravity compensators used in heavy industrial robots. The main attention is paid to the geometrical parameters identification and calibration accuracy. To reduce impact of the measurement errors, the design of calibration experiments is used. The advantages of the developed technique are illustrated by experimental results
