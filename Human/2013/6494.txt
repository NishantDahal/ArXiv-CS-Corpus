A Compact Dual Band Dielectric Resonator Antenna For Wireless Applications

This paper presents the design of a dual band rectangular Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA) coupled to narrow slot aperture that is fed by microstrip line. The fundamental TE111 mode and higher-order TE113 mode are excited with their resonant frequencies respectively. These frequencies can be controlled by changing the DRA dimensions. A dielectric resonator with high permittivity is used to miniaturize the global structure. The proposed antenna is designed to have dual band operation suitable for both DCS (1710 - 1880 MHz) and WLAN (2400 - 2484 MHz) applications. The return loss, radiation pattern and gain of the proposed antenna are evaluated. Reasonable agreement between simulation and experimental results is obtained.
