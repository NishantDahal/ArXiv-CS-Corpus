Estimating the number of disjoint edges in simple topological graphs via cylindrical drawings

A topological graph drawn on a cylinder whose base is horizontal is \emph{angularly monotone} if every vertical line intersects every edge at most once. Let $c(n)$ denote the maximum number $c$ such that every simple angularly monotone drawing of a complete graph on $n$ vertices contains at least $c$ pairwise disjoint edges. We show that for every simple complete topological graph $G$ there exists $Δ$, $0<Δ<n$, such that $G$ contains at least $\max \{\frac nΔ, c(Δ)\}$ pairwise disjoint edges. By combining our result with a result of Tóth we obtain an alternative proof for the best known lower bound of $Ω(n^\frac 13)$ on the maximum number of pairwise disjoint edges in a simple complete topological graph proved by Suk. Our proof is based on a result of Ruiz-Vargas.
