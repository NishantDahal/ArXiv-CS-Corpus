Geometric Implications of the Naive Bayes Assumption

A naive (or Idiot) Bayes network is a network with a single hypothesis node and several observations that are conditionally independent given the hypothesis.  We recently surveyed a number of members of the UAI community and discovered a general lack of understanding of the implications of the Naive Bayes assumption on the kinds of problems that can be solved by these networks.  It has long been recognized [Minsky 61] that if observations are binary, the decision surfaces in these networks are hyperplanes.  We extend this result (hyperplane separability) to Naive Bayes networks with m-ary observations.  In addition, we illustrate the effect of observation-observation dependencies on decision surfaces.  Finally, we discuss the implications of these results on knowledge acquisition and research in learning.
