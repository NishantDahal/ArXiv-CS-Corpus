A Novel Grid Based Dynamic Energy Efficient Routing Approach for Highly Dense Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

We have proposed a novel Grid Based Dynamic Energy Efficient Routing (GBDEER) approach which is aimed to construct an energy efficient path from source to destination based on grid area, where each grid will have three deferent levels of transmission power.
