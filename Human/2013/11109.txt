Optimum Tag Reading Efficiency of Multi-Packet Reception Capable RFID Readers

Maximizing the tag reading rate of a reader is one of the most important design objectives in RFID systems as the tag reading rate is inversely proportional to the time required to completely read all the tags within the reader's radio field. To this end, numerous techniques have been independently suggested so far and they can be broadly categorized into pure advancements in the link-layer tag anti-collision protocols and pure advancements in the physical-layer RF transmission/reception model. In this paper, we show by rigorous mathematical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations that how such two independent approaches can be coupled to attain the optimum tag reading efficiency in a RFID system considering a Dynamic Frame Slotted Aloha based link layer anti-collision protocol at tags and a Multi-Packet Reception capable RF reception model at the reader.
