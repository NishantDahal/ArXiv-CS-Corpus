On the Performance Potential of Speculative Execution based on Branch and Value Prediction

Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets are used to capture the dynamic behavior of an ILP processor, and discrete-event simulation is applied to assess the performance potential of predictions and speculative execution in boosting the performance of ILP processors that fetch, issue, execute and commit a large number of instructions per cycle.
