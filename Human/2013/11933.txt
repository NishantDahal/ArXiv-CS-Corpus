A Novel Lowest Density MDS Array Code

In this paper we introduce a novel MDS array code with lowest density. In contrast to existing codes, this one has no restrictions on the size or the number of erasures it can correct. It is based on a simple matrix construction involving totally nonsingular matrices. We also introduce a simple decoding algorithm based on the structure of the code.
