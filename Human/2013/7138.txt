Parallelizing Windowed Stream Joins in a Shared-Nothing Cluster

The availability of large number of processing nodes in a parallel and distributed computing environment enables sophisticated real time processing over high speed data streams, as required by many emerging applications. Sliding window stream joins are among the most important operators in a stream processing system. In this paper, we consider the issue of parallelizing a sliding window stream join operator over a shared nothing cluster. We propose a framework, based on fixed or predefined communication pattern, to distribute the join processing loads over the shared-nothing cluster. We consider various overheads while scaling over a large number of nodes, and propose solution methodologies to cope with the issues. We implement the algorithm over a cluster using a message passing system, and present the experimental results showing the effectiveness of the join processing algorithm.
