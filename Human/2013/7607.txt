A Dynamic Algorithm for the Longest Common Subsequence Problem using Ant Colony Optimization Technique

We present a dynamic algorithm for solving the Longest Common Subsequence Problem using Ant Colony Optimization Technique. The Ant Colony Optimization Technique has been applied to solve many problems in Optimization Theory, Machine Learning and Telecommunication Networks etc. In particular, application of this theory in NP-Hard Problems has a remarkable significance. Given two strings, the traditional technique for finding Longest Common Subsequence is based on Dynamic Programming which consists of creating a recurrence relation and filling a table of size . The proposed algorithm draws analogy with behavior of ant colonies function and this new computational paradigm is known as Ant System. It is a viable new approach to Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence and greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in minimum number of stages. We apply the proposed methodology to Longest Common Subsequence Problem and give the simulation results. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by efficient Computational Complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Longest Common Subsequence Problem.
