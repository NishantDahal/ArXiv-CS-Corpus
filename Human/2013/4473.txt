Multiparty Compatibility in Communicating Automata: Characterisation and Synthesis of Global Session Types

Multiparty session types are a type system that can ensure the safety and liveness of distributed peers via the global specification of their interactions. To construct a global specification from a set of distributed uncontrolled behaviours, this paper explores the problem of fully characterising multiparty session types in terms of communicating automata. We equip global and local session types with labelled transition systems (LTSs) that faithfully represent asynchronous communications through unbounded buffered channels. Using the equivalence between the two LTSs, we identify a class of communicating automata that exactly correspond to the projected local types. We exhibit an algorithm to synthesise a global type from a collection of communicating automata. The key property of our findings is the notion of multiparty compatibility which non-trivially extends the duality condition for binary session types.
