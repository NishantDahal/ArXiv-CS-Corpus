Characterizing User Behavior and Information Propagation on a Social Multimedia Network

An increasing portion of modern socializing takes place via online social networks. Members of these communities often play distinct roles that can be deduced from observations of users' online activities. One such activity is the sharing of multimedia, the popularity of which can vary dramatically. Here we discuss our initial analysis of anonymized, scraped data from consenting Facebook users, together with associated demographic and psychological profiles. We present five clusters of users with common observed online behaviors, where these users also show correlated profile characteristics. Finally, we identify some common properties of the most popular multimedia content.
