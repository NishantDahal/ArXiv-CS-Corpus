Domain-of-Attraction Estimation for Uncertain Non-polynomial Systems

In this paper, we consider the problem of computing estimates of the domain-of-attraction for non-polynomial systems. A polynomial approximation technique, based on multivariate polynomial interpolation and error analysis for remaining functions, is applied to compute an uncertain polynomial system, whose set of trajectories contains that of the original non-polynomial system. Experiments on the benchmark non-polynomial systems show that our approach gives better estimates of the domain-of-attraction.
