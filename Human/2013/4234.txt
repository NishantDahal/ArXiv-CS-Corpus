A Fuzzy Logic Based Certain Trust Model for E-Commerce

Trustworthiness especially for service oriented system is very important topic now a day in IT field of the whole world. There are many successful E-commerce organizations presently run in the whole world, but E-commerce has not reached its full potential. The main reason behind this is lack of Trust of people in e-commerce. Again, proper models are still absent for calculating trust of different e-commerce organizations. Most of the present trust models are subjective and have failed to account vagueness and ambiguity of different domain. In this paper we have proposed a new fuzzy logic based Certain Trust model which considers these ambiguity and vagueness of different domain. Fuzzy Based Certain Trust Model depends on some certain values given by experts and developers. can be applied in a system like cloud computing, internet, website, e-commerce, etc. to ensure trustworthiness of these platforms. In this paper we show, although fuzzy works with uncertainties, proposed model works with some certain values. Some experimental results and validation of the model with linguistics terms are shown at the last part of the paper.
