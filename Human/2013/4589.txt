The algorithm allows the ranking of the teams using the notions of hubs and authorities well known for ranking pages in the World Wide Web. Results of the games introduced as a graph where losing team 'gives a link' to a winning team and, if draw registered both team give links to each other. In case of a win link is weighted as three points in adjacent matrix and in case of draw as one point. Author uses notion of authority in order to define team which win a game and hub as a team which lose a game, the winner of the competition defined as the 'worst' hub, team that didn't reinforced any other team. Using this ranking system, the champion's team, which is a 'worst hub' must not lose, or draw games to other 'good authorities' teams. If by the end of the competition there are teams with an equal number of wins and losses then the team which has beaten more teams with higher authority ranks, wins.
