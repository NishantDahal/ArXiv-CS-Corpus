On the Peculiarities of Design: An Engineering Perspective

It is a fact of our existence, that no matter where we are, we most often find ourselves either hearing, seeing, talking, or even engaged in design related activities. Despite this reality, the notion of 'design', and in particular 'engineering design', is often ambiguous, and at times obscure. Thus, the transfer of knowledge of this crucial topic to engineering students engaged in practical hands-on learning or analytical research is usually perplexing to accomplish. In light of this, it becomes worthwhile to dissect and reflect on the abstraction of the design process in engineering. In fact, the aim of this article is to investigate the facets of applied design, and elaborate on its diversity, complexity and elements. Eventually, by concretizing this subject matter, we hope to slightly assist engineering students in alleviating some of the vagueness associated with the principle of design, and enhance their technical skillset during innovative conceptions.
