A heterogeneous many-core platform for experiments on scalable custom interconnects and management of fault and critical events, applied to many-process applications: Vol. II, 2012 technical report

This is the second of a planned collection of four yearly volumes describing the deployment of a heterogeneous many-core platform for experiments on scalable custom interconnects and management of fault and critical events, applied to many-process applications. This volume covers several topics, among which: 1- a system for awareness of faults and critical events (named LO|FA|MO) on experimental heterogeneous many-core hardware platforms; 2- the integration and test of the experimental hardware heterogeneous many-core platform QUoNG, based on the APEnet+ custom interconnect; 3- the design of a Software-Programmable Distributed Network Processor architecture (DNP) using ASIP technology; 4- the initial stages of design of a new DNP generation onto a 28nm FPGA. These developments were performed in the framework of the EURETILE European Project under the Grant Agreement no. 247846.
