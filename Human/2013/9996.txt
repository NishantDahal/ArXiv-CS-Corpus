Stable Restoration and Separation of Approximately Sparse Signals

This paper develops new theory and algorithms to recover signals that are approximately sparse in some general dictionary (i.e., a basis, frame, or over-/incomplete matrix) but corrupted by a combination of interference having a sparse representation in a second general dictionary and measurement noise. The algorithms and analytical recovery conditions consider varying degrees of signal and interference support-set knowledge. Particular applications covered by the proposed framework include the restoration of signals impaired by impulse noise, narrowband interference, or saturation/clipping, as well as image in-painting, super-resolution, and signal separation. Two application examples for audio and image restoration demonstrate the efficacy of the approach.
