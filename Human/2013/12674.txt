Session Types in Abelian Logic

There was a PhD student who says "I found a pair of wooden shoes.  I put a coin in the left and a key in the right.  Next morning, I found those objects in the opposite shoes."  We do not claim existence of such shoes, but propose a similar programming abstraction in the context of typed lambda calculi.  The result, which we call the Amida calculus, extends Abramsky's linear lambda calculus LF and characterizes Abelian logic.
