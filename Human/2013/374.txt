A generalisation of Nash's theorem with higher-order functionals

The recent theory of sequential games and selection functions by Mar- tin Escardo and Paulo Oliva is extended to games in which players move simultaneously. The Nash existence theorem for mixed-strategy equilibria of finite games is generalised to games defined by selection functions. A normal form construction is given which generalises the game-theoretic normal form, and its soundness is proven. Minimax strategies also gener- alise to the new class of games and are computed by the Berardi-Bezem- Coquand functional, studied in proof theory as an interpretation of the axiom of countable choice.
