A Hybrid Cryptosystem Based On Vigenere Cipher and Columnar Transposition Cipher

Privacy is one of the key issues addressed by information Security. Through cryptographic encryption methods, one can prevent a third party from understanding transmitted raw data over unsecured channel during signal transmission. The cryptographic methods for enhancing the security of digital contents have gained high significance in the current era. Breach of security and misuse of confidential information that has been intercepted by unauthorized parties are key problems that information security tries to solve. This paper sets out to contribute to the general body of knowledge in the area of classical cryptography by develop- ing a new hybrid way of encryption of plaintext. The cryptosystem performs its encryption by encrypting the plaintext using columnar transposition cipher and further using the ciphertext to encrypt the plaintext again using Vigen√®re ci- pher. At the end, cryptanalysis was performed on the ciphertext. The implementation will be done using java program- ming.
