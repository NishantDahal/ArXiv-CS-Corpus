Low Complexity Indoor Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks by UWB and Inertial Data Fusion

Precise indoor localization of moving targets is a challenging activity which cannot be easily accomplished without combining different sources of information. In this sense, the combination of different data sources with an appropriate filter might improve both positioning and tracking performance. This work proposes an algorithm for hybrid positioning in Wireless Sensor Networks based on data fusion of UWB and inertial information. A constant-gain Steady State Kalman Filter is used to bound the complexity of the system, simplifying its implementation on a typical low-power WSN node. The performance of the presented data fusion algorithm has been evaluated in a realistic scenario using both simulations and realistic datasets. The obtained results prove the validity of this approach, which efficiently fuses different positioning data sources, reducing the localization error.
