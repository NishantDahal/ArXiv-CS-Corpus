On Adaptive Energy Efficient Transmission in WSNs

One of the major challenges in design of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes to prolong lifetime of finite-capacity batteries. In this paper, we propose Energy-efficient Adaptive Scheme for Transmission (EAST) in WSNs. EAST is an IEEE 802.15.4 standard compliant. In this scheme, open-loop is used for temperature-aware link quality estimation and compensation. Whereas, closed-loop feedback process helps to divide network into three logical regions to minimize overhead of control packets. Threshold on transmitter power loss (RSSIloss) and current number of nodes (nc(t)) in each region help to adapt transmit power level (Plevel) according to link quality changes due to temperature variation. Evaluation of propose scheme is done by considering mobile sensor nodes and reference node both static and mobile. Simulation results show that propose scheme effectively adapts transmission Plevel to changing link quality with less control packets overhead and energy consumption as compared to classical approach with single region in which maximum transmitter Plevel assigned to compensate temperature variation.
