Towards slime mould colour sensor: Recognition of colours by Physarum polycephalum

Acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a popular now user-friendly living substrate for designing of future and emergent sensing and computing devices. P. polycephalum exhibits regular patterns of oscillations of its surface electrical potential. The oscillation patterns are changed when the slime mould is subjected to mechanical, chemical, electrical or optical stimuli. We evaluate feasibility of slime-mould based colour sensors by illuminating Physarum with red, green, blue and white colours and analysing patterns of the slime mould's electrical potential oscillations. We define that the slime mould recognises a colour if it reacts to illumination with the colour by a unique changes in amplitude and periods of oscillatory activity. In laboratory experiments we found that the slime mould recognises red and blue colour. The slime mould does not differentiate between green and white colours. The slime mould also recognises when red colour is switched off. We also map colours to diversity of the oscillations: illumination with a white colour increases diversity of amplitudes and periods of oscillations, other colours studied increase diversity either of amplitude or period.
