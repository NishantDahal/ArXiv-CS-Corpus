Accurate curve fits of IAPWS data for high-pressure, high-temperature single-phase liquid water based on the stiffened gas equation of state

We present a series of optimal (in the sense of least-squares) curve fits for the stiffened gas equation of state for single-phase liquid water. At high pressures and (subcritical) temperatures, the parameters produced by these curve fits are found to have very small relative errors: less than $1\%$ in the pressure model, and less than $2\%$ in the temperature model. At low pressures and temperatures, especially near the liquid-vapor transition line, the error in the curve fits increases rapidly. The smallest pressure value for which curve fits are reported in the present work is 25 MPa, high enough to ensure that the fluid remains a single-phase liquid up to the maximum subcritical temperature of approximately 647K.
