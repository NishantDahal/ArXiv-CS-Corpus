An LP-based 3/2-approximation algorithm for the graphic s-t path TSP

We design a new LP-based algorithm for the graphic $s$-$t$ path Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which achieves the best approximation factor of 1.5. The algorithm is based on the idea of narrow cuts due to An, Kleinberg, and Shmoys. It partly answers an open question of Sebő.
