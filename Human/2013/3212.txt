On the conjecture about the nonexistence of rotation symmetric bent functions

In this paper, we describe a different approach to the proof of the nonexistence of homogeneous rotation symmetric bent functions. As a result, we obtain some new results which support the conjecture made in this journal, i.e., there are no homogeneous rotation symmetric bent functions of degree >2. Also we characterize homogeneous degree 2 rotation symmetric bent functions by using GCD of polynomials.
