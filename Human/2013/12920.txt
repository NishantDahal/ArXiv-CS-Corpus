Radix Conversion for IEEE754-2008 Mixed Radix Floating-Point Arithmetic

Conversion between binary and decimal floating-point representations is ubiquitous. Floating-point radix conversion means converting both the exponent and the mantissa. We develop an atomic operation for FP radix conversion with simple straight-line algorithm, suitable for hardware design. Exponent conversion is performed with a small multiplication and a lookup table. It yields the correct result without error. Mantissa conversion uses a few multiplications and a small lookup table that is shared amongst all types of conversions. The accuracy changes by adjusting the computing precision.
