Lowering the Barrier to Reuse through Test-Driven Search

Dedicated software search engines that index open source software repositories or in-house software assets significantly enhance the chance of finding software components suitable for reuse. However, they still leave the work of evaluating and testing components to the developer. To significantly change the risk-cost-benefit tradeoff involved in software reuse, search engines need to be supported by user friendly environments that deliver code search functionality non-intrusively right to developers' fingertips.
