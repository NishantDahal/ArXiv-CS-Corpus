Ant Colony based Routing for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks towards Improved Quality of Services

Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a dynamic multihop wireless network which is established by a set of mobile nodes on a shared wireless channel. One of the major issues in MANET is routing due to the mobility of the nodes. Routing means the act of moving information across an internet work from a source to a destination. When it comes to MANET, the complexity increases due to various characteristics like dynamic topology, time varying QoS requirements, limited resources and energy etc. QoS routing plays an important role for providing QoS in wireless ad hoc networks. The most complex issue in this kind of networks is to find a path between the communication end points satisfying QoS requirement for the user. Nature-inspired algorithms (swarm intelligence) such as ant colony optimization ACO)algorithms have shown to be a good technique for developing routing algorithms for MANETs.
  In this paper, a new QoS algorithm for mobile ad hoc network has been proposed. The proposed algorithm combines the idea of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol to identify multiple stable paths between source and destination nodes.
