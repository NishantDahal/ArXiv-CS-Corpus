Introduction to computer animation and its possible educational applications

Animation, which is basically a form of pictorial presentation, has become the most prominent feature of technology-based learning environments. It refers to simulated motion pictures showing movement of drawn objects. Recently, educational computer animation has turned out to be one of the most elegant tools for presenting multimedia materials for learners, and its significance in helping to understand and remember information has greatly increased since the advent of powerful graphics-oriented computers. In this book chapter we introduce and discuss the history of computer animation, its well-known fundamental principles and some educational applications. It is however still debatable if truly educational computer animations help in learning, as the research on whether animation aids learners' understanding of dynamic phenomena has come up with positive, negative and neutral results. We have tried to provide as much detailed information on computer animation as we could, and we hope that this book chapter will be useful for students who study computer science, computer-assisted education or some other courses connected with contemporary education, as well as researchers who conduct their research in the field of computer animation.
