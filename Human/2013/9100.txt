SIED, a Data Privacy Engineering Framework

While a number of data privacy techniques have been proposed in the recent years, a few frameworks have been suggested for the implementation of the data privacy process. Most of the proposed approaches are tailored towards implementing a specific data privacy algorithm but not the overall data privacy engineering and design process. Therefore, as a contribution, this study proposes SIED (Specification, Implementation, Evaluation, and Dissemination), a conceptual framework that takes a holistic approach to the data privacy engineering procedure by looking at the specifications, implementation, evaluation, and finally, dissemination of the privatized data sets.
