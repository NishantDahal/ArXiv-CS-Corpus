Relative Entropy, Probabilistic Inference and AI

Various properties of relative entropy have led to its widespread use in information theory. These properties suggest that relative entropy has a role to play in systems that attempt to perform inference in terms of probability distributions. In this paper, I will review some basic properties of relative entropy as well as its role in probabilistic inference. I will also mention briefly a few existing and potential applications of relative entropy to so-called artificial intelligence (AI).
