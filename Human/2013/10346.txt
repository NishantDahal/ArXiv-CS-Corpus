Implementing Computations in Automaton (Semi)groups

We consider the growth, order, and finiteness problems for automaton (semi)groups. We propose new implementations and compare them with the existing ones. As a result of extensive experimentations, we propose some conjectures on the order of finite automaton (semi)groups.
