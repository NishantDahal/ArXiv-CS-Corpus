Optimized Parallel Transmission in Elastic Optical Networks to Support High-Speed Ethernet

The need for optical parallelization is driven by the imminent optical capacity crunch, where the spectral efficiency required in the coming decades will be beyond the Shannon limit. To this end, the emerging high-speed Ethernet services at 100 Gbps, have already standardized options to utilize parallel optics to parallelize interfaces referred to as Multi-lane Distribution (MLD). OFDM-based optical network is a promising transmission option towards the goal of Ethernet parallelization. It can allocate optical resource tailored for a variety of bandwidth requirements and that in a fundamentally parallel fashion with each sub-carrier utilizing a frequency slot at a lower rate than if serial transmission was used. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel transmission framework designed for elastic (OFDM-based) optical networks to support high-speed Ethernet services, in-line with IEEE and ITU-T standards. We formulate an ILP optimization model based on integer linear programming, with consideration of various constraints, including spectrum fragmentation, differential delay and guard-band constraints. We also propose a heuristic algorithm which can be applied when the optimization model becomes intractable. The numerical results show the effectiveness and high suitability of elastic optical networks to support parallel transmission in high-speed Ethernet. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the parallel transmission in elastic optical networks to support standardized high-speed Ethernet.
