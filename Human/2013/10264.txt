Ship Detection and Segmentation using Image Correlation

There have been intensive research interests in ship detection and segmentation due to high demands on a wide range of civil applications in the last two decades. However, existing approaches, which are mainly based on statistical properties of images, fail to detect smaller ships and boats. Specifically, known techniques are not robust enough in view of inevitable small geometric and photometric changes in images consisting of ships. In this paper a novel approach for ship detection is proposed based on correlation of maritime images. The idea comes from the observation that a fine pattern of the sea surface changes considerably from time to time whereas the ship appearance basically keeps unchanged. We want to examine whether the images have a common unaltered part, a ship in this case. To this end, we developed a method - Focused Correlation (FC) to achieve robustness to geometric distortions of the image content. Various experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
