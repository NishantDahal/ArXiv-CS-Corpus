New Results on the Number Theoretic Hilbert Transform

This paper presents new results in the theory of number theoretic Hilbert (NHT) transforms. New polymorphic solutions have been found for the 14-point and 16-point transforms. Several transform pairs are computed and solutions found for which the sequence and the transform have the same shape. The multiplicity of solutions for the same moduli increases their applicability to cryptography.
