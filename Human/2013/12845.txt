Design and Analysis of an Estimation of Distribution Approximation Algorithm for Single Machine Scheduling in Uncertain Environments

In the current work we introduce a novel estimation of distribution algorithm to tackle a hard combinatorial optimization problem, namely the single-machine scheduling problem, with uncertain delivery times. The majority of the existing research coping with optimization problems in uncertain environment aims at finding a single sufficiently robust solution so that random noise and unpredictable circumstances would have the least possible detrimental effect on the quality of the solution. The measures of robustness are usually based on various kinds of empirically designed averaging techniques. In contrast to the previous work, our algorithm aims at finding a collection of robust schedules that allow for a more informative decision making. The notion of robustness is measured quantitatively in terms of the classical mathematical notion of a norm on a vector space. We provide a theoretical insight into the relationship between the properties of the probability distribution over the uncertain delivery times and the robustness quality of the schedules produced by the algorithm after a polynomial runtime in terms of approximation ratios.
