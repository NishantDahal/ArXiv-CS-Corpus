Changing the Environment based on Intrinsic Motivation

One of the remarkable feats of intelligent life is that it restructures the world it lives in for its own benefit. This extended abstract outlines how the information-theoretic principle of empowerment, as an intrinsic motivation, can be used to restructure the environment an agent lives in. We present a first qualitative evaluation of how an agent in a 3d-gridworld builds a staircase-like structure, which reflects the agent's embodiment.
