Medical Information Embedding in Compressed Watermarked Intravascular Ultrasound Video

In medical field, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a tomographic imaging modality, which can identify the boundaries of different layers of blood vessels. IVUS can detect myocardial infarction (heart attack) that remains ignored and unattended when only angioplasty is done. During the past decade, it became easier for some individuals or groups to copy and transmits digital information without the permission of the owner. For increasing authentication and security of copyrights, digital watermarking, an information hiding technique, was introduced. Achieving watermarking technique with lesser amount of distortion in biomedical data is a challenging task. Watermark can be embedded into an image or in a video. As video data is a huge amount of information, therefore a large storage area is needed which is not feasible. In this case motion vector based video compression is done to reduce size. In this present paper, an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) is embedded as watermark within an IVUS video and then motion vector is calculated. This proposed method proves robustness as the extracted watermark has good PSNR value and less MSE.
