Probabilistic bisimilarities between quantum processes

Modeling and reasoning about concurrent quantum systems is very important both for distributed quantum computing and for quantum protocol verification. As a consequence, a general framework describing formally the communication and concurrency in complex quantum systems is necessary. For this purpose, we propose a model qCCS which is a natural quantum extension of classical value-passing CCS with the input and output of quantum states, and unitary transformations and measurements on quantum systems. The operational semantics of qCCS is given based on probabilistic labeled transition system. This semantics has many different features compared with the proposals in literature in order to describe input and output of quantum systems which are possibly correlated with other components. Based on this operational semantics, we introduce the notions of strong probabilistic bisimilarity and weak probabilistic bisimilarity between quantum processes and discuss some properties of them, such as congruence under various combinators.
