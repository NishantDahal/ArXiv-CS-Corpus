Steganography using the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)

We present here the first work to propose different mechanisms for hiding data in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). This is a very popular instant messaging protocol used by many messaging platforms such as Google Talk, Cisco, LiveJournal and many others. Our paper describes how to send a secret message from one XMPP client to another, without raising the suspicion of any intermediaries. The methods described primarily focus on using the underlying protocol as a means for steganography, unlike other related works that try to hide data in the content of instant messages. In doing so, we provide a more robust means of data hiding and additionally offer some preliminary analysis of its general security, in particular against entropic-based steganalysis.
