Post-Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Learning and Nonmonotonic Reasoning

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning and Machine Learning are two important fields in AI. Nonmonotonic logic programming (NMLP) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) provide formal languages for representing and reasoning with commonsense knowledge and realize declarative problem solving in AI. On the other side, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) realizes Machine Learning in logic programming, which provides a formal background to inductive learning and the techniques have been applied to the fields of relational learning and data mining. Generally speaking, NMLP and ASP realize nonmonotonic reasoning while lack the ability of learning. By contrast, ILP realizes inductive learning while most techniques have been developed under the classical monotonic logic. With this background, some researchers attempt to combine techniques in the context of nonmonotonic ILP. Such combination will introduce a learning mechanism to programs and would exploit new applications on the NMLP side, while on the ILP side it will extend the representation language and enable us to use existing solvers. Cross-fertilization between learning and nonmonotonic reasoning can also occur in such as the use of answer set solvers for ILP, speed-up learning while running answer set solvers, learning action theories, learning transition rules in dynamical systems, abductive learning, learning biological networks with inhibition, and applications involving default and negation. This workshop is the first attempt to provide an open forum for the identification of problems and discussion of possible collaborations among researchers with complementary expertise. The workshop was held on September 15th of 2013 in Corunna, Spain. This post-proceedings contains five technical papers (out of six accepted papers) and the abstract of the invited talk by Luc De Raedt.
