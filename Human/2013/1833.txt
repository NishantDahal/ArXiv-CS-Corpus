Towards Technology Independent Strategies for SOA Implementations

Benefiting from the technology based strategies, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been able to achieve the general goals such as agility, flexibility, reusability and efficiency. Nevertheless, technical conditions alone cannot guarantee successful SOA implementations. As a valuable and necessary supplement, the space of technology independent strategies should also be explored. Through treating SOA system as an instance of organization and identifying the common ground on the similar process of SOA implementation and organization design, this paper uses existing work in organization theory area to inspire the research into technology independent strategies of SOA implementation. As a result, four preliminary strategies that can be applied to organizational area we identify to support SOA implementations. Furthermore, the novel methodology of investigating technology independent strategies for implementing SOA is revealed, which encourages interdisciplinary research across service-oriented computing and organization theory.
