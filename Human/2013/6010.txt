Partial Spreads in Random Network Coding

Following the approach by R. KÃ¶tter and F. R. Kschischang, we study network codes as families of k-dimensional linear subspaces of a vector space F_q^n, q being a prime power and F_q the finite field with q elements. In particular, following an idea in finite projective geometry, we introduce a class of network codes which we call "partial spread codes". Partial spread codes naturally generalize spread codes. In this paper we provide an easy description of such codes in terms of matrices, discuss their maximality, and provide an efficient decoding algorithm.
