Refining Data Security in Infrastructure Networks Support of Multipath Routing

An infrastructure network is a self-organizing network with help of Access Point (AP) of wireless links connecting nodes to another. The nodes can communicate without an ad hoc. They form an uninformed topology (BSS/ESS), where the nodes play the role of routers and are free to move randomly. Infrastructure networks proved their efficiency being used in different fields but they are highly vulnerable to security attacks and dealing with this is one of the main challenges of these networks at present. In recent times some clarification are proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion avoidance in infrastructure networks. Implementing security in such dynamically changing networks is a hard task. Infrastructure network characteristics should be taken into consideration to be clever to design efficient solutions. Here we spotlight on civilizing the flow transmission privacy in infrastructure networks based on multipath routing. Certainly, we take benefit of the being of multiple paths between nodes in an infrastructure network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data with the help of Access Point. In our approach the original message to secure is split into shares through access point that are encrypted and combined then transmitted along different disjointed existing paths between sender and receiver. Even if an intruder achieve something to get one or more transmitted distribute the likelihood that the unique message will be reconstituted is very squat.
