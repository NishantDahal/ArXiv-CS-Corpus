Investigating the linear structure of Boolean functions based on Simon's period-finding quantum algorithm

It is believed that there is no efficient classical algorithm to determine the linear structure of Boolean function. We investigate an extension of Simon's period-finding quantum algorithm, and propose an efficient quantum algorithm to determine the linear structure of Boolean function.
