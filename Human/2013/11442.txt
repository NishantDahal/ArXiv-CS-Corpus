A generalized evidence distance

Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (D-S theory) is widely used in uncertain information process. The basic probability assignment(BPA) is a key element in D-S theory. How to measure the distance between two BPAs is an open issue. In this paper, a new method to measure the distance of two BPAs is proposed. The proposed method is a generalized of existing evidence distance. Numerical examples are illustrated that the proposed method can overcome the shortcomings of existing methods.
