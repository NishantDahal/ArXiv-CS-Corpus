Improving Software Developer's Competence: Is the Personal Software Process Working?

Emerging agile software development methods are people oriented development approaches to be used by the software industry. The personal software process (PSP) is an accepted method for improving the capabilities of a single software engineer. Five original hypotheses regarding the impact of the PSP to individual performance are tested. Data is obtained from 58 computer science students in three university courses on the master level, which were held in two different educational institutions in Finland and Denmark. Statistical data treatment shows that the use of PSP did not improve size and time estimation skills but that the productivity did not decrease and the resulting product quality was improved. The implications of these findings are briefly addressed.
