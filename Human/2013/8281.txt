Multirate Digital Signal Processing via Sampled-Data H-infinity Optimization

In this thesis, we present a new method for designing multirate signal processing and digital communication systems via sampled-data H-infinity control theory. The difference between our method and conventional ones is in the signal spaces. Conventional designs are executed in the discrete-time domain, while our design takes account of both the discrete-time and the continuous-time signals. Namely, our method can take account of the characteristic of the original analog signal and the influence of the A/D and D/A conversion. While the conventional method often indicates that an ideal digital low-pass filter is preferred, we show that the optimal solution need not be an ideal low-pass when the original analog signal is not completely band-limited. This fact can not be recognized only in the discrete-time domain. Moreover, we consider quantization effects. We discuss the stability and the performance of quantized sampled-data control systems. We justify H-infinity control to reduce distortion caused by the quantizer. Then we apply it to differential pulse code modulation. While the conventional Delta modulator is not optimal and besides not stable, our modulator is stable and optimal with respect to the H-infinity-norm. We also give an LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) solution to the optimal H-infinity approximation of IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters via FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters. A comparison with the Nehari shuffle is made with a numerical example, and it is observed that the LMI solution generally performs better. Another numerical study also indicates that there is a trade-off between the pass-band and stop-band approximation characteristics.
