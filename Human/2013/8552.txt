The Course Design To Develop Meta-Cognitive Skills for Collaborative Learning Through Tool-Assisted Discourse Analysis

This paper presents the course design titled "Learning Management" of which the goal is to "learn collaborative learning" for a first-year undergraduate student. The objective of the class design is to help transform the student's belief of learning from a passive, individual model to an active, collaborative model which is supported by the concept of "Knowledge Building" or "Constructive Interaction". We conducted an empirical study where the students analyzed their own discourse with KBDeX which is the software they used to assist their analysis in the experimental group whereas the students in the control group reflected their project activities in their own way. We examined the transformation of their beliefs through the qualitative analysis of their reports after the course. The results showed that the design led to the transforming of their learning beliefs from "just experiences of the participation of the collaborative learning" to "active contribution for collaborative knowledge creation". The course succeeded in changing the students' preferences about collaborative learning from negative to positive as well.
