Lensless Compressive Sensing Imaging

In this paper, we propose a lensless compressive sensing imaging architecture. The architecture consists of two components, an aperture assembly and a sensor. No lens is used. The aperture assembly consists of a two dimensional array of aperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture element is independently controllable. The sensor is a single detection element, such as a single photo-conductive cell. Each aperture element together with the sensor defines a cone of a bundle of rays, and the cones of the aperture assembly define the pixels of an image. Each pixel value of an image is the integration of the bundle of rays in a cone. The sensor is used for taking compressive measurements. Each measurement is the integration of rays in the cones modulated by the transmittance of the aperture elements. A compressive sensing matrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the individual aperture elements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The proposed architecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used. Furthermore, the sharpness of an image from our device is only limited by the resolution of the aperture assembly, but not affected by blurring due to defocus. The architecture can be used for capturing images of visible lights, and other spectra such as infrared, or millimeter waves. Such devices may be used in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or extracting features such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be used with a single aperture assembly to capture multi-view images simultaneously. A prototype was built by using a LCD panel and a photoelectric sensor for capturing images of visible spectrum.
