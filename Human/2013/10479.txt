Next Generation Cluster Editing

This work aims at improving the quality of structural variant prediction from the mapped reads of a sequenced genome. We suggest a new model based on cluster editing in weighted graphs and introduce a new heuristic algorithm that allows to solve this problem quickly and with a good approximation on the huge graphs that arise from biological datasets.
