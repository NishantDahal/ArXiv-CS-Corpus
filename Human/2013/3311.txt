A Belief-Function Based Decision Support System

In this paper, we present a decision support system based on belief functions and the pignistic transformation.  The system is an integration of an evidential system for belief function propagation and a valuation-based system for Bayesian decision analysis.  The two subsystems are connected through the pignistic transformation.  The system takes as inputs the user's "gut feelings" about a situation and suggests what, if any, are to be tested and in what order, and it does so with a user friendly interface.
