Flashmon V2: Monitoring Raw NAND Flash Memory I/O Requests on Embedded Linux

This paper presents Flashmon version 2, a tool for monitoring embedded Linux NAND flash memory I/O requests. It is designed for embedded boards based devices containing raw flash chips. Flashmon is a kernel module and stands for "flash monitor". It traces flash I/O by placing kernel probes at the NAND driver level. It allows tracing at runtime the 3 main flash operations: page reads / writes and block erasures. Flashmon is (1) generic as it was successfully tested on the three most widely used flash file systems that are JFFS2, UBIFS and YAFFS, and several NAND chip models. Moreover, it is (2) non intrusive, (3) has a controllable memory footprint, and (4) exhibits a low overhead (<6%) on the traced system. Finally, it is (5) simple to integrate and used as a standalone module or as a built-in function / module in existing kernel sources. Monitoring flash memory operations allows a better understanding of existing flash management systems by studying and analyzing their behavior. Moreover it is useful in development phase for prototyping and validating new solutions.
