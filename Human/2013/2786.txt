Object-oriented approach to Rapid Custom Instruction design

Due to continuous evolution of Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the complexity of their design and development has augmented exponentially. To deal with the ever-growing complexity of such embedded systems, we introduce, in this paper, an object-oriented approach to rapid SoC design using auto-generation of hardware custom instructions to simplify and accelerate the SoC design process. In our approach, a Data Flow Graph (DFG) is adopted as a representation of the arithmetic operation to convert it to a custom instruction. Then VHDL code will be automatically generated. The input C code is automatically updated for calling the new hardware components. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a Java source code framework named Automatic Custom Architecture generator (ACAgen) is developed. Experimental results on 3D sample application validate our approach and demonstrate how the proposed framework facilitates and accelerates the SoC design process at low costs.
