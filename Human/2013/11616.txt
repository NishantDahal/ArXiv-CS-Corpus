The Third-Order Term in the Normal Approximation for the AWGN Channel

This paper shows that, under the average error probability formalism, the third-order term in the normal approximation for the additive white Gaussian noise channel with a maximal or equal power constraint is at least $\frac{1}{2} \log n + O(1)$. This matches the upper bound derived by Polyanskiy-Poor-Verd√∫ (2010).
