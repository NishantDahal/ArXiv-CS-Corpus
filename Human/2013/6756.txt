The Hidden Structural Rules of the Discontinuous Lambek Calculus

The sequent calculus sL for the Lambek calculus L (lambek 58) has no structural rules. Interestingly, sL is equivalent to a multimodal calculus mL, which consists of the nonassociative Lambek calculus with the structural rule of associativity. This paper proves that the sequent calculus or hypersequent calculus hD of the discontinuous Lambek calculus (Morrill and Valent√≠n), which like sL has no structural rules, is also equivalent to an omega-sorted multimodal calculus mD. More concretely, we present a faithful embedding translation between mD and hD in such a way that it can be said that hD absorbs the structural rules of mD.
