Imperfect and Unmatched CSIT is Still Useful for the Frequency Correlated MISO Broadcast Channel

Since Maddah-Ali and Tse showed that the completely stale transmitter-side channel state information (CSIT) still benefits the Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of the Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC), there has been much interest in the academic literature to investigate the impact of imperfect CSIT on \emph{DoF} region of time correlated broadcast channel. Even though the research focus has been on time correlated channels so far, a similar but different problem concerns the frequency correlated channels. Indeed, the imperfect CSIT also impacts the DoF region of frequency correlated channels, as exemplified by current multi-carrier wireless systems.
  This contribution, for the first time in the literature, investigates a general frequency correlated setting where a two-antenna transmitter has imperfect knowledge of CSI of two single-antenna users on two adjacent subbands. A new scheme is derived as an integration of Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF) and the scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse. The achievable DoF region resulted by this scheme is expressed as a function of the qualities of CSIT.
