Algorithms for Self-Healing Networks

Many modern networks are \emph{reconfigurable}, in the sense that the topology of the network can be changed by the nodes in the network. For example, peer-to-peer, wireless and ad-hoc networks are reconfigurable. More generally, many social networks, such as a company's organizational chart; infrastructure networks, such as an airline's transportation network; and biological networks, such as the human brain, are also reconfigurable. Modern reconfigurable networks have a complexity unprecedented in the history of engineering, resembling more a dynamic and evolving living animal rather than a structure of steel designed from a blueprint. Unfortunately, our mathematical and algorithmic tools have not yet developed enough to handle this complexity and fully exploit the flexibility of these networks.
  We believe that it is no longer possible to build networks that are scalable and never have node failures. Instead, these networks should be able to admit small, and maybe, periodic failures and still recover like skin heals from a cut. This process, where the network can recover itself by maintaining key invariants in response to attack by a powerful adversary is what we call \emph{self-healing}.
  Here, we present several fast and provably good distributed algorithms for self-healing in reconfigurable dynamic networks. Each of these algorithms have different properties, a different set of gaurantees and limitations. We also discuss future directions and theoretical questions we would like to answer. %in the final dissertation that this document is proposed to lead to.
