Optimal Discretization of Analog Filters via Sampled-Data H-infinity Control Theory

In this article, we propose optimal discretization of analog filters (or controllers) based on the theory of sampled-data H-infinity control. We formulate the discretization problem as minimization of the H-infinity norm of the error system between a (delayed) target analog filter and a digital system including an ideal sampler, a zero-order hold, and a digital filter. The problem is reduced to discrete-time H-infinity optimization via the fast sample/hold approximation method. We also extend the proposed method to multirate systems. Feedback controller discretization by the proposed method is discussed with respect to stability. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
