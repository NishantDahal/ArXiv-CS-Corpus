The idempotent Radon--Nikodym theorem has a converse statement

Idempotent integration is an analogue of the Lebesgue integration where $σ$-additive measures are replaced by $σ$-maxitive measures. It has proved useful in many areas of mathematics such as fuzzy set theory, optimization, idempotent analysis, large deviation theory, or extreme value theory. Existence of Radon--Nikodym derivatives, which turns out to be crucial in all of these applications, was proved by Sugeno and Murofushi. Here we show a converse statement to this idempotent version of the Radon--Nikodym theorem, i.e. we characterize the $σ$-maxitive measures that have the Radon--Nikodym property.
