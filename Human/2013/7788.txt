Words with unbounded periodicity complexity

If an infinite non-periodic word is uniformly recurrent or is of bounded repetition, then the limit of its periodicity complexity is infinity. Moreover, there are uniformly recurrent words with the periodicity complexity arbitrarily high at infinitely many positions.
