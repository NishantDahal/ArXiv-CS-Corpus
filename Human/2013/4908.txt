Secure Degrees of Freedom of K-User Gaussian Interference Channels: A Unified View

We determine the exact sum secure degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of the K-user Gaussian interference channel. We consider three different secrecy constraints: 1) K-user interference channel with one external eavesdropper (IC-EE), 2) K-user interference channel with confidential messages (IC-CM), and 3) K-user interference channel with confidential messages and one external eavesdropper (IC-CM-EE). We show that for all of these three cases, the exact sum secure d.o.f. is K(K-1)/(2K-1). We show converses for IC-EE and IC-CM, which imply a converse for IC-CM-EE. We show achievability for IC-CM-EE, which implies achievability for IC-EE and IC-CM. We develop the converses by relating the channel inputs of interfering users to the reliable rates of the interfered users, and by quantifying the secrecy penalty in terms of the eavesdroppers' observations. Our achievability uses structured signaling, structured cooperative jamming, channel prefixing, and asymptotic real interference alignment. While the traditional interference alignment provides some amount of secrecy by mixing unintended signals in a smaller sub-space at every receiver, in order to attain the optimum sum secure d.o.f., we incorporate structured cooperative jamming into the achievable scheme, and intricately design the structure of all of the transmitted signals jointly.
