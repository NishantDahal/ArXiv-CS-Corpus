Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing and its Applications

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a multi-carrier modulation technique which is very much popular in new wireless networks of IEEE standard, digital television, audio broadcasting and 4G mobile communications. The main benefit of OFDM over single-carrier schemes is its ability to cope with severe channel conditions without complex equalization filters. It has improved the quality of long-distance communication by eliminating InterSymbol Interference (ISI) and improving Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR). The main drawbacks of OFDM are its high peak to average power ratio and its sensitivity to phase noise and frequency offset. This paper gives an overview of OFDM, its applications in various systems such as IEEE 802.11a, Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and Digital Broadcast Services to Handheld Devices (DVB-H) along with its advantages and disadvantages.
