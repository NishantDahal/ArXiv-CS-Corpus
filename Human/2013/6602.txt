Revisiting Circular-Based Random Node Simulation

In literature, a stochastic model for spreading nodes in a cellular cell is available. Despite its existence, the current method does not offer any versatility in dealing with sectored layers. Of course, this needed adaptability could be created synthetically through heuristic means. However, due to selective sampling, such practice dissolves the true randomness sought. Hence, in this paper, a universal exact scattering model is derived. Also, as an alternative to exhaustive simulation, a generic close-form path-loss predictor between a node and a BS is obtained. Further, using these results, an algorithm based on the superposition principle is proposed. This will ensure greater emulation flexibility, and attain a heterogeneous spatial density.
