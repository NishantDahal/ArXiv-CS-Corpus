Extended Distributed Learning Automata:A New Method for Solving Stochastic Graph Optimization Problems

In this paper, a new structure of cooperative learning automata so-called extended learning automata (eDLA) is introduced. Based on the proposed structure, a new iterative randomized heuristic algorithm for finding optimal sub-graph in a stochastic edge-weighted graph through sampling is proposed. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm based on new networked-structure can be to solve the optimization problems on stochastic graph through less number of sampling in compare to standard sampling. Stochastic graphs are graphs in which the edges have an unknown distribution probability weights. Proposed algorithm uses an eDLA to find a policy that leads to an induced sub-graph that satisfies some restrictions such as minimum or maximum weight (length). At each stage of the proposed algorithm, eDLA determines which edges to be sampled. This eDLA-based proposed sampling method may result in decreasing unnecessary samples and hence decreasing the time that algorithm requires for finding the optimal sub-graph. It has been shown that proposed method converge to optimal solution, furthermore the probability of this convergence can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by using a sufficiently small learning rate. A new variance-aware threshold value was proposed that can be improving significantly convergence rate of the proposed eDLA-based algorithm. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm is competitive in terms of the quality of the solution
