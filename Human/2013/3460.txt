A Newer User Authentication, File encryption and Distributed Server Based Cloud Computing Security Architecture

The cloud computing platform gives people the opportunity for sharing resources, services and information among the people of the whole world. In private cloud system, information is shared among the persons who are in that cloud. For this, security or personal information hiding process hampers. In this paper we have proposed new security architecture for cloud computing platform. This ensures secure communication system and hiding information from others. AES based file encryption system and asynchronous key system for exchanging information or data is included in this model. This structure can be easily applied with main cloud computing features, e.g. PaaS, SaaS and IaaS. This model also includes onetime password system for user authentication process. Our work mainly deals with the security system of the whole cloud computing platform.
