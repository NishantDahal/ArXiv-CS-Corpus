Metric Dimension for Gabriel Unit Disk Graphs is NP-Complete

We show that finding a minimal number of landmark nodes for a unique virtual addressing by hop-distances in wireless ad-hoc sensor networks is NP-complete even if the networks are unit disk graphs that contain only Gabriel edges. This problem is equivalent to Metric Dimension for Gabriel unit disk graphs. The Gabriel edges of a unit disc graph induce a planar O(\sqrt{n}) distance and an optimal energy spanner. This is one of the most interesting restrictions of Metric Dimension in the context of wireless multi-hop networks.
