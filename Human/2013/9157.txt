Smooth minimization of nonsmooth functions with parallel coordinate descent methods

We study the performance of a family of randomized parallel coordinate descent methods for minimizing the sum of a nonsmooth and separable convex functions. The problem class includes as a special case L1-regularized L1 regression and the minimization of the exponential loss ("AdaBoost problem"). We assume the input data defining the loss function is contained in a sparse $m\times n$ matrix $A$ with at most $ω$ nonzeros in each row. Our methods need $O(n β/τ)$ iterations to find an approximate solution with high probability, where $τ$ is the number of processors and $β= 1 + (ω-1)(τ-1)/(n-1)$ for the fastest variant. The notation hides dependence on quantities such as the required accuracy and confidence levels and the distance of the starting iterate from an optimal point. Since $β/τ$ is a decreasing function of $τ$, the method needs fewer iterations when more processors are used. Certain variants of our algorithms perform on average only $O(\nnz(A)/n)$ arithmetic operations during a single iteration per processor and, because $β$ decreases when $ω$ does, fewer iterations are needed for sparser problems.
