From Bits to Atoms: 3D Printing in the Context of Supply Chain Strategies

A lot of attention in supply chain management has been devoted to understanding customer requirements. What are customer priorities in terms of price and service level, and how can companies go about fulfilling these requirements in an optimal way? New manufacturing technology in the form of 3D printing is about to change some of the underlying assumptions for different supply chain set-ups. This paper explores opportunities and barriers of 3D printing technology, specifically in a supply chain context. We are proposing a set of principles that can act to bridge existing research on different supply chain strategies and 3D printing. With these principles, researchers and practitioners alike can better understand the opportunities and limitations of 3D printing in a supply chain management context.
