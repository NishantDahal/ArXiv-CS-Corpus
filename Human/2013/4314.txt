Logical Stochastic Optimization

We present a logical framework to represent and reason about stochastic optimization problems based on probability answer set programming. This is established by allowing probability optimization aggregates, e.g., minimum and maximum in the language of probability answer set programming to allow minimization or maximization of some desired criteria under the probabilistic environments. We show the application of the proposed logical stochastic optimization framework under the probability answer set programming to two stages stochastic optimization problems with recourse.
