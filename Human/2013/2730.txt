A Variant of the Gröbner Basis Algorithm for Computing Hilbert Bases

Gröbner bases can be used for computing the Hilbert basis of a numerical submonoid. By using these techniques, we provide an algorithm that calculates a basis of a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space over a finite prime field given as a matrix kernel.
