Fat Hoffman graphs with smallest eigenvalue greater than -3

In this paper, we give a combinatorial characterization of the special graphs of fat Hoffman graphs containing $\mathfrak{K}_{1,2}$ with smallest eigenvalue greater than -3, where $\mathfrak{K}_{1,2}$ is the Hoffman graph having one slim vertex and two fat vertices.
