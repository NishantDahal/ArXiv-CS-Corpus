Structured Message Passing

In this paper, we present structured message passing (SMP), a unifying framework for approximate inference algorithms that take advantage of structured representations such as algebraic decision diagrams and sparse hash tables. These representations can yield significant time and space savings over the conventional tabular representation when the message has several identical values (context-specific independence) or zeros (determinism) or both in its range. Therefore, in order to fully exploit the power of structured representations, we propose to artificially introduce context-specific independence and determinism in the messages. This yields a new class of powerful approximate inference algorithms which includes popular algorithms such as cluster-graph Belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation and particle BP as special cases. We show that our new algorithms introduce several interesting bias-variance trade-offs. We evaluate these trade-offs empirically and demonstrate that our new algorithms are more accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art techniques.
