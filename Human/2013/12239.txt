The performance evaluation of IEEE 802.16 physical layer in the basis of bit error rate considering reference channel models

Fixed Broadband Wireless Access is a promising technology which can offer high speed data rate from transmitting end to customer end which can offer high speed text, voice, and video data. IEEE 802.16 WirelessMAN is a standard that specifies medium access control layer and a set of PHY layer to fixed and mobile BWA in broad range of frequencies and it supports equipment manufacturers due to its robust performance in multipath environment. Consequently WiMAX forum has adopted this version to develop the network world wide. In this paper the performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDM PHY Layer has been investigated by using the simulation model in Matlab. The Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel models are selected for the performance evaluation of this standard. The Ideal Channel estimation is considered in this work and the performance evaluation is observed in the basis of BER.
