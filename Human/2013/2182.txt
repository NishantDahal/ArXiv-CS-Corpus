Sinusoidal analysis of memristor bridge circuit-rectifier for low frequencies

Reasoned by its dynamical behavior, the memristor enables a lot of new applications in analog circuit design. Since some realizations are shown (e.g. 2007 by Hewlett Packard), the development of applications with memristors becomes more and more interesting. Whereas most of the research was done in the direction of memristor applications in neural networks and storage devices, less publications deal with practical applications of analog memristive circuits. But this topic is also promising further applications. Therefore, this article proposes a frequency dependent rectifier memristor bridge for different purposes (e.g. using as a programmable synaptic membrane voltage generator for Spike-Time-Dependent-Plasticity) and describes the circuit theory. In this context it is shown that the Picard Iteration is one possibility to solve the system of nonlinear state equations of memristor circuits analytically. An intuitive picture of how a memristor works in a network in general is given as well. In this context some research on the dynamical behavior of a HP memristor should be done.
