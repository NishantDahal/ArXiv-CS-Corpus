Derivation of Upper Bounds on Optimization Time of Population-Based Evolutionary Algorithm on a Function with Fitness Plateaus Using Elitism Levels Traverse Mechanism

In this article a tool for the analysis of population-based EAs is used to derive asymptotic upper bounds on the optimization time of the algorithm solving Royal Roads problem, a test function with plateaus of fitness. In addition to this, limiting distribution of a certain subset of the population is approximated.
