Linear Precoding for Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages under Transmit-Side Channel Correlation

In this paper, we analyze the performance of regularized channel inversion (RCI) precoding in multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channels with confidential messages under transmit-side channel correlation. We derive a deterministic equivalent for the achievable per-user secrecy rate which is almost surely exact as the number of transmit antennas and the number of users grow to infinity in a fixed ratio, and we determine the optimal regularization parameter that maximizes the secrecy rate. Furthermore, we obtain deterministic equivalents for the secrecy rates achievable by: (i) zero forcing precoding and (ii) single user beamforming. The accuracy of our analysis is validated by simulations of finite-size systems.
