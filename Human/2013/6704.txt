Codes and caps from orthogonal Grassmannians

In this paper we investigate linear error correcting codes and projective caps related to the Grassmann embedding $\varepsilon_k^{gr}$ of an orthogonal Grassmannian $Δ_k$. In particular, we determine some of the parameters of the codes arising from the projective system determined by $\varepsilon_k^{gr}(Δ_k)$. We also study special sets of points of $Δ_k$ which are met by any line of $Δ_k$ in at most 2 points and we show that their image under the Grassmann embedding $\varepsilon_k^{gr}$ is a projective cap.
