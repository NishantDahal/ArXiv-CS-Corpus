Clustering Based Topology Control Protocol for Data Delivery in Wireless Sensor Networks

The issue of optimizing the limited and often non-renewable energy of sensor nodes due to its direct impact on network lifetime dominates every aspect of wireless sensor networks. Existing techniques for optimizing energy consumption are based on exploiting node redundancy, adaptive radio transmission power and topology control. Topology control protocols have a significant impact on network lifetime, available energy and connectivity. In this paper we classify sensor nodes as strong and weak nodes based on their residual energy as well as operational lifetime and propose a Clustering based topology control protocol (CTCP) which extends network lifetime while guarantying the minimum connectivity. Extensive simulations in Java-Simulator (J-Sim) show that our proposed protocol outperforms the existing protocols in terms of various performance metrics life network lifetime, average delay and minimizes energy utilization.
