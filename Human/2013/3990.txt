On Quasiperiodic Morphisms

Weakly and strongly quasiperiodic morphisms are tools introduced to study quasiperiodic words. Formally they map respectively at least one or any non-quasiperiodic word to a quasiperiodic word. Considering them both on finite and infinite words, we get four families of morphisms between which we study relations. We provide algorithms to decide whether a morphism is strongly quasiperiodic on finite words or on infinite words.
