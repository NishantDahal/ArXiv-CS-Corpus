A simple combinatorial interpretation of certain generalized Bell and Stirling numbers

In a series of papers, P. Blasiak et al. developed a wide-ranging generalization of Bell numbers (and of Stirling numbers of the second kind) that appears to be relevant to the so-called Boson normal ordering problem. They provided a recurrence and, more recently, also offered a (fairly complex) combinatorial interpretation of these numbers. We show that by restricting the numbers somewhat (but still widely generalizing Bell and Stirling numbers), one can supply a much more natural combinatorial interpretation. In fact, we offer two different such interpretations, one in terms of graph colourings and another one in terms of certain labelled Eulerian digraphs.
