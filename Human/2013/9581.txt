VisIt: Experiences with Sustainable Software

The success of the VisIt visualization system has been wholly dependent upon the culture and practices of software development that have fostered its welcome by users and embrace by developers and researchers. In the following paper, we, the founding developers and designers of VisIt, summarize some of the major efforts, both successful and unsuccessful, that we have undertaken in the last thirteen years to foster community, encourage research, create a sustainable open-source development model, measure impact, and support production software. We also provide commentary about the career paths that our development work has engendered.
