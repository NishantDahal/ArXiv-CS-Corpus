New modular multiplication and division algorithms based on continued fraction expansion

In this paper, we apply results on number systems based on continued fraction expansions to modular arithmetic. We provide two new algorithms in order to compute modular multiplication and modular division. The presented algorithms are based on the Euclidean algorithm and are of quadratic complexity.
