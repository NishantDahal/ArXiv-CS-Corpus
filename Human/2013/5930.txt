W3-Scrape - A Windows based Reconnaissance Tool for Web Application Fingerprinting

Web Application finger printing is a quintessential part of the Information Gathering phase of (ethical) hacking. It allows narrowing down the specifics instead of looking for all clues. Also an application that has been correctly recognized can help in quickly analyzing known weaknesses and then moving ahead with remaining aspects. This step is also essential to allow a pen tester to customize its payload or exploitation techniques based on the identification so to increase the chances of successful intrusion. This paper presents a new tool "W3-Scrape" for the relatively nascent field of Web Application finger printing that helps automate web application fingerprinting when performed in the current scenarios.
