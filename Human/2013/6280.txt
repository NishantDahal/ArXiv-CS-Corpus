Enhancing Mobile Data Offloading with Mobility Prediction and Prefetching

We present procedures that exploit mobility prediction and prefetching to enhance offloading of traffic from mobile networks to WiFi hotspots, for both delay tolerant and delay sensitive traffic. We evaluate the procedures in terms of the percentage of offloaded traffic, the data transfer delay, and the cache size used for prefetching. The evaluation considers empirical measurements and shows how various parameters influence the performance of the procedures, and their robustness to time and throughput estimation errors.
