Chaotic Variations of AES Algorithm

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is considered as a secured algorithm. Still, some security issues lie in the S-Box and the key used. In this paper, we have tried to give focus on the security of the key used. Here, the proposed modified algorithms for the AES have been simulated and tested with different chaotic variations such as 1-D logistic chaos equation, cross chaos equation as well as combination of both. For the evaluation purpose, the CPU time has been taken as the parameter. Though the variations of AES algorithms are taking some more time as compared to the standard AES algorithm, still the variations can be taken into consideration in case of more sensitive information. As we are giving more security to the key used for AES algorithm, our proposed algorithms are very much secured from unauthorized people.
