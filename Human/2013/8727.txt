Interdisciplinary Research Collaborations: Evaluation of a Funding Program

Innovative ideas are often situated where disciplines meet, and socio-economic problems generally require contributions from several disciplines. Ways to stimulate interdisciplinary research collaborations are therefore an increasing point of attention for science policy. There is concern that 'regular' funding programs, involving advice from disciplinary experts and discipline-bound viewpoints, may not adequately stimulate, select or evaluate this kind of research. This has led to specific policies aimed at interdisciplinary research in many countries. There is however at this moment no generally accepted method to adequately select and evaluate interdisciplinary research. In the vast context of different forms of interdisciplinarity, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on best practices to stimulate and support interdisciplinary research collaborations. It describes the selection procedures and results of a university program supporting networks formed 'bottom up', integrating expertise from different disciplines. The program's recent evaluation indicates that it is successful in selecting and supporting the interdisciplinary synergies aimed for, responding to a need experienced in the field. The analysis further confirms that potential for interdisciplinary collaboration is present in all disciplines.
