Computing Covers of Plane Forests

Let $φ$ be a function that maps any non-empty subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to a non-empty subset $φ(A)$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$. A $φ$-cover of a set $T=\{T_1, T_2, \dots, T_m\}$ of pairwise non-crossing trees in the plane is a set of pairwise disjoint connected regions such that each tree $T_i$ is contained in some region of the cover, and each region of the cover is either (1) $φ(T_i)$ for some $i$, or (2) $φ(A \cup B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are constructed by either (1) or (2), and $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$.
  We present two properties for the function $φ$ that make the $φ$-cover well-defined. Examples for such functions $φ$ are the convex hull and the axis-aligned bounding box. For both of these functions $φ$, we show that the $φ$-cover can be computed in $O(n\log^2n)$ time, where $n$ is the total number of vertices of the trees in $T$.
