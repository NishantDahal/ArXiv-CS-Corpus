Review of intelligent tutoring systems using bayesian approach

With advancement in computer science research on artificial intelligence and in cognitive psychology research on human learning and performance, the next generation of computer-based tutoring systems moved beyond the simple presentation of pages of text or graphics. These new intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) called cognitive tutors; incorporated model-tracing technology which is a cognitive model of student problem solving that captures students multiple strategies and common misconceptions. Such Intelligent tutoring systems or Knowledge Based Tutoring Systems can guide learners to progress in the learning process at their best. This paper deals with the review of various Intelligent tutoring systems using Bayesian Networks and how Bayesian Networks can be used for efficient decision making.
