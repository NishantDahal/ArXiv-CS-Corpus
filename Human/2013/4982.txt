Integration of Wireless Sensor Networks with Virtual Instrumentation in a Residential Environment

This paper presents an approach to integrate wireless sensor networks (WSN) with the LabVIEW graphical development environment through a dedicated software driver. As personal constribution, a system architecture and concept implementation are described, in the context of a smart house monitoring scenario. Data acquisition is performed via the deployed wireless sensor network with focus on three main parameters: temperature, humidity and light. The data logging, monitoring and control functions are realized through a virtual instrumentation project. This also enables an easy-to-use user interface and the accesibility of data through standards-based web server technologies. The potential of remote monitoring and control through mobile terminals is opened up.
