Using Self-Organizing Maps for Sentiment Analysis

Web 2.0 services have enabled people to express their opinions, experience and feelings in the form of user-generated content. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining involves identifying, classifying and aggregating opinions as per their positive or negative polarity. This paper investigates the efficacy of different implementations of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for sentiment based visualization and classification of online reviews. Specifically, this paper implements the SOM algorithm for both supervised and unsupervised learning from text documents. The unsupervised SOM algorithm is implemented for sentiment based visualization and classification tasks. For supervised sentiment analysis, a competitive learning algorithm known as Learning Vector Quantization is used. Both algorithms are also compared with their respective multi-pass implementations where a quick rough ordering pass is followed by a fine tuning pass. The experimental results on the online movie review data set show that SOMs are well suited for sentiment based classification and sentiment polarity visualization.
