A fast and light stream cipher for smartphones

We present a stream cipher based on a chaotic dynamical system. Using a chaotic trajectory sampled under certain rules in order to avoid any attempt to reconstruct the original one, we create a binary pseudo-random keystream that can only be exactly reproduced by someone that has fully knowledge of the communication system parameters formed by a transmitter and a receiver and sharing the same initial conditions. The plaintext is XORed with the keystream creating the ciphertext, the encrypted message. This keystream passes the NISTs randomness test and has been implemented in a videoconference App for smartphones, in order to show the fast and light nature of the proposed encryption system.
