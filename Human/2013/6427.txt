A Solution of Simultaneous Recurrences

The paper is devoted to the methods of solving simultaneous recurrences. Specifically, we discuss transformation of matrix recurrences to regular recurrences and propose a way of solving special matrix recurrences of order three by their decomposition to matrix recurrences of order two.
