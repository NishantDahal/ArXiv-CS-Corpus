Census Data Mining and Data Analysis using WEKA

Data mining (also known as knowledge discovery from databases) is the process of extraction of hidden, previously unknown and potentially useful information from databases. The outcome of the extracted data can be analyzed for the future planning and development perspectives. In this paper, we have made an attempt to demonstrate how one can extract the local (district) level census, socio-economic and population related other data for knowledge discovery and their analysis using the powerful data mining tool Weka.
