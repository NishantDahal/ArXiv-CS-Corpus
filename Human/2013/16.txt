Introduction of Intellectual Property Courses in STEM Curriculum

The paper explains and emphasizes the need to include mandatory Intellectual Property (IP) courses in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum of STEM students. It prescribes the proposed content of IP to be covered at undergraduate level, and graduate depending on the degree pursued by the STEM student. More importantly, this paper advocates for an Integrated PhD/JD degree to produce highly skilled patent attorneys and agents, to overcome the problem of poor quality of patents, and the high number of patent related litigations. A framework is suggested which would enable STEM departments and law schools to successfully offer this integrated degree, and students to successfully pursue and complete this degree program in a realistic manner; without compromising any stake holder's interest.
