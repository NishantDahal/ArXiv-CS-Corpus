Function Overloading Implementation in C++

In this article the function overloading in object-oriented programming is elaborated and how they are implemented in C++. The language supports a variety of programming styles. Here we are describing the polymorphism and its types in brief. The main stress is given on the function overloading implementation styles in the language. The polymorphic nature of languages has advantages like that we can add new code without requiring changes to the other classes and interfaces (in Java language) are easily implemented. In this technique, the run-time overhead is also introduced in dynamic binding which increases the execution time of the software. But there are no such types of overheads in this static type of polymorphism because everything is resolved at the time of compile time. Polymorphism; Function Overloading; Static Polymorphism; Overloading; Compile Time Polymorphism.
