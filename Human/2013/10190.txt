Threshold Quantum Cryptography

Most current research on quantum cryptography requires transmission and reception of single photons that creates severe implementation challenges and limits range. This paper argues for the development of threshold quantum cryptography protocols in which the system is secure so long as the number of photons being exchanged between Alice and Bob is below a specified threshold. We speak of a (p-k-n) threshold system where if the number of photons exchanged is less than p, the system is completely secure, when it is between p and k, the system is partially secure, and when it exceeds k, the system is insecure. The BB84 protocol is (1-1-1) whereas the three-stage protocol appears to be (p-4p-n), where p is the least number of photons necessary to determine the polarization state of identically prepared photons. New quantum cryptography systems should be sought that provide greater flexibility in the choice of p and k.
