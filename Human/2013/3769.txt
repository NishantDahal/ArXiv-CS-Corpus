A Computational Model for the Direct Execution of General Specifications with Multi-way Constraints

In this paper, we propose a computational model for the direct execution of general specifications with multi-way constraints. Although this computational model has a similar structure to existing constraint programming models, it is not meant for solving constraint satisfaction problems but rather for the simulation of social systems and to continue to execute assigned processes. Because of this similar structure, it is applicable to the spectrum of the constraint solver, which is purple in this model. Essentially, it is a technology that can speed up the construction of large-scale network systems. This model can be efficiently executed to directly describe design content in a simple way.
