Homogeneous Weights and Möbius Functions on Finite Rings

The homogeneous weights and the Möbius functions and Euler phi-functions on finite rings are discussed; some computational formulas for these functions on finite principal ideal rings are characterized; for the residue rings of integers, they are reduced to the classical number-theoretical Möbius functions and the classical number-theoretical Euler phi-functions.
