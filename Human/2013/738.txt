In-situ associative permuting

The technique of in-situ associative permuting is introduced which is an association of in-situ permuting and in-situ inverting. It is suitable for associatively permutable permutations of {1,2,...,n} where the elements that will be inverted are negative and stored in order relative to each other according to their absolute values.
  Let K[1...n] be an array of n integer keys each in the range [1,n], and it is allowed to modify the keys in the range [-n,n]. If the integer keys are rearranged such that one of each distinct key having the value i is moved to the i'th position of K, then the resulting arrangement (will be denoted by K^P) can be transformed in-situ into associatively permutable permutation pi^P using only logn additional bits. The associatively permutable permutation pi^P not only stores the ranks of the keys of K^P but also uniquely represents K^P. Restoring the keys from pi^P is not considered. However, in-situ associative permuting pi^P in O(n) time using logn additional bits rearranges the elements of pi^P in order, as well as lets to restore the keys of K^P in O(n) further time using the inverses of the negative ranks. This means that an array of n integer keys each in the range [1,n] can be sorted using only logn bits of additional space.
