Investigate The Performance Evaluation of IPTV over WiMAX Networks

Deployment Video on Demand (VoD) over the next generation (WiMAX) has become one of the intense interest subjects in the research these days, and is expected to be the main revenue generators in the near future and the efficiency of video streaming over next generation 4G is the key to enabling this. We are considering video streaming for real time video was coded by different H.264.x codes (H.264/AVC, and SVC), and we consider an IP-Unicast to deliver this streaming video over WiMAX. Our approach investigates the performance evaluation of IPTV (VoD) over WiMAX networks. OPNET is used to investigate the performance of VoD over WiMAX. Results obtained from simulation indicate that SVC video codec is an appropriate video codec for video streaming over WiMAX.
