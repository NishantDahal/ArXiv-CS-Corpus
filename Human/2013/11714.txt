Performance of Uplink Multiuser Massive MIMO Systems

We study the performance of uplink transmission in a large-scale (massive) MIMO system, where all the transmitters have single antennas and the receiver (base station) has a large number of antennas. Specifically, we analyze achievable degrees of freedom of the system without assuming channel state information at the receiver. Also, we quantify the amount of power saving that is possible with increasing number of receive antennas.
