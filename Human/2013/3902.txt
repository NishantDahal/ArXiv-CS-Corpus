A Novel approach for Hybrid Database

In the current world of economic crises, the cost control is one of the chief concerns for all types of industries, especially for the small venders. The small vendors are suppose to minimize their budget on Information Technology by reducing the initial investment in hardware and costly database servers like ORACLE, SQL Server, SYBASE, etc. for the purpose of data processing and storing. In other divisions, the electronic devices manufacturing companies want to increase the demand and reduce the manufacturing cost by introducing the low cost technologies. The new small devices like ipods, iphones, palm top etc. are now-a-days used as data computation and storing tools. For both the cases mentioned above, instead of going for the costly database servers which additionally requires extra hardware as well as the extra expenses in training and handling, the flat file may be considered as a candidate due to its easy handling nature, fast accessing, and of course free of cost. But the main hurdle is the security aspects which are not up to the optimum level. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines all the merit of the flat file and with the help of a novel steganographic technique we can maintain the utmost security fence. The new proposed methodology will undoubtedly be highly beneficial for small vendors as well as for the above said electronic devices manufacturer
