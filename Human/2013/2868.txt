A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Target Tracking

This paper discusses a target tracking problem in which no dynamic mathematical model is explicitly assumed.  A nonlinear filter based on the fuzzy If-then rules is developed.  A comparison with a Kalman filter is made, and empirical results show that the performance of the fuzzy filter is better.  Intensive simulations suggest that theoretical justification of the empirical results is possible.
