Computer Interaction and the Benefits of Social Networking for People with Borderline Personality Disorder: Enlightening Mental Health Professionals

This paper seeks to present the findings of a focus group and questionnaire in assessing how aware mental health professionals, who have experience with people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), are in the extent of ICT based support for people with BPD. The methods used were both qualitative and quantitative and used descriptive data. Content analysis was used to explore specific themes and results were cross-examined between the two methods. The work should be viewed as an exploratory study into the viability and likely acceptance of a virtual support community specifically designed for people with BPD. The long term aim is to provide additional support for people with BPD, especially when they are in crisis and might be at a higher risk of harm.
