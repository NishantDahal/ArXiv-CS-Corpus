On Automation and Medical Image Interpretation, With Applications for Laryngeal Imaging

Indeed, these are exciting times. We are in the heart of a digital renaissance. Automation and computer technology allow engineers and scientists to fabricate processes that amalgamate quality of life. We anticipate much growth in medical image interpretation and understanding, due to the influx of computer technologies. This work should serve as a guide to introduce the reader to core themes in theoretical computer science, as well as imaging applications for understanding vocal-fold vibrations. In this work, we motivate the use of automation, review some mathematical models of computation. We present a proof of a classical problem in image analysis that cannot be automated by means of algorithms. Furthermore, discuss some applications for processing medical images of the vocal folds, and discuss some of the exhilarating directions the art of automation will take vocal-fold image interpretation and quite possibly other areas of biomedical image analysis.
