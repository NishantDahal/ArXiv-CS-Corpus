Generating Keys in Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems

In this paper, we will present how to find keys elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) with simple tools of Delphi 7 console application, using the software problem solving of the scalar point multiplication in the field GF(p), where p is an arbitrary prime number.
