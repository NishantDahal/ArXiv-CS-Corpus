Modifying the Entity relationship modelling notation: towards high quality relational databases from better notated ER models

The entity relationship modelling using the original ER notation has been applauded providing a natural view of data in conceptual modelling of information systems. However, the current ER to relational model transformation algorithm is known to be insufficient in providing a complete and accurate representation of the ER model undertaken for transformation. In an effort to derive better transformations from ER models, we have understood that modifications should be introduced to both of the existing transformation algorithm as well as to the ER notation. Introducing some new concepts, we have adapted the original ER notation and developed a new transformation algorithm based on the existing one. This paper presents the modified ER notation with an ER diagram drawn based on the new notation.
