Toward a Unified Performance and Power Consumption NAND Flash Memory Model of Embedded and Solid State Secondary Storage Systems

This paper presents a set of models dedicated to describe a flash storage subsystem structure, functions, performance and power consumption behaviors. These models cover a large range of today's NAND flash memory applications. They are designed to be implemented in simulation tools allowing to estimate and compare performance and power consumption of I/O requests on flash memory based storage systems. Such tools can also help in designing and validating new flash storage systems and management mechanisms. This work is integrated in a global project aiming to build a framework simulating complex flash storage hierarchies for performance and power consumption analysis. This tool will be highly configurable and modular with various levels of usage complexity according to the required aim: from a software user point of view for simulating storage systems, to a developer point of view for designing, testing and validating new flash storage management systems.
