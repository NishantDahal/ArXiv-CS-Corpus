Efficiency Improvement of Measurement Pose Selection Techniques in Robot Calibration

The paper deals with the design of experiments for manipulator geometric and elastostatic calibration based on the test-pose approach. The main attention is paid to the efficiency improvement of numerical techniques employed in the selection of optimal measurement poses for calibration experiments. The advantages of the developed technique are illustrated by simulation examples that deal with the geometric calibration of the industrial robot of serial architecture.
