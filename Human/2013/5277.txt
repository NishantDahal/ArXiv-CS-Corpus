Performance Analysis of Embarassingly Parallel Application on Cluster Computer Environment: A Case Study of Virtual Screening with Autodock Vina 1.1 on Hastinapura Cluster

IT based scientific research requires high computational resources. The limitation on funding and infrastructure led the high performance computing era from supercomputer to cluster and grid computing technology. Parallel application running well on cluster computer as well as supercomputer, one of the type is embarrassingly parallel application. Many scientist loves EP because it doesn't need any sophisticated technique but gives amazing performance. This paper discuss the bioinformatics research that used embarrassingly application and show its performance on cluster computer.
