Uplink Scheduling Strategy Based on A Population Game in Vehicular Sensor Networks

Recent advances in the integration of vehicular sensor network (VSN) technology, and crowd sensing leveraging pervasive sensors called onboard units (OBUs), like smartphones and radio frequency IDentifications to provide sensing services, have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academy. Nowadays, existing vehicular sensing applications lack good mechanisms to improve the maximum achievable throughput and minimizing service time of participating sensing OBUs in vehicular sensor networks. To fill these gaps, in this paper, first, we introduce real imperfect link states to the calculation of Markov chains. Second, we incorporate the result of different link states for multiple types of vehicles with the calculations of uplink throughput and service time. Third, in order to accurately calculate the service time of an OBU, we introduce the steady state probability to calculate the exact time of a duration for back-off decrement, rather than using the traditional relative probability. Additionally, to our best knowledge, we first explore a multichannel scheduling strategy of uplink data access in a single roadside unit (RSU) by using a non-cooperative game in a RSU coverage region to maximize the uplink throughput and minimize service time under saturated and unsaturated traffic loads. To this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis and find the equilibrium point of the scheduling. The numerical results show that the solution of the equilibrium points are consistent with optimization problems.
