Natural Language Web Interface for Database (NLWIDB)

It is a long term desire of the computer users to minimize the communication gap between the computer and a human. On the other hand, almost all ICT applications store information in to databases and retrieve from them. Retrieving information from the database requires knowledge of technical languages such as Structured Query Language. However majority of the computer users who interact with the databases do not have a technical background and are intimidated by the idea of using languages such as SQL. For above reasons, a Natural Language Web Interface for Database (NLWIDB) has been developed. The NLWIDB allows the user to query the database in a language more like English, through a convenient interface over the Internet.
