Madeup: A Mobile Development Environment for Programming 3-D Models

Constructionism is a learning theory that states that we learn more when we construct tangible objects. In the process of building and presenting our work, we make concrete the abstract mental models we've formed, see where they breakdown through the feedback we receive, and revise the models accordingly. Computer programming has long been taught under a constructionist approach using sensory-rich contexts like robots, media, and Logo-style environments. Now, with affordable 3-D printers in the hands of consumers, we have a new medium in which learners may realize their computational ideas. In this demonstration, we share a mobile development environment named Madeup, which empowers its users to navigate 3-D space using a Logo-like imperative and functional language. Every stop in space becomes a vertex in a 3-D model. The generated models may be exported or uploaded to a 3-D printing service.
