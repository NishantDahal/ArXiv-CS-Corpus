An event-based model for contracts

We introduce a basic model for contracts.  Our model extends event structures with a new relation,  which faithfully captures the circular dependencies among  contract clauses.  We establish whether an agreement exists which respects all the contracts at hand (i.e. all the dependencies can be resolved), and we detect the obligations of each participant. The main technical contribution is a correspondence between our model  and a fragment of the contract logic PCL.  More precisely, we show that the reachable events are exactly those which correspond to provable atoms in the logic. Despite of this strong correspondence, our model improves previous work on PCL by exhibiting a finer-grained notion of culpability, which  takes into account the legitimate orderings of events.
