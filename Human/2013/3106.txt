Performance of a random-access wireless network with a mix of full- and half-duplex stations

In this paper, we consider the performance of a random-access time-slotted wireless network with a single access point and a mix of half- and full- duplex stations. Full-duplex transmissions involve data transmitted simultaneously in both directions, and this influences the dynamics of the queue at the access point. Given the probabilities of channel access by the nodes, this paper provides generalized analytical formulations for the throughputs for each station. Special cases related to a 802.11 DCA based system as well as a full-fairness system are discussed, which provide insights into the changes introduced by the new technology of full-duplex wireless.
