Separating Topology and Geometry in Space Planning

We are dealing with the problem of space layout planning here. We present an architectural conceptual CAD approach. Starting with design specifications in terms of constraints over spaces, a specific enumeration heuristics leads to a complete set of consistent conceptual design solutions named topological solutions. These topological solutions which do not presume any precise definitive dimension correspond to the sketching step that an architect carries out from the Design specifications on a preliminary design phase in architecture.
