Recurrence relations versus succession rules

In this paper we present a method to pass from a recurrence relation having constant coefficients (in short, a C-recurrence) to a finite succession rule defining the same number sequence. We recall that succession rules are a recently studied tool for the enumeration of combinatorial objects related to the ECO method. We also discuss the applicability of our method as a test for the positivity of a number sequence.
