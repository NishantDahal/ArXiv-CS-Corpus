Solve of problems of mathematical theory of learning with using computer modeling methods

Analyzed models of learning, which take into account that: 1) the rate of increase of student's knowledge is proportional to the difference between levels of teacher's requirements and prior knowledge; 2) if the requirements are too high, then student motivation decreases and he stops learning. Was proposed: 1) a one component model, coming from the fact that the training information consists of equal elements; 2) a two component model that takes into account that knowledge is assimilated with varying strength, 'trustworthy' knowledge forgotten much slower then 'weak'; 3) two component model, which takes into account the transition of 'weak' knowledge in 'trustworthy' knowledge. The solution of the five predictors and optimization problems of learning theory are represented.
