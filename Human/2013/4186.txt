Joint operation in public key cryptography

We believe that there is no real data protection without our own tools. Therefore, our permanent aim is to have more of our own codes. In order to achieve that, it is necessary that a lot of young researchers become interested in cryptography. We believe that the encoding of cryptographic algorithms is an important step in that direction, and it is the main reason why in this paper we present a software implementation of finding the inverse element, the operation which is essentially related to both ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and the RSA schemes of digital signature.
