Dense Scattering Layer Removal

We propose a new model, together with advanced optimization, to separate a thick scattering media layer from a single natural image. It is able to handle challenging underwater scenes and images taken in fog and sandstorm, both of which are with significantly reduced visibility. Our method addresses the critical issue -- this is, originally unnoticeable impurities will be greatly magnified after removing the scattering media layer -- with transmission-aware optimization. We introduce non-local structure-aware regularization to properly constrain transmission estimation without introducing the halo artifacts. A selective-neighbor criterion is presented to convert the unconventional constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained one where the latter can be efficiently solved.
