Authentication System Securing Index of Image using SVD and ECC

This paper presents a new approach to securing information stored in a database. It has three components including: an operation for indexing images using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which will constitute the reference images, asymmetric encryption operation using Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), aiming to make confidential these reference images stored and a technique for comparing these images to a query image using the Euclidian Distance.
