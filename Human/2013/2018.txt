Validasi data dengan menggunakan objek lookup pada borland delphi 7.0

Developing an application with some tables must concern the validation of input (specially in Table Child). In order to maximize the accuracy and data input validation. Its called lookup (took data from other dataset). There are two ways to look up data from Table Parent: 1) Using Objects (DBLookupComboBox and DBookupListBox), or 2) Arranging the properties of data types fields (shown by using DBGrid). In this article is using Borland Delphi software (Inprise product). The method is offered using 5 (five) practise steps: 1) Relational Database Scheme, 2) Form Design, 3) Object DatabasesRelationships Scheme, 4) Properties and Field Type Arrangement, and 5) Procedures. The result of this paper are: 1) The relationship that using lookup objects are valid, and 2) Delphi Lookup Objects can be used for 1-1, 1-N, and M-N relationship.
