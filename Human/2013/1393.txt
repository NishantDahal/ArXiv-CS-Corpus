On Graph Deltas for Historical Queries

In this paper, we address the problem of evaluating historical queries on graphs. To this end, we investigate the use of graph deltas, i.e., a log of time-annotated graph operations. Our storage model maintains the current graph snapshot and the delta. We reconstruct past snapshots by applying appropriate parts of the graph delta on the current snapshot. Query evaluation proceeds on the reconstructed snapshots but we also propose algorithms based mostly on deltas for efficiency. We introduce various techniques for improving performance, including materializing intermediate snapshots, partial reconstruction and indexing deltas.
