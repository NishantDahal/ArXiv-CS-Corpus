Weight distribution of two classes of cyclic codes with respect to two distinct order elements

Cyclic codes are an interesting type of linear codes and have wide applications in communication and storage systems due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Cyclic codes have been studied for many years, but their weight distribution are known only for a few cases. In this paper, let $\Bbb F_r$ be an extension of a finite field $\Bbb F_q$ and $r=q^m$, we determine the weight distribution of the cyclic codes $\mathcal C=\{c(a, b): a, b \in \Bbb F_r\},$ $$c(a, b)=(\mbox {Tr}_{r/q}(ag_1^0+bg_2^0), \ldots, \mbox {Tr}_{r/q}(ag_1^{n-1}+bg_2^{n-1})), g_1, g_2\in \Bbb F_r,$$ in the following two cases: (1) $\ord(g_1)=n, n|r-1$ and $g_2=1$; (2) $\ord(g_1)=n$, $g_2=g_1^2$, $\ord(g_2)=\frac n 2$, $m=2$ and $\frac{2(r-1)}n|(q+1)$.
