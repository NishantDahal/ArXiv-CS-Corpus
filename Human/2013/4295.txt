A Secure And High Capacity Image Steganography Technique

Steganography is the science of invisible communication. The purpose of Steganography is to maintain secret communication between two parties. The secret information can be concealed in content such as image, audio, or video. This paper provides a novel image steganography technique to hide multiple secret images and keys in color cover image using Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT). There is no visual difference between the stego image and the cover image. The extracted secret images are also similar to the original secret images. Very good PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) values are obtained for both stego and extracted secret images. The results are compared with the results of other techniques, where single image is hidden and it is found that the proposed technique is simple and gives better PSNR values than others.
