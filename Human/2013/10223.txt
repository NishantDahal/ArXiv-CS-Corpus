A temporal semantics for Nilpotent Minimum logic

In [Ban97] a connection among rough sets (in particular, pre-rough algebras) and three-valued Łukasiewicz logic Ł3 is pointed out. In this paper we present a temporal like semantics for Nilpotent Minimum logic NM ([Fod95, EG01]), in which the logic of every instant is given by Ł3: a completeness theorem will be shown. This is the prosecution of the work initiated in [AGM08] and [ABM09], in which the authors construct a temporal semantics for the many-valued logics of Gödel ([Göd32], [Dum59]) and Basic Logic ([Háj98]).
