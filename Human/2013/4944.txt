Modèle multi-échelles pour les services dans les VANET

Service deployment, integration and interactions in VANET are fast expanding. They are now focusing only on driver security. In the future, with in-car application deployments, the car will be considered as a user extension - in the same way as smartphones actually. We propose a multi-level graph model to challenge this VANET / Application / User integration.
