Internationalization of Malaysian Mathematical and Computer Science Journal

The internationalization characteristics of two Malaysian journals, Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Sciences Society (indexed by ISI) and the Malaysian Journal of Computer Science (indexed by Inspec and Scopus) is observed. All issues for the years 2000 to 2007 were looked at to obtain the following information, (i) total articles published between 2000 and 2007; (ii) the distribution of foreign and Malaysian authors publishing in the journals; (iii) the distribution of articles by country and (iv) the geographical distribution of authors citing articles published in the journals. Citation to articles is derived from information given by Google scholar. The results indicate that both journals exhibit average internationalization characteristics as they are current in their publications but with between 19% -30% international composition of reviewers or editorials, publish between 36%-79% of foreign articles and receive between 60%-70% of citations from foreign authors.
