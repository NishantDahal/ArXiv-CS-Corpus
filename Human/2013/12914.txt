Property-Testing in Sparse Directed Graphs: 3-Star-Freeness and Connectivity

We study property testing in directed graphs in the bounded degree model, where we assume that an algorithm may only query the outgoing edges of a vertex, a model proposed by Bender and Ron in 2002. As our first main result, we we present a property testing algorithm for strong connectivity in this model, having a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1-ε/(3+α)})$ for arbitrary $α>0$; it is based on a reduction to estimating the vertex indegree distribution. For subgraph-freeness we give a property testing algorithm with a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1-1/k})$, where $k$ is the number of connected componentes in the queried subgraph which have no incoming edge. We furthermore take a look at the problem of testing whether a weakly connected graph contains vertices with a degree of least $3$, which can be viewed as testing for freeness of all orientations of $3$-stars; as our second main result, we show that this property can be tested with a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ instead of, what would be expected, $Ω(n^{2/3})$.
