Group Coding with Complex Isometries

We investigate group coding for arbitrary finite groups acting linearly on a vector space. These yield robust codes based on real or complex matrix groups. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for correct subgroup decoding using geometric notions of minimal length coset representatives. The infinite family of complex reflection groups G(r,1,n) produces effective codes of arbitrarily large size that can be decoded in relatively few steps.
