Universal truncation error upper bounds in irregular sampling restoration

Universal (pointwise uniform and time shifted) truncation error upper bounds are presented in Whittaker--Kotel'nikov--Shannon (WKS) sampling restoration sum for Bernstein function class $B_{Ï€,d}^q\,,\ q \ge 1,$ $d\in \mathbb N\,,$ when the sampled functions decay rate is unknown. The case of multidimensional irregular sampling is discussed.
