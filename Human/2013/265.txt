Computer Poker Research at LIACC

Computer Poker's unique characteristics present a well-suited challenge for research in artificial intelligence. For that reason, and due to the Poker's market increase in popularity in Portugal since 2008, several members of LIACC have researched in this field. Several works were published as papers and master theses and more recently a member of LIACC engaged on a research in this area as a Ph.D. thesis in order to develop a more extensive and in-depth work. This paper describes the existing research in LIACC about Computer Poker, with special emphasis on the completed master's theses and plans for future work. This paper means to present a summary of the lab's work to the research community in order to encourage the exchange of ideas with other labs / individuals. LIACC hopes this will improve research in this area so as to reach the goal of creating an agent that surpasses the best human players.
