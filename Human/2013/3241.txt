Ubiquitous HealthCare in Wireless Body Area Networks - A Survey

Advances in wireless communication, system on chip and low power sensor nodes allowed realization of Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). WBAN comprised of tiny sensors, which collect information of patient's vital signs and provide a real time feedback. In addition, WBAN also supports many applications including Ubiquitous HealthCare (UHC), entertainment, gaming, military, etc. UHC is required by elderly people to facilitate them with instant monitoring anywhere they move around. In this paper, different standards used in WBAN were also discussed briefly. Path loss in WBAN and its impact on communication was presented with the help of simulations, which were performed for different models of In-Body communication and different factors (such as, attenuation, frequency, distance etc) influencing path loss in On-Body communications.
