Wide Band Time-Correlated Model for Wireless Communications under Impulsive Noise within Power Substation

The installation of wireless technologies in power substations requires characterizing the impulsive noise produced by the high-voltage equipment. Substation impulsive noise might interfere with classic wireless communications and none of the existing models can reliably represent this noise in wide band. Previous studies have shown that impulsive noise is characterized by series of damped oscillations with the amplitude, the duration and the occurrence times of the impulses that are random. All these characteristics make this noise time-correlated and the partitioned Markov chain remains an efficient model that can ensure the correlation between the samples. In this study, we propose to design a partitioned Markov chain to generate an impulsive noise that is similar to the noise measured in existing substations, in time and frequency domains. We configure our Markov chain to produce the impulses with the damped oscillation effect, then, we determine the probability transition matrix and the distribution of each state of the Markov chain. Finally, we generate noise samples and we study the distribution of the impulsive noise characteristics. Our Markov chain model can replicate the correlation between the measured noise samples; also the distributions of the noise characteristics are similar in the simulations and the measurements.
