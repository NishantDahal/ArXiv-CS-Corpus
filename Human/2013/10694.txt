On Lattices of Regular Sets of Natural Integers Closed under Decrementation

We consider lattices of regular sets of non negative integers, i.e. of sets definable in Presbuger arithmetic. We prove that if such a lattice is closed under decrement then it is also closed under many other functions: quotients by an integer, roots, etc.
