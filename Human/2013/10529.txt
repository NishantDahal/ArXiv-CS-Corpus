An approach for a business-driven cloudcompliance analysis covering public sector process improvement requirements

The need for process improvement is an important target that does affect as well the government processes. Specifically in the public sector there are specific challenges to face.New technology approaches within government processes such as cloud services are necessary to address these challenges. Following the current discussion of cloudification of business processes all processes are considered similar in regards to their usability within the cloud. The truth is, that neither all processes have the same usability for cloud services not do they have the same importance for a specific company.The most comprehensive process within a company is the corporate value chain. In this article one key proposition is to use the corporate value chain as the fundamental structuring backbone for all business process analysis and improvement activities. It is a pre-requisite to identify the core elements of the value chain that are essential for the individual companys business and the root cause for any company success. In this paper we propose to use the company-specific value-creation for the cloud-affinity and the cloud-usability of a business process in public sector considering the specific challenges of addressing processes in cloud services. Therefor it is necessary to formalize the way the processes with its interdependencies are documented in context of their company-specific value chain (as part of the various deployment- and governance alternatives. Moreover, it is essential in the public sector to describe in detail the environmental and external restrictions of processes. With the use of this proposed methodology it becomes relatively easy to identify cloud-suitable processes within the public sector and thus optimize the public companies value generation tightly focused with the use of this new technology.
