Real-Time Vector Automata

We study the computational power of real-time finite automata that have been augmented with a vector of dimension k, and programmed to multiply this vector at each step by an appropriately selected $k \times k$ matrix. Only one entry of the vector can be tested for equality to 1 at any time. Classes of languages recognized by deterministic, nondeterministic, and "blind" versions of these machines are studied and compared with each other, and the associated classes for multicounter automata, automata with multiplication, and generalized finite automata.
