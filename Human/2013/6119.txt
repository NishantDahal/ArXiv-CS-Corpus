Solution to Quadratic Equation Using Genetic Algorithm

Solving Quadratic equation is one of the intrinsic interests as it is the simplest nonlinear equations. A novel approach for solving Quadratic Equation based on Genetic Algorithms (GAs) is presented. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a technique to solve problems which need optimization. Generation of trial solutions have been formed by this method. Many examples have been worked out, and in most cases we find out the exact solution. We have discussed the effect of different parameters on the performance of the developed algorithm. The results are concluded after rigorous testing on different equations.
