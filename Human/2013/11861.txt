Cubic graphs with large circumference deficit

The circumference $c(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the length of a longest cycle. By exploiting our recent results on resistance of snarks, we construct infinite classes of cyclically $4$-, $5$- and $6$-edge-connected cubic graphs with circumference ratio $c(G)/|V(G)|$ bounded from above by $0.876$, $0.960$ and $0.990$, respectively. In contrast, the dominating cycle conjecture implies that the circumference ratio of a cyclically $4$-edge-connected cubic graph is at least $0.75$.
  In addition, we construct snarks with large girth and large circumference deficit, solving Problem 1 proposed in [J. Hägglund and K. Markström, On stable cycles and cycle double covers of graphs with large circumference, Disc. Math. 312 (2012), 2540--2544].
