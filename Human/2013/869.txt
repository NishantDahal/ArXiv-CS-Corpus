EELA Operations: A standalone regional dashboard implementation

Grid operators in EGEE use a dedicated dashboard as their central operational tool, stable and scalable for the last 5 years despite continuous upgrade from specifications by users, monitoring tools or data providers. In EGEE-III, regionalisation of operations led the tool developers to conceive a standalone instance of this tool. Hereby, we will present the concept and the EELA-II implementation. Indeed, there-engineering of this tool led to an easily deployable package that canconnect to EELA-II specific information sources such as EVENTUM, EELAGOCDB like or SAM EELA instance through the three components of thepackage: the generic and scalable data access mechanism, Lavoisier; thewidely spread php framework Symfony, for configuration flexibility and a Mysql database.
