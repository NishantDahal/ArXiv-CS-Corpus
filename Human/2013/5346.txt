Mnemonics for Higher Education Using Contemporary Technologies

Education pierces into the contemporary world due to the influence of the emerging technologies in the digital world. Education field is also bombarded by the modern technologies and the demands of the digital society. It is affected by cloud computing, green computing and Internet. Still the success of this depends upon the minimization of the knowledge loss, while transferring ideas from teacher to student. Teaching & Learning is always an art. Even though modern technology is introduced along with the traditional method of teaching in Higher College of Technology (HCT), knowledge loss is very high still. Mnemonics is an old tool; still suitable for digital era students with the influence of recent technologies. Hence this paper discusses how to implement this mnemonics with the help of modern technologies like E-Learning and M-Learning. In this paper we have tried to discuss about E-learning and M-learning usage for implementing Mnemonics, and also discussed how far this concept can be used to make the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) more efficient and effective in term of making the students learning experience as a fun and without huge knowledge loss during the teaching and learning process including practical subjects. This paper also explains the initial research conducted with the students of database specialization of HCT and findings of that research about the knowledge loss. We have also suggests the future research areas in Mnemonics.
