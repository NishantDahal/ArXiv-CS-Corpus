A counterexample to a question of Hof, Knill and Simon

In this article, we give a negative answer to a question of Hof, Knill and Simon (1995) concerning purely morphic sequences obtained from primitive morphism containing an infinite number of palindromes. Proven for the binary alphabet by B. Tan in 2007, we show the existence of a counterexample on the ternary alphabet.
