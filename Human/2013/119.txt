Energy-Efficient Spectrum Sharing in Relay-Assisted Cognitive Radio Systems

This work characterizes an important solution concept of a relevant spectrum game. Two energy-efficient sources communicating with their respective destination compete for an extra channel brought by a relay charging the used bandwidth through a pricing mechanism. This game is shown to possess a unique Nash bargaining solution, exploiting a time-sharing argument. This Pareto-efficient solution can be implemented by using a distributed optimization algorithm for which each transmitter uses a simple gradient-type algorithm and alternately updates its spectrum sharing policy. Typical numerical results show to what extent spectral efficiency can be improved in a system involving selfish energy-efficient sources.
