Designing Unimodular Codes via Quadratic Optimization is not Always Hard

The NP-hard problem of optimizing a quadratic form over the unimodular vector set arises in radar code design scenarios as well as other active sensing and communication applications. To tackle this problem (which we call unimodular quadratic programming (UQP)), several computational approaches are devised and studied. A specialized local optimization scheme for UQP is introduced and shown to yield superior results compared to general local optimization methods. Furthermore, a \textbf{m}onotonically \textbf{er}ror-bound \textbf{i}mproving \textbf{t}echnique (MERIT) is proposed to obtain the global optimum or a local optimum of UQP with good sub-optimality guarantees. The provided sub-optimality guarantees are case-dependent and generally outperform the $Ï€/4$ approximation guarantee of semi-definite relaxation. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The examples show that for cases including several matrix structures used in radar code design, MERIT can solve UQP efficiently in the sense of sub-optimality guarantee and computational time.
