On Weak Dress Codes for Cloud Storage

In a distributed storage network, reliability and bandwidth optimization can be provided by regenerating codes. Recently table based regenerating codes viz. DRESS (Distributed Replication-based Exact Simple Storage) codes has been proposed which also optimizes the disk I/O. Dress codes consists of an outer MDS code with an inner fractional repetition (FR) code with replication degree $œÅ$. Several constructions of FR codes based on regular graphs, resolvable designs and bipartite graphs are known. This paper presents a simple modular construction of FR codes. We also generalize the concept of FR codes to weak fractional repetition (WFR) codes where each node has different number of packets. We present a construction of WFR codes based on partial regular graph. Finally we present a simple generalized ring construction of both strong and weak fractional repetition codes.
