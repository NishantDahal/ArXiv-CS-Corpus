6th International Symposium on Attention in Cognitive Systems 2013

This volume contains the papers accepted at the 6th International Symposium on Attention in Cognitive Systems (ISACS 2013), held in Beijing, August 5, 2013. The aim of this symposium is to highlight the central role of attention on various kinds of performance in cognitive systems processing. It brings together researchers and developers from both academia and industry, from computer vision, robotics, perception psychology, psychophysics and neuroscience, in order to provide an interdisciplinary forum to present and communicate on computational models of attention, with the focus on interdependencies with visual cognition. Furthermore, it intends to investigate relevant objectives for performance comparison, to document and to investigate promising application domains, and to discuss visual attention with reference to other aspects of AI enabled systems.
