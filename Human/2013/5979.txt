Downlink Rate Distribution in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks under Generalized Cell Selection

Considering both small-scale fading and long-term shadowing, we characterize the downlink rate distribution at a typical user equipment (UE) in a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet), where shadowing, following any general distribution, impacts cell selection while fading does not. Prior work either ignores the impact of channel randomness on cell selection or lumps all the sources of randomness into a single variable, with cell selection based on the instantaneous signal strength, which is unrealistic. As an application of the results, we study the impact of shadowing on load balancing in terms of the optimal per-tier selection bias needed for rate maximization.
