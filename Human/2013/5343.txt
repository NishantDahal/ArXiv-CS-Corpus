Full Square Rhomboids and Their Algebraic Expressions

The paper investigates relationship between algebraic expressions and graphs. We consider a digraph called a full square rhomboid that is an example of non-series-parallel graphs. Our intention is to simplify the expressions of full square rhomboids and eventually find their shortest representations. With that end in view, we describe two decomposition methods for generating expressions of full square rhomboids and carry out their comparative analysis.
