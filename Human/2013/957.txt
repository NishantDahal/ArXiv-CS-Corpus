Multicommand Tactile Brain Computer Interface based on Fingertips or Head Stimulation

The paper presents results from a computational neuroscience study conducted to test vibrotactile stimuli delivered to subject fingertips and head areas in order to evoke the somatosensory brain responses utilized in a haptic brain computer interface (hBCI) paradigm. We present the preliminary and very encouraging results, with subjects conducting online hBCI interfacing experiments, ranging from 40% to 90% with a very fast inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of 250ms. The presented results confirm our hypothesis that the hBCI paradigm concept is valid and it allows for rapid stimuli presentation in order to achieve a satisfactory information-transfer-rate of the novel BCI.
