GRED: Graph-Regularized 3D Shape Reconstruction from Highly Anisotropic and Noisy Images

Analysis of microscopy images can provide insight into many biological processes. One particularly challenging problem is cell nuclear segmentation in highly anisotropic and noisy 3D image data. Manually localizing and segmenting each and every cell nuclei is very time consuming, which remains a bottleneck in large scale biological experiments. In this work we present a tool for automated segmentation of cell nuclei from 3D fluorescent microscopic data. Our tool is based on state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning techniques and supports a friendly graphical user interface (GUI). We show that our tool is as accurate as manual annotation but greatly reduces the time for the registration.
