Work Breakdown Structure: A Tool for Software Project Scope Verification

Software project scope verification is a very important process in project scope management and it needs to be performed properly and thoroughly so as to avoid project rework and scope creep. Moreover, software scope verification is crucial in the process of delivering exactly what the customer requested and minimizing project scope changes. Well defined software scope eases the process of scope verification and contributes to project success. Furthermore, a deliverable-oriented WBS provides a road map to a well defined software scope of work. It is on the basis of this that this paper extends the use of deliverable-oriented WBS to that of scope verification process. This paper argues that a deliverable-oriented WBS is a tool for software scope verification.
