Enhanced Security for Cloud Storage using File Encryption

Cloud computing is a term coined to a network that offers incredible processing power, a wide array of storage space and unbelievable speed of computation. Social media channels, corporate structures and individual consumers are all switching to the magnificent world of cloud computing. The flip side to this coin is that with cloud storage emerges the security issues of confidentiality, data integrity and data availability. Since the cloud is a mere collection of tangible super computers spread across the world, authentication and authorization for data access is more than a necessity. Our work attempts to overcome these security threats. The proposed methodology suggests the encryption of the files to be uploaded on the cloud. The integrity and confidentiality of the data uploaded by the user is ensured doubly by not only encrypting it but also providing access to the data only on successful authentication.
