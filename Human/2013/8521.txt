Evolution of IEEE 802.11 compatible standards and impact on Energy Consumption

Over the last decade, the IEEE 802.11 has emerged as the most popular protocol in the wireless domain. Since the release of the first standard version, several amendments have been introduced in an effort to improve its throughput performance, with the most recent one being the IEEE 802.11n extension. In this work, we present detailed experimentally obtained measurements that evaluate the energy efficiency of the base standard in comparison with the latest 802.11n version. Moreover, we investigate the impact of various MAC layer enhancements, both vendor specific and standard compliant ones, on the energy consumption of wireless transceivers and total nodes as well. Results obtained under a wide range of settings, indicate that the latest standard enables reduction of energy expenditure, by more than 75%, when combined with innovative frame aggregation mechanisms.
