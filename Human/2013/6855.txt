Error Floor Approximation for LDPC Codes in the AWGN Channel

This paper addresses the prediction of error floors of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with variable nodes of constant degree in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Specifically, we focus on the performance of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder formulated in the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) domain. We hypothesize that several published error floor levels are due to the manner in which decoder implementations handled the LLRs at high SNRs. We employ an LLR-domain SPA decoder that does not saturate near-certain messages and find the error rates of our decoder to be lower by at least several orders of magnitude. We study the behavior of trapping sets (or near-codewords) that are the dominant cause of the reported error floors.
  We develop a refined linear model, based on the work of Sun and others, that accurately predicts error floors caused by elementary tapping sets for saturating decoders. Performance results of several codes at several levels of decoder saturation are presented.
