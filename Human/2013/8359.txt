xTras: a field-theory inspired xAct package for Mathematica

We present the tensor computer algebra package xTras, which provides functions and methods frequently needed when doing (classical) field theory. Amongst others, it can compute contractions, make Ans√§tze, and solve tensorial equations. It is built upon the tensor computer algebra system xAct, a collection of packages for Mathematica.
