Turbo DPSK in Bi-directional Relaying

In this paper, iterative differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) demodulation and channel decoding scheme is investigated for the Joint Channel decoding and physical layer Network Coding (JCNC) approach in two-way relaying systems. The Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv (BCJR) algorithm for both coherent and noncoherent detection is derived for soft-in soft-out decoding of DPSK signalling over the two-user multiple-access channel with Rayleigh fading. Then, we propose a pragmatic approach with the JCNC scheme for iteratively exploiting the extrinsic information of the outer code. With coherent detection, we show that DPSK can be well concatenated with simple convolutional codes to achieve excellent coding gain just like in traditional point-to-point communication scenarios. The proposed noncoherent detection, which essentially requires that the channel keeps constant over two consecutive symbols, can work without explicit channel estimation. Simulation results show that the iterative processing converges very fast and most of the coding gain is obtained within two iterations.
