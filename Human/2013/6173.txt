Modeling of Multipath Transport

In this paper, we propose a model for evaluating the transmission performance of multipath transport. Previous researches focused exclusively on single pair users in simple scenarios. The distinct perspective in this paper is to build models for analyzing the performance when multipath transport is used in the entire network scope. We illustrate the influences on the transmission performance caused by the variation of network topologies, the services' arrival rate, the services' size and other parameters. We demonstrate through simulation that multipath transport could conditionally increase the throughput than single-path transport. And it has the capability to support higher services' arrival rate in various network topologies. And higher multi-parent probability will be beneficial for multipath transport to take its advantages.
