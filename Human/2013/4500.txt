Some Hierarchies of QCB_0-Spaces

We define and study hierarchies of topological spaces induced by the classical Borel and Luzin hierarchies of sets. Our hierarchies are divided into two classes: hierarchies of countably based spaces induced by their embeddings into the domain PÏ‰, and hierarchies of spaces (not necessarily countably based) induced by their admissible representations. We concentrate on the non-collapse property of the hierarchies and on the relationships between hierarchies in the two classes.
