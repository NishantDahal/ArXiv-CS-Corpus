New Lower Bounds for Matching Vector Codes

A Matching Vector (MV) family modulo $m$ is a pair of ordered lists $U=(u_1,...,u_t)$ and $V=(v_1,...,v_t)$ where $u_i,v_j \in \mathbb{Z}_m^n$ with the following inner product pattern: for any $i$, $< u_i,v_i>=0$, and for any $i \ne j$, $< u_i,v_j> \ne 0$. A MV family is called $q$-restricted if inner products $< u_i,v_j>$ take at most $q$ different values.
  Our interest in MV families stems from their recent application in the construction of sub-exponential locally decodable codes (LDCs). There, $q$-restricted MV families are used to construct LDCs with $q$ queries, and there is special interest in the regime where $q$ is constant. When $m$ is a prime it is known that such constructions yield codes with exponential block length. However, for composite $m$ the behaviour is dramatically different. A recent work by Efremenko [STOC 2009] (based on an approach initiated by Yekhanin [JACM 2008]) gives the first sub-exponential LDC with constant queries. It is based on a construction of a MV family of super-polynomial size by Grolmusz [Combinatorica 2000] modulo composite $m$.
  In this work, we prove two lower bounds on the block length of LDCs which are based on black box construction using MV families. When $q$ is constant (or sufficiently small), we prove that such LDCs must have a quadratic block length. When the modulus $m$ is constant (as it is in the construction of Efremenko) we prove a super-polynomial lower bound on the block-length of the LDCs, assuming a well-known conjecture in additive combinatorics, the polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture over $\mathbb{Z}_m$.
