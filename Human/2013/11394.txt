Numerical modeling of friction stir welding process: a literature review

This survey presents a literature review on friction stir welding (FSW) modeling with a special focus on the heat generation due to the contact conditions between the FSW tool and the workpiece. The physical process is described and the main process parameters that are relevant to its modeling are highlighted. The contact conditions (sliding/sticking) are presented as well as an analytical model that allows estimating the associated heat generation. The modeling of the FSW process requires the knowledge of the heat loss mechanisms, which are discussed mainly considering the more commonly adopted formulations. Different approaches that have been used to investigate the material flow are presented and their advantages/drawbacks are discussed. A reliable FSW process modeling depends on the fine tuning of some process and material parameters. Usually, these parameters are achieved with base on experimental data. The numerical modeling of the FSW process can help to achieve such parameters with less effort and with economic advantages.
