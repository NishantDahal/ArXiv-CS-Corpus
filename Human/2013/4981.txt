Extended Lambek calculi and first-order linear logic

First-order multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic (MILL1) can be seen as an extension of the Lambek calculus. In addition to the fragment of MILL1 which corresponds to the Lambek calculus (of Moot & Piazza 2001), I will show fragments of MILL1 which generate the multiple context-free languages and which correspond to the Displacement calculus of Morrilll e.a.
