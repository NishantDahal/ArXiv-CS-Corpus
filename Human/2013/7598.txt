Optimal Locally Repairable Linear Codes

Linear erasure codes with local repairability are desirable for distributed data storage systems. An [n, k, d] code having all-symbol (r, δ})-locality, denoted as (r, δ)a, is considered optimal if it also meets the minimum Hamming distance bound. The existing results on the existence and the construction of optimal (r, δ)a codes are limited to only the special case of δ = 2, and to only two small regions within this special case, namely, m = 0 or m >= (v+δ-1) > (δ-1), where m = n mod (r+δ-1) and v = k mod r. This paper investigates the existence conditions and presents deterministic constructive algorithms for optimal (r, δ)a codes with general r and δ. First, a structure theorem is derived for general optimal (r, δ)a codes which helps illuminate some of their structure properties. Next, the entire problem space with arbitrary n, k, r and δ is divided into eight different cases (regions) with regard to the specific relations of these parameters. For two cases, it is rigorously proved that no optimal (r, δ)a could exist. For four other cases the optimal (r, δ)a codes are shown to exist, deterministic constructions are proposed and the lower bound on the required field size for these algorithms to work is provided. Our new constructive algorithms not only cover more cases, but for the same cases where previous algorithms exist, the new constructions require a considerably smaller field, which translates to potentially lower computational complexity. Our findings substantially enriches the knowledge on (r, δ)a codes, leaving only two cases in which the existence of optimal codes are yet to be determined.
