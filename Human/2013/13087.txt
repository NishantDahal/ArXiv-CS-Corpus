Optimal Frame Transmission for Scalable Video with Hierarchical Prediction Structure

An optimal frame transmission scheme is presented for streaming scalable video over a link with limited capacity. The objective is to select a transmission sequence of frames and their transmission schedule such that the overall video quality is maximized. The problem is solved for two general classes of hierarchical prediction structures, which include as a special case the popular dyadic structure. Based on a new characterization of the interdependence among frames in terms of trees, structural properties of an optimal transmission schedule are derived. These properties lead to the development of a jointly optimal frame selection and scheduling algorithm, which has computational complexity that is quadratic in the number of frames. Simulation results show that the optimal scheme substantially outperforms three existing alternatives.
