An empirical study to order citation statistics between subject fields

An empirical study is conducted to compare citations per publication, statistics and observed Hirsch indexes between subject fields using summary statistics of countries. No distributional assumptions are made and ratios are calculated. These ratios can be used to make approximate comparisons between researchers of different subject fields with respect to the Hirsch index.
