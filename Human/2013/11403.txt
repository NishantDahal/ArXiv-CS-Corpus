Most Complex Regular Right-Ideal Languages

A right ideal is a language L over an alphabet A that satisfies L = LA*. We show that there exists a stream (sequence) (R_n : n \ge 3) of regular right ideal languages, where R_n has n left quotients and is most complex under the following measures of complexity: the state complexities of the left quotients, the number of atoms (intersections of complemented and uncomplemented left quotients), the state complexities of the atoms, the size of the syntactic semigroup, the state complexities of the operations of reversal, star, and product, and the state complexities of all binary boolean operations. In that sense, this stream of right ideals is a universal witness.
