Investigating Information Security Risks of Mobile Device Use within Organizations

Mobile devices, such as phones, tablets and laptops, expose businesses and governments to a multitude of information security risks. While Information Systems research has focused on the security and privacy aspects from the end-user perspective regarding mobile devices, very little research has been conducted within corporate environments. In this work, thirty-two mobile devices were returned by employees in a global Fortune 500 company. In the empirical analysis, a number of significant security risks were uncovered which may have led to leakage of valuable intellectual property or exposed the organization to future legal conflicts. The research contribution is an initial empirical report highlighting examples of corporate policy breaches by users along with providing a foundation for future research on the security risks of the pervasive presence of mobile devices in corporate environments.
