Visualization and Analysis of Geographical Crime Patterns Using Formal Concept Analysis

There are challenges faced in today's world in terms of crime analysis when it comes to graphical visualization of crime patterns. Geographical representation of crime scenes and crime types become very important in gathering intelligence about crimes. This provides a very dynamic and easy way of monitoring criminal activities and analyzing them as well as producing effective countermeasures and preventive measures in solving them. But we need effective computer tools and intelligent systems that are automated to analyze and interpret criminal data in real time effectively and efficiently. These current computer systems should have the capability of providing intelligence from raw data and creating a visual graph which will make it easy for new concepts to be built and generated from crime data in order to solve, understand and analyze crime patterns easily. This paper proposes a new method of visualizing and analyzing crime patterns based on geographical crime data by using Formal Concept Analysis, or Galois Lattices, a data analysis technique grounded on Lattice Theory and Propositional Calculus. This method considered the set of common and distinct attributes of crimes in such a way that categorization are done based on related crime types. This will help in building a more defined and conceptual systems for analysis of geographical crime data that can easily be visualized and intelligently analyzed by computer systems.
