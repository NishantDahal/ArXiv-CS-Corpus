Conceptual Framework of Redundant Link Aggregation

This is era of information blast. A huge quantity of information is pouring in from various sources. The revolutionary advancement of Information and Communication technologies bring the world close together. A pile of information in different formats is just a click away. Which motivate the organizations to get more internet bandwidth to consume and publish the information over exploding cloud of Internet. The standard router redundancy protocol is used to handle backup links however it cannot aggregate them. Whereas the link standard aggregation protocol can aggregate the link but it support only Ethernet technology. In this research paper a concept of Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) is proposed. RLA can aggregate and handle backup links with main links regardless of carrier technology. Furthermore a data forwarding mechanism Odd Load Balancing (OLB) is also proposed for RLA scheme. For the sake of performance evaluation, Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) is compared with Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP). The simulation result reveals that Redundant Link Aggregation (RLA) can cover the bandwidth demand of the network in peak hours by consuming backup links as well which with Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) cannot. It is further noted that Odd Load Balancing (OLB) feature can be used to save the cost in terms of money per annum.
