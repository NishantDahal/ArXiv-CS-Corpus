Improved Asymptotic Key Rate of the B92 Protocol

We analyze the asymptotic key rate of the single photon B92 protocol by using Renner's security analysis given in 2005. The new analysis shows that the B92 protocol can securely generate key at 6.5% depolarizing rate, while the previous analyses cannot guarantee the secure key generation at 4.2% depolarizing rate.
