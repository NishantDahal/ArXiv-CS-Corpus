Practical Secrecy: Bridging the Gap between Cryptography and Physical Layer Security

Current security techniques can be implemented either by requiring a secret key exchange or depending on assumptions about the communication channels. In this paper, we show that, by using a physical layer technique known as artificial noise, it is feasible to protect secret data without any form of secret key exchange and any restriction on the communication channels. Specifically, we analyze how the artificial noise can achieve practical secrecy. By treating the artificial noise as an unshared one-time pad secret key, we show that the proposed scheme also achieves Shannon's perfect secrecy. Moreover, we show that achieving perfect secrecy is much easier than ensuring non-zero secrecy capacity, especially when the eavesdropper has more antennas than the transmitter. Focusing on the practical applications, we show that practical secrecy and strong secrecy can be guaranteed even if the eavesdropper attempts to remove the artificial noise. We finally show the connections between traditional cryptography and physical layer security.
