The solution to the challenge in "Time-Reversible Random Number Generators" by Wm. G. Hoover and Carol G. Hoover

I provide the algorithm that solves the challenge proposed by Wm. G. Hoover and Carol G. Hoover in their recent paper "Time-Reversible Random Number Generators", arXiv:1305.0961, with an explanation on how to derive it analytically.
