Quantum and Concept Combination, Entangled Measurements and Prototype Theory

We analyze the meaning of the violation of the marginal probability law for situations of correlation measurements where entanglement is identified. We show that for quantum theory applied to the cognitive realm such a violation does not lead to the type of problems commonly believed to occur in situations of quantum theory applied to the physical realm. We briefly situate our quantum approach for modeling concepts and their combinations with respect to the notions of 'extension' and 'intension' in theories of meaning, and in existing concept theories.
