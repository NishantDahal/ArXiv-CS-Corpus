The design of high-speed data transmission method for a small nuclear physics DAQ system

A large number of data need to be transmitted in high-speed between Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and Advanced RISC Machines 11 micro-controller (ARM11) when we design a small data acquisition (DAQ) system for nuclear experiments. However, it is a complex problem to beat the target. In this paper, we will introduce a method which can realize the high-speed data transmission. By this way, FPGA is designed to acquire massive data from Front-end electronics (FEE) and send it to ARM11, which will transmit the data to other computer through the TCP/IP protocol. This paper mainly introduces the interface design of the high-speed transmission between FPGA and ARM11, the transmission logic of FPGA and the driver program of ARM11. The research shows that the maximal transmission speed between FPGA and ARM11 by this way can reach 50MB/s theoretically, while in nuclear physics experiment, the system can acquire data with the speed of 2.2MB/s.
