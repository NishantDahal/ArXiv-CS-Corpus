An Optimal Heuristic for Sum of All Prime Numbers Logic for Large Inputs using RAPTOR

An optimal heuristic logic is an effective method for finding the sum of all prime numbers up to a given number. This paper presents different approaches, namely, general method and optimal method which facilitate to compare the results and draw the optimal solution. The method adopted is to know the number of symbols evaluated in each logic, construct better approaches based on heuristics, proposals and implementations of human sequential development using Rapid algorithmic prototyping tool for ordered reasoning (RAPTOR). In traditional approach, task is complex in point of time and space; however, this method reduces these prime factors by applying simple mathematical theorems and heuristics. This model effectively works with large numeric inputs. It has been tested on RAPTOR with flow charts, results indicates that algorithms are fast, effective and scalable.
