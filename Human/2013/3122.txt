Using Mathematica & Matlab for CAGD/CAD research and education

In CAGD/CAD research and education, users are involved with development of mathematical algorithms and followed by the analysis of the resultant algorithm. This process involves geometric display which can only be carried out with high end graphics display. There are many approaches practiced and one of the so-called easiest approaches is by using C/C++ programming language and OpenGL application program interface, API. There are practitioners uses C/C++ programming language to develop the algorithms and finally utilize AutoCAD for graphics display. On the other hand, high end CAD users manage to use Auto Lisp as their programming language in AutoCAD. Nevertheless, these traditional ways are definitely time consuming. This paper introduces an alternative method whereby the practitioners may maximize scientific computation programs, SCPs: Mathematica and MATLAB in the context of CAGD/CAD for research and education.
