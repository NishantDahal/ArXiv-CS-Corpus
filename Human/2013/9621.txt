A binary deletion channel with a fixed number of deletions

Suppose a binary string x = x_1...x_n is being broadcast repeatedly over a faulty communication channel. Each time, the channel delivers a fixed number m of the digits (m<n) with the lost digits chosen uniformly at random, and the order of the surviving digits preserved. How large does m have to be to reconstruct the message?
