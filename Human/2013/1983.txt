Image Interpolation Using Kriging Technique for Spatial Data

Image interpolation has been used spaciously by customary interpolation techniques. Recently, Kriging technique has been widely implemented in simulation area and geostatistics for prediction. In this article, Kriging technique was used instead of the classical interpolation methods to predict the unknown points in the digital image array. The efficiency of the proposed technique was proven using the PSNR and compared with the traditional interpolation techniques. The results showed that Kriging technique is almost accurate as cubic interpolation and in some images Kriging has higher accuracy. A miscellaneous test images have been used to consolidate the proposed technique.
