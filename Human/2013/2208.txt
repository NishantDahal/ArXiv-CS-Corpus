Fast and efficient exact synthesis of single qubit unitaries generated by Clifford and T gates

In this paper, we show the equivalence of the set of unitaries computable by the circuits over the Clifford and T library and the set of unitaries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},i]$, in the single-qubit case. We report an efficient synthesis algorithm, with an exact optimality guarantee on the number of Hadamard and T gates used. We conjecture that the equivalence of the sets of unitaries implementable by circuits over the Clifford and T library and unitaries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},i]$ holds in the $n$-qubit case.
