Toward Recovering Complete SRS for Softbody Simulation System and a Sample Application -- a Team 9a SOEN6481 W13 Project Report

This document aims at specifying the requirements and capturing the needs of users for building a softbody simulation system. This system has different applications ranging from computer games to surgery training which facilitates the creation and visualization of a certain softbody object. It also allows users to interact with created object at real time. A softbody or deformable object is an object whose shape changes due to an external force. Deformation type varies depending on the amount of object deformation. Each object can have multiple layers and each layer can have its own properties. So layers can be different in pressure, density and motion.
