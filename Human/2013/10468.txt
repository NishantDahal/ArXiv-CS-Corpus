Linear Extended Whitening Filters

In this paper we present a class of linear whitening filters termed linear extended whitening filters (EWFs) which are whitening filters that have desirable secondary properties and can be used for simplifying algorithms, or achieving desired side-effects on given secondary matrices, random vectors or random processes. Further, we present an application of EWFs for simplification of QR decomposition based ML detection algorithm in Wireless Communication.
