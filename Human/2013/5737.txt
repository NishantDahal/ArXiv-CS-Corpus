The Metadata Anonymization Toolkit

This document summarizes the experience of Julien Voisin during the 2011 edition of the well-known \emph{Google Summer of Code}. This project is a first step in the domain of metadata anonymization in Free Software. This article is articulated in three parts. First, a state of the art and a categorization of usual metadata, then the privacy policy is exposed/discussed in order to find the right balance between information lost and privacy enhancement. Finally, the specification of the Metadata Anonymization Toolkit (MAT) is presented, and future possible works are sketched.
