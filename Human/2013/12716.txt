Evaluation of Software Architecture Quality Attribute for an Internet Banking System

The design phase plays a vital role than all other phases in the software development. Software Architecture has to meet both the functional and non-functional quality requirements. The Evaluation of Architecture has to be performed, so that the developers are assured that their selected Architecture will reduce the cost and effort and also enhances the various quality attributes like Availability, Reusability, Performance, Modifiability and Extendibility. The success of the system depends upon the Architecture Evaluation by the essential method to the system. The overall ranking of the candidate architecture is ascertained by assigning weight to the scenario and scenario interaction. In this paper, SAAM method is taken to evaluate the two architectures from the various available method and techniques to achieve the various quality attributes by weight metric.
