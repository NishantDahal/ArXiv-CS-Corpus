Sentence complexity of theorems in Mizar

As one of the longest-running computer-assisted formal mathematics projects, large tracts of mathematical knowledge have been formalized with the help of the Mizar system. Because Mizar is based on first-order classical logic and set theory, and because of its emphasis on pure mathematics, the Mizar library offers a cornucopia for the researcher interested in foundations of mathematics. With Mizar, one can adopt an experimental approach and take on problems in foundations, at least those which are amenable to such experimentation. Addressing a question posed by H. Friedman, we use Mizar to take on the question of surveying the sentence complexity (measured by quantifier alternation) of mathematical theorems. We find, as Friedman suggests, that the sentence complexity of most Mizar theorems is universal ($Î _{1}$, or $\forall$), and as one goes higher in the sentence complexity hierarchy the number of Mizar theorems having these complexities decreases rapidly. The results support the intuitive idea that mathematical statements, even when carried out an abstract set-theoretical style, are usually quite low in the sentence complexity hierarchy (not more complex than $\forall\exists\forall$ or $\exists\forall$).
