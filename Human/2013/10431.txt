Green Communication via Power-optimized HARQ Protocols

Recently, efficient use of energy has become an essential research topic for green communication. This paper studies the effect of optimal power controllers on the performance of delay-sensitive communication setups utilizing hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). The results are obtained for repetition time diversity (RTD) and incremental redundancy (INR) HARQ protocols. In all cases, the optimal power allocation, minimizing the outage-limited average transmission power, is obtained under both continuous and bursting communication models. Also, we investigate the system throughput in different conditions. The results indicate that the power efficiency is increased substantially, if adaptive power allocation is utilized. For instance, assume Rayleigh-fading channel, a maximum of two (re)transmission rounds with rates $\{1,\frac{1}{2}\}$ nats-per-channel-use and an outage probability constraint ${10}^{-3}$. Then, compared to uniform power allocation, optimal power allocation in RTD reduces the average power by 9 and 11 dB in the bursting and continuous communication models, respectively. In INR, these values are obtained to be 8 and 9 dB, respectively.
