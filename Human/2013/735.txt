The Černý conjecture for small automata: experimental report

We present a report from a series of experiments involving computation of the shortest reset words for automata with small number of states. We confirm that the Černý conjecture is true for all automata with at most 11 states on 2 letters. Also some new interesting results were obtained, including the third gap in the distribution of the shortest reset words and new slowly synchronizing classes of automata.
