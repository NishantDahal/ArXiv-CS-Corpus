Towards modelling cost and risks of infrequent events in the cargo screening process

We introduce a simulation model of the port of Calais with a focus on the operation of immigration controls. Our aim is to compare the cost and benefits of different screening policies. Methodologically, we are trying to understand the limits of discrete event simulation of rare events. When will they become 'too rare' for simulation to give meaningful results?
