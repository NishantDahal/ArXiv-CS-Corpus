Convexity in source separation: Models, geometry, and algorithms

Source separation or demixing is the process of extracting multiple components entangled within a signal. Contemporary signal processing presents a host of difficult source separation problems, from interference cancellation to background subtraction, blind deconvolution, and even dictionary learning. Despite the recent progress in each of these applications, advances in high-throughput sensor technology place demixing algorithms under pressure to accommodate extremely high-dimensional signals, separate an ever larger number of sources, and cope with more sophisticated signal and mixing models. These difficulties are exacerbated by the need for real-time action in automated decision-making systems.
  Recent advances in convex optimization provide a simple framework for efficiently solving numerous difficult demixing problems. This article provides an overview of the emerging field, explains the theory that governs the underlying procedures, and surveys algorithms that solve them efficiently. We aim to equip practitioners with a toolkit for constructing their own demixing algorithms that work, as well as concrete intuition for why they work.
