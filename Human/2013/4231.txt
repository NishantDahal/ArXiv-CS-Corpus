A Paradigm for the Application of Cloud Computing in Mobile Intelligent Tutoring Systems

Nowadays, with the rapid growth of cloud computing, many industries are going to move their computing activities to clouds. Researchers of virtual learning are also looking for the ways to use clouds through mobile platforms. This paper offers a model to accompany the benefits of "Mobile Intelligent Learning" technology and "Cloud Computing". The architecture of purposed system is based on multi-layer architecture of Mobile Cloud Computing. Despite the existing challenges, the system has increased the life of mobile device battery. It will raise working memory capacity and processing capacity of the educational system in addition to the greater advantage of the educational system. The proposed system allows the users to enjoy an intelligent learning every-time and every-where, reduces training costs and hardware dependency, and increases consistency, efficiency, and data reliability.
