GV-Index:Scientific Contribution Rating Index That Takes into Account the Growth Degree of Research Area and Variance Values of the Publication Year of Cited Paper

There are a wide variety of scientific contribution rating indices including the impact factor and h-index. These are used for quantitative analyses on research papers published in the past, and therefore unable to incorporate in the assessment the growth, or deterioration, of the research area: whether the research area of a particular paper is in decline or conversely in a growing trend. Other hand, the use of the conventional rating indices may result in higher rates for papers that are hardly referenced nowadays in other papers although frequently cited in the past. This study proposes a new type of scientific contribution ranking index, "Growing Degree of Research Area and Variance Values Index (GV-Index)". The GV-Index is computed by a principal component analysis based on an estimated value obtained by PageRank Algorithm, which takes into account the growing degree of the research area and its variance. We also propose visualization system of a scientist's network using the GV-Index.
