Asymptotic Analysis and Random Sampling of Digitally Convex Polyominoes

Recent work of Brlek \textit{et al.} gives a characterization of digitally convex polyominoes using combinatorics on words. From this work, we derive a combinatorial symbolic description of digitally convex polyominoes and use it to analyze their limit properties and build a uniform sampler. Experimentally, our sampler shows a limit shape for large digitally convex polyominoes.
