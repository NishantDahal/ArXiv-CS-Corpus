MC-curves and aesthetic measurements for pseudospiral curve segments

This article studies families of curves with monotonic curvature function (MC-curves) and their applications in geometric modelling and aesthetic design. Aesthetic analysis and assessment of the structure and plastic qualities of pseudospirals, which are curves with monotonic curvature function, are conducted for the first time in the field of geometric modelling from the position of technical aesthetics laws. The example of car body surface modelling with the use of aesthetics splines is given.
