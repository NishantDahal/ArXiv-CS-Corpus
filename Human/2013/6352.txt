A Fast Fault Tolerant Partitioning Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks

In this paper, given a random uniform distribution of sensor nodes on a 2-D plane, a fast self-organized distributed algorithm is proposed to find the maximum number of partitions of the nodes such that each partition is connected and covers the area to be monitored. Each connected partition remains active in a round robin fashion to cover the query region individually. In case of a node failure, the proposed distributed fault recovery algorithm reconstructs the affected partition locally utilizing the available free nodes. Simulation studies show significant improvement in performance compared to the earlier works in terms of computation time, the diameter of each partition, message overhead and network lifetime.
