An Improved Variable Step-size Affine Projection Sign Algorithm for Echo Cancellation

This paper proposes an improved variable step-size (VSS) algorithm for the recently introduced affine projection sign algorithm (APSA) based on the recovery of the near-end signal energy in the error signal. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to the previous VSS for APSA, the proposed approach provides both more robustness to impulse interference and better tracking ability of echo path change.
