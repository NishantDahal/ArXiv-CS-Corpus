A Face-like Structure Detection on Planet and Satellite Surfaces using Image Processing

This paper demonstrates that face-like structures are everywhere, and can be de-tected automatically even with computers. Huge amount of satellite images of the Earth, the Moon, the Mars are explored and many interesting face-like structure are detected. Throughout this fact, we believe that science and technologies can alert people not to easily become an occultist.
