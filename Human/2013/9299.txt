Cable-Driven Robots with Wireless Control Capability for Pedagogical Illustration in Science

Science teaching in secondary schools is often abstract for students. Even if some experiments can be conducted in classrooms, mainly for chemistry or some physics fields, mathematics is not an experimental science. Teachers have to convince students that theorems have practical implications. We present teachers an original and easy-to-use pedagogical tool: a cable-driven robot with a Web-based remote control interface. The robot implements several scientific concepts such as 3D-geometry and kinematics. The remote control enables the teacher to move freely in the classroom.
