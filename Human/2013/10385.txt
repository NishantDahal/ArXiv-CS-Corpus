The BeiHang Keystroke Dynamics Authentication System

Keystroke Dynamics is an important biometric solution for person authentication. Based upon keystroke dynamics, this paper designs an embedded password protection device, develops an online system, collects two public databases for promoting the research on keystroke authentication, exploits the Gabor filter bank to characterize keystroke dynamics, and provides benchmark results of three popular classification algorithms, one-class support vector machine, Gaussian classifier, and nearest neighbour classifier.
