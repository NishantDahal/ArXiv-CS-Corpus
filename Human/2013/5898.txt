Time-Domain Large Signal Investigation on Dynamic Responses of the GDCC Quarterly Wavelength Shifted Distributed Feedback Semiconductor Laser

A numerical investigation on the dynamic large-signal analysis using a time-domain traveling wave model of quarter wave-shifted distributed feedback semiconductor lasers diode with a Gaussian distribution of the coupling coefficient (GDCC) is presented. It is found that the single-mode behavior and the more hole-burning effect corrections of quarter wave-shifted distributed feedback laser with large coupling coefficient can be improved significantly by this new proposed light source.
