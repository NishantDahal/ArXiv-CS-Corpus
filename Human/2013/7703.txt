Suggest an Aspect-Oriented Design Approach for UML Communication Diagram

More and more works are done on the design of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) which is designed to help us for modeling effective object oriented software, Existing Object-Oriented design methods are not mature enough to capture non-functional requirement such as concurrency, fault tolerance, distribution and persistence of a software approach. Our approach proposed to use aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) mechanisms to solve the issues for interactions of the communication diagram in UML that support only the Object-Oriented mechanisms,thus AOSD allow to design programs that are out of reach of strict Object-Orientation and could possibly improve the structures and implementations.
