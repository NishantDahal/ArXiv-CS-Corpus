DLOLIS-A: Description Logic based Text Ontology Learning

Ontology Learning has been the subject of intensive study for the past decade. Researchers in this field have been motivated by the possibility of automatically building a knowledge base on top of text documents so as to support reasoning based knowledge extraction. While most works in this field have been primarily statistical (known as light-weight Ontology Learning) not much attempt has been made in axiomatic Ontology Learning (called heavy-weight Ontology Learning) from Natural Language text documents. Heavy-weight Ontology Learning supports more precise formal logic-based reasoning when compared to statistical ontology learning. In this paper we have proposed a sound Ontology Learning tool DLOL_(IS-A) that maps English language IS-A sentences into their equivalent Description Logic (DL) expressions in order to automatically generate a consistent pair of T-box and A-box thereby forming both regular (definitional form) and generalized (axiomatic form) DL ontology. The current scope of the paper is strictly limited to IS-A sentences that exclude the possible structures of: (i) implicative IS-A sentences, and (ii) "Wh" IS-A questions. Other linguistic nuances that arise out of pragmatics and epistemic of IS-A sentences are beyond the scope of this present work. We have adopted Gold Standard based Ontology Learning evaluation on chosen IS-A rich Wikipedia documents.
