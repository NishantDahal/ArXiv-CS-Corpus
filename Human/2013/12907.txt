Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP): Robust and Efficient for Data Centre Applications

Due to rapid advancement in modern technology, as one of the major concerns is the stability of business. The organizations depend on their systems to provide robust and faster processing of information for their operations. Efficient data centers are key sources to handle these operations. If the organizational system is not fully functional, the performance of organization may be impaired or clogged completely. With the developments of real-time applications into data centers for data communications, there is a need to use an alternative of the standard TCP protocol to provide reliable data transfer. Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) consists of several well built-in characteristics that make it capable to work efficiently with real-time applications. In this paper, we evaluate an optimized version of STCP. The optimized version of SCTP is tested against a non optimized version of STCP and TCP in a data center environment. Simulations of the protocols are carried using NS2 simulator
