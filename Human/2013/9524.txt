Probability and the Classical/Quantum Divide

This paper considers the problem of distinguishing between classical and quantum domains in macroscopic phenomena using tests based on probability and it presents a condition on the ratios of the outcomes being the same (Ps) to being different (Pn). Given three events, Ps/Pn for the classical case, where there are no 3-way coincidences, is one-half whereas for the quantum state it is one-third. For non-maximally entangled objects we find that so long as r < 5.83, we can separate them from classical objects using a probability test. For maximally entangled particles (r = 1), we propose that the value of 5/12 be used for Ps/Pn to separate classical and quantum states when no other information is available and measurements are noisy.
