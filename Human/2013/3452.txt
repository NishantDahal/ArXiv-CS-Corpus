Symmetry Based Cluster Approach for Automatic Recognition of the Epileptic Focus in Brain Using PET Scan Image : An Analysis

Recognition of epileptic focal point is the important diagnosis when screening the epilepsy patients for latent surgical cures. The accurate localization is challenging one because of the low spatial resolution images with more noisy data. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) has now replaced the issues and caring a high resolution. This paper focuses the research of automated localization of epileptic seizures in brain functional images using symmetry based cluster approach. This approach presents a fully automated symmetry based brain abnormality detection method for PET sequences. PET images are spatially normalized to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard and then it has been trained using symmetry based cluster approach using Medical Image Processing, Analysis & Visualization (MIPAV) tool. The performance evolution is considered by the metric like accuracy of diagnosis. The obtained result is surely assists the surgeon for the automated identification of seizures focus.
