Treating clitics with minimalist grammars

We propose an extension of Stabler's version of clitics treatment for a wider coverage of the French language. For this, we present the lexical entries needed in the lexicon. Then, we show the recognition of complex syntactic phenomena as (left and right) dislo- cation, clitic climbing over modal and extraction from determiner phrase. The aim of this presentation is the syntax-semantic interface for clitics analyses in which we will stress on clitic climbing over verb and raising verb.
