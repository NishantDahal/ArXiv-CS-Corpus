A Low-Voltage, Low-Power 4-bit BCD Adder, designed using the Clock Gated Power Gating, and the DVT Scheme

This paper proposes a Low-Power, Energy Efficient 4-bit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) adder design where the conventional 4-bit BCD adder has been modified with the Clock Gated Power Gating Technique. Moreover, the concept of DVT (Dual-vth) scheme has been introduced while designing the full adder blocks to reduce the Leakage Power, as well as, to maintain the overall performance of the entire circuit. The reported architecture of 4-bit BCD adder is designed using 45 nm technology and it consumes 1.384 Î¼Watt of Average Power while operating with a frequency of 200 MHz, and a Supply Voltage (Vdd) of 1 Volt. The results obtained from different simulation runs on SPICE, indicate the superiority of the proposed design compared to the conventional 4-bit BCD adder. Considering the product of Average Power and Delay, for the operating frequency of 200 MHz, a fair 47.41 % reduction compared to the conventional design has been achieved with this proposed scheme.
