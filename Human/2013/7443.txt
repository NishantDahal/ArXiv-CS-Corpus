Agent Based Software Testing Framework (ABSTF) for Application Maintenance

Software testing framework can be stated as the process of verifying and validating that a computer program/application works as expected and meets the requirements of the user. Usually testing can be done manually or using tools. Manual testing can be time consuming and tedious, also it requires heavy investment of human resources. Testing tools in fact have many advantages and are widely used nowadays, but also has several disadvantages. One particular problem is that human intervention is no longer needed. Testing tools are of high cost and so, it cannot be used for small companies. Hence in this paper we propose Agent based testing, which is a fast growing approach in testing field. The proposed system (ABSTF) has to reduce the application testing moment, easily find out bug and solve the bug by Regression Testing. Here by we are going to use a safe efficient regression selection technique algorithm to selectively retest the modified program. We also use Traceability relation of completeness checking for agent oriented system, which identifies missing elements in entire application and classifies defect in the testing moment. With the ability of agents to act autonomously, monitoring code changes and generating test cases for the changed version of code can be done dynamically.
