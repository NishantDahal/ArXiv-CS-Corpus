Immersive VR Visualizations by VFIVE. Part 2: Applications

VFIVE is a scientific visualization application for CAVE-type immersive virtual reality systems. The source codes are freely available. VFIVE is used as a research tool in various VR systems. It also lays the groundwork for developments of new visualization software for CAVEs. In this paper, we pick up five CAVE systems in four different institutions in Japan. Applications of VFIVE in each CAVE system are summarized. Special emphases will be placed on scientific and technical achievements made possible by VFIVE.
