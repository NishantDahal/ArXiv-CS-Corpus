Efficient quantum algorithm to construct arbitrary Dicke states

In this paper, we study efficient algorithms towards the construction of any arbitrary Dicke state. Our contribution is to use proper symmetric Boolean functions that involve manipulations with Krawtchouk polynomials. Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Grover algorithm and the parity measurement technique are stitched together to devise the complete algorithm. Further, motivated by the work of Childs et al (2002), we explore how one can plug the biased Hadamard transformation in our strategy. Our work compares fairly with the results of Childs et al (2002).
