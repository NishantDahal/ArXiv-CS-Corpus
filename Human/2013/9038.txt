Beyond Log-Supermodularity: Lower Bounds and the Bethe Partition Function

A recent result has demonstrated that the Bethe partition function always lower bounds the true partition function of binary, log-supermodular graphical models. We demonstrate that these results can be extended to other interesting classes of graphical models that are not necessarily binary or log-supermodular: the ferromagnetic Potts model with a uniform external field and its generalizations and special classes of weighted graph homomorphism problems.
