Quorums Quicken Queries: Efficient Asynchronous Secure Multiparty Computation

We describe an asynchronous algorithm to solve secure multiparty computation (MPC) over n players, when strictly less than a 1/8 fraction of the players are controlled by a static adversary. For any function f over a field that can be computed by a circuit with m gates, our algorithm requires each player to send a number of field elements and perform an amount of computation that is O (m/n + \sqrt{n}). This significantly improves over traditional algorithms, which require each player to both send a number of messages and perform computation that is Î©(nm). Additionally, we define the threshold counting problem and present a distributed algorithm to solve it in the asynchronous communication model. Our algorithm is load balanced, with computation, communication and latency complexity of O(log n), and may be of independent interest to other applications with a load balancing goal in mind.
