Cooperative Caching Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing

Due to the advancement in mobile devices and wireless networks mobile cloud computing, which combines mobile computing and cloud computing has gained momentum since 2009. The characteristics of mobile devices and wireless network makes the implementation of mobile cloud computing more complicated than for fixed clouds. This section lists some of the major issues in Mobile Cloud Computing. One of the key issues in mobile cloud computing is the end to end delay in servicing a request. Data caching is o ne of the techniques widely used in wired and wireless networks to improve data access efficiency. In this paper we explore the possibility of a cooperative caching approach to enhance data access efficiency in mobile cloud computing. The proposed approach is based on cloudlets, one of the architecture designed for mobile cloud computing.
