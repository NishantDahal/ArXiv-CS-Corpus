Syntactic Complexity of Circular Semi-Flower Automata

We investigate the syntactic complexity of certain types of finitely generated submonoids of a free monoid. In fact, we consider those submonoids which are accepted by circular semi-flower automata (CSFA). Here, we show that the syntactic complexity of CSFA with at most one `branch point going in' (bpi) is linear. Further, we prove that the syntactic complexity of $n$-state CSFA with two bpis over a binary alphabet is $2n(n+1)$.
