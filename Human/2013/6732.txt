Opportunistic Interference Alignment for MIMO Interfering Multiple-Access Channels

We consider the $K$-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interfering multiple-access channel (IMAC) with time-invariant channel coefficients, where each cell consists of a base station (BS) with $M$ antennas and $N$ users having $L$ antennas each. In this paper, we propose two opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) techniques utilizing multiple transmit antennas at each user: antenna selection-based OIA and singular value decomposition (SVD)-based OIA. Their performance is analyzed in terms of \textit{user scaling law} required to achieve $KS$ degrees-of-freedom (DoF), where $S(\le M)$ denotes the number of simultaneously transmitting users per cell. We assume that each selected user transmits a single data stream at each time-slot. It is shown that the antenna selection-based OIA does not fundamentally change the user scaling condition if $L$ is fixed, compared with the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) IMAC case, which is given by $\text{SNR}^{(K 1)S}$, where SNR denotes the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we show that the SVD-based OIA can greatly reduce the user scaling condition to $\text{SNR}^{(K-1)S-L+1}$ through optimizing a weight vector at each user. Simulation results validate the derived scaling laws of the proposed OIA techniques. The sum-rate performance of the proposed OIA techniques is compared with the conventional techniques in MIMO IMAC channels and it is shown that the proposed OIA techniques outperform the conventional techniques.
