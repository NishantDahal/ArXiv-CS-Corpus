Comparative Study of Simulation for Vehicular Ad-hoc Network

In this paper we have discussed about the number of automobiles that has been increased on the road in the past few years. Due to high density of vehicles, the potential threats and road accident is increasing. Wireless technology is aiming to equip technology in vehicles to reduce these factors by sending messages to each other. The vehicular safety application should be thoroughly tested before it is deployed in a real world to use. Simulator tool has been preferred over out door experiment because it simple, easy and cheap. VANET requires that a traffic and network simulator should be used together to perform this test. Many tools exist for this purpose but most of them have the problem with the proper interaction. Simulating vehicular networks with external stimulus to analyze its effect on wireless communication but to do this job a good simulator is also needed.
