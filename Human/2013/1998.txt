On the need for optimization of the software development processes in short-term projects

Nowadays, most of the software development projects in Mexico are short-term projects (micro and small projects); for this reason, in this paper we are presenting a research proposal with the goal of identifying the elements contributing to their success or failure. With this research, we are trying to identify and propose techniques and tools that would contribute in the successful outcome of these projects.
