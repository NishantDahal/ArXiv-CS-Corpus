Agent Based Negotiation using Cloud - an Approach in E-Commerce

Cloud computing allows subscription based access to computing. It also allows storage services over Internet. Automated Negotiation is becoming an emerging, and important area in the field of Multi Agent Systems in ECommerce. Multi Agent based negotiation system is necessary to increase the efficiency of E-negotiation process. Cloud computing provides security and privacy to the user data and low maintenance costs. We propose a Negotiation system using cloud. In this system, all product information and multiple agent details are stored on cloud. Both parties select their agents through cloud for negotiation. Agent acts as a negotiator. Agents have users details and their requirements for a particular product. Using users requirement, agents negotiate on some issues such as price, volume, duration, quality and so on. After completing negotiation process, agents give feedback to the user about whether negotiation is successful or not. This negotiation system is dynamic in nature and increases the agents with the increase in participating user.
