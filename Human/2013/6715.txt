Design and Analysis of a Multi-Carrier Differential Chaos Shift Keying Communication System

A new Multi-Carrier Differential Chaos Shift Keying (MC-DCSK) modulation is presented in this paper. The system endeavors to provide a good trade-off between robustness, energy efficiency and high data rate, while still being simple compared to conventional multi-carrier spread spectrum systems. This system can be seen as a parallel extension of the DCSK modulation where one chaotic reference sequence is transmitted over a predefined subcarrier frequency. Multiple modulated data streams are transmitted over the remaining subcarriers. This transmitter structure increases the spectral efficiency of the conventional DCSK system and uses less energy. The receiver design makes this system easy to implement where no radio frequency (RF) delay circuit is needed to demodulate received data. Various system design parameters are discussed throughout the paper, including the number of subcarriers, the spreading factor, and the transmitted energy. Once the design is explained, the bit error rate performance of the MC-DCSK system is computed and compared to the conventional DCSK system under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels. Simulation results confirm the advantages of this new hybrid design.
