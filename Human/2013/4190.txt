A Survey of Software Reliability Models

Software reliability analysis is performed at various stages during the process of engineering software as an attempt to evaluate if the software reliability requirements have been (or might be) met. In this report, I present a summary of some fundamental black-box and white-box software reliability models. I also present some general shortcomings of these models and suggest avenues for further research.
