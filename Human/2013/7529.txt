An Efficient Multiplication Algorithm Using Nikhilam Method

Multiplication is one of the most important operation in computer arithmetic. Many integer operations such as squaring, division and computing reciprocal require same order of time as multiplication whereas some other operations such as computing GCD and residue operation require at most a factor of $\log n$ time more than multiplication. We propose an integer multiplication algorithm using Nikhilam method of Vedic mathematics which can be used to multiply two binary numbers efficiently.
