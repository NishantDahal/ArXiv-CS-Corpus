Notes on Physical & Logical Data Layouts

In this short note I review and discuss fundamental options for physical and logical data layouts as well as the impact of the choices on data processing. I should say in advance that these notes offer no new insights, that is, everything stated here has already been published elsewhere. In fact, it has been published in so many different places, such as blog posts, in the literature, etc. that the main contribution is to bring it all together in one place.
