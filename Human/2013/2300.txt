Object Oriented Model for Evaluation of On-Chip Networks

The Network on Chip (NoC) paradigm is rapidly replacing bus based System on Chip (SoC) designs due to their inherent disadvantages such as non-scalability, saturation and congestion. Currently very few tools are available for the simulation and evaluation of on-chip architectures. This study proposes a generic object oriented model for performance evaluation of on-chip interconnect architectures and algorithms. The generic nature of the proposed model can help the researchers in evaluation of any kind of on-chip switching networks. The model was applied on 2D-Mesh and 2D-Diagonal-Mesh on-chip switching networks for verification and selection of best out of both the analyzed architectures. The results show the superiority of 2D-Diagonal-Mesh over 2D-Mesh in terms of average packet delay.
