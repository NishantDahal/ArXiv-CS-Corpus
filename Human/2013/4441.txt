Web Services Modeling and Composition Approach using Object-Oriented Petri Nets

Nowadays, with the emergence and the evolution of new technologies, such as e-business, a large number of companies are connected to Internet, and have proposed web services to trade. Web services as presented, are conceptually limited components to relatively simple functionalities. Generally, a single service does not satisfy the users needs that are more and more complex. Therefore, services must be made able to be composed to offer added value services. In this paper, a web services composition approach, modelled by Objects-Oriented Petri nets, is presented. In his context, an expressive algebra, which successfully solves the web services complex composition problem, is proposed. A java tool that allows automating this approach; based on a definite algebra and a G-nets meta-model, proposed by us, is developed.
