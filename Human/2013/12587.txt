On resources and tasks

Essentially being an extended abstract of the author's 1998 PhD thesis, this paper introduces an extension of the language of linear logic with a semantics which treats sentences as tasks rather than true/false statements. A resource is understood as an agent capable of accomplishing the task expressed by such a sentence. It is argued that the corresponding logic can be used as a planning logic, whose advantage over the traditional comprehensive planning logics is that it avoids the representationalframe problem and significantly alleviates the inferential frame problem.
