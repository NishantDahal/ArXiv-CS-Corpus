Proceedings First Workshop on Control Operators and their Semantics

The focus of the papers presented in this volume is on the interplay between syntax and semantics in case of languages, namely the central question of what a program means and how it does define the intended procedure. This is a crucial issue especially in the case of control operators, since they are as powerful as potentially obscure, and programs that use them are usually more error-prone than purely declarative ones.  The included contributions provide perspectives on the topic of control operators via operational semantics of formal calculi as well as type assignment systems, denotational semantics, game semantics, category theory and logic.
