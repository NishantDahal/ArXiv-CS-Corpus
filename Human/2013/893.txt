Reliable Robust and Real-Time Communication Protocol for Data Delivery in Wireless sensor Networks

WSNs can be considered a distributed control system designed to react to sensor information with an effective and timely action. For this reason, in WSNs it is important to provide real-time coordination and communication to guarantee timely execution of the right actions. In this paper a new communication protocol RRRT to support robust real-time and reliable event data delivery with minimum energy consumption and with congestion avoidance in WSNs is proposed. The proposed protocol uses the fault tolerant optimal path for data delivery. The proposed solution dynamically adjust their protocol configurations to adapt to the heterogeneous characteristics of WSNs. Specifically, the interactions between contention resolution and congestion control mechanisms as well as the physical layer effects in WSNs are investigated.
