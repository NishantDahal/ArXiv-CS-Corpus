A Receiver-Centric OFCDM Approach with Subcarrier Grouping

In this letter, following a cross-layer design concept, we propose a novel subcarrier grouping technique for Orthogonal Frequency and Code Division Multiplexing (OFCDM) multiuser systems. We adopt a two dimensional (2D) spreading, so as to achieve both frequency- and time-domain channel gain. Furthermore, we enable a receiver-centric approach, where the receiver rather than a potential sender controls the admission decision of the communication establishment. We study the robustness of the proposed scheme in terms of the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) and the outage probability. The derived results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the classical OFCDM approach.
