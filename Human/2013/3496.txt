A Review On Securing Distributed Systems Using Symmetric Key Cryptography

This review is aimed to evaluate the importance of Symmetric Key Cryptography for Security in Distributed Systems. Businesses around the world as well as research and other such areas rely heavily on distributed systems these days. Hence, security is also a major concern due to the openness of the system. Out of the various available security measures, we, in this paper, concentrate in general on the symmetric key cryptographic technique. We review two widely used and popular symmetric key cryptographic algorithms, viz. DES and AES. These two algorithms are evaluated on the parameters such as key size, block size, number of iterations, etc.
