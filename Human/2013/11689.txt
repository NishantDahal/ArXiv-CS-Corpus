On Maximal Ratio Diversity with Weighting Errors for Physical Layer Security

In this letter, we introduce the performance of maximal ratio combining (MRC) with weighting errors for physical layer security. We assume both legitimate user and eavesdropper each equipped with multiple antennas employ non ideal MRC. The non ideal MRC is designed in terms of power correlation between the estimated and actual fadings. We derive new closedform and generalized expressions for secrecy outage probability. Next, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of secrecy outage probability for high signal-to-noise ratio in the main channel between legitimate user and transmitter. The asymptotic analysis provides the insights about actual diversity provided by MRC with weighting errors. We substantiate our claims with the analytic results and numerical evaluations.
