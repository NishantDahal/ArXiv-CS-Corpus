Simple Search Engine Model: Selective Properties

In this paper we study the relationship between query and search engine by exploring the selective properties based on a simple search engine. We used the set theory and utilized the words and terms for defining singleton and doubleton in the event spaces and then provided their implementation for proving the existence of the shadow of micro-cluster.
