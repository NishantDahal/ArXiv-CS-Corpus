Wavelet Based Authentication/Secret Transmission Through Image Resizing(WASTIR)

The paper is aimed for a wavelet based steganographic or watermarking technique in frequency domain termed as WASTIR for secret message or image transmission or image authentication. Number system conversion of the secret image by changing radix form decimal to quaternary is the pre-processing of the technique. Cover image scaling through inverse discrete wavelet transformation with false Horizontal and vertical coefficients are embedded with quaternary digits through hash function and a secret key. Experimental results are computed and compared with the existing steganographic techniques like WTSIC, Yuancheng Lis Method and Region-Based in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Image Fidelity (IF) which show better performances in WASTIR.
