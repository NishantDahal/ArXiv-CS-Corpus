Acoustic Echo Cancellation Postfilter Design Issues For Speech Recognition System

In this paper a generalized postfilter algorithm design issues are presented. This postfilter is used to jointly suppress late reverberation, residual echo, and background noise. When residual echo and noise are suppressed, the best result obtains by suppressing both interferences together after the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). The main advantage of this approach is that the residual echo and noise suppression does not suffer from the existence of a strong acoustic echo component. Furthermore, the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) does not suffer from the time-varying noise suppression. A disadvantage is that the input signal of the Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) has a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To overcome this problem, algorithms have been proposed where, apart from the joint suppression, a noise-reduced signal is used to adapt the echo canceller.
