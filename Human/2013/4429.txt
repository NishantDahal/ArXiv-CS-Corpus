Object-Oriented Translation for Programmable Relational System (DRAFT)

The paper introduces the principles of object-oriented translation for target machine which provides executing the sequences of elementary operations on persistent data presented as a set of relations (programmable relational system). The language of this target machine bases on formal operations of relational data model. An approach is given to convert both the description of complex object-oriented data structures and operations on these data, into a description of relational structures and operations on them. The proposed approach makes possible to extend the target relational language with commands allowing data be described as a set of complex persistent objects of different classes. Object views are introduced which allow relational operations be applied to the data of complex objects. It is shown that any operation and method can be executed on any group of the objects without explicit and implicit iterators. Binding of both attributes and methods with their polymorphic implementations are discussed. Classes can be co-used with relations as scalar domains, in referential integrity constraints and in data query operations.
