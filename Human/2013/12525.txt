Toward an agent based distillation approach for protesting crowd simulation

This paper investigates the problem of protesting crowd simulation. It considers CROCADILE, an agent based distillation system, for this purpose. A model of protesting crowd was determined and then a CROCADILE model of protesting crowd was engineered and demonstrated. We validated the model by using two scenarios where protesters are varied with different personalities. The results indicated that CROCADILE served well as the platform for protesting crowd modeling simulation
