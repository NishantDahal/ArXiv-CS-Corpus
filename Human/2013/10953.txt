Macro-trends in research on the central dogma of molecular biology

The central dogma of molecular biology, formulated more than five decades ago, compartmentalized information exchange in the cell into the DNA, RNA and protein domains. This formalization has served as an implicit thematic distinguisher for cell biological research ever since. However, a clear account of the distribution of research across this formalization over time does not exist. Abstracts of >3.5 million publications focusing on the cell from 1975 to 2011 were analyzed for the frequency of 100 single-word DNA-, RNA- and protein-centric search terms and amalgamated to produce domain- and subdomain-specific trends. A preponderance of protein- over DNA- and in turn over RNA-centric terms as a percentage of the total word count is evident until the early 1990s, at which point the trends for protein and DNA begin to coalesce while RNA percentages remain relatively unchanged. This term-based census provides a yearly snapshot of the distribution of research interests across the three domains of the central dogma of molecular biology. A frequency chart of the most dominantly-studied elements of the periodic table is provided as an addendum.
