Strategies for Generating Micro Explanations for Bayesian Belief Networks

Bayesian Belief Networks have been largely overlooked by Expert Systems practitioners on the grounds that they do not correspond to the human inference mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an explanation mechanism designed to generate intuitive yet probabilistically sound explanations of inferences drawn by a Bayesian Belief Network. In particular, our mechanism accounts for the results obtained due to changes in the causal and the evidential support of a node.
