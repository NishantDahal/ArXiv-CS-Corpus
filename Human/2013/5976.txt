Throughput and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Small Cell Networks with Multi-antenna Base Stations

Small cell networks have recently been proposed as an important evolution path for the next-generation cellular networks. However, with more and more irregularly deployed base stations (BSs), it is becoming increasingly difficult to quantify the achievable network throughput or energy efficiency. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for downlink performance evaluation of small cell networks, based on a random spatial network model, where BSs and users are modeled as two independent spatial Poisson point processes. A new simple expression of the outage probability is derived, which is analytically tractable and is especially useful with multi-antenna transmissions. This new result is then applied to evaluate the network throughput and energy efficiency. It is analytically shown that deploying more BSs or more BS antennas can always increase the network throughput, but the performance gain critically depends on the BS-user density ratio and the number of BS antennas. On the other hand, increasing the BS density or the number of transmit antennas will first increase and then decrease the energy efficiency if different components of BS power consumption satisfy certain conditions, and the optimal BS density and the optimal number of BS antennas can be found. Otherwise, the energy efficiency will always decrease. Simulation results shall demonstrate that our conclusions based on the random network model are general and also hold in a regular grid-based model.
