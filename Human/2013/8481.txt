Signature-Based Gröbner Basis Algorithms --- Extended MMM Algorithm for computing Gröbner bases

Signature-based algorithms is a popular kind of algorithms for computing Gröbner bases, and many related papers have been published recently. In this paper, no new signature-based algorithms and no new proofs are presented. Instead, a view of signature-based algorithms is given, that is, signature-based algorithms can be regarded as an extended version of the famous MMM algorithm. By this view, this paper aims to give an easier way to understand signature-based Gröbner basis algorithms.
