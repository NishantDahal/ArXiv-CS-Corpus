Beyond visual P300 based brain-computer interfacing paradigms

The paper reviews and summarizes recent developments in spatial auditory and tactile brain-computer interfacing neurotechology applications. It serves as the latest developments summary in "non-visual" brain-computer interfacing solutions presented in a tutorial delivered by the author at the IICST 2013 workshop. The novel concepts of unimodal auditory or tactile, as well as a bimodal combined paradigms are described and supported with recent research results from our BCI-lab research group at Life Science Center, University of Tsukuba, Japan. The newly developed experimental paradigms fit perfectly to needs of paralyzed or hearing impaired users, in case of tactile stimulus, as well as for able users who cannot utilize vision in computer or machine interaction (driving or operation of machinery required not disturbed eyesight). We present and review the EEG event related potential responses useful for brain computer interfacing applications beyond state-of-the-art visual paradigms. In conclusion the recent results are discussed and suggestions for further applications are drawn.
