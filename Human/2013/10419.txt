A Polyhedral Method to Compute All Affine Solution Sets of Sparse Polynomial Systems

To compute solutions of sparse polynomial systems efficiently we have to exploit the structure of their Newton polytopes. While the application of polyhedral methods naturally excludes solutions with zero components, an irreducible decomposition of a variety is typically understood in affine space, including also those components with zero coordinates. We present a polyhedral method to compute all affine solution sets of a polynomial system. The method enumerates all factors contributing to a generalized permanent. Toric solution sets are recovered as a special case of this enumeration. For sparse systems as adjacent 2-by-2 minors our methods scale much better than the techniques from numerical algebraic geometry.
