Evolution of the Chilean Web: A Larger Study

In this paper we extend our previous and only study on the dynamics of the Chilean Web. This new study doubles the time period and to the best of our knowledge is the only study of its type known about any country in the Web. The new results corroborate the trends found before, in particular the exponential growth of the Web, and reinforce the conclusion that the Web is more chaotic than we would like. Hence, modeling most Web characteristics is not trivial.
