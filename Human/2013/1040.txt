Web Portal for Photonic Technologies Using Grid Infrastructures

The modeling of physical processes is an integral part of scientific and technical research. In this area, the Extendible C++ Application in Quantum Technologies (ECAQT) package provides the numerical simulations and modeling of complex quantum systems in the presence of decoherence with wide applications in photonics. It allows creating models of interacting complex systems and simulates their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers. Physical simulations involving massive amounts of calculations are often executed on distributed computing infrastructures. It is often difficult for non expert users to use such computational infrastructures or even to use advanced libraries over the infrastructures, because they often require being familiar with middleware and tools, parallel programming techniques and packages. The P-RADE Grid Portal is a Grid portal solution that allows users to manage the whole life-cycle for executing a parallel application on the computing Grid infrastructures. The article describes the functionality and the structure of the web portal based on ECAQT package.
