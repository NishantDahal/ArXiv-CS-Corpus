OntoRich - A Support Tool for Semi-Automatic Ontology Enrichment and Evaluation

This paper presents the OntoRich framework, a support tool for semi-automatic ontology enrichment and evaluation. The WordNet is used to extract candidates for dynamic ontology enrichment from RSS streams. With the integration of OpenNLP the system gains access to syntactic analysis of the RSS news. The enriched ontologies are evaluated against several qualitative metrics.
