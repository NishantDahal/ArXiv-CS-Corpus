Towards an Updatable Strategy Logic

This article is about temporal multi-agent logics. Several of these formalisms have been already presented (ATL-ATL*, ATLsc, SL). They enable to express the capacities of agents in a system to ensure the satisfaction of temporal properties. Particularly, SL and ATLsc enable several agents to interact in a context mixing the different strategies they play in a semantical game. We generalize this possibility by proposing a new formalism, Updating Strategy Logic (USL). In USL, an agent can also refine its own strategy. The gain in expressive power rises the notion of "sustainable capacities" for agents.
  USL is built from SL. It mainly brings to SL the two following modifications: semantically, the successor of a given state is not uniquely determined by the data of one choice from each agent. Syntactically, we introduce in the language an operator, called an "unbinder", which explicitely deletes the binding of a strategy to an agent. We show that USL is strictly more expressive than SL.
