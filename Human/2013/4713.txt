Bringing simulation to implementation: Presentation of a global approach in the design of passive solar buildings under humid tropical climates

In early 1995, a DSM pilot initiative has been launched in the French islands of Guadeloupe and Reunion through a partnership between several public and private partners (the French Public Utility EDF, the University of Reunion Island, low cost housing companies, architects, energy consultants, etc...) to set up standards to improve thermal design of new residential buildings in tropical climates. This partnership led to defining optimized bio-climatic urban planning and architectural designs featuring the use of passive cooling architectural principles (solar shading, natural ventilation) and components, as well as energy efficient systems and technologies. The design and sizing of each architectural component on internal thermal comfort in building has been assessed with a validated thermal and airflow building simulation software (CODYRUN). These technical specifications have been edited in a reference document which has been used to build over 300 new pilot dwellings through the years 1996-1998 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe. An experimental monitoring has been made in these first ECODOM dwellings in 1998 and 1999. It will result in experimental validation of impact of the passive cooling strategies on thermal comfort of occupants leading to modify specifications if necessary. The paper present all the methodology used for the elaboration of ECODOM, from the simulations to the experimental results. This follow up is important, as the setting up of the ECODOM standard will be the first step towards the setting up of thermal regulations in the French overseas territories, by the year 2002.
