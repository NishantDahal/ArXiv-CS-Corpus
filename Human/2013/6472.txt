Planar 4-critical graphs with four triangles

By the Grunbaum-Aksenov Theorem (extending Grotzsch's Theorem) every planar graph with at most three triangles is 3-colorable. However, there are infinitely many planar 4-critical graphs with exactly four triangles. We describe all such graphs. This answers a question of Erdos from 1990.
