RandomBoost: Simplified Multi-class Boosting through Randomization

We propose a novel boosting approach to multi-class classification problems, in which multiple classes are distinguished by a set of random projection matrices in essence. The approach uses random projections to alleviate the proliferation of binary classifiers typically required to perform multi-class classification. The result is a multi-class classifier with a single vector-valued parameter, irrespective of the number of classes involved. Two variants of this approach are proposed. The first method randomly projects the original data into new spaces, while the second method randomly projects the outputs of learned weak classifiers. These methods are not only conceptually simple but also effective and easy to implement. A series of experiments on synthetic, machine learning and visual recognition data sets demonstrate that our proposed methods compare favorably to existing multi-class boosting algorithms in terms of both the convergence rate and classification accuracy.
