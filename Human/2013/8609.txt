Increasing Knowledge Worker Efficiency through a "Virtual Mirror" of the Social Network

In this paper we introduce a case study describing the combination of manual survey-based and e-mail-based social network analysis. The goal of the project was to increase collaboration efficiency in a team of consultants of a major high tech manufacturer. By analyzing the social network of a team of 42 consultants and comparing it with their utilization as the dependent variable, their efficiency in working together was improved in various way by bridging structure holes and eliminating bottlenecks, reducing stress for overburdened individuals, connecting isolated individuals and identifying the best network structures for high utilization and increased job satisfaction.
