Analyses and performance of techniques PAPR reduction for STBC MIMO-OFDM system in (4G) wireless communication

An OFDM system is combined with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in order to increase the diversity gain and system capacity over the time variant frequency-selective channels. However, a major drawback of MIMO-OFDM system is that the transmitted signals on different antennas might exhibit high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).In this paper, we present a PAPR analysis reduction of space-timeblock-coded (STBC) MIMO-OFDM system for 4G wirelessnetworks. Several techniques have been used to reduce the PAPR of the (STBC) MIMOOFDM system: clipping and filtering, partial transmit sequence (PTS) and selected mapping (SLM). Simulation results show that clipping and filtering provides a better PAPR reduction than the others methods and only SLM technique conserve the PAPR reduction in reception part of signal.
