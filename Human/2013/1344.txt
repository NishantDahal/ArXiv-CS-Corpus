A Meta-Theory of Boundary Detection Benchmarks

Human labeled datasets, along with their corresponding evaluation algorithms, play an important role in boundary detection. We here present a psychophysical experiment that addresses the reliability of such benchmarks. To find better remedies to evaluate the performance of any boundary detection algorithm, we propose a computational framework to remove inappropriate human labels and estimate the intrinsic properties of boundaries.
