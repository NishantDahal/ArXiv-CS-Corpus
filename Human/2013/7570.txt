The MacWilliams identity for $m$-spotty weight enumerator over $\mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2+\cdots+u^{m-1}\mathbb{F}_2$

Past few years have seen an extensive use of RAM chips with wide I/O data (e.g. 16, 32, 64 bits) in computer memory systems. These chips are highly vulnerable to a special type of byte error, called an $m$-spotty byte error, which can be effectively detected or corrected using byte error-control codes. The MacWilliams identity provides the relationship between the weight distribution of a code and that of its dual. The main purpose of this paper is to present a version of the MacWilliams identity for $m$-spotty weight enumerators over $\mathbbm{F}_{2}+u\mathbbm{F}_{2}+\cdots+u^{m-1}\mathbbm{F}_{2}$ (shortly $R_{u, m, 2}$).
