Logique math√©matique et linguistique formelle

As the etymology of the word shows, logic is intimately related to language, as exemplified by the work of philosophers from Antiquity and from the Middle-Age. At the beginning of the XX century, the crisis of the foundations of mathematics invented mathematical logic and imposed logic as a language-based foundation for mathematics. How did the relations between logic and language evolved in this newly defined mathematical framework? After a survey of the history of the relation between logic and linguistics, traditionally focused on semantics, we focus on some present issues: 1) grammar as a deductive system 2) the transformation of the syntactic structure of a sentence to a logical formula representing its meaning 3) taking into account the context when interpreting words. This lecture shows that type theory provides a convenient framework both for natural language syntax and for the interpretation of any of tis level (words, sentences, discourse).
