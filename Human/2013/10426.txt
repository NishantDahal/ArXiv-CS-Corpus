Proceedings 6th Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE 2013, the 6th Interaction and Concurrency Experience workshop, which was held in Florence, Italy on the 6th of June 2013 as a satellite event of DisCoTec 2013. The ICE procedure for paper selection allows PC members to interact, anonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a Wiki and associated with a discussion forum whose access is restricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of interests. The PC members post comments and questions that the authors reply to. Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether 6 papers were accepted for publication. We were proud to host two invited talks, Davide Sangiorgi and Filippo Bonchi, whose abstracts are included in this volume together with the regular papers. The workshop also featured a brief announcement of an already published paper.
