A Novel Application Licensing Framework for Mobile Cloud Environment

Mobile cloud computing is a new technology that enhances smartphone applications capabilities in terms of performance, energy efficiency, and execution support. These features are achieved via computation offloading technique that is supported by specialized mobile cloud application development models. However, the cloud-enabled applications are prone to application piracy issue for which the traditional licensing frameworks are of no use. Therefore, a new licensing framework is required to control application piracy in mobile cloud environment. This paper presents a preliminary design of a novel application licensing framework for mobile cloud environment that restricts execution of applications on unauthenticated smartphones and cloud resources.
