Arabic Text Recognition in Video Sequences

In this paper, we propose a robust approach for text extraction and recognition from Arabic news video sequence. The text included in video sequences is an important needful for indexing and searching system. However, this text is difficult to detect and recognize because of the variability of its size, their low resolution characters and the complexity of the backgrounds. To solve these problems, we propose a system performing in two main tasks: extraction and recognition of text. Our system is tested on a varied database composed of different Arabic news programs and the obtained results are encouraging and show the merits of our approach.
