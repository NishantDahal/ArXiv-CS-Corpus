Subadditivity of Matrix phi-Entropy and Concentration of Random Matrices

Matrix concentration inequalities provide a direct way to bound the typical spectral norm of a random matrix. The methods for establishing these results often parallel classical arguments, such as the Laplace transform method. This work develops a matrix extension of the entropy method, and it applies these ideas to obtain some matrix concentration inequalities.
