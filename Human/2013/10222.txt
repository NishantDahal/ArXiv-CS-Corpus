Entropy region and convolution

The entropy region is constructed from vectors of random variables by collecting Shannon entropies of all subvectors. Its shape is studied here by means of polymatroidal constructions, notably by convolution. The closure of the region is decomposed into the direct sum of tight and modular parts, reducing the study to the tight part. The relative interior of the reduction belongs to the entropy region. Behavior of the decomposition under selfadhesivity is clarified. Results are specialized to and completed for the region of four random variables. This and computer experiments help to visualize approximations of a symmetrized part of the entropy region. Four-atom conjecture on the minimization of Ingleton score is refuted.
