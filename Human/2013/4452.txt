Image Compression predicated on Recurrent Iterated Function Systems

Recurrent iterated function systems (RIFSs) are improvements of iterated function systems (IFSs) using elements of the theory of Marcovian stochastic processes which can produce more natural looking images. We construct new RIFSs consisting substantially of a vertical contraction factor function and nonlinear transformations. These RIFSs are applied to image compression.
