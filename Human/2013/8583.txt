Mathematical model of concentrating solar cooker

The main purpose of this work is to obtain a mathematical model consistent with the thermal behavior of concentrating solar cookers, such as Jorhejpataranskua. We also want to simulate different conditions respect to the parameters involved of several materials for its construction and efficiency. The model is expressed in terms of a coupled nonlinear system of differential equations which are solved using Mathematica 8. The results obtained by our model are compared with measurements of solar cooker in field testing operation. We obtained good results in agreement with experimental data. Moreover, the simulation results are used by calculating cooking power and standardized cooking power of solar cooker for different parameters.
