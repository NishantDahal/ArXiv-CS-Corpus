Random Residue Sequences and the Number Theoretic Hilbert Transform

This paper presents random residue sequences derived from the number theoretic Hilbert (NHT) transform and their correlation properties. The autocorrelation of a NHT derived sequence is zero for all non-zero shifts which illustrates that these are self-orthogonal sequences. The cross correlation function between two sequences may be computed with respect to the moduli of the either sequence. There appears to be some kind of an inverse qualitative relationship between these two different computations for many sets of residue sequences.
