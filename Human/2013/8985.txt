Optimal Hybrid Channel Allocation:Based On Machine Learning Algorithms

Recent advances in cellular communication systems resulted in a huge increase in spectrum demand. To meet the requirements of the ever-growing need for spectrum, efficient utilization of the existing resources is of utmost importance. Channel Allocation, has thus become an inevitable research topic in wireless communications. In this paper, we propose an optimal channel allocation scheme, Optimal Hybrid Channel Allocation (OHCA) for an effective allocation of channels. We improvise upon the existing Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) technique by imparting intelligence to the existing system by employing the multilayer perceptron technique.
