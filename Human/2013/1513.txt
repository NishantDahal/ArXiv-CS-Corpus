Stacking from Tags: Clustering Bookmarks around a Theme

Since very recently, users on the social bookmarking service Delicious can stack web pages in addition to tagging them. Stacking enables users to group web pages around specific themes with the aim of recommending to others. However, users still stack a small subset of what they tag, and thus many web pages remain unstacked. This paper presents early research towards automatically clustering web pages from tags to find stacks and extend recommendations.
