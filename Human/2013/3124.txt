Computing Motion with 3D Memristive Grid

Computing the relative motion of objects is an important navigation task that we routinely perform by relying on inherently unreliable biological cells in the retina. The non-linear and adaptive response of memristive devices make them excellent building blocks for realizing complex synaptic-like architectures that are common in the human retina. Here, we introduce a novel memristive thresholding scheme that facilitates the detection of moving edges. In addition, a double-layered 3-D memristive network is employed for modeling the motion computations that take place in both the Outer Plexiform Layer (OPL) and Inner Plexiform Layer (IPL) that enables the detection of on-center and off-center transient responses. Applying the transient detection results, it is shown that it is possible to generate an estimation of the speed and direction a moving object.
