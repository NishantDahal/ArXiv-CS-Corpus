A language independent web data extraction using vision based page segmentation algorithm

Web usage mining is a process of extracting useful information from server logs i.e. users history. Web usage mining is a process of finding out what users are looking for on the internet. Some users might be looking at only textual data, where as some others might be interested in multimedia data. One would retrieve the data by copying it and pasting it to the relevant document. But this is tedious and time consuming as well as difficult when the data to be retrieved is plenty. Extracting structured data from a web page is challenging problem due to complicated structured pages. Earlier they were used web page programming language dependent; the main problem is to analyze the html source code. In earlier they were considered the scripts such as java scripts and cascade styles in the html files. When it makes different for existing solutions to infer the regularity of the structure of the Web Pages only by analyzing the tag structures. To overcome this problem we are using a new algorithm called VIPS algorithm i.e. independent language. This approach primary utilizes the visual features on the webpage to implement web data extraction.
