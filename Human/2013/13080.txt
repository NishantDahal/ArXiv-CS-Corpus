Geometric Complexity Theory: an introduction for geometers

This article is a survey of recent developments in, and a tutorial on, the approach to P v. NP and related questions called Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT). It is written to be accessible to graduate students. Numerous open questions in algebraic geometry and representation theory relevant for GCT are presented.
