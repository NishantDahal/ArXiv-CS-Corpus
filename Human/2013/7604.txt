PROOFTOOL: a GUI for the GAPT Framework

This paper introduces PROOFTOOL, the graphical user interface for the General Architecture for Proof Theory (GAPT) framework. Its features are described with a focus not only on the visualization but also on the analysis and transformation of proofs and related tree-like structures, and its implementation is explained. Finally, PROOFTOOL is compared with three other graphical interfaces for proofs.
