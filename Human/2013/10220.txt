RBAC Architecture Design Issues in Institutions Collaborative Environment

Institutional collaborative systems focus on providing the fast, and secure connections to students, teaching and non-teaching staff members. Access control is more important in these types of systems because different kind of users access the system on different levels. So a proper architecture must be there for these kinds of systems, for providing an efficient and secure system.

So, this paper will be a step towards administrative load sharing, securing the system, and ease of use.
