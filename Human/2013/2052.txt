On the dynamic compressibility of sets

We define a new notion of compressibility of a set of numbers through the dynamics of a polynomial function. We provide approaches to solve the problem by reducing it to the multi-criteria traveling salesman problem through a series of transformations. We then establish computational complexity results by giving some NP-completeness proofs. We also discuss about a notion of $ε$ K-compressibility of a set, with regard to lossy compression and deduce the necessary condition for the given set to be $ε$ K-compressible. Finally, we conclude by providing a list of open problems solutions to which could extend the applicability the our technique.
