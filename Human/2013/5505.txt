Parameterized Quantum Query Complexity of Graph Collision

We present three new quantum algorithms in the quantum query model for \textsc{graph-collision} problem: \begin{itemize} \item an algorithm based on tree decomposition that uses $O\left(\sqrt{n}t^{\sfrac{1}{6}}\right)$ queries where $t$ is the treewidth of the graph; \item an algorithm constructed on a span program that improves a result by Gavinsky and Ito. The algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{α^{**}})$ queries, where $α^{**}(G)$ is a graph parameter defined by \[α^{**}(G):=\min_{VC\text{-- vertex cover of}G}{\max_{\substack{I\subseteq VC\\I\text{-- independent set}}}{\sum_{v\in I}{°{v}}}};\] \item an algorithm for a subclass of circulant graphs that uses $O(\sqrt{n})$ queries. \end{itemize} We also present an example of a possibly difficult graph $G$ for which all the known graphs fail to solve graph collision in $O(\sqrt{n} \log^c n)$ queries.
