A Domain-Specific Language for Discrete Mathematics

This paper discusses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that has been developed to enable implementation of concepts of discrete mathematics. A library of data types and functions provides functionality which is frequently required by users. Covering the areas of Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Functions, Graph Theory, Number Theory, Linear Algebra and Combinatorics, the language's syntax is close to the actual notation used in the specific fields.
