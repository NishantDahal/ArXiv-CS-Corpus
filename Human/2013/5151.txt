Mobile Services and Network Proximity

This paper discusses several practical use cases for deploying network proximity in mobile services. Our research presents here mobile services oriented for either discovering new data for mobile subscribers or for delivering some customized information to them. All applications share the same approach and use the common platform, based on the Wi-Fi proximity. The typical deployment areas for our approach are context-aware services and ubiquitous computing applications. Our own examples include proximity marketing as the model use case.
