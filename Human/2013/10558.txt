Eclipse-IT 2013: Proceedings of VIII Workshop of the Italian Eclipse Community

This volume contains the extended abstracts of the contributions presented at EclipseIT 2013, the 8th workshop of the Italian Eclipse Community, hosted by the Computer Science Department of the University of Milan (Crema Campus) on September 19-20, 2013. Although Eclipse was initially designed as an integrated development environment (IDE) for object-oriented application development, today it represents an open development platform comprised of extensible frameworks, tools and runtimes for building, deploying and managing software. Around Eclipse, an international live community continuously works on improving the framework and on promoting the use of Eclipse. That happens also in Italy. This workshop is, indeed, the eighth yearly meeting of the Italian Eclipse Community which includes universities, public institutions and industries, researchers and practitioners, students and professionals, all joined by the interest in experimenting, extending, and supporting the Eclipse platform. The special topic of this edition is the Software cooperative development for mobile applications. Two tutorials are offered on this theme: (1) Sviluppo di applicazioni enterprise per il mobile con IBM Jazz, Eclipse e Worklight by Ferdinando Gorga from IBM, and (2) Uso di Eclipse per lo sviluppo cooperativo del software, by Paolo Maresca of the University of Naples, Federico II.
