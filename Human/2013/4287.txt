Advice-Efficient Prediction with Expert Advice

Advice-efficient prediction with expert advice (in analogy to label-efficient prediction) is a variant of prediction with expert advice game, where on each round of the game we are allowed to ask for advice of a limited number $M$ out of $N$ experts. This setting is especially interesting when asking for advice of every expert on every round is expensive. We present an algorithm for advice-efficient prediction with expert advice that achieves $O(\sqrt{\frac{N}{M}T\ln N})$ regret on $T$ rounds of the game.
