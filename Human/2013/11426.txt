Finite-type-Dyck shift spaces

We study some basic properties of sofic-Dyck shifts and finite-type-Dyck shifts. We prove that the class of sofic-Dyck shifts is stable under proper conjugacies. We prove a Decomposition Theorem of a proper conjugacy between edge-Dyck shifts into a sequence of Dyck splittings and amalgamations.
