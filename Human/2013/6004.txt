Panphasia: a user guide

We make a very large realisation of a Gaussian white noise field, called PANPHASIA, public by releasing software that computes this field. Panphasia is designed specifically for setting up Gaussian initial conditions for cosmological simulations and resimulations of structure formation. We make available both software to compute the field itself and codes to illustrate applications including a modified version of a public serial initial conditions generator. We document the software and present the results of a few basic tests of the field. The properties and method of construction of Panphasia are described in full in a companion paper Jenkins 2013.
