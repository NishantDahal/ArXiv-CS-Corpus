A biologically-motivated system is poised at a critical state

We explore the critical behaviors in the dynamics of information transfer of a biologically-inspired system by an individual-based model. "Quorum response", a type of social interaction which has been recognized taxonomically in animal groups, is applied as the sole interaction rule among particles. We assume a truncated Gaussian distribution to quantitatively depict the distribution of the particles' vigilance level and find that by fine-tuning the parameters of the mean and the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, the system is poised at a critical state in the dynamics of information transfer. We present the phase diagrams to exhibit that the phase line divides the parameter space into a super-critical and a sub-critical zone, in which the dynamics of information transfer varies largely.
