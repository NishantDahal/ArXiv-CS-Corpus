Finding Hyperexponential Solutions of Linear ODEs by Numerical Evaluation

We present a new algorithm for computing hyperexponential solutions of ordinary linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. The algorithm relies on interpreting formal series solutions at the singular points as analytic functions and evaluating them numerically at some common ordinary point. The numerical data is used to determine a small number of combinations of the formal series that may give rise to hyperexponential solutions.
