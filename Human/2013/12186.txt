A Novel Approach for Designing Online Testable Reversible Circuits

Reversible logic is gaining interest of many researchers due to its low power dissipating characteristic. In this paper we proposed a new approach for designing online testable reversible circuits. The resultant testable reversible circuit can detect any single bit error whiles it is operating. Appropriate theorems and lemmas are presented to clarify the proposed design. The experimental results show that our design approach is superior in terms of number of number of gates, garbage outputs and quantum cost.
