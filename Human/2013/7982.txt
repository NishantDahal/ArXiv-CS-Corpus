Defining the symmetry of the universal semi-regular autonomous asynchronous systems

The regular autonomous asynchronous systems are the non-deterministic Boolean dynamical systems and universality means the greatest in the sense of the inclusion. The paper gives four definitions of symmetry of these systems in a slightly more general framework, called semi-regularity and also many examples.
