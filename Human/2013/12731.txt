E-Governance, International Cooperation and Security - New Millennium Challenges for a Small Country

In the paper we analyze the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their impact on developing countries (DCs), making a criticism of different views on the supposed role of ICT for the future of human society. This criticism is seen from the point of view of a small developing post-communist country as Albania, hoping that the conclusions would throw some light for developing countries in general, especially those in a transition stage. We examine some aspects of international collaboration and security, where the ICT implemented in the public administration may have an important impact. The development policies and practices are examined, including relations between public and private sectors. Following arguments of many authors, we identify or redefine some crucial factors that negatively impact the role of ICT in the development of the country, its relations with the international community, and ways to push forward its development.
