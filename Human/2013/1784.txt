A Systematic Literature Review on relationship between agile methods and Open Source Software Development methodology

Agile software development methods (ASD) and open source software development methods (OSSD) are two different approaches which were introduced in last decade and both of them have their fanatical advocators. Yet, it seems that relation and interface between ASD and OSSD is a fertile area and few rigorous studies have been done in this matter. Major goal of this study was assessment of the relation and integration of ASD and OSSD. Analyzing of collected data shows that ASD and OSSD are able to support each other. Some practices in one of them are useful in the other. Another finding is that however there are some case studies using ASD and OSSD simultaneously, but there is not enough evidence about comprehensive integration of them.
