Separation Properties and Related Bounds of Collusion-secure Fingerprinting Codes

In this paper we investigate the separation properties and related bounds of some codes. We tried to obtain a new existence result for $(w_1, w_2)$-separating codes and discuss the "optimality" of the upper bounds. Next we tried to study some interesting relationship between separation and existence of non-trivial subspace subcodes for Reed-Solomon codes.
