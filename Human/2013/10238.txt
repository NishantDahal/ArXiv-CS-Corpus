An Operational Approach For Wimax At Ultra High Bandwidth With Spectrum 60 Ghz

WiMax is a promising network of today industry. It provides P2P and P2MP point to multipoint broadband services up to thirty miles. Its operational frequency range is 10 GHz to 60 GHz. It provides data rate of 75Mbps per channel; with an end-to-end encryption called CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol). CCMP is an Advanced Encryption Standard AES based encryption method, which delivers secure communication. Telecom industry seeks secure, cheaper, wireless metro area network, that full fill the today internet demand in most efficient way. Our research explores the new dimension of WiMax with HEMT High Electron Mobility Transistor using un-licensed Band. The Aim of this paper is to simulate 60GHz unlicensed WiMax band in Matlab. This research explores millimeter waves, related electronics, mathematics of WiMax and simulated graph comparison. It determines available capacity verses coverage area and transmission bit error probability. Further it highlights the ideal modulation condition in different terrains. Research proofs that WiMax will be the future promising wireless network.
