On the weight hierarchy of codes coming from semigroups with two generators

The weight hierarchy of one-point algebraic geometry codes can be estimated by means of the generalized order bounds, which are described in terms of a certain Weierstrass semigroup. The asymptotical behaviour of such bounds for r > 1 differs from that of the classical Feng-Rao distance (r=1) by the so-called Feng-Rao numbers. This paper is addressed to compute the Feng-Rao numbers for numerical semigroups of embedding dimension two (with two generators), obtaining a closed simple formula for the general case by using numerical semigroup techniques. These involve the computation of the Ap√©ry set with respect to an integer of the semigroups under consideration. The formula obtained is applied to lower-bounding the generalized Hamming weights, improving the bound given by Kirfel and Pellikaan in terms of the classical Feng-Rao distance. We also compare our bound with a modification of the Griesmer bound, improving this one in many cases.
