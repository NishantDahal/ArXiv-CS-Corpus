Loss Rate Based Fountain Codes for Data Transfer

Fountain codes are becoming increasingly important for data transferring over dedicated high-speed long-distance network. However, the encoding and decoding complexity of traditional fountain codes such as LT and Raptor codes are still high. In this paper, a new fountain codes named LRF (Loss Rate Based Fountain) codes for data transfer is proposed. In order to improve the performance of encoding and decoding efficiency and decrease the number of redundant encoding symbols, an innovative degree distribution instead of robust soliton degree distribution in LT (Luby Transfer) codes is proposed. In LRF codes, the degree of encoding symbol is decided by loss rate property, and the window size is extended dynamic. Simulations result using LRF codes show that the proposed method has better performance in term of encoding ratio, degree ratio, encoding and decoding efficiency with respect to LT and Raptor codes.
