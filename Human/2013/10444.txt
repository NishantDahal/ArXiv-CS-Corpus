Evaluating parametric holonomic sequences using rectangular splitting

We adapt the rectangular splitting technique of Paterson and Stockmeyer to the problem of evaluating terms in holonomic sequences that depend on a parameter. This approach allows computing the $n$-th term in a recurrent sequence of suitable type using $O(n^{1/2})$ "expensive" operations at the cost of an increased number of "cheap" operations.
  Rectangular splitting has little overhead and can perform better than either naive evaluation or asymptotically faster algorithms for ranges of $n$ encountered in applications. As an example, fast numerical evaluation of the gamma function is investigated. Our work generalizes two previous algorithms of Smith.
