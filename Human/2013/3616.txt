Efficiency improvement of the frequency-domain BEM for rapid transient elastodynamic analysis

The frequency-domain fast boundary element method (BEM) combined with the exponential window technique leads to an efficient yet simple method for elastodynamic analysis. In this paper, the efficiency of this method is further enhanced by three strategies. Firstly, we propose to use exponential window with large damping parameter to improve the conditioning of the BEM matrices. Secondly, the frequency domain windowing technique is introduced to alleviate the severe Gibbs oscillations in time-domain responses caused by large damping parameters. Thirdly, a solution extrapolation scheme is applied to obtain better initial guesses for solving the sequential linear systems in the frequency domain. Numerical results of three typical examples with the problem size up to 0.7 million unknowns clearly show that the first and third strategies can significantly reduce the computational time. The second strategy can effectively eliminate the Gibbs oscillations and result in accurate time-domain responses.
