Mining Representative Unsubstituted Graph Patterns Using Prior Similarity Matrix

One of the most powerful techniques to study protein structures is to look for recurrent fragments (also called substructures or spatial motifs), then use them as patterns to characterize the proteins under study. An emergent trend consists in parsing proteins three-dimensional (3D) structures into graphs of amino acids. Hence, the search of recurrent spatial motifs is formulated as a process of frequent subgraph discovery where each subgraph represents a spatial motif. In this scope, several efficient approaches for frequent subgraph discovery have been proposed in the literature. However, the set of discovered frequent subgraphs is too large to be efficiently analyzed and explored in any further process. In this paper, we propose a novel pattern selection approach that shrinks the large number of discovered frequent subgraphs by selecting the representative ones. Existing pattern selection approaches do not exploit the domain knowledge. Yet, in our approach we incorporate the evolutionary information of amino acids defined in the substitution matrices in order to select the representative subgraphs. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a number of real datasets. The results issued from our experiments show that our approach is able to considerably decrease the number of motifs while enhancing their interestingness.
