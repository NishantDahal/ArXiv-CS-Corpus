A Framework for Reproducible, Interactive Research: Application to health and social sciences

The aim of this article is to introduce a reporting framework for reproducible, interactive research applied to Big Clinical Data, based on open source technologies. The framework is constituted by the following three axes: (i) data, (ii) analytical codes and (iii) dissemination. In this paper, different documentation formats and online repositories are introduced. To integrate and manage the reproducible contents, we propose the R Language as the tool of choice. All the information is then published and gathered in a website for different projects. This framework is free and user friendly and is proposed to enhance reproducibility of health-science reports.
