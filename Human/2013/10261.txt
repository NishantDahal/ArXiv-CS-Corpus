On the Optimal Scheduling in Pull-based Real-Time P2P Streaming Systems: Layered and Non-Layered Streaming

During the last decade, we witnessed a rapid growth in deployment of pull-based P2P streaming applications. In these applications, each node selects some other nodes as its neighbors and requests streaming data from them. This scheme allows eliminating data redundancy and recovering from data loss, but it pushes the complexity to the receiver node side. In this paper, we theoretically study the scheduling problem in Pull-based P2P video streaming and we model it as an assignment problem. Then, we propose AsSched, new scheduling algorithm for layered streaming, in order to optimize the throughput and the delivery ratio of the system. In second time, we derive an optimal algorithm (NAsSched) for non layered streaming. The results of simulations show that our algorithms significantly outperform classic scheduling strategies especially in stern bandwidth constraints.
