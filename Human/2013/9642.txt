Reversible Logic Elements with Memory and Their Universality

Reversible computing is a paradigm of computation that  reflects physical reversibility, one of the  fundamental microscopic laws of Nature.  In this survey, we discuss topics on reversible logic  elements with memory (RLEM), which can be used to build  reversible computing systems, and their universality.  An RLEM is called universal, if any reversible sequential  machine (RSM) can be realized as a circuit composed only of it.  Since a finite-state control and a tape cell of a reversible  Turing machine (RTM) are formalized as RSMs, any RTM can  be constructed from a universal RLEM.  Here, we investigate 2-state RLEMs, and show that infinitely  many kinds of non-degenerate RLEMs are all universal  besides only four exceptions.  Non-universality of these exceptional RLEMs is also argued.
