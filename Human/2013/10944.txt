A Universal Quantum Circuit Scheme For Finding Complex Eigenvalues

We present a general quantum circuit design for finding eigenvalues of non-unitary matrices on quantum computers using the iterative phase estimation algorithm. In particular, we show how the method can be used for the simulation of resonance states for quantum systems.
