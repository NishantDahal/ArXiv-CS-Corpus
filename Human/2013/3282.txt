Maximum Possibility Of Spectrum Access In Cognitive Radio Using Fuzzy Logic System

Many spectrum methods have been proposed to use spectrum effectively, the opportunistic spectrum access has become the most viable approach to achieve near-optimal spectrum utilization by allowing secondary users to sense and access available spectrum opportunistically. However, a naive spectrum access for secondary users can make spectrum utilization inefficient and increase interference to adjacent users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) to control the spectrum access. We have to minimize the call blocking and interference. The linguistic knowledge of spectrum access are based on three descriptors namely spectrum utilization efficiency of the secondary user, its degree of mobility, and its distance to the primary user. The spectrum is chosen for accessing based on the maximum possibility for better utilization of the spectrum
