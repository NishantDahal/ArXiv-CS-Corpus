Some considerations about Java implementation of two provably secure pseudorandom bit generators

The quest for a cryptographically secure pseudorandom bit generator (PRBG) was initiated long ago, and for a long time the proposed pseudorandom generators were very slow. More recently some "provably secure" PRBG capable to achieve a throughput rate greater than 1Mbit/sec. We noticed, anyway, the absence of Java implementations of such PRBGs, provably due to poor expected values for throughput rate. In the present paper we show that it is quite easy to write down Java implementations for them, achieving a throughput rae into range $0,5รท7$ Mbit/sec on very common mobile low-end devices.
