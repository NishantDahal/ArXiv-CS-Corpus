Robust watermarking based on DWT SVD

Digital information revolution has brought about many advantages and new issues. The protection of ownership and the prevention of unauthorized manipulation of digital audio, image, and video materials has become an important concern due to the ease of editing and perfect reproduction. Watermarking is identified as a major means to achieve copyright protection. It is a branch of information hiding which is used to hide proprietary information in digital media like photographs, digital music, digital video etc. In this paper, a new image watermarking algorithm that is robust against various attacks is presented. DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) have been used to embed two watermarks in the HL and LH bands of the host image. Simulation evaluation demonstrates that the proposed technique withstand various attacks.
