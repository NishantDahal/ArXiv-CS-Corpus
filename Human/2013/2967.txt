A Survey of Appearance Models in Visual Object Tracking

Visual object tracking is a significant computer vision task which  can be applied to many domains such as visual surveillance, human computer interaction, and video compression.  In the literature, researchers have proposed a variety of 2D  appearance models.  To help readers swiftly learn the recent advances in 2D appearance  models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey,  which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance  models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based  architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this survey, we first decompose the  problem of appearance modeling into two different processing  stages: visual representation and statistical modeling. Then,  different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with  respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several  issues of interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic.  The contributions of this survey are four-fold. First, we review  the literature of visual representations according to their  feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for  tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their  model-construction mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and  hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each type of visual  representations or statistical modeling techniques is analyzed and  discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint. Fourth, the  existing benchmark resources (e.g., source code and video  datasets) are examined in this survey.
