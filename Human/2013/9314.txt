Specifying Robustness

This paper proposes a new logic RoCTL* to model robustness in concurrent systems. RoCTL* extends CTL* with the addition of Obligatory and Robustly operators, which quantify over failure-free paths and paths with one more failure respectively. We present a number of examples of problems to which RoCTL* can be applied. The core result of this paper is to show that RoCTL* is expressively equivalent to CTL* but is non-elementarily more succinct. We present a translation from RoCTL* into CTL* that preserves truth but may result in non-elementary growth in the length of the translated formula as each nested Robustly operator may result in an extra exponential blowup. However, we show that this translation is optimal in the sense that any equivalence preserving translation will require an extra exponential growth per nested Robustly. We also compare RoCTL* to Quantified CTL* (QCTL*) and hybrid logics.
