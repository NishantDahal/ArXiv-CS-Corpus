Effect of data preprocessing on software effort estimation

Software effort estimation requires high accuracy, but accurate estimations are difficult to achieve. Increasingly, data mining is used to improve an organization's software process quality, e. g. the accuracy of effort estimations . There are a large number of different method combination exists for software effort estimation, selecting the most suitable combination becomes the subject of research in this paper. In this study, three simple preprocessors are taken (none, norm, log) and effort is measured using COCOMO model. Then results obtained from different preprocessors are compared and norm preprocessor proves to be more accurate as compared to other preprocessors.
