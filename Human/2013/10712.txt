Analysis of Errors: A Support System for Teachers to Analyse the Error Occurring to a Novice Programmer

For a novice programmer, coding is equivalent to a nightmare. A novice programmer tries to replicate steps provided by the faculty and on compilation gets a number of errors which the novice programmer is not able to resolve. This system provides support to the faculty about the coding ability of the students and their ability to solve those errors. Also, the faculty can provide a solution to the errors which are occurring to the students and the solution is displayed accordingly. The emphasis of this paper is on developing this system within JAVA and making use of Online Compilers. Moreover, we focus on a new system which is able to provide online code management and these codes get compiled using an online compiler and these programs can be viewed by the respective faculty for cross verification. This paper takes into account the syntactic errors, runtime and semantic errors.
