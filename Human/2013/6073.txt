Document watermarking based on digital holographic principle

A new method for document watermarking based on the digital Fourier hologram is proposed. It applies the methods of digital image watermarking based on holographic principle presented previously in several papers into printed documents. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only meet the demand on invisibility, robustness and non-reproducibility of the document watermark, and but also has other advantages compared with the conventional methods for document securities such as embossed hologram, Lippmann photograph and halftone modulation.
