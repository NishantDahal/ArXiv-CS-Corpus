Navigation Assistance and Web Accessibility Helper

Web accessibility is actually the most important aspect for providing access to information and interaction for people with disabilities. However, it seems that the ability of users with disabilities to navigate over the Web is not dependent on the graphical complexity, but on the markup used to create the structure of the website. Consequently, it is necessary to design some software assistants to help all users to mark themselves in space during a navigation session. In this paper, we propose an assistant for browsing on the Internet to allow user to get one s bearings within Web navigation. We describe our approach which puts at the disposal of the user a visited site map, thus giving an explicit representation of virtual space. Different levels of visualization are implemented in order to make the map more visible and less overloaded.
