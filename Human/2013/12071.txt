On Dispersions of Discrete Memoryless Channels with Noncausal State Information at the Encoder

In this paper, we study the finite blocklength limits of state-dependent discrete memoryless channels where the discrete memoryless state is known noncausally at the encoder. For the point-to-point case, this is known as the Gel'fand-Pinsker channel model. We define the (n,ε)-capacity of the Gel'fand-Pinsker channel as the maximal rate of transmission of a message subject to the condition that the length of the block-code is n and the average error probability is no larger than ε. This paper provides a lower bound for the (n,ε)-capacity of the Gel'fand-Pinsker channel model, and hence an upper bound on the dispersion, a fundamental second-order quantity in the study of the performance limits of discrete memoryless channels. In addition, we extend the work of Y. Steinberg (2005), in which the (degraded) broadcast channel extension of the Gel'fand-Pinsker model was studied. We provide and inner bound to the (n,ε)-capacity region for this broadcast channel model using a combination of ideas of Gel'fand-Pinsker coding, superposition coding and dispersion (finite blocklength) analysis.
