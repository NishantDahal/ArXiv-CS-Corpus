On Topological Structure of Web Services Networks for Composition

In order to deal efficiently with the exponential growth of the Web services landscape in composition life cycle activities, it is necessary to have a clear view of its main features. As for many situations where there is a lot of interacting entities, the complex networks paradigm is an appropriate approach to analyze the interactions between the multitudes of Web services. In this paper, we present and investigate the main interactions between semantic Web services models from the complex network perspective. Results show that both parameter and operation networks exhibit the main characteristics of typical real-world complex networks such as the small-world property and an inhomogeneous degree distribution. These results yield valuable insight in order to develop composition search algorithms, to deal with security threat in the composition process and on the phenomena which characterize its evolution.
