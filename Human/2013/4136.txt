Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip

Manycore System-on-Chip include an increasing amount of processing elements and have become an important research topic for improvements of both hardware and software. While research can be conducted using system simulators, prototyping requires a variety of components and is very time consuming. With the Open Tiled Manycore System-on-Chip (OpTiMSoC) we aim at building such an environment for use in our and other research projects as prototyping platform.
  This paper describes the project goals and aspects of OpTiMSoC and summarizes the current status and ideas.
