The solution of complex problems on calculation of the electrostatic fields on lessons on computer modeling

In article the following tasks on computer modeling of electric fields are analyzed: 1) calculation of distribution of potential for the field created by two parallel plates and charged bodies in the non-uniform environment; 2) calculation of distribution of potential and force lines of electric field in which are brought the cylinder, a pipe, a plate, a rectangular parallelepiped from dielectric, and also the metal cylinder; 3) calculation of distribution of potential in the one-dimensional nonuniform environment; 4) the solution of the equation of Poisson in spherical coordinates; 5) calculation of distribution of potential in cylindrical coordinates with the subsequent creation of equipotential surfaces and force lines.
