Sequencing and navigation through learning content

The aim of this paper is to describe a basic idea to introduce formal modeling in development and presentation of e-learning systems. By introducing formalism, reasoning on e-learning systems and processes through them can be more easily understood. In particular, we propose to use Harel automata (statecharts) in modeling sequencing and navigation through learning content and learning process.
