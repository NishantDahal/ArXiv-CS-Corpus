Experiments in Sustainable Software Practices for Future Architectures

In the process of rewriting large physics codes at Los Alamos National Laboratory to perform well on new architectures such as many-core, GPU, and Intel MIC, we have found a number of areas in which sustainable software practices can provide significant advantages. We describe several specific advantages of sustainable practices for future architectures, and report on two small experimental projects at LANL intended to raise awareness of new software practices and programming approaches for new architectures.
