Proceedings Fourth International Symposium on Symbolic Computation in Software Science

Symbolic computation is the science of computing with symbolic objects (terms, formulae, programs, algebraic objects, geometrical objects, etc). Powerful symbolic algorithms have been developed during the past decades and have played an influential role in theorem proving, automated reasoning, software verification, model checking, rewriting, formalisation of mathematics, network security, Groebner bases, characteristic sets, etc.
  The international Symposium on "Symbolic Computation in Software Science" is the fourth in the SCSS workshop series. SCSS 2008 and 2010 took place at the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC), Hagenberg, Austria, and, SCSS 2009 took place in Gammarth, Tunisia. These symposium grew out of internal workshops that bring together researchers from: a) SCORE (Symbolic Computation Research Group) at the University of Tsukuba, Japan, b) Theorema Group at the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria, c) SSFG (Software Science Foundation Group) at Kyoto University, Japan, and d) Sup'Com (Higher School of Communication of Tunis) at the University of Carthage, Tunisia.
