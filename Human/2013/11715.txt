Face Recognition via Globality-Locality Preserving Projections

We present an improved Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) method, named Gloablity-Locality Preserving Projections (GLPP), to preserve both the global and local geometric structures of data. In our approach, an additional constraint of the geometry of classes is imposed to the objective function of conventional LPP for respecting some more global manifold structures. Moreover, we formulate a two-dimensional extension of GLPP (2D-GLPP) as an example to show how to extend GLPP with some other statistical techniques. We apply our works to face recognition on four popular face databases, namely ORL, Yale, FERET and LFW-A databases, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that the considered global manifold information can significantly improve the performance of LPP and the proposed face recognition methods outperform the state-of-the-arts.
