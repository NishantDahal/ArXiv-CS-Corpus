Overview of Optical Interconnect Technology

Optical interconnect is seen as a potential solution to meet the performance requirements of current and future generation of data processors. Optical interconnects have negligible frequency dependent loss, low cross talk and high band width. Optical interconnects are not much used commercially since optical interconnects technology is incompatible with manufacturing processes and assembly methods that are currently used in the semiconductor industry. There are many promising optical interconnect technologies and this paper presents a brief analysis of current state of optical interconnect technology.
