Neural perceptual model to global-local vision for recognition of the logical structure of administrative documents

This paper gives the definition of Transparent Neural Network "TNN" for the simulation of the globallocal vision and its application to the segmentation of administrative document image. We have developed and have adapted a recognition method which models the contextual effects reported from studies in experimental psychology. Then, we evaluated and tested the TNN and the multi-layer perceptron "MLP", which showed its effectiveness in the field of the recognition, in order to show that the TNN is clearer for the user and more powerful on the level of the recognition. Indeed, the TNN is the only system which makes it possible to recognize the document and its structure.
