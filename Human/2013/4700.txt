A Geometric Descriptor for Cell-Division Detection

We describe a method for cell-division detection based on a geometric-driven descriptor that can be represented as a 5-layers processing network, based mainly on wavelet filtering and a test for mirror symmetry between pairs of pixels. After the centroids of the descriptors are computed for a sequence of frames, the two-steps piecewise constant function that best fits the sequence of centroids determines the frame where the division occurs.
