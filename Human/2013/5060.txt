Denoising the 3-Base Periodicity Walks of DNA Sequences in Gene Finding

A nonlinear Tracking-Differentiator is one-input-two-output system that can generate smooth approximation of measured signals and get the derivatives of the signals. The nonlinear tracking-Differentiator is explored to denoise and generate the derivatives of the walks of the 3-periodicity of DNA sequences. An improved algorithm for gene finding is presented using the nonlinear Tracking-Differentiator. The gene finding algorithm employs the 3-base periodicity of coding region. The 3-base periodicity DNA walks are denoised and tracked using the nonlinear Tracking-Differentiator. Case studies demonstrate that the nonlinear Tracking-Differentiator is an effective method to improve the accuracy of the gene finding algorithm.
