Proceedings 10th International Workshop on Formal Engineering Approaches to Software Components and Architectures

These are the proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures (FESCA). The workshop was held on March 23, 2013 in Rome (Italy) as a satellite event to the European Joint Conference on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS'13). 
  The aim of the FESCA workshop is to bring together both young and senior researchers from formal methods, software engineering, and industry interested in the development and application of formal modelling approaches as well as associated analysis and reasoning techniques with practical benefits for component-based software engineering.
  FESCA aims to address the open question of how formal methods can be applied effectively to these new contexts and challenges. FESCA is interested in both the development and application of formal methods in component-based development and tries to cross-fertilize their research and application.
