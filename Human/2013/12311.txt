Generalized simulation model of teaching and its research on PC

One of the important problems of cyber pedagogy is the following: how, knowing the parameters of the student, his initial level of knowledge and the impact of the teacher to predict knowledge of student at subsequent times. Simulation method allows you to create a computer program that simulates the behavior of the 'teacher-student'-system and investigate the influence of system parameters on the results of learning.
