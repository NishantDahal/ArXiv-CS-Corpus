Revisiting Timed Specification Theory II : Realisability

In this paper we present an assume-guarantee specification theory (aka interface theory from [14]) for modular synthesis and verification of real-time systems with critical timing constraints. It is a further step of our earlier work [10] which achieved an elegant algebraic specification theory for real-time systems endowed with the capability to freeze time. In this paper we relinquish such (unrealisable) capability and target more realistic systems without the ability to stop time.
  Our theory, in a combined process-algebraic and reactive-synthesis style, provides the operations of parallel composition for system integration, logical conjunction/disjunction for viewpoint fusion and independent development, and quotient for incremental synthesis.
  We show that a substitutive refinement preorder, which is a coarsening of the pre-congruence in [10], constitutes the weakest pre-congruence preserving freedom of incompatibility errors. The coarsening requires a shift in the focus of our theory to a more game-theoretical treatment, where the coarsening constitutes a reactive synthesis game named normalisation and is efficiently implementable by a novel local bot-backpropagation algorithm.
  Previously, timed concurrent games have been studied in [1,14,13], where one of the key concern is the removal of time-blocking strategies by applying blame assignment [13]. Our timed games also have the issue of time-blocking strategies, which may arise through the composition of specifications. However, due to our distinctively different formulation of timed games, we have discovered another elegant solution to the problem without blame assignment. Our solution utilises a second reactive synthesis game called realisation, which is dual to normalisation and implementable by the dual local top-backpropagation algorithm.
