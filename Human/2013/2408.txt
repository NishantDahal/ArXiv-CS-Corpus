The Inductive Logic of Information Systems

An inductive logic can be formulated in which the elements are not propositions or probability distributions, but information systems. The logic is complete for information systems with binary hypotheses, i.e., it applies to all such systems. It is not complete for information systems with more than two hypotheses, but applies to a subset of such systems. The logic is inductive in that conclusions are more informative than premises. Inferences using the formalism have a strong justification in terms of the expected value of the derived information system.
