Stabilizer formalism for generalized concatenated quantum codes

The concept of generalized concatenated quantum codes (GCQC) provides a systematic way for constructing good quantum codes from short component codes. We introduce a stabilizer formalism for GCQCs, which is achieved by defining quantum coset codes. This formalism offers a new perspective for GCQCs and enables us to derive a lower bound on the code distance of stabilizer GCQCs from component codes parameters,for both non-degenerate and degenerate component codes. Our formalism also shows how to exploit the error-correcting capacity of component codes to design good GCQCs efficiently.
