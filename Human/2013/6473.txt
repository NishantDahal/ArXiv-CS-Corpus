A model driven engineering approach to develop a cooperative information system

To reuse one or several existing systems in order to develop a complex system is a common practice in software engineering. This approach can be justified by the fact that it is often difficult for a single Information System (IS) to accomplish all the requested tasks. So, one solution is to combine many different ISs and make them collaborate in order to realize these tasks. We proposed an approach named AspeCiS (An Aspect-oriented Approach to Develop a Cooperative Information System) to develop a Cooperative Information System from existing ISs by using their artifacts such as existing requirements, and design. AspeCiS covers the three following phases: (i) discovery and analysis of Cooperative Requirements, (ii) design of Cooperative Requirements models, and (iii) preparation of the implementation phase. The main issue of AspeCiS is the definition of Cooperative Requirements using the Existing Requirements and Additional Requirements, which should be composed with Aspectual Requirements. We earlier studied how to elicit the Cooperative Requirements in AspeCiS (phase of discovery and analysis of Cooperative Requirements in AspeCiS) . We study here the second phase of AspeCiS (design of Cooperative Requirements models), by the way of a model weaving process. This process uses so-called AspeCiS Weaving Metamodel, and it weaves Existing and Additional Requirements models to realize Cooperative Requirements models.
