Practical Secrecy using Artificial Noise

In this paper, we consider the use of artificial noise for secure communications. We propose the notion of practical secrecy as a new design criterion based on the behavior of the eavesdropper's error probability $P_E$, as the signal-to-noise ratio goes to infinity. We then show that the practical secrecy can be guaranteed by the randomly distributed artificial noise with specified power. We show that it is possible to achieve practical secrecy even when the eavesdropper can afford more antennas than the transmitter.
