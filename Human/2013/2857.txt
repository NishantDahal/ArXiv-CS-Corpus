Numerical method for real root isolation of semi-algebraic system and its applications

In this paper, based on the homotopy continuation method and the interval Newton method, an efficient algorithm is introduced to isolate the real roots of semi-algebraic system.
  Tests on some random examples and a variety of problems including transcendental functions arising in many applications show that the new algorithm reduces the cost substantially compared with the traditional symbolic approaches.
