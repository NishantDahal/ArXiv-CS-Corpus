Fast and RIP-optimal transforms

We study constructions of $k \times n$ matrices $A$ that both (1) satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) at sparsity $s$ with optimal parameters, and (2) are efficient in the sense that only $O(n\log n)$ operations are required to compute $Ax$ given a vector $x$. Our construction is based on repeated application of independent transformations of the form $DH$, where $H$ is a Hadamard or Fourier transform and $D$ is a diagonal matrix with random $\{+1,-1\}$ elements on the diagonal, followed by any $k \times n$ matrix of orthonormal rows (e.g.\ selection of $k$ coordinates). We provide guarantees (1) and (2) for a larger regime of parameters for which such constructions were previously unknown. Additionally, our construction does not suffer from the extra poly-logarithmic factor multiplying the number of observations $k$ as a function of the sparsity $s$, as present in the currently best known RIP estimates for partial random Fourier matrices and other classes of structured random matrices.
