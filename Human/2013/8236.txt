How to implement Marketing 2.0 Successfully

The purpose of this research is to develop a model that would close the gap between marketing plans and strategies from one side and the advanced online collaboration applications platforms known as WEB 2.0 in order to implement marketing 2.0 smoothly without disrupting the working environment. We started by examining published articles related to marketing, Web 2.0, Customer Relationship Management Systems, CRM, and social media in a step to conduct an extensive review of the available literature. Then, we presented critique of the articles we have examined. After that, we have been able to develop the model we are proposing in this research. As this paper shows, the proposed model will help in transforming marketing plans and strategies from its traditional approach into, what we would like to call, marketing 2.0 approach smoothly. There are some unavoidable limitations due to the given time and scope constrains. The factors included in the proposed model does not cover every related aspect, however, they cover the most important ones.
