ChaMAILeon: Simplified email sharing like never before!

While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends in the Internet usage have witnessed an increasing number of people sharing their email passwords for both personal and professional purposes. As sharing passwords increases the chances of your passwords being compromised, leading websites like Google strongly advise their users not to share their passwords with anyone.

In this report, we discuss the technical details of the implementation of ChaMAILeon.
