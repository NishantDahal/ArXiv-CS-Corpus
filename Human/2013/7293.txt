A Design Methodology for Software Measurement Programs

Software measurement programs have emerged as compounds of several measurement activities that are pursued as part of a combined effort of several parties within a software organization, based on interests that the organization has regarding the assessment of the different elements that intervene in the development of software.
  This paper recognizes design of measurement programs as an essential activity that, up until now, has been studied extensively, however, only in what respects to the content of the programs. In addition, proper specification for this kind of programs, accounting for preciseness and unambiguity, to facilitate maintenance, evolution, and execution has not been thoroughly considered. A methodology for designing programs that embody these and some other desirable features is presented. The methodology is built in solid ground. From software measurement literature, a goal-oriented approach is considered for building the content of the program. On the other hand, a successful technique from software development as modularization is utilized to give coherent structure to the measurement program.
