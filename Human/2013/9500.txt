Implementation of nlization framework for verbs, pronouns and determiners with eugene

UNL system is designed and implemented by a nonprofit organization, UNDL Foundation at Geneva in 1999. UNL applications are application softwares that allow end users to accomplish natural language tasks, such as translating, summarizing, retrieving or extracting information, etc. Two major web based application softwares are Interactive ANalyzer (IAN), which is a natural language analysis system. It represents natural language sentences as semantic networks in the UNL format. Other application software is dEep-to-sUrface GENErator (EUGENE), which is an open-source interactive NLizer. It generates natural language sentences out of semantic networks represented in the UNL format. In this paper, NLization framework with EUGENE is focused, while using UNL system for accomplishing the task of machine translation. In whole NLization process, EUGENE takes a UNL input and delivers an output in natural language without any human intervention. It is language-independent and has to be parametrized to the natural language input through a dictionary and a grammar, provided as separate interpretable files. In this paper, it is explained that how UNL input is syntactically and semantically analyzed with the UNL-NL T-Grammar for NLization of UNL sentences involving verbs, pronouns and determiners for Punjabi natural language.
