Evaluation the efficiency of artificial bee colony and the firefly algorithm in solving the continuous optimization problem

Now the Meta-Heuristic algorithms have been used vastly in solving the problem of continuous optimization. In this paper the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the Firefly Algorithm (FA) are valuated. And for presenting the efficiency of the algorithms and also for more analysis of them, the continuous optimization problems which are of the type of the problems of vast limit of answer and the close optimized points are tested. So, in this paper the efficiency of the ABC algorithm and FA are presented for solving the continuous optimization problems and also the said algorithms are studied from the accuracy in reaching the optimized solution and the resulting time and the reliability of the optimized answer points of view.
