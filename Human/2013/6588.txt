Evolutionary Approach for the Containers Bin-Packing Problem

This paper deals with the resolution of combinatorial optimization problems, particularly those concerning the maritime transport scheduling. We are interested in the management platforms in a river port and more specifically in container organisation operations with a view to minimizing the number of container rehandlings. Subsequently, we rmeet customers delivery deadlines and we reduce ship stoppage time In this paper, we propose a genetic algorithm to solve this problem and we present some experiments and results.
