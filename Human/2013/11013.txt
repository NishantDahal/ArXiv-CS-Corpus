A note on the factorization conjecture

We give partial results on the factorization conjecture on codes proposed by Schutzenberger. We consider finite maximal codes C over the alphabet A = {a, b} with C \cap a^* = a^p, for a prime number p. Let P, S in Z <A>, with S = S_0 + S_1, supp(S_0) \subset a^* and supp(S_1) \subset a^*b supp(S_0). We prove that if (P,S) is a factorization for C then (P,S) is positive, that is P,S have coefficients 0,1, and we characterize the structure of these codes. As a consequence, we prove that if C is a finite maximal code such that each word in C has at most 4 occurrences of b's and a^p is in C, then each factorization for C is a positive factorization. We also discuss the structure of these codes. The obtained results show once again relations between (positive) factorizations and factorizations of cyclic groups.
