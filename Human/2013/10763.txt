Designing Markets for Daily Deals

Daily deals platforms such as Amazon Local, Google Offers, GroupOn, and LivingSocial have provided a new channel for merchants to directly market to consumers. In order to maximize consumer acquisition and retention, these platforms would like to offer deals that give good value to users. Currently, selecting such deals is done manually; however, the large number of submarkets and localities necessitates an automatic approach to selecting good deals and determining merchant payments.
  We approach this challenge as a market design problem. We postulate that merchants already have a good idea of the attractiveness of their deal to consumers as well as the amount they are willing to pay to offer their deal. The goal is to design an auction that maximizes a combination of the revenue of the auctioneer (platform), welfare of the bidders (merchants), and the positive externality on a third party (the consumer), despite the asymmetry of information about this consumer benefit. We design auctions that truthfully elicit this information from the merchants and maximize the social welfare objective, and we characterize the consumer welfare functions for which this objective is truthfully implementable. We generalize this characterization to a very broad mechanism-design setting and give examples of other applications.
