Data Mining Based Technique for IDS Alerts Classification

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become a widely used measure for security systems. The main problem for those systems results is the irrelevant alerts on those results. We will propose a data mining based method for classification to distinguish serious alerts and irrelevant one with a performance of 99.9% which is better in comparison with the other recent data mining methods that have reached the performance of 97%. A ranked alerts list also created according to alerts importance to minimize human interventions.
