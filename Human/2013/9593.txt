Towards a Unified Belief Structure in Games with indeterminate probabilities

This paper provides an analysis of different formal representations of beliefs in epistemic game theory. The aim is to attempt a synthesis of different structures of beliefs in the presence of indeterminate probabilities. Special attention is also paid to the decision-theoretic principle known as the thesis of no subjective probability for self-action. Conditions in cope with this principle are given which underlie the interrelationships between different models of beliefs, and it is shown that under these conditions different doxastic structures can be coherently unified.
