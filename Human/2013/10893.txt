New Bounds on the Capacity of Fiber-Optics Communications

By taking advantage of the temporal correlations of the nonlinear phase noise in WDM systems we show that the capacity of a nonlinear fiber link is notably higher than what is currently assumed. This advantage is translated into the doubling of the link distance for a fixed transmission rate.
