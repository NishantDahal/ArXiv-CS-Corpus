Personalized Email Community Detection using Collaborative Similarity Measure

Email service providers have employed many email classification and prioritization systems over the last decade to improve their services. In order to assist email services, we propose a personalized email community detection method to discover the groupings of email users based on their structural and semantic intimacy. We extract the personalized social graph from a set of emails by uniquely leveraging each node with communication behavior. Subsequently, collaborative similarity measure (CSM) based intra-graph clustering approach detects personalized communities. The empirical analysis shows effectiveness of the resultant communities in terms of evaluation measures, i.e. density, entropy and f-measure. Moreover, email strainer, dynamic group prediction, and fraudulent account detection are suggested as the potential applications from both the service provider and user's point of view.
