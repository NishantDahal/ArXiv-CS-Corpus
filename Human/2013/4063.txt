Particularities of Analog FCS Optimization

There is analyzed a performance of optimal feedback communication systems with the analog transmitters in the forward channel (AFCS). It is shown that measures and limit boundaries of AFCS performance are similar but differ from those used in digital communications and information theory. The causes of the differences are discussed.
