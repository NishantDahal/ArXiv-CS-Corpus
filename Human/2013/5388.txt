Capacity of a Simple Intercellular Signal Transduction Channel

We model the ligand-receptor molecular communication channel with a discrete-time Markov model, and show how to obtain the capacity of this channel. We show that the capacity-achieving input distribution is iid; further, unusually for a channel with memory, we show that feedback does not increase the capacity of this channel.
