Using UWB for Human Trajectory Extraction

In this paper we report on a methodology to model pedestrian behaviours whilst aggregate variables are concerned, with potential applications to different situations, such as evacuating a building in emergency events. The approach consists of using UWB (ultra-wide band) based data collection to characterise behaviour in specific scenarios. From a number of experiments carried out, we detail the single-file scenario to demonstrate the ability of this approach to represent macroscopic characteristics of the pedestrian flow. Results are discussed and we can conclude that UWB-based data collection shows great potential and suitability for human trajectory extraction, when compared to other traditional approaches.
