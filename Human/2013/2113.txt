Optimizing Client Association in 60 GHz Wireless Access Networks

MillimeterWave communications in the 60 GHz band are considered one of the key technologies for enabling multi-gigabit wireless access. However, the high propagation loss in such a band poses major obstacles to the optimal utilization of the wireless resources, where the problem of efficient client association to access points (APs) is of vital importance. In this paper, the client association in 60 GHz wireless access networks is investigated. The AP utilization and the quality of the rapidly vanishing communication links are the control parameters. Because of the tricky non-convex and combinatorial nature of the client association optimization problem, a novel solution method is developed to guarantee balanced and fair resource allocation. A new distributed, lightweight and easy to implement association algorithm, based on Lagrangian duality theory and subgradient methods, was proposed. It is shown that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal, that is, the relative duality gap diminishes to zero as the number of clients increases. Both theoretical and numerical results evince numerous useful properties of the algorithm, such as fast convergence, scalability, time efficiency, and fair execution in comparison to existing approaches. It is concluded that the proposed solution can be applied in the forthcoming 60 GHz wireless access networks.
