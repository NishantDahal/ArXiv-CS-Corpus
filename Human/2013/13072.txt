Detecting Similarity of Rational Plane Curves

A novel and deterministic algorithm is presented to detect whether two given rational plane curves are related by means of a similarity, which is a central question in Pattern Recognition. As a by-product it finds all such similarities, and the particular case of equal curves yields all symmetries. A complete theoretical description of the method is provided, and the method has been implemented and tested in the Sage system for curves of moderate degrees.
