Update XML Views

View update is the problem of translating an update to a view to some updates to the source data of the view. In this paper, we show the factors determining XML view update translation, propose a translation procedure, and propose translated updates to the source document for different types of views. We further show that the translated updates are precise. The proposed solution makes it possible for users who do not have access privileges to the source data to update the source data via a view.
