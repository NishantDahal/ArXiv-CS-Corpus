An Improved Structure Of Reversible Adder And Subtractor

In today's world everyday a new technology which is faster, smaller and more complex than its predecessor is being developed. The increased number of transistors packed onto a chip of a conventional system results in increased power consumption that is why Reversible logic has drawn attention of Researchers due to its less heat dissipating characteristics. Reversible logic can be imposed over applications such as quantum computing, optical computing, quantum dot cellular automata, low power VLSI circuits, DNA computing. This paper presents the reversible combinational circuit of adder, subtractor and parity preserving subtractor. The suggested circuit in this paper are designed using Feynman, Double Feynman and MUX gates which are better than the existing one in literature in terms of Quantum cost, Garbage output and Total logical calculations.
