Utilizing Noise Addition for Data Privacy, an Overview

The internet is increasingly becoming a standard for both the production and consumption of data while at the same time cyber-crime involving the theft of private data is growing. Therefore in efforts to securely transact in data, privacy and security concerns must be taken into account to ensure that the confidentiality of individuals and entities involved is not compromised, and that the data published is compliant to privacy laws. In this paper, we take a look at noise addition as one of the data privacy providing techniques. Our endeavor in this overview is to give a foundational perspective on noise addition data privacy techniques, provide statistical consideration for noise addition techniques and look at the current state of the art in the field, while outlining future areas of research.
