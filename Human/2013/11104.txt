Proceedings Sixth Transformation Tool Contest

The aim of the Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) series is to compare the expressiveness, the usability and the performance of graph and model transformation tools along a number of selected case studies. Participants want to learn about the pros and cons of each tool considering different applications. A deeper understanding of the relative merits of different tool features will help to further improve graph and model transformation tools and to indicate open problems. 
  TTC 2013 involved 18 offline case study solutions: 6 solutions to the FlowGraphs case, 9 solutions to the Petri Nets to Statecharts case and 3 solutions to the Restructuring case. 13 of the 18 solutions have undergone a non-blind peer review before the workshop and were presented and evaluated during the workshop in Budapest.  This volume contains the submissions that have passed an additional (post-workshop, blind) reviewing round.
