Time varying ISI model for nonlinear interference noise

We show that the effect of nonlinear interference in WDM systems is equivalent to slowly varying inter-symbol-interference (ISI), and hence its cancellation can be carried out by means of adaptive linear filtering. We characterize the ISI coefficients and discuss the potential gain following from their cancellation.
