Evaluating Wireless Reactive Routing Protocols with Linear Programming Model for Wireless Ad-hoc Networks

In Wireless Ad-hoc Networks, nodes are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily, thus topology may change quickly and capriciously. In Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks, specially Wireless Multi-hop Networks provide users with facility of quick communication. In Wireless Multi-hop Networks, routing protocols with energy efficient and delay reduction techniques are needed to fulfill users demands. In this paper, we present Linear Programming models to assess and enhance reactive routing protocols. To practically examine constraints of respective Linear Programming models over reactive protocols, we select AODV, DSR and DYMO. It is deduced from analytical simulations of Linear Programming models in MATLAB that quick route repair reduces routing latency and optimizations of retransmission attempts results efficient energy utilization. To provide quick repair, we enhance AODV and DSR. To practically examine the efficiency of enhanced protocols in different scenarios of Wireless Multi-hop Networks, we conduct simulations using NS-2. From simulation results, enhanced DSR and AODV achieve efficient output by optimizing routing latencies and routing load in terms of retransmission attempts.
