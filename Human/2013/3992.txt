List total coloring of pseudo-outerplanar graphs

A graph is pseudo-outerplanar if each of its blocks has an embedding in the plane so that the vertices lie on a fixed circle and the edges lie inside the disk of this circle with each of them crossing at most one another. It is proved that every pseudo-outerplanar graph with maximum degree Δ\geq 5 is totally (Δ+1)-choosable.
