Resolution in Linguistic Propositional Logic based on Linear Symmetrical Hedge Algebra

The paper introduces a propositional linguistic logic that serves as the basis for automated uncertain reasoning with linguistic information. First, we build a linguistic logic system with truth value domain based on a linear symmetrical hedge algebra. Then, we consider GÃ¶del's t-norm and t-conorm to define the logical connectives for our logic. Next, we present a resolution inference rule, in which two clauses having contradictory linguistic truth values can be resolved. We also give the concept of reliability in order to capture the approximative nature of the resolution inference rule. Finally, we propose a resolution procedure with the maximal reliability.
