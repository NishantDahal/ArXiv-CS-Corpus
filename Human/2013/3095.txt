Proposed Video Encryption Algorithm v/s Other Existing Algorithms: A Comparative Study

Securing multimedia data has become of utmost importance especially in the applications related to military purposes. With the rise in development in computer and internet technology, multimedia data has become the most convenient method for military training. An innovative encryption algorithm for videos compressed using H.264 was proposed to safely exchange highly confidential videos. To maintain a balance between security and computational time, the proposed algorithm shuffles the video frames along with the audio, and then AES is used to selectively encrypt the sensitive video codewords. Using this approach unauthorized viewing of the video file can be prevented and hence this algorithm provides a high level of security. A comparative study of the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms has been put forward in this paper to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
