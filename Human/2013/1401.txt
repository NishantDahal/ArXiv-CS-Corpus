HCI considerations in Designing a Second Life Virtual Therapeutic Community for the Support & Treatment of People with Borderline Personality Disorder

This paper aims to present the current position of the ongoing research into developing the requirements and acceptance of a virtual therapeutic community in Second Life, specifically for people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The research has identified this particular user group given that people with BPD often require high levels of support, which can result in emergency hospital admissions, in addition to the significant economic cost of treating people BPD in relation to other mental illnesses (NCCMH, 2009). The research is also intended to be used as framework for other mental health conditions. This work is a continuation of the research carried out in exploring the potential of virtual therapeutic communities based on existing models of therapeutic hospitals as well as virtual treatments and support, in treating people with BPD. An interdisciplinary approach to this research features collaboration from areas in HCI, forensic psychology and psychotherapy.
