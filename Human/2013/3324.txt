On reasoning in networks with qualitative uncertainty

In this paper some initial work towards a new approach to qualitative reasoning under uncertainty is presented.  This method is not only applicable to qualitative probabilistic reasoning, as is the case with other methods, but also allows the qualitative propagation within networks of values based upon possibility theory and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.  The method is applied to two simple networks from which a large class of directed graphs may be constructed.  The results of this analysis are used to compare the qualitative behaviour of the three major quantitative uncertainty handling formalisms, and to demonstrate that the qualitative integration of the formalisms is possible under certain assumptions.
