Addendum to Uniqueness of certain polynomials constant on a line

The computer calculations in arXiv:0808.0284 to classify sharp polynomials with nonegative coefficients constant on the line $x+y=1$ have been extended to degrees 19 and 21. In degree 19 a surprisingly large number of 13 sharp polynomials was found, while in degree 21 only the group invariant polynomial exists.
