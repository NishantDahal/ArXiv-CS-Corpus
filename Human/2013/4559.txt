Quantum Cryptography Using Various Reversible Quantum Logic Gates in WSNs

As sensor nodes are deployed anywhere in a wireless sensor network, hence their communication can be easily monitored. In these networks, message protection and node identification are very issues. Hence, security of large scale such networks requires efficient key distribution and management mechanisms. Quantum cryptography and particularly quantum key distribution is such a technique that allocates secure keys only for short distances. While not completely secure, it offers huge advantages over traditional methods by the use of entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. Reversible logic gates like CNOT, Toffoli, Fredkin etc. are of basic importance in Quantum Computing. In our research, we adopted a EPR-pair allocation scheme in terms of these quantum gates to overcome the susceptibility caused by malicious nodes. As the qubits stored in a sensor node can be used only once and cannot be duplicated, hence risk of information leakage reduced even if the node are compromised.
