This paper aims to identify the key dimensions that shape the relationship quality among Jordanian and foreign banks and their customers who are utilizing the e-Banking services.

Survey data from 350 customers from four Jordanian banks and four foreign banks in Amman city the capital of Jordan were collected and used to test the proposed hypotheses.
