Solution of System of Linear Equations - A Neuro-Fuzzy Approach

Neuro-Fuzzy Modeling has been applied in a wide variety of fields such as Decision Making, Engineering and Management Sciences etc. In particular, applications of this Modeling technique in Decision Making by involving complex Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations have remarkable significance. In this Paper, we present Polak-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient based Neural Network with Fuzzy rules to solve System of Simultaneous Linear Algebraic Equations. This is achieved using Fuzzy Backpropagation Learning Rule. The implementation results show that the proposed Neuro-Fuzzy Network yields effective solutions for exactly determined, underdetermined and over-determined Systems of Linear Equations. This fact is demonstrated by the Computational Complexity analysis of the Neuro-Fuzzy Algorithm. The proposed Algorithm is simulated effectively using MATLAB software. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work of the Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations using Neuro-Fuzzy Modeling.
