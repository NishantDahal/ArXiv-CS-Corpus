Generalizations of the Los-Tarski Preservation Theorem

We present new preservation theorems that semantically characterize the $\exists^k \forall^*$ and $\forall^k \exists^*$ prefix classes of first order logic, for each natural number $k$. Unlike preservation theorems in the literature that characterize the $\exists^* \forall^*$ and $\forall^* \exists^*$ prefix classes, our theorems relate the count of quantifiers in the leading block of the quantifier prefix to natural quantitative properties of the models. As special cases of our results, we obtain the classical Los-Tarski preservation theorem for sentences in both its extensional and substructural versions. For arbitrary finite vocabularies, we also generalize the extensional version of the Los-Tarski preservation theorem for theories. We also present an interpolant-based approach towards these results. Finally, we present partial results towards generalizing to theories, the substructural version of the Los-Tarski theorem and in the process, we give a preservation theorem that provides a semantic characterization of $Î£^0_n$ theories for each natural number $n$.
