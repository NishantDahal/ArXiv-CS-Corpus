Multi-command Tactile Brain Computer Interface: A Feasibility Study

The study presented explores the extent to which tactile stimuli delivered to the ten digits of a BCI-naive subject can serve as a platform for a brain computer interface (BCI) that could be used in an interactive application such as robotic vehicle operation. The ten fingertips are used to evoke somatosensory brain responses, thus defining a tactile brain computer interface (tBCI). Experimental results on subjects performing online (real-time) tBCI, using stimuli with a moderately fast inter-stimulus-interval (ISI), provide a validation of the tBCI prototype, while the feasibility of the concept is illuminated through information-transfer rates obtained through the case study.
