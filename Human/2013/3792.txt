TCloud: A Dynamic Framework and Policies for Access Control across Multiple Domains in Cloud Computing

In a cloud computing environment, access control policy is an effective means of fortification cloud users and cloud resources services against security infringements. Based on analysis of current cloud computing security characteristics, the preamble of the concept of trust, role-based access control policy, combined with the characteristics of the cloud computing environment, there are multiple security management domains, so a new cross domain framework is for access control is proposed which is based on trust. It will establish and calculate the degree of trust in the single as well as multiple domains. Role Based Access Control is used for the implementation of the access control policies in a single domain environment with the introduction of the trust concept. In multiple domains the access control will be based on the conversion of roles. On the basis of trust, and role based access control model, a new novel framework of flexible cross domain access control framework is presented. The role assignment and conversion will take place dynamically.
