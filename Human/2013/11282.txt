Trajectory control of a bipedal walking robot with inertial disc

In this paper we exploit some interesting properties of a class of bipedal robots which have an inertial disc. One of this properties is the ability to control every position and speed except for the disc position. The proposed control is designed in two hierarchic levels. The first will drive the robot geometry, while the second will control the speed and also the angular momentum. The exponential stability of this approach is proved around some neighborhood of the nominal trajectory defining the geometry of the step. This control will not spend energy to adjust the disc position and neither to synchronize the trajectory with the time. The proposed control only takes action to correct the essential aspects of the walking gait. Computational simulations are presented for different conditions, serving as a empirical test for the neighborhood of attraction.
