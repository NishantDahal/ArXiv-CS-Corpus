Epistemic Learning Programs A Calculus for Describing Epistemic Action Models

Dynamic Epistemic Logic makes it possible to model and reason about information change in multi-agent systems. Information change is mathematically modeled through epistemic action Kripke models introduced by Baltag et al. Also, van Ditmarsch interprets the information change as a relation between epistemic states and sets of epistemic states and to describe it formally, he considers a special constructor LB called learning operator. Inspired by this, it seems natural to us that the basic source of information change in a multi-agent system should be learning an announcement by some agents together, privately, concurrently or even wrongly. Hence moving along this path, we introduce the notion of a learning program and prove that all finite K45 action models can be described by our learning programs
