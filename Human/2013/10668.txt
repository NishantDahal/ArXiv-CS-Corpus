Evolution of the Modern Phase of Written Bangla: A Statistical Study

Active languages such as Bangla (or Bengali) evolve over time due to a variety of social, cultural, economic, and political issues. In this paper, we analyze the change in the written form of the modern phase of Bangla quantitatively in terms of character-level, syllable-level, morpheme-level and word-level features. We collect three different types of corpora---classical, newspapers and blogs---and test whether the differences in their features are statistically significant. Results suggest that there are significant changes in the length of a word when measured in terms of characters, but there is not much difference in usage of different characters, syllables and morphemes in a word or of different words in a sentence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on Bangla of this kind.
