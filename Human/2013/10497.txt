The 10-point and 12-point Number Theoretic Hilbert Transform

This paper presents 10-point and 12-point versions of the recently introduced number theoretic Hilbert (NHT) transforms. Such transforms have applications in signal processing and scrambling. Polymorphic solutions with respect to different moduli for each of the two cases have been found. The multiplicity of solutions for the same moduli increases their applicability to cryptography.
