Tightened Exponential Bounds for Discrete Time, Conditionally Symmetric Martingales with Bounded Jumps

This letter derives some new exponential bounds for discrete time, real valued, conditionally symmetric martingales with bounded jumps. The new bounds are extended to conditionally symmetric sub/ supermartingales, and they are compared to some existing bounds.
