Wideband Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey

Cognitive radio has emerged as one of the most promising candidate solutions to improve spectrum utilization in next generation cellular networks. A crucial requirement for future cognitive radio networks is wideband spectrum sensing: secondary users reliably detect spectral opportunities across a wide frequency range. In this article, various wideband spectrum sensing algorithms are presented, together with a discussion of the pros and cons of each algorithm and the challenging issues. Special attention is paid to the use of sub-Nyquist techniques, including compressive sensing and multi-channel sub-Nyquist sampling techniques.
