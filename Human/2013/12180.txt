A Novel Carrier Waveform Inter-Displacement Modulation Method in Underwater Communication Channel

As the main way of underwater wireless communication, underwater acoustic communication is one of the focuses of ocean research. Compared with the free space wireless communication channel, the underwater acoustic channel suffers from more severe multipath effect, the less available bandwidth and the even complex noise. The underwater acoustic channel is one of the most complicated wireless communication channels. To achieve a reliable underwater acoustic communication, Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation and Passive Time Reversal Mirror (PTRM) equalization are considered to be a suitable scheme. However, due to the serious distortion of the received signal caused by the channel, this scheme suffers from a high Bit Error Rate (BER) under the condition of the low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). To solve this problem, we proposes a Carrier Waveform Inter-Displacement (CWID) modulation method based on the Linear Frequency Modulation (LFM) PSK and PTRM scheme. The new communication scheme reduces BER by increasing the difference from the carrier waveform for different symbols. Simulation results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.
