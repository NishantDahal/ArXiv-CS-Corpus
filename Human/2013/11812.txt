An axiomatic characterization of generalized entropies under analyticity condition

We present the characterization of the Nath, Rényi and Havrda-Charvát-Tsallis entropies under the assumption that they are analytic function with respect to the distribution dimension, unlike the the previous characterizations, which supposes that they are expandable maximized for uniform distribution.
