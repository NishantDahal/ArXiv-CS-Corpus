Research Excellence Milestones of BRIC and N-11 Countries

While scientific performance is an important aspect of a stable and healthy economy, measures for it have yet to gain their place in economic country profiles. As useful indicators for this performance dimension, this paper introduces the concept of milestones for research excellence, as points of transition to higher-level contributions at the leading edge of science. The proposed milestones are based on two indicators associated with research excellence, the impact vitality profile and the production of review type publications, both applied to a country's publications in the top journals Nature and Science. The milestones are determined for two distinct groups of emerging market economies: the BRIC countries, which outperformed the relative growth expected at their identification in 2001, and the N-11 or Next Eleven countries, identified in 2005 as potential candidates for a BRIC-like evolution. Results show how these two groups at different economic levels can be clearly distinguished based on the research milestones, indicating a potential utility as parameters in an economic context.
