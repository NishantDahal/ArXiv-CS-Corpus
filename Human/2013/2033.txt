On graphic lambda calculus and the dual of the graphic beta move

This is a short description of graphic lambda calculus, with special emphasis on a duality suggested by the two different appearances of knot diagrams, in lambda calculus and emergent algebra sectors of the graphic lambda calculus respectively. This duality leads to the introduction of the dual of the graphic beta move. While the graphic beta move corresponds to beta reduction in untyped lambda calculus, the dual graphic beta move appears in relation to emergent algebras.
