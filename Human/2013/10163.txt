Hybrid-Logical Reasoning in False-Belief Tasks

The main aim of the present paper is to use a proof system for hybrid modal logic to formalize what are called falsebelief tasks in cognitive psychology, thereby investigating the interplay between cognition and logical reasoning about belief. We consider two different versions of the Smarties task, involving respectively a shift of perspective to another person and to another time. Our formalizations disclose that despite this difference, the two versions of the Smarties task have exactly the same underlying logical structure. We also consider the Sally-Anne task, having a somewhat more complicated logical structure, presupposing a "principle of inertia" saying that a belief is preserved over time, unless there is belief to the contrary.
