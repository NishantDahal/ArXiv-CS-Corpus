Polar Coded Modulation with Optimal Constellation Labeling

A practical $2^m$-ary polar coded modulation (PCM) scheme with optimal constellation labeling is proposed. To efficiently find the optimal labeling rule, the search space is reduced by exploiting the symmetry properties of the channels. Simulation results show that the proposed PCM scheme can outperform the bit-interleaved turbo coded modulation scheme used in the WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) mobile communication systems by up to 1.5dB.
