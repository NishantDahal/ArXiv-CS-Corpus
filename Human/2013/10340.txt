Laplacian Spectral Properties of Graphs from Random Local Samples

The Laplacian eigenvalues of a network play an important role in the analysis of many structural and dynamical network problems. In this paper, we study the relationship between the eigenvalue spectrum of the normalized Laplacian matrix and the structure of `local' subgraphs of the network. We call a subgraph \emph{local} when it is induced by the set of nodes obtained from a breath-first search (BFS) of radius $r$ around a node. In this paper, we propose techniques to estimate spectral properties of the normalized Laplacian matrix from a random collection of induced local subgraphs. In particular, we provide an algorithm to estimate the spectral moments of the normalized Laplacian matrix (the power-sums of its eigenvalues). Moreover, we propose a technique, based on convex optimization, to compute upper and lower bounds on the spectral radius of the normalized Laplacian matrix from local subgraphs. We illustrate our results studying the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a large-scale online social network.
