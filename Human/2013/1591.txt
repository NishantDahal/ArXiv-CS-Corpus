Impact of Pointing Errors on the Performance of Mixed RF/FSO Dual-Hop Transmission Systems

In this work, the performance analysis of a dual-hop relay transmission system composed of asymmetric radio-frequency (RF)/free-space optical (FSO) links with pointing errors is presented. More specifically, we build on the system model presented in [1] to derive new exact closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, probability density function, moment generating function, and moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the Meijer's G function. We then capitalize on these results to offer new exact closed-form expressions for the higher-order amount of fading, average error rate for binary and M-ary modulation schemes, and the ergodic capacity, all in terms of Meijer's G functions. Our new analytical results were also verified via computer-based Monte-Carlo simulation results.
