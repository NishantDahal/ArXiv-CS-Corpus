Generalized Public Key Transformations with Side Information

This paper presents results on generalized public key cryptography with exponentials modulo primes and composite numbers where the mapping is not one-to-one and the uniqueness is achieved by additional side information. Such transformations may be used for oblivious transfer and generate events of specific probabilities.
