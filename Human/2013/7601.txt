Theorema 2.0: A Graphical User Interface for a Mathematical Assistant System

Theorema 2.0 stands for a re-design including a complete re-implementation of the Theorema system, which was originally designed, developed, and implemented by Bruno Buchberger and his Theorema group at RISC. In this paper, we present the first prototype of a graphical user interface (GUI) for the new system. It heavily relies on powerful interactive capabilities introduced in recent releases of the underlying Mathematica system, most importantly the possibility of having dynamic objects connected to interface elements like sliders, menus, check-boxes, radio-buttons and the like. All these features are fully integrated into the Mathematica programming environment and allow the implementation of a modern user interface.
