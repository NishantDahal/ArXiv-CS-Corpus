The Logarithmic Curvature Graphs of Generalised Cornu Spirals

The Generalized Cornu Spiral (GCS) was first proposed by Ali et al. in 1995 [9]. Due to the monotonocity of its curvature function, the surface generated with GCS segments has been considered as a high quality surface and it has potential applications in surface design [2]. In this paper, the analysis of GCS segment is carried out by determining its aesthetic value using the log curvature Graph (LCG) as proposed by Kanaya et al.[10]. The analysis of LCG supports the claim that GCS is indeed a generalized aesthetic curve.
