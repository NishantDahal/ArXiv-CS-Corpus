On Convex Polytopes in the d-dimensional Space Containing and Avoiding Zero

The goal of this paper is to establish certain inequalities between the numbers of convex polytopes in the d-dimensional space "containing" and "avoiding" zero provided that their vertex sets are subsets of a given finite set of points in the space.
