Understanding BitTorrent Through Real Measurements

In this paper the results of the BitTorrent measurement study are presented. Two sources of BitTorrent data were utilized: meta-data files that describe the content of resources shared by BitTorrent users and the logs of one of the currently most popular BitTorrent clients - μTorrent. μTorrent is founded upon a rather newly released UDP-based μTP protocol that is claimed to be more efficient than TCP-based clients. Experimental data have been collected for fifteen days from the popular torrent-discovery site thepiratebay.org (more than 30,000 torrents were captured and analyzed). During this period the activity and logs of an unmodified version of μTorrent client downloading sessions have been also captured. The obtained experimental results are swarm-oriented (not tracker-oriented as has been previously researched), which has allowed us to look at BitTorrent and its users from an exchanged resources perspective. Moreover, comparative analysis of the clients' connections with and without μTP protocol is carried out to verify to what extent μTP improves BitTorrent transmissions. To the authors' best knowledge, none of the previous studies have addressed these issues.
