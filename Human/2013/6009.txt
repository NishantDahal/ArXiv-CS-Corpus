Trace representation and linear complexity of binary sequences derived from Fermat quotients

We describe the trace representations of two families of binary sequences derived from Fermat quotients modulo an odd prime $p$ (one is the binary threshold sequences, the other is the Legendre-Fermat quotient sequences) via determining the defining pairs of all binary characteristic sequences of cosets, which coincide with the sets of pre-images modulo $p^2$ of each fixed value of Fermat quotients. From the defining pairs, we can obtain an earlier result of linear complexity for the binary threshold sequences and a new result of linear complexity for the Legendre-Fermat quotient sequences under the assumption of $2^{p-1}\not\equiv 1 \bmod {p^2}$.
