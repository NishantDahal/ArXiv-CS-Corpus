Hardware Acceleration of the Gipps Model for Real-Time Traffic Simulation

Traffic simulation software is becoming increasingly popular as more cities worldwide use it to better manage their crowded traffic networks. An important requirement for such software is the ability to produce accurate results in real time, requiring great computation resources. This work proposes an ASIC-based hardware accelerated approach for the AIMSUN traffic simulator, taking advantage of repetitive tasks in the algorithm. Different system configurations using this accelerator are also discussed. Compared with the traditional software simulator, it has been found to improve the performance by as much as 9x when using a single processing element approach, or more depending on the chosen hardware configuration.
