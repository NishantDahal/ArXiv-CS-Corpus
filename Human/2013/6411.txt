Detecting Useless Transitions in Pushdown Automata

Pushdown automata may contain transitions that are never used in any accepting run of the automaton. We present an algorithm for detecting such useless transitions. A finite automaton that captures the possible stack content during runs of the pushdown automaton, is first constructed in a forward procedure to determine which transitions are reachable, and then employed in a backward procedure to determine which of these transitions can lead to a final stat
