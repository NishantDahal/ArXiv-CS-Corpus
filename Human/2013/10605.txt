Development of Biofeedback Mechanisms in a Procedural Environment Using Biometric Sensors

Before the computer age, games were played in the physical world where players would have to interact with real objects and each other, triggering a series of emotions. Nowadays, the computer games have become one of the most popular forms of entertainment due to their high-level of attraction and accessibility. However, the game industry is always trying to find new ways of making games more interactive and exciting in order to attract new players, and one of the recent trends on the area of human-computer interaction is Biofeedback.
  The goal of this dissertation is to study different approaches on the use of indirect biofeedback within videogames, with the purpose of creating a better human-computer interaction, and provide a more appealing and immersive user experience. For this, we focused on the development of a framework capable of testing different indirect biofeedback models within a specified game, in order to assess the effect of each of these variations on the user experience. This framework is game independent, with the intention of being used on further studies.
