Object Tracking in Videos: Approaches and Issues

Mobile object tracking has an important role in the computer vision applications. In this paper, we use a tracked target-based taxonomy to present the object tracking algorithms. The tracked targets are divided into three categories: points of interest, appearance and silhouette of mobile objects. Advantages and limitations of the tracking approaches are also analyzed to find the future directions in the object tracking domain.
