Degree Correlations in Random Geometric Graphs

Spatially embedded networks are important in several disciplines. The prototypical spatial net- work we assume is the Random Geometric Graph of which many properties are known. Here we present new results for the two-point degree correlation function in terms of the clustering coefficient of the graphs for two-dimensional space in particular, with extensions to arbitrary finite dimension.
