MARTE Profile-based MDA approach for semantic NFP-aware Web services

Non Functional Properties (NFPs) such as security, quality of service and business related properties enhance the service description and provide necessary information about the fitness of its behaviour. These properties have become crucial criteria for efficient selection and composition of Web services. However, they belong to different domains, are complex, change frequently and have to be semantically described. The W3C standard WSPolicy,recommended to describe these properties doesn t define standardized specifications that cover all NFPs domains. Moreover, it doesn t provide an easy manner to express them independently of domains, and doesn t support their semantic. This paper proposes a Model driven approach to describe and automatically generate enriched Web services including semantic NFPs. It explores both the use of the OMG Profile for Modelling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded Systems (MARTE) and the W3C standards. Mapping rules, from NFPs profile to WS-Policy and SAWSDL files, transforms NFPs into policies associated with WSDL elements.
