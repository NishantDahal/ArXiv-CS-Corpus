The Number Theoretic Hilbert Transform

This paper presents a general expression for a number-theoretic Hilbert transform (NHT). The transformations preserve the circulant nature of the discrete Hilbert transform (DHT) matrix together with alternating values in each row being zero and non-zero. Specific examples for 4-point, 6-point, and 8-point NHT are provided. The NHT transformation can be used as a primitive to create cryptographically useful scrambling transformations.
