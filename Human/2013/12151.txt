Towards supporting simultaneous use of process-based quality approaches

In this paper we describe the first steps of a PhD programme, having the goal to develop a common meta-model for different software quality approaches and methods. We focus on presenting the structure of quality approaches emphasizing the similarities amongst them. Understanding the structure of quality approaches helps supporting organizations in using multiple quality approaches and methods in the same time.
