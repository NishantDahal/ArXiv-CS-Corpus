Control Strategies for Mobile Robot With Obstacle Avoidance

Obstacle avoidance is an important task in the field of robotics, since the goal of autonomous robot is to reach the destination without collision. Several algorithms have been proposed for obstacle avoidance, having drawbacks and benefits. In this survey paper, we mainly discussed different algorithms for robot navigation with obstacle avoidance. We also compared all provided algorithms and mentioned their characteristics; advantages and disadvantages, so that we can select final efficient algorithm by fusing discussed algorithms. Comparison table is provided for justifying the area of interest
