Angle Optimization of Graphs Embedded in the Plane

In this paper we study problems of drawing graphs in the plane using edge length constraints and angle optimization. Specifically we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum angle, the MMA problem. We solve the MMA problem using a spring-embedding approach where two forces are applied to the vertices of the graph: a force optimizing edge lengths and a force optimizing angles. We solve analytically the problem of computing an optimal displacement of a graph vertex optimizing the angles between edges incident to it if the degree of the vertex is at most three. We also apply a numerical approach for computing the forces applied to vertices of higher degree. We implemented our algorithm in Java and present drawings of some graphs.
