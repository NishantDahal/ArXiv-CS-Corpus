Spin polarized induction of quantum correlations-entanglement using a 2 MeV proton beam channeling

In solid_state hybrid electron_nuclear spin systems quantum entanglement plays vital role in allowing accessible transfer of information between subatomic particles, regardless of the host lattice coordination spatial geometry, revealing the powerful resource for nuclear quantum states engineering. Here we present study of 2 MeV superfocused channeled proton (SCP) beam induced polarization of atom_photon correlated states, established in isotopically purified silicon nanocrystal. Two level entangling interaction which couples an initial quantum state to two possible light_matter states via silicon nanocrystal interface is presented. The anisotropic hyperfine coupling is demonstrated by strong mixing of quantum states within the control mechanism of the coherent proton pulse sequence. Obtained results reveal the mutual predictable correlation of particles of energy_matter, by using the fully broadcastable and precise hybrid electron_nuclear spin qubit manipulations which can be exploited for the speed_superior communication channels keeping at the same time the maximum degree of data preservation.
