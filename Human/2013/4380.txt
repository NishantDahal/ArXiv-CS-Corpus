On MITL and alternating timed automata

One clock alternating timed automata OCATA have been recently introduced as natural extension of (one clock) timed automata to express the semantics of MTL (Ouaknine, Worrell 2005). We consider the application of OCATA to problem of model-checking MITL formulas (a syntactic fragment of MTL) against timed automata. We introduce a new semantics for OCATA where, intuitively, clock valuations are intervals instead of single real values. Thanks to this new semantics, we show that we can bound the number of clock copies that are necessary to allow an OCATA to recognise the models of an MITL formula. Equipped with this technique, we propose a new algorithm to translate an MITL formula into a timed automaton, and we sketch several ideas to define new model checking algorithms for MITL.
