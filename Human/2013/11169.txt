A Survey: Various Techniques of Image Compression

This paper addresses about various image compression techniques. On the basis of analyzing the various image compression techniques this paper presents a survey of existing research papers. In this paper we analyze different types of existing method of image compression. Compression of an image is significantly different then compression of binary raw data. To solve these use different types of techniques for image compression. Now there is question may be arise that how to image compress and which types of technique is used. For this purpose there are basically two types are method are introduced namely lossless and lossy image compression techniques. In present time some other techniques are added with basic method. In some area neural network genetic algorithms are used for image compression.
  Keywords-Image Compression; Lossless; Lossy; Redundancy; Benefits of Compression.
