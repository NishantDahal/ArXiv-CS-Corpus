Cognitive Radios: A Survey of Methods for Channel State Prediction

This paper discusses the need for Cognitive Radio ability in view of the physical scarcity of wireless spectrum for communication. A background of the Cognitive Radio technology is presented and the aspect of 'channel state prediction' is focused upon. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been traditionally used to model the wireless channel behavior but it suffers from certain limitations. We discuss few techniques of channel state prediction using machine-learning methods and will extend the Conditional Random Field (CRF) procedure to this field.
