Randomness extraction and asymptotic Hamming distance

We obtain a non-implication result in the Medvedev degrees by studying sequences that are close to Martin-Löf random in asymptotic Hamming distance. Our result is that the class of stochastically bi-immune sets is not Medvedev reducible to the class of sets having complex packing dimension 1.
