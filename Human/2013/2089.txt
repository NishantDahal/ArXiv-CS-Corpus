  The program included 1 invited talk, 9 technical presentations and a panel discussion on Prolog open standards (open.pl). Each programme paper was reviewed by 3 reviewers.
  CICLOPS'12 continues a tradition of successful workshops on Implementations of Logic Programming Systems, previously held in Budapest (1993) and Ithaca (1994), the Compulog Net workshops on Parallelism and Implementation Technologies held in Madrid (1993 and 1994), Utrecht (1995) and Bonn (1996), the Workshop on Parallelism and Implementation Technology for (Constraint) Logic Programming Languages held in Port Jefferson (1997), Manchester (1998), Las Cruces (1999), and London (2000), and more recently the Colloquium on Implementation of Constraint and LOgic Programming Systems in Paphos (2001), Copenhagen (2002), Mumbai (2003), Saint Malo (2004), Sitges (2005), Seattle (2006), Porto (2007), Udine (2008), Pasadena (2009), Edinburgh (2010) - together with WLPE, Lexington (2011).
