Adaptive Energy Efficient Communications for Hybrid Aerial-Terrestrial Systems

Aerial telecommunications networks based on Low Altitude Platforms (LAPs) are expected to optimally meet the urgent needs of emergency relief and recovery operations for tackling large scale natural disasters. The energy efficient operation of such networks is important given the fact that the entire network infrastructure including the battery operated ground terminals, exhibit requirements to operate under power constrained situations. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a real-time adaptive transmission strategy for dynamic selection of direct and cooperative links based on the channel conditions for improved energy efficiency. We show that the cooperation between mobile terrestrial terminals on the ground could improve the energy efficiency in the uplink depending on the temporal behavior of the terrestrial and the aerial uplink channels. The simulation analysis corroborates that the adaptive transmission technique improves the overall energy efficiency of the network.
