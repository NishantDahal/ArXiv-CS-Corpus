Implementation and optimization of Wavelet modulation in Additive Gaussian channels

In this paper, we investigate the implementation of wavelet modulation (WM) in a digital communication system and propose novel methods to improve its performance. We will put particular focus on the structure of an optimal detector in AWGN channels and address two main methods for inserting the samples of the message signal in different frequency layers. Finally, computer based algorithms are described in order to implement and optimize receivers and transmitters.
