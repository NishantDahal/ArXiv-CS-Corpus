Enhanced XML Validation using SRML

Data validation is becoming more and more important with the ever-growing amount of data being consumed and transmitted by systems over the Internet. It is important to ensure that the data being sent is valid as it may contain entry errors, which may be consumed by different systems causing further errors. XML has become the defacto standard for data transfer. The XML Schema Definition language (XSD) was created to help XML structural validation and provide a schema for data type restrictions, however it does not allow for more complex situations. In this article we introduce a way to provide rule based XML validation and correction through the extension and improvement of our SRML metalanguage. We also explore the option of applying it in a database as a trigger for CRUD operations allowing more granular dataset validation on an atomic level allowing for more complex dataset record validation rules.
