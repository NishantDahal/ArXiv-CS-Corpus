Permutation polynomials on F_q induced from bijective Redei functions on subgroups of the multiplicative group of F_q

We construct classes of permutation polynomials over F_{Q^2} by exhibiting classes of low-degree rational functions over F_{Q^2} which induce bijections on the set of (Q+1)-th roots of unity in F_{Q^2}. As a consequence, we prove two conjectures about permutation trinomials from a recent paper by Tu, Zeng, Hu and Li.
