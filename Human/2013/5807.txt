Gaussian process regression as a predictive model for Quality-of-Service in Web service systems

In this paper, we present the Gaussian process regression as the predictive model for Quality-of-Service (QoS) attributes in Web service systems. The goal is to predict performance of the execution system expressed as QoS attributes given existing execution system, service repository, and inputs, e.g., streams of requests. In order to evaluate the performance of Gaussian process regression the simulation environment was developed. Two quality indexes were used, namely, Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error. The results obtained within the experiment show that the Gaussian process performed the best with linear kernel and statistically significantly better comparing to Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method.
