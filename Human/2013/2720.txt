Model Checking for Modal Dependence Logic: An Approach Through Post's Lattice

In this paper we investigate an extended version of modal dependence logic by allowing arbitrary Boolean connectives. Modal dependence logic was recently introduced by Jouko Väänänen by extending modal logic by a the dependence atom dep(.). In this paper we study the computational complexity of the model checking problem. For a complete classification of arbitrary Boolean functions we are using a Lattice approach introduced by Emil Post. This classification is done for all fragments of the logical language allowing modalities $\Diamond$ and $\Box$, the dependence atom, and logical symbols for arbitrary Boolean functions.
