The Holonomy Decomposition of Circular Semi-Flower Automata

Eilenberg's holonomy decomposition is useful to ascertain the structural properties of automata. Using this method, Egri-Nagy and Nehaniv characterized the absence of certain types of cycles in automata. In the direction of studying the structure of automata with cycles, this work focuses on a special class of semi-flower automata and establish the holonomy decompositions of certain circular semi-flower automata.
