Design, Implementation, and Operation of a Mobile Honeypot

Mobile nodes, in particular smartphones are one of the most relevant devices in the current Internet in terms of quantity and economic impact. There is the common believe that those devices are of special interest for attackers due to their limited resources and the serious data they store. On the other hand, the mobile regime is a very lively network environment, which misses the (limited) ground truth we have in commonly connected Internet nodes. In this paper we argue for a simple long-term measurement infrastructure that allows for (1) the analysis of unsolicited traffic to and from mobile devices and (2) fair comparison with wired Internet access. We introduce the design and implementation of a mobile honeypot, which is deployed on standard hardware for more than 1.5 years. Two independent groups developed the same concept for the system. We also present preliminary measurement results.
