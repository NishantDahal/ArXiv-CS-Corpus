An Optimized Design of Reversible Sequential Digital Circuits

In the today's era, reversible logics are the promising technology for the designing of low power digital logic system having major application in the field of nanotechnology, quantum computation, DNA and other low power digital circuits. Reversible logics provide zero power dissipation (Ideally) in the digital operations. There are numbers of circuit designed by the reversible logics and sequential circuits have their own importance in the digital systems. In this paper authors provides a optimized approach and optimized design for the sequential circuit (counter as an example) by using the MUX gate (a reversible gate) which provides the better results against the previous designs discussed in the literature. The proposed design has lower quantum cost, garbage output, constant input and total number of logical calculations performing by the design.
