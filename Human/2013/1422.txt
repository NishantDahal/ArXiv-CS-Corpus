A Virtual World Model to Enhance Tourism Destination Accessibility in Developing Countries

The problem of destination accessibility is a vital concern in the sustainable tourism development in the emerging regions due to the increasing numbers of tourism business growth in the recent times. Tourism is one of the potential foreign exchange earning sectors, which place sustainability as one of the main success metrics for benchmarking the industry's overall development. On the other hand, there are several destinations, which are inaccessible to tourists due to several reasons. Underutilization of potential destinations in both pre purchase and consumption stages is a strategic disadvantage for emerging countries on leading their tourism industry towards sustainability. A virtual world model to increase the destination accessibility of tourism products has been proposed. The model has to be designed with visual and auditory experience to tourists. The model is expected to enhance the accessibility of destinations for users of different categories. Elderly users, users with panic disorders, users with mobility impairments also will be able to enjoy traveling experience just same as other, through the proposed model.
