Compositionality of Approximate Bisimulation for Probabilistic Systems

Probabilistic transition system specifications using the rule format ntmuft-ntmuxt provide structural operational semantics for Segala-type systems and guarantee that probabilistic bisimilarity is a congruence. Probabilistic bisimilarity is for many applications too sensitive to the exact probabilities of transitions. Approximate bisimulation provides a robust semantics that is stable with respect to implementation and measurement errors of probabilistic behavior. We provide a general method to quantify how much a process combinator  expands the approximate bisimulation distance. As a direct application we derive an appropriate rule format that guarantees compositionality with respect to approximate bisimilarity. Moreover, we describe how specification formats for non-standard compositionality requirements may be derived.
