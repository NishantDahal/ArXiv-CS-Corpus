Wireless Computing and IT Ecosystems

We have evolved an IT system that is ubiquitous and pervasive and integrated into most aspects of our lives. Many of us are working on 4th and 5th level refinements in efficiency and functionality. But, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before and this restricts our freedom of action. The prior work has left us with an ecosystem which is the living embodiment of our state-of-the-art. While we work on integration, refinement, broader application and efficiency, the results must move seamlessly into the ecosystem. Fundamental concepts are being researched in the lab and may rebuild the world we all live in, until that happens, we must work within the ecosystem.
