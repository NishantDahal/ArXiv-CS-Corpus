Proceedings Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science

This volume contains the proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science which took place on the September 1st, 2013 in Torino, Italy as a CSL-affiliated workshop. Past workshops have been held in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop), Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS workshop), Coimbra (2009, CSL workshop), Brno (2010, MFCS-CSL workshop), Tallinn (2012, CSL workshop). Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science. They are used to justify (co)recursive definitions and associated reasoning techniques. The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many different settings such as: design and implementation of programming languages, logics, verification, databases. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their results to those members of the computer science and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed points.
