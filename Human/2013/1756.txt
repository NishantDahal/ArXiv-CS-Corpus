A New Construction of Multi-receiver Authentication Codes from Pseudo-Symplectic Geometry over Finite Fields

Multi-receiver authentication codes allow one sender to construct an authenticated message for a group of receivers such that each receiver can verify authenticity of the received message. In this paper, we constructed one multi-receiver authentication codes from pseudo-symplectic geometry over finite fields. The parameters and the probabilities of deceptions of this codes are also computed.
