A Case-Study on Teaching Undergraduate-Level Software Engineering Course Using Inverted-Classroom, Large-Group, Real-Client and Studio-Based Instruction Model

We present a case-study on teaching an undergraduate level course on Software Engineering (second year and fifth semester of bachelors program in Computer Science) at a State University (New Delhi, India) using a novel teaching instruction model. Our approach has four main elements: inverted or flipped classroom, studio-based learning, real-client projects and deployment, large team and peer evaluation. We present our motivation and approach, challenges encountered, pedagogical benefits, findings (both positive and negative) and recommendations. Our motivation was to teach Software Engineering using an active learning (significantly increasing the engagement and collaboration with the Instructor and other students in the class), team-work, balance between theory and practice, imparting both technical and managerial skills encountered in real-world and problem-based learning (through an intensive semester-long project). We conduct a detailed survey (anonymous, optional and online) and present the results of student responses. Survey results reveal that for nearly every students (class size: 89) the instruction model was new, interesting and had a positive impact on the motivation in addition to meeting the learning outcome of the course.
