On sets of numbers rationally represented in a rational base number system

In this work, it is proved that a set of numbers closed under addition and whose representations in a rational base numeration system is a rational language is not a finitely generated additive monoid.
  A key to the proof is the definition of a strong combinatorial property on languages : the bounded left iteration property. It is both an unnatural property in usual formal language theory (as it contradicts any kind of pumping lemma) and an ideal fit to the languages defined through rational base number systems.
