Implementation of Automata Theory to Improve the Learning Disability

There are various types of disability egress in world like blindness, deafness, and Physical disabilities. It is quite difficult to deal with people with disability. Learning disability (LD) is types of disability totally different from general disability. To deal children with learning disability is difficult for both parents and teacher. As parent deal with only single child so it bit easy. But teacher deals with different students at a time so its more difficult to deal with group of students with learning disability. If there is more students with learning disability so it is necessary that first all identify the type of learning disability in group of students. Some students have learning disability of mathematics; some have learning disability of other subjects. By using theory of Automata it easy to analysis the level of disability among all students then deal with them accordingly. For these purpose deterministic automata is the best practice. Teacher deals with deterministic students in class and check there response. In this research deterministic automata is use to facilitated the teacher which help teacher in identification of students with learning disability.
