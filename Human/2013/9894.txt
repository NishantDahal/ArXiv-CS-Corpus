Square Property, Equitable Partitions, and Product-like Graphs

Equivalence relations on the edge set of a graph $G$ that satisfy restrictive conditions on chordless squares play a crucial role in the theory of Cartesian graph products and graph bundles. We show here that such relations in a natural way induce equitable partitions on the vertex set of $G$, which in turn give rise to quotient graphs that can have a rich product structure even if $G$ itself is prime.
