Polynomial functions of degree 20 which are APN infinitely often

We give all the polynomials functions of degree 20 which are APN over an infinity of field extensions and show they are all CCZ-equivalent to the function $x^5$, which is a new step in proving the conjecture of Aubry, McGuire and Rodier.
