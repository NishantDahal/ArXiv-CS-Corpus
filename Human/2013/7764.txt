Multilevel Threshold Based Gray Scale Image Segmentation using Cuckoo Search

Image Segmentation is a technique of partitioning the original image into some distinct classes. Many possible solutions may be available for segmenting an image into a certain number of classes, each one having different quality of segmentation. In our proposed method, multilevel thresholding technique has been used for image segmentation. A new approach of Cuckoo Search (CS) is used for selection of optimal threshold value. In other words, the algorithm is used to achieve the best solution from the initial random threshold values or solutions and to evaluate the quality of a solution correlation function is used. Finally, MSE and PSNR are measured to understand the segmentation quality.
