High Dimensional Expanders and Property Testing

We show that the high dimensional expansion property as defined by Gromov, Linial and Meshulam, for simplicial complexes is a form of testability. Namely, a simplicial complex is a high dimensional expander iff a suitable property is testable. Using this connection, we derive several testability results.
