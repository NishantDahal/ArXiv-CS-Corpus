Power Penalty Due to First-order PMD in Optical OFDM/QAM and FBMC/OQAM Transmission System

Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) is a challenge for high-data-rate optical-communication systems. More researches are desirable for impairments that is induced by PMD in high-speed optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission system. In this paper, an approximately analytical method for evaluating the power penalty due to first-order PMD in optical OFDM with quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM/QAM) and filter bank based multi-carrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) transmission system is presented. The simulation results show that, compared with the single carrier with quadrature phase shift keying(SC-QPSK), both the OFDM/QAM and the FBMC/OQAM can decrease the power penalty caused by PMD by half. Furthermore, the FBMC/OQAM shows better power penalty immunity than the OFDM/QAM under the influence of first order PMD.
