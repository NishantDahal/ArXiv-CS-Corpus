Can Evidence Be Combined in the Dempster-Shafer Theory

Dempster's rule of combination has been the most controversial part of the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory. In particular, Zadeh has reached a conjecture on the noncombinability of evidence from a relational model of the D-S theory. In this paper, we will describe another relational model where D-S masses are represented as conditional granular distributions. By comparing it with Zadeh's relational model, we will show how Zadeh's conjecture on combinability does not affect the applicability of Dempster's rule in our model.
