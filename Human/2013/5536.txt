Relative Interval Analysis of Paging Algorithms on Access Graphs

Access graphs, which have been used previously in connection with competitive analysis and relative worst order analysis to model locality of reference in paging, are considered in connection with relative interval analysis. The algorithms LRU, FIFO, FWF, and FAR are compared using the path, star, and cycle access graphs. In this model, some of the expected results are obtained. However, although LRU is found to be strictly better than FIFO on paths, it has worse performance on stars, cycles, and complete graphs, in this model. We solve an open question from [Dorrigiv, Lopez-Ortiz, Munro, 2009], obtaining tight bounds on the relationship between LRU and FIFO with relative interval analysis.
