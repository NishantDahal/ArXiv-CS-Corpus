Marketplaces for Energy Demand-Side Management based on Future-Internet Technology

Renewable energies become more important, and they contribute to the EU's goals for greenhouse-gas reduction. However, their fluctuating nature calls for demand-side-management techniques, which balance energy generation and consumption. Such techniques are currently not broadly deployed. This paper describes the latest results from the FINSENY project on how Future-Internet enablers and market mechanisms can be used to realise such systems.
