Scan-based Compressed Terahertz Imaging and Real-Time Reconstruction via the Complex-valued Fast Block Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm

Compressed Sensing based Terahertz imaging (CS-THz) is a computational imaging technique. It uses only one THz receiver to accumulate the random modulated image measurements where the original THz image is reconstruct from these measurements using compressed sensing solvers. The advantage of the CS-THz is its reduced acquisition time compared with the raster scan mode. However, when it applied to large-scale two-dimensional (2D) imaging, the increased dimension resulted in both high computational complexity and excessive memory usage. In this paper, we introduced a novel CS-based THz imaging system that progressively compressed the THz image column by column. Therefore, the CS-THz system could be simplified with a much smaller sized modulator and reduced dimension. In order to utilize the block structure and the correlation of adjacent columns of the THz image, a complex-valued block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm was proposed. We conducted systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art CS algorithms under the scan based CS-THz architecture. The compression ratios and the choices of the sensing matrices were analyzed in detail using both synthetic and real-life THz images. Simulation results showed that both the scan based architecture and the proposed recovery algorithm were superior and efficient for large scale CS-THz applications.
