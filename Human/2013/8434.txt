Discretized Gabor Frames of Totally Positive Functions

In this paper a large class of universal windows for Gabor frames (Weyl-Heisenberg frames) is constructed. These windows have the fundamental property that every overcritical rectangular lattice generates a Gabor frame. Likewise, every undercritical rectangular lattice generates a Riesz sequence.
