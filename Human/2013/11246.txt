Agent Approach in Support of Enterprise Application Integration

The present approach highlights the synergies between application integration and interaction protocols. Since both fields have advanced in different directions, a number of important technical problems can be addressed by their proper synthesis. In our previous work, we proposed a methodological approach based on Interaction Protocols for Enterprise Applica tion Integration (EAI). This approach permits to specify MAS (Multi-Agent System) interaction protocols, verify their behavior and use them to integrate multiple business applications. The result of the proposed approach is a validated interaction protocol. Based on this protocol, we define in this paper, an agent- based architecture for the EAI. It includes all the concepts nec- essary to support communication and coordination mechanisms such as inter-agent and agent-Web services communication.
