Knowledge-Aided STAP Using Low Rank and Geometry Properties

This paper presents knowledge-aided space-time adaptive processing (KA-STAP) algorithms that exploit the low-rank dominant clutter and the array geometry properties (LRGP) for airborne radar applications. The core idea is to exploit the fact that the clutter subspace is only determined by the space-time steering vectors,
  {red}{where the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization approach is employed to compute the clutter subspace. Specifically, for a side-looking uniformly spaced linear array, the} algorithm firstly selects a group of linearly independent space-time steering vectors using LRGP that can represent the clutter subspace. By performing the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, the orthogonal bases of the clutter subspace are obtained, followed by two approaches to compute the STAP filter weights. To overcome the performance degradation caused by the non-ideal effects, a KA-STAP algorithm that combines the covariance matrix taper (CMT) is proposed. For practical applications, a reduced-dimension version of the proposed KA-STAP algorithm is also developed. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, and show that the proposed algorithms converge rapidly and provide a SINR improvement over existing methods when using a very small number of snapshots.
