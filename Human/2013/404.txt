Two-valued sigma-maxitive measures and Mesiar's hypothesis

We reformulate Mesiar's hypothesis [Possibility measures, integration and fuzzy possibility measures, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 92 (1997) 191-196], which as such was shown to be untrue by Murofushi [Two-valued possibility measures induced by $σ$-finite $σ$-additive measures, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 126 (2002) 265-268]. We prove that a two-valued $σ$-maxitive measure can be induced by a $σ$-additive measure under the additional condition that it is $σ$-principal.
