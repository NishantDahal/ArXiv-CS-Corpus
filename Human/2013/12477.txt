Technical Report: A New Multi-Device Wireless Power Transfer Scheme Using an Intermediate Energy Storage Circuit

A new multi-device wireless power transfer scheme that reduces the overall charging time is presented. The proposed scheme employs the intermediated energy storage (IES) circuit which consists of a constant power driving circuit and a super-capacitor. By utilizing the characteristic of high power density of the super-capacitor, the receiver can receive and store the energy in short duration and supply to the battery for long time. This enables the overlap of charging duration between all receivers. As a result, the overall charging time can be reduced.
