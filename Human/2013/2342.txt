Generalizing Fuzzy Logic Probabilistic Inferences

Linear representations for a subclass of boolean symmetric functions selected by a parity condition are shown to constitute a generalization of the linear constraints on probabilities introduced by Boole. These linear constraints are necessary to compute probabilities of events with relations between the. arbitrarily specified with propositional calculus boolean formulas.
