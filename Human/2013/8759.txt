Proceedings 11th International Workshop on Quantitative Aspects of Programming Languages and Systems

Quantitative aspects of computation are important and sometimes essential in characterising the behavior and determining the properties of systems. They are related to the use of physical quantities (storage space, time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures for reliability, security and trust). Such quantities play a central role in defining both the model of systems (architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and verification of system properties. The aim of this workshop is to discuss the explicit use of quantitative information such as time and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the analysis of systems.
