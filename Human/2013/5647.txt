Correlations and Scaling Laws in Human Mobility

Human mobility patterns deeply affect the dynamics of many social systems. In this paper, we empirically analyze the real-world human movements based GPS records, and observe rich scaling properties in the temporal-spatial patterns as well as an abnormal transition in the speed-displacement patterns. We notice that the displacements at the population level show significant positive correlation, indicating a cascade-like nature in human movements. Furthermore, our analysis at the individual level finds that the displacement distributions of users with strong correlation of displacements are closer to power laws, implying a relationship between the positive correlation of the series of displacements and the form of an individual's displacement distribution. These findings from our empirical analysis show a factor directly relevant to the origin of the scaling properties in human mobility.
