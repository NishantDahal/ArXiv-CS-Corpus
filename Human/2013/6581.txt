Details of an Automotive Sub-System: Saab Instrument Cluster Module

The goal of this technical report is to give the details of a real world existing sub-system in the automotive industry. It is produced to be used for reproduction of the same experiment if other researchers are interested in. Hence, it would be possible to compare the results of our published studies with the results of similar tools. The data is collected for the purpose of applying metaheuristic optimization approaches. The case study based on these data shows that metaheuristic optimization approaches can find efficient solutions for multiple quality attributes while fulfilling given constraints.
  The case study was conducted at Saab Automobile AB in order to evaluate the AQOSA framework in an industrial context. AQOSA (Automated Quality-driven Optimization of Software Architecture) is our architecture optimization framework that supports multiple quality attributes including response time, processor utilization, bus utilization, safety and cost.
  To enable validation of the results we selected an existing realization for the Saab 9-5 Instrument Cluster Module ECU (Electronic Control Unit) and the surrounding sub-systems. The goal of the case study is to find a better solution than the current realization while fulfilling the requirements and constraints. The results of the case study and the details of AQOSA framework is reported in a paper from the authors in Journal of Systems and Software, Special Issue on Quality Optimization of Software Architecture and Design Specifications.
