An Encryption Scheme with DNA Technology and JPEG Zigzag Coding for Secure Transmission of Images

The Internet is a ubiquitous and affordable communications network suited for e-commerce and medical image communications. Security has become a major issue as data communication channels can be intruded by intruders during transmission. Though, different methods have been proposed and used to protect the transmission of data from illegal and unauthorized access, code breakers have come up with various methods to crack them. DNA based Cryptography brings forward a new hope for unbreakable algorithms. This paper outlines an encryption scheme with DNA technology and JPEG Zigzag Coding for Secure Transmission of Images.
