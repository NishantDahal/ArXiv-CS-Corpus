The Cyan Language

This is the manual of Cyan, a prototype-based object-oriented language. Cyan supports static typing, single inheritance, mixin objects (similar to mixin classes with mixin inheritance), generic prototypes, and Java-like interfaces. The language has several innovations: a completely object-oriented exception system, statically-typed closures, a kind of graphical metaobjects called codegs, optional dynamic typing, user-defined literal objects (an innovative way of creating objects), context objects (a generalization of closures), and grammar methods and message sends (which makes it easy to define Domain Specific Languages).
