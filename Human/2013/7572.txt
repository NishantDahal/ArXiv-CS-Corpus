TDOA assisted RSSD based localization using UWB and directional antennas

This paper studies the use of directional antennas for received signal strength difference (RSSD) based localization using ultra-wideband and demonstrates the achievable accuracy with this localization method applied to UWB. As introduced in our previous work the RSSD localization is assisted with one Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation. The use of directional receiving antennas and an omni-directional transmitting antenna is assumed. Localization is performed in 2D. Two localization approaches are considered: RSSD using statistical channel model and fingerprinting approach. In the case of statistical channel model simulations are performed using Matlab. In the case of fingerprinting approach localization is done based on real indoor-measurements.
