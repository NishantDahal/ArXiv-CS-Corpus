Bayesian Inference for Radar Imagery Based Surveillance

We are interested in creating an automated or semi-automated system with the capability of taking a set of radar imagery, collection parameters and a priori map and other tactical data, and producing likely interpretations of the possible military situations given the available evidence. This paper is concerned with the problem of the interpretation and computation of certainty or belief in the conclusions reached by such a system.
