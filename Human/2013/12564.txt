Quantum computation and real multiplication

We propose a construction of anyon systems associated to quantum tori with real multiplication and the embedding of quantum tori in AF algebras. These systems generalize the Fibonacci anyons, with weaker categorical properties, and are obtained from the basic modules and the real multiplication structure.
