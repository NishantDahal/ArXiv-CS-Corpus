Puzzle Encryption Algorithm

This document describes the symmetric encryption algorithm called Puzzle. It is free and open. The objective of this paper is to get an opinion about its security from the cryptology community. It is separated in two parts, a technical description of the algorithm and its cryptanalysis. The algorithm has some interesting properties :
  The block size is variable and unknown from an attacker. The size of the key has no limit and is unknown from an attacker. The key size does not affect the algorithm speed (using a 256 bit key is the same as using a 1024 bit key). The algorithm is much faster than the average cryptographic function. Experimental test showed 600 Mo/s - 4 cycles/byte on an Intel Core 2 Duo P8600 2.40GHz and 1,2 Go/s - 2 cycles/byte on an Intel i5-3210M 2.50GHz. Both CPU had only 2 cores.
