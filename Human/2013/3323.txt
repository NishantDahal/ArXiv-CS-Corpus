Qualitative Measures of Ambiguity

This paper introduces a qualitative measure of ambiguity and analyses its relationship with other measures of uncertainty.  Probability measures relative likelihoods, while ambiguity measures vagueness surrounding those judgments.  Ambiguity is an important representation of uncertain knowledge.  It deals with a different, type of uncertainty modeled by subjective probability or belief.
