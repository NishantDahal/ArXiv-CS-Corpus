Evolution and the structure of learning agents

This paper presents the thesis that all learning agents of finite information size are limited by their informational structure in what goals they can efficiently learn to achieve in a complex environment. Evolutionary change is critical for creating the required structure for all learning agents in any complex environment. The thesis implies that there is no efficient universal learning algorithm. An agent can go past the learning limits imposed by its structure only by slow evolutionary change or blind search which in a very complex environment can only give an agent an inefficient universal learning capability that can work only in evolutionary timescales or improbable luck.
