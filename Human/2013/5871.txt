Some Software Packages for Partial SVD Computation

This technical report introduces some software packages for partial SVD computation, including optimized PROPACK, modified PROPACK for computing singular values above a threshold and the corresponding singular vectors, and block Lanczos with warm start (BLWS). The current version is preliminary. The details will be enriched soon.
