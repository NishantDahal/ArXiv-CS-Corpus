SEFE with No Mapping via Large Induced Outerplane Graphs in Plane Graphs

We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph admits a simultaneous embedding with no mapping and with fixed edges with any $(n/2)$-vertex planar graph. In order to achieve this result, we prove that every $n$-vertex plane graph has an induced outerplane subgraph containing at least $n/2$ vertices. Also, we show that every $n$-vertex planar graph and every $n$-vertex planar partial 3-tree admit a simultaneous embedding with no mapping and with fixed edges.
