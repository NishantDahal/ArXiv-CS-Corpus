State Decoding in Multi-Stage Cryptography Protocols

This paper presents a practical method of quantum tomography for decoding the state of photons in a multistage cryptography protocol. This method works if the polarization angles are defined on a fixed plane, as is assumed in several quantum cryptography protocols. We show if there are 2m polarization angles in a fixed plane, we need m number of filters and m2 number of photons through each filter.
