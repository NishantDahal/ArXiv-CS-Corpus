Computational Properties of Fiction Writing and Collaborative Work

From the earliest days of computing, there have been tools to help shape narrative. Spell-checking, word counts, and readability analysis, give today's novelists tools that Dickens, Austen, and Shakespeare could only have dreamt of. However, such tools have focused on the word, or phrase levels. In the last decade, research focus has shifted to support for collaborative editing of documents. This work considers more sophisticated attempts to visualise the semantics, pace and rhythm within a narrative through data mining. We describe real life applications in two related domains.
