Model of solutions for data security in Cloud Computing

The aim of this paper is to develop a model to ensure data stored in the cloud. Model based on situations that arise in a business environment. The model also includes individual participants and their data operations. Implementation of the model is transferred using UML. The model is divided into 7 modules. Each module is apparent from the terms of data security and described specific situations when working with data. Based on this model it is possible to convert the implementation of cloud into enterprise environments with respect to data security in the firm.
