Partition Parameters for Girth Maximum (m, r) BTUs

This paper describes the calculation of the optimal partition parameters such that the girth maximum (m, r) Balanced Tanner Unit lies in family of BTUs specified by them using a series of proved results and thus creates a framework for specifying a search problem for finding the girth maximum (m, r) BTU. Several open questions for girth maximum (m, r) BTU have been raised.
