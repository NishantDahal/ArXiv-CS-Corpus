Linked-Cluster Technique for Finding the Distance of a Quantum LDPC Code

We present a linked-cluster technique for calculating the distance of a quantum LDPC code. It offers an advantage over existing deterministic techniques for codes with small relative distances (which includes all known families of quantum LDPC codes), and over the probabilistic technique for codes with sufficiently high rates.
