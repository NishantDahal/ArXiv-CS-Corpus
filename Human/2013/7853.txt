An Efficient Bilinear Pairing-Free Certificateless Two-Party Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol in the eCK Model

Recent study on certificateless authenticated key agreement focuses on bilinear pairing-free certificateless authenticated key agreement protocol. Yet it has got limitations in the aspect of computational amount. So it is important to reduce the number of the scalar multiplication over elliptic curve group in bilinear pairing-free protocols. This paper proposed a new bilinear pairing-free certificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocol, providing more efficiency among related work and proof under the random oracle model.
