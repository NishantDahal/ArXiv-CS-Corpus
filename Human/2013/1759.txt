Concatenated Capacity-Achieving Polar Codes for Optical Quantum Channels

We construct concatenated capacity-achieving quantum codes for noisy optical quantum channels. We demonstrate that the error-probability of capacity-achieving quantum polar encoding can be reduced by the proposed low-complexity concatenation scheme.
