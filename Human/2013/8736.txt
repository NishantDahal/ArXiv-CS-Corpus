Cloud Template, a Big Data Solution

Today cloud computing has become as a new concept for hosting and delivering different services over the Internet for big data solutions. Cloud computing is attractive to different business owners of both small and enterprise as it eliminates the requirement for users to plan ahead for provisioning, and allows enterprises to start from the small and increase resources only when there is a rise in service demand. Despite the fact that cloud computing offers huge opportunities to the IT industry, the development of cloud computing technology is currently has several issues. This study presents an idea for introducing cloud templates which will be used for analyzing, designing, developing and implementing cloud computing systems. We will present a template based design for cloud computing systems, highlighting its key concepts, architectural principles and state of the art implementation, as well as research challenges and future work requirements. The aim of this idea is to provide a better understanding of the design challenges of cloud computing and identify important research directions in this big data increasingly important area. We will describe a series of studies by which we and other researchers have assessed the effectiveness of these techniques in practical situations. Finally, in this study we will show how this idea could be implemented in a practical and useful way in industry.
