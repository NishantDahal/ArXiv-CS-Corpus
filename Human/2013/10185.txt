Can Facial Uniqueness be Inferred from Impostor Scores?

In Biometrics, facial uniqueness is commonly inferred from impostor similarity scores. In this paper, we show that such uniqueness measures are highly unstable in the presence of image quality variations like pose, noise and blur. We also experimentally demonstrate the instability of a recently introduced impostor-based uniqueness measure of [Klare and Jain 2013] when subject to poor quality facial images.
