Software Reuse in Cardiology Related Medical Database Using K-Means Clustering Technique

Software technology based on reuse is identified as a process of designing software for the reuse purpose. The software reuse is a process in which the existing software is used to build new software. A metric is a quantitative indicator of an attribute of an item or thing. Reusability is the likelihood for a segment of source code that can be used again to add new functionalities with slight or no modification. A lot of research has been projected using reusability in reducing code, domain, requirements, design etc., but very little work is reported using software reuse in medical domain. An attempt is made to bridge the gap in this direction, using the concepts of clustering and classifying the data based on the distance measures. In this paper cardiologic database is considered for study. The developed model will be useful for Doctors or Paramedics to find out the patients level in the cardiologic disease, deduce the medicines required in seconds and propose them to the patient. In order to measure the reusability K means clustering algorithm is used.
