Efficient and Global Optimization-Based Smoothing Methods for Mixed-Volume Meshes

Some methods based on simple regularizing geometric element transformations have heuristically been shown to give runtime efficient and quality effective smoothing algorithms for meshes. We describe the mathematical framework and a systematic approach to global optimization-based versions of such methods for mixed volume meshes. In particular, we identify efficient smoothing algorithms for certain algebraic mesh quality measures. We also provide explicit constructions of potentially useful smoothing algorithms.
