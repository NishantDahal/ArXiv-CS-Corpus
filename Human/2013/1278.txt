On the Construction of Radio Environment Maps for Cognitive Radio Networks

The Radio Environment Map (REM) provides an effective approach to Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). Previous results on REM construction show that there exists a tradeoff between the number of measurements (sensors) and REM accuracy. In this paper, we analyze this tradeoff and determine that the REM error is a decreasing and convex function of the number of measurements (sensors). The concept of geographic entropy is introduced to quantify this relationship. And the influence of sensor deployment on REM accuracy is examined using information theory techniques. The results obtained in this paper are applicable not only for the REM, but also for wireless sensor network deployment.
