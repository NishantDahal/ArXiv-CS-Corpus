Enhancing the Conventional Information Security Management Maturity Model (ISM3) in Resolving Human Factors in Organization Information Sharing

Information sharing in organization has been considered as an important approach in increasing organizational efficiency, performance and decision making. With the present and advances in information and communication technology, sharing information and exchanging of data across organizations has become more feasible in organization. However, information sharing has been a complex task over the years and identifying factors that influence information sharing across organization has becomes crucial and critical. Researchers have taken several methods and approaches to resolve problems in information sharing at all levels without a lasting solution, as sharing is best understood as a practice that reflects behavior, social, economic, legal and technological influences. Due to the limitation of the conventional ISM3 standards to address culture, social, legislation and human behavior, the findings in this paper suggest that, a centralized information structure without human practice, distribution of information and coordination is not effective. This paper reviews the previous information sharing research, outlines the factors affecting information sharing and the different practices needed to improve the management of information security by recommending several combinations of information security and coordination mechanism for reducing uncertainty during sharing of information .This thesis proposes information security management protocol (ISMP) as an enhancement towards ISM3 to resolve the above problems. This protocol provides a means for practitioners to identify key factors involved in successful information sharing.....
