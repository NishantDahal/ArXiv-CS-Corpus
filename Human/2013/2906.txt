Lattice-Based Graded Logic: a Multimodal Approach

Experts do not always feel very, comfortable when they have to give precise numerical estimations of certainty degrees.  In this paper we present a qualitative approach which allows for attaching partially ordered symbolic grades to logical formulas.  Uncertain information is expressed by means of parameterized modal operators.  We propose a semantics for this multimodal logic and give a sound and complete axiomatization.  We study the links with related approaches and suggest how this framework might be used to manage both uncertain and incomplere knowledge.
