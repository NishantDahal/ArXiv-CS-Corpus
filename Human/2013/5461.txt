Speech User Interface for Information Retrieval

Along with the rapid development of information technology, the amount of information generated at a given time far exceeds human's ability to organize, search, and manipulate without the help of automatic systems. Now a days so many tools and techniques are available for storage and retrieval of information. User uses interface to interact with these techniques, mostly text user interface (TUI) or graphical user interface (GUI). Here, I am trying to introduce a new interface i.e. speech for information retrieval. The goal of this project is to develop a speech interface that can search and read the required information from the database effectively, efficiently and more friendly. This tool will be highly useful to blind people, they will able to demand the information to the computer by giving voice command/s (keyword) through microphone and listen the required information using speaker or headphones.
