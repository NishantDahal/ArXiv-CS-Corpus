Multi-component model of learning and its use for research didactic system

In computer simulation of the learning process is usually assumed that all elements of the training material are assimilated equally durable. But in practice, the knowledge, which a student uses in its operations, are remembered much better. For a more precise study of didactic systems the multi component model of learning are proposed. It takes into account: 1) the transition of weak knowledge in trustworthy knowledge; 2) the difference in the rate of forgetting the trustworthy and weak knowledge. It is assumed that the rate of increase of student's knowledge is proportional to: 1) the difference between the level of the requirements of teachers and the number of learned knowledge; 2) the amount of learned knowledge, raised to some power. Examples of the use of a multi component model for the study of situations in the learning process are considered, the resulting graphs of the student's level of knowledge of the time are presented. A generalized model of learning, which allows to take into account the complexity of the various elements of the educational material are proposed. The possibility of creating a training program for the training of students of pedagogical institutes are considered.
