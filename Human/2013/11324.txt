Coverage by Pairwise Base Station Cooperation under Adaptive Geometric Policies

We study a cooperation model where the positions of base stations follow a Poisson point process distribution and where Voronoi cells define the planar areas associated with them. For the service of each user, either one or two base stations are involved. If two, these cooperate by exchange of user data and reduced channel information (channel phase, second neighbour interference) with conferencing over some backhaul link. The total user transmission power is split between them and a common message is encoded, which is coherently transmitted by the stations. The decision for a user to choose service with or without cooperation is directed by a family of geometric policies. The suggested policies further control the shape of coverage contours in favor of cell-edge areas. Analytic expressions based on stochastic geometry are derived for the coverage probability in the network. Their numerical evaluation shows benefits from cooperation, which are enhanced when Dirty Paper Coding is applied to eliminate the second neighbour interference.
