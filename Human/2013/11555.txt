The Distributed Computing Paradigms: P2P, Grid, Cluster, Cloud, and Jungle

The distributed computing is done on many systems to solve a large scale problem. The growing of high-speed broadband networks in developed and developing countries, the continual increase in computing power, and the rapid growth of the Internet have changed the way. In it the society manages information and information services. Historically, the state of computing has gone through a series of platform and environmental changes. Distributed computing holds great assurance for using computer systems effectively. As a result, supercomputer sites and data centers have changed from providing high performance floating point computing capabilities to concurrently servicing huge number of requests from billions of users. The distributed computing system uses multiple computers to solve large-scale problems over the Internet. It becomes data-intensive and network-centric. The applications of distributed computing have become increasingly wide-spread. In distributed computing, the main stress is on the large scale resource sharing and always goes for the best performance. In this article, we have reviewed the work done in the area of distributed computing paradigms. The main stress is on the evolving area of cloud computing.
