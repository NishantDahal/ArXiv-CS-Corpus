Discovering Multiple Constraints that are Frequently Approximately Satisfied

Some high-dimensional data.sets can be modelled by assuming that there are many different linear constraints, each of which is Frequently Approximately Satisfied (FAS) by the data. The probability of a data vector under the model is then proportional to the product of the probabilities of its constraint violations. We describe three methods of learning products of constraints using a heavy-tailed probability distribution for the violations.
