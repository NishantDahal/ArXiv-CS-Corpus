Any Positive Feedback Rate Increases the Capacity of Strictly Less-Noisy Broadcast Channels

We propose two coding schemes for discrete memoryless broadcast channels (DMBCs) with rate-limited feedback from only one receiver. For any positive feedback rate and for the class of strictly less-noisy DMBCs, our schemes strictly improve over the no-feedback capacity region.
