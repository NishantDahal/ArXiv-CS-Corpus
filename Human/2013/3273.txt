On Finding Lekkerkerker-Boland Subgraphs

Lekkerkerker and Boland characterized the minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for the class of interval graphs. We give a linear-time algorithm to find one in any graph that is not an interval graph. Tucker characterized the minimal forbidden submatrices of matrices that do not have the consecutive-ones property. We give a linear-time algorithm to find one in any matrix that does not have the consecutive-ones property.
