GQM+Strategies is a method that aims at aligning organizational goals, strategies, and measurements at all levels of an organization in a seamless way.

The study analyzes how GQM+Strategies has helped clarify and harmonize the goal set of the organization. Results of the study indicate improved alignment and integration of different goals.
