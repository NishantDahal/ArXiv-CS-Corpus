Implementation of Function Point Analysis in Measuring The Volume Estimation of Software System in Object Oriented and Structural Model of Academic System

In the software development required a fidelity and accuracy in determining the size or value of the software to fit the operation is executed. Various methods of calculation has been widely applied to estimate the size, and one of them is by using the method of Function Point Analysis (FPA). The method is then applied by author to measure the complexity of an academic information system by using the two modeling approaches, namely object oriented and structural models. Measurements in this paper consists of several stages, namely describing the information system that will be built into the UML models and structured. Then the model is analyzed by calculating Crude Function Points (CRP), Relative Complexity Adjustment Factor (RCAF), and then calculate its function point. From the result of a calculation using the FPA to the academic system software development, FP values of object oriented model obtained for 174,64 and the FP value of structured models for 180,93. The result of function point that will be used by developers in determining the price and cost of software systems to be built.
