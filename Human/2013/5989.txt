DNA Reservoir Computing: A Novel Molecular Computing Approach

We propose a novel molecular computing approach based on reservoir computing. In reservoir computing, a dynamical core, called a reservoir, is perturbed with an external input signal while a readout layer maps the reservoir dynamics to a target output. Computation takes place as a transformation from the input space to a high-dimensional spatiotemporal feature space created by the transient dynamics of the reservoir. The readout layer then combines these features to produce the target output. We show that coupled deoxyribozyme oscillators can act as the reservoir. We show that despite using only three coupled oscillators, a molecular reservoir computer could achieve 90% accuracy on a benchmark temporal problem.
