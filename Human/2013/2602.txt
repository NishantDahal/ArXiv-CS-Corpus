An Approach to Secure Mobile Enterprise Architectures

Due to increased security awareness of enterprises for mobile applications operating with sensitive or personal data as well as extended regulations form legislative (the principle of proportionality) various approaches, how to implement (extended) two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication or virtual private network within enterprise mobile environments to ensure delivery of secure applications, have been developed. Within mobile applications it will not be sufficient to rely on security measures of the individual components or interested parties, an overall concept of a security solution has to be established which requires the interaction of several technologies, standards and system components. These include the physical fuses on the device itself as well as on the network layer (such as integrated security components), security measures (such as employee agreements, contract clauses), insurance coverage, but also software technical protection at the application level (e.g. password protection, encryption, secure container). The purpose of this paper is to summarize the challenges and practical successes, providing best practices to fulfill appropriate risk coverage of mobile applications. I present a use case, in order to proof the concept in actual work settings, and to demonstrate the adaptability of the approach.
