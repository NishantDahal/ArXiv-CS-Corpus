Results from a Practical Deployment of the MyZone Decentralized P2P Social Network

This paper presents MyZone, a private online social network for relatively small, closely-knit communities. MyZone has three important distinguishing features. First, users keep the ownership of their data and have complete control over maintaining their privacy. Second, MyZone is free from any possibility of content censorship and is highly resilient to any single point of disconnection. Finally, MyZone minimizes deployment cost by minimizing its computation, storage and network bandwidth requirements. It incorporates both a P2P architecture and a centralized architecture in its design ensuring high availability, security and privacy. A prototype of MyZone was deployed over a period of 40 days with a membership of more than one hundred users. The paper provides a detailed evaluation of the results obtained from this deployment.
