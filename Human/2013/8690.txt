A New 3D Geometric Approach to Focus and Context Lens Effect Simulation

We present a novel methodology based on geometric approach to simulate magnification lens effects. Our aim is to promote new applications of powerful geometric modeling techniques in visual computing. Conventional image processing/visualization methods are computed in two dimensional space (2D). We examine this conventional 2D manipulation from a completely innovative perspective of 3D geometric processing. Compared with conventional optical lens design, 3D geometric method are much more capable of preserving shape features and minimizing distortion. We magnify an area of interest to better visualize the interior details, while keeping the rest of area without perceivable distortion. We flatten the mesh back into 2D space for viewing, and further applications in the screen space. In both steps, we devise an iterative deformation scheme to minimize distortion around both focus and context region, while avoiding the noncontinuous transition region between the focus and context areas. Particularly, our method allows the user to flexibly modify the ROI shapes to accommodate complex feature. The user can also easily specify a spectrum of metrics for different visual effects. Various experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our framework.
