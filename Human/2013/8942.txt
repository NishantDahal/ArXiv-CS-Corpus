A Class of Binomial Permutation Polynomials

In this note, a criterion for a class of binomials to be permutation polynomials is proposed. As a consequence, many classes of binomial permutation polynomials and monomial complete permutation polynomials are obtained. The exponents in these monomials are of Niho type.
