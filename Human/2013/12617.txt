Various models of process of the learning, based on the numerical solution of the differential equations

The principles on which can be based computer model of process of training are formulated. Are considered: 1) the unicomponent model, which is recognizing that educational information consists of equal elements; 2) the multicomponent model, which is considering that knowledge is assimilate with a various strength, and on lesson weak knowledge becomes strong; 3) the generalized multicomponent model which considers change of working capacity of the pupil and various complexity of studied elements of a training material. Typical results of imitating modeling of learning process are presented in article.
