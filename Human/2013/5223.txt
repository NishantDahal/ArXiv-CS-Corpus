Making the case of GPUs in courses on computational physics

Most relatively modern desktop or even laptop computers contain a graphics card useful for more than showing colors on a screen. In this paper, we make a case for why you should learn enough about GPU (graphics processing unit) computing to use as an accelerator or even replacement to your CPU code. We include an example of our own as a case study to show what can be realistically expected.
