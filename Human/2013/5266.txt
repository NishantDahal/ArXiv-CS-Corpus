A computer algebra user interface manifesto

Many computer algebra systems have more than 1000 built-in functions, making expertise difficult. Using mock dialog boxes, this article describes a proposed interactive general-purpose wizard for organizing optional transformations and allowing easy fine grain control over the form of the result even by amateurs. This wizard integrates ideas including:
  * flexible subexpression selection;
  * complete control over the ordering of variables and commutative operands, with well-chosen defaults;
  * interleaving the choice of successively less main variables with applicable function choices to provide detailed control without incurring a combinatorial number of applicable alternatives at any one level;
  * quick applicability tests to reduce the listing of inapplicable transformations;
  * using an organizing principle to order the alternatives in a helpful manner;
  * labeling quickly-computed alternatives in dialog boxes with a preview of their results,
  * using ellipsis elisions if necessary or helpful;
  * allowing the user to retreat from a sequence of choices to explore other branches of the tree of alternatives or to return quickly to branches already visited;
  * allowing the user to accumulate more than one of the alternative forms;
  * integrating direct manipulation into the wizard; and
  * supporting not only the usual input-result pair mode, but also the useful alternative derivational and in situ replacement modes in a unified window.
