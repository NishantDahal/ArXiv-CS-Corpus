DREAM_OLSR PROTOCOL (Distance Routing Effective Algorithm for Mobility - Optimized Link State Routing)

This paper lays down a proposal of protocol named DREAM_OLSR. The protocol has been developed so as to effect current OLSR (RFC 3626) [4] protocol. The protocol establishes an optimized solution hence the name has been manipulated from Open Link State Routing to DREAM Optimized Link State Routing. DREAM specifies Distance Routing Effective Algorithm for Mobility wherein it implements the Distance routing effective algorithm for the optimized solution. This optimization includes higher efficiency and fewer overheads for the MANET.
