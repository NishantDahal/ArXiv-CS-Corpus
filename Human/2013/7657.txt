Detect adverse drug reactions for the drug Pravastatin

Adverse drug reaction (ADR) is widely concerned for public health issue. ADRs are one of most common causes to withdraw some drugs from market. Prescription event monitoring (PEM) is an important approach to detect the adverse drug reactions. The main problem to deal with this method is how to automatically extract the medical events or side effects from high-throughput medical data, which are collected from day to day clinical practice. In this study we propose an original approach to detect the ADRs using feature matrix and feature selection. The experiments are carried out on the drug Pravastatin. Major side effects for the drug are detected. The detected ADRs are based on computerized method, further investigation is needed.
