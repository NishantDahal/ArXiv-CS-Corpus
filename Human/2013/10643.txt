Mobility Diversity in Mobile Wireless Networks

We introduce the novel concept of mobility diversity for mobile sensor or communication networks as the diversity introduced by transmitting data over different topologies of the network. We show how node mobility can provide diversity by changing the topology of the network. More specifically, we consider a mobile network of a sensor node and a number of sink nodes which are all moving randomly according to different Wiener process mobility models. Assuming that the network topology evolves with time and assuming that the connectivity of the sensor node to at least one sink node is needed for successful communication, we calculate three performance measures for this network, i) the expected number of time instants, where the sensor node is connected to at least one sink node, ii) the probability of outage, being the probability that no sink node is in the vicinity of the sensor node during the observation interval, and finally, iii) the maximum number of consequent failures in the communication. Our theoretical and numerical analysis show that increasing the mobility parameter of the sensor node increases the average number of successful transmissions, decreases the probability of outage, and reduces the maximum delay in the senor-sink communication.
