An Algorithm for Constructing a Smallest Register with Non-Linear Update Generating a Given Binary Sequence

Registers with Non-Linear Update (RNLUs) are a generalization of Non-Linear Feedback Shift Registers (NLFSRs) in which both, feedback and feedforward, connections are allowed and no chain connection between the stages is required. In this paper, a new algorithm for constructing RNLUs generating a given binary sequence is presented. Expected size of RNLUs constructed by the presented algorithm is proved to be O(n/log(n/p)), where n is the sequence length and p is the degree of parallelization. This is asymptotically smaller than the expected size of RNLUs constructed by previous algorithms and the expected size of LFSRs and NLFSRs generating the same sequence. The presented algorithm can potentially be useful for many applications, including testing, wireless communications, and cryptography.
