Generalization of the Lee-O'Sullivan List Decoding for One-Point AG Codes

We generalize the list decoding algorithm for Hermitian codes proposed by Lee and O'Sullivan based on Gröbner bases to general one-point AG codes, under an assumption weaker than one used by Beelen and Brander. Our generalization enables us to apply the fast algorithm to compute a Gröbner basis of a module proposed by Lee and O'Sullivan, which was not possible in another generalization by Lax.
