New Index for Quantifying an Individual's Scientific Research Output

Classifying researchers according to the quality of their published work rather than the quantity is a curtail issue. We attempt to introduce a new formula of the percentage range to be used for evaluating qualitatively the researchers' production. The suggested equation depends on the number of the single-author published papers and their citations to be added as a new factor to the known h-index. These factors give an advantage and make a clear evidence of innovative authors and reduce the known h-index for authors who are gaining citations by adding their names to multi-author papers. It is shown that various dimensions of ethical integrity and originality will be effective in this new index. An important scenario arising from the analysis is shown in terms of examples. It refers to larger differences between the h- and the new index which comes from the whole work and the one comes from the single-author papers only, is shown.
