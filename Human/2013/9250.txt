Notions of Monad Strength

Over the past two decades the notion of a strong monad has found wide applicability in computing. Arising out of a need to interpret products in computational and semantic settings, different approaches to this concept have arisen. In this paper we introduce and investigate the connections between these approaches and also relate the results to monad composition. We also introduce new methods for checking and using the required laws associated with such compositions, as well as provide examples illustrating problems and issues that arise.
