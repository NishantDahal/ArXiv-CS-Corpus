Riding the crest of the altmetrics wave: How librarians can help prepare faculty for the next generation of research impact metrics

As scholars migrate into online spaces like Mendeley, blogs, Twitter, and more, they leave new traces of once-invisible interactions like reading, saving, discussing, and recommending. Observing these traces can inform new metrics of scholarly influence and impact -- so-called "altmetrics." Stakeholders in academia are beginning to discuss how and where altmetrics can be useful towards evaluating a researcher's academic contribution. As this interest grows, libraries are in a unique position to help support an informed dialog on campus. We suggest that librarians can provide this support in three main ways: informing emerging conversations with the latest research, supporting experimentation with emerging altmetrics tools, and engaging in early altmetrics education and outreach. We include examples and lists of resources to help librarians fill these roles.
