Efficient quantum protocols for XOR functions

We show that for any Boolean function f on {0,1}^n, the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of XOR functions $f\circ \oplus$ satisfies that $Q_ε(f\circ \oplus) = O(2^d (\log\|\hat f\|_{1,ε} + \log \frac{n}ε) \log(1/ε))$, where d is the F2-degree of f, and $\|\hat f\|_{1,ε} = \min_{g:\|f-g\|_\infty \leq ε} \|\hat f\|_1$. This implies that the previous lower bound $Q_ε(f\circ \oplus) = Ω(\log\|\hat f\|_{1,ε})$ by Lee and Shraibman \cite{LS09} is tight for f with low F2-degree. The result also confirms the quantum version of the Log-rank Conjecture for low-degree XOR functions. In addition, we show that the exact quantum communication complexity satisfies $Q_E(f) = O(2^d \log \|\hat f\|_0)$, where $\|\hat f\|_0$ is the number of nonzero Fourier coefficients of f. This matches the previous lower bound $Q_E(f(x,y)) = Ω(\log rank(M_f))$ by Buhrman and de Wolf \cite{BdW01} for low-degree XOR functions.
