Group Key Agreement Protocol for MANETs Based on HSK Scheme

In this paper, we first provide a spanning tree (ST)-based centralized group key agreement protocol for unbalanced mobile Ad Hoc networks (MANETs). Based on the centralized solution, a local spanning tree (LST)-based distributed protocol for general MANETs is subsequently presented. Both protocols follow the basic features of the HSK scheme: 1) H means that a hybrid approach, which is the combination of key agreement and key distribution via symmetric encryption, is exploited; 2) S indicates that a ST or LSTs are adopted to form a connected network topology; and 3) K implies that the extended Kruskal algorithm is employed to handle dynamic events. It is shown that the HSK scheme is a uniform approach to handle the initial key establishment process as well as all kinds of dynamic events in group key agreement protocol for MANETs. Additionally, the extended Kruskal algorithm enables to realize the reusability of the precomputed secure links to reduce the overhead. Moreover, some other aspects, such as the network topology connectivity and security, are well analyzed.
