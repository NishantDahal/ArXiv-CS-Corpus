Inference with Possibilistic Evidence

In this paper, the concept of possibilistic evidence which is a possibility distribution as well as a body of evidence is proposed over an infinite universe of discourse.  The inference with possibilistic evidence is investigated based on a unified inference framework maintaining both the compatibility of concepts and the consistency of the probability logic.
