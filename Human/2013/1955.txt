Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes

Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are constructed by coupling many regular low-density parity-check codes in a chain. The decoding chain of SC codes stops when facing burst erasures. This problem can not be overcome by increasing coupling number. In this paper, we introduce multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes. Numerical results show that 2D-SC codes are more robust to the burst erasures than 1D-SC codes. Furthermore, we consider designing MD-SC codes with smaller rateloss.
