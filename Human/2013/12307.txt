PRIMEBALL: a Parallel Processing Framework Benchmark for Big Data Applications in the Cloud

In this paper, we draw the specifications of a novel benchmark for comparing parallel processing frameworks in the context of big data applications hosted in the cloud. We aim at filling several gaps in already existing cloud data processing benchmarks, which lack a real-life context for their processes, thus losing relevance when trying to assess performance for real applications. Hence, we propose a fictitious news site hosted in the cloud that is to be managed by the framework under analysis, together with several objective use case scenarios and measures for evaluating system performance. The main strengths of our benchmark are parallelization capabilities supporting cloud features and big data properties.
