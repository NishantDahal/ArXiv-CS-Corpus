Wavelet methods for shape perception in electro-sensing

This paper aims at presenting a new approach to the electro-sensing problem using wavelets. It provides an efficient algorithm for recognizing the shape of a target from micro-electrical impedance measurements. Stability and resolution capabilities of the proposed algorithm are quantified in numerical simulations.
