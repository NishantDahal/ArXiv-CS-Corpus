Learning Mixed Graphical Models

We consider the problem of learning the structure of a pairwise  graphical model over continuous and discrete variables. We present a  new pairwise model for graphical models with both continuous and  discrete variables that is amenable to structure learning. In  previous work, authors have considered structure learning of  Gaussian graphical models and structure learning of discrete  models. Our approach is a natural generalization of these two lines  of work to the mixed case. The penalization scheme involves a novel  symmetric use of the group-lasso norm and follows naturally from a  particular parametrization of the model.
