A Deterministic Annealing Approach to Optimization of Zero-delay Source-Channel Codes

This paper studies optimization of zero-delay source-channel codes, and specifically the problem of obtaining globally optimal transformations that map between the source space and the channel space, under a given transmission power constraint and for the mean square error distortion. Particularly, we focus on the setting where the decoder has access to side information, whose cost surface is known to be riddled with local minima. Prior work derived the necessary conditions for optimality of the encoder and decoder mappings, along with a greedy optimization algorithm that imposes these conditions iteratively, in conjunction with the heuristic "noisy channel relaxation" method to mitigate poor local minima. While noisy channel relaxation is arguably effective in simple settings, it fails to provide accurate global optimization results in more complicated settings including the decoder with side information as considered in this paper. We propose a global optimization algorithm based on the ideas of "deterministic annealing"- a non-convex optimization method, derived from information theoretic principles with analogies to statistical physics, and successfully employed in several problems including clustering, vector quantization and regression. We present comparative numerical results that show strict superiority of the proposed algorithm over greedy optimization methods as well as over the noisy channel relaxation.
