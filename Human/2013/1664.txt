Real Time Estimation of Bayesian Networks

For real time evaluation of a Bayesian network when there is not sufficient time to obtain an exact solution, a guaranteed response time, approximate solution is required.  It is shown that nontraditional methods utilizing estimators based on an archive of trial solutions and genetic search can provide an approximate solution that is considerably superior to the traditional Monte Carlo simulation methods.
