On the Optimal Representation of Algebraic Expressions of Fibonacci Graphs

The paper investigates relationship between algebraic expressions and graphs. We consider a digraph called a Fibonacci graph which gives a generic example of non-series-parallel graphs. Our intention in this paper is to simplify the expressions of Fibonacci graphs and eventually find their shortest representations. With that end in view, we describe the optimal decomposition method for generating Fibonacci graph expressions that is conjectured to provide these representations. Proof (or disproof) of this conjecture is presented as an open problem.
