Experiences of Using a Hybrid Cloud to Construct an Environmental Virtual Observatory

Environmental science is often fragmented: data is collected using mismatched formats and conventions, and models are misaligned and run in isolation. Cloud computing offers a lot of potential in the way of resolving such issues by supporting data from different sources and at various scales, by facilitating the integration of models to create more sophisticated software services, and by providing a sustainable source of suitable computational and storage resources. In this paper, we highlight some of our experiences in building the Environmental Virtual Observatory pilot (EVOp), a tailored cloud-based infrastructure and associated web-based tools designed to enable users from different backgrounds to access data concerning different environmental issues. We review our architecture design, the current deployment and prototypes. We also reflect on lessons learned. We believe that such experiences are of benefit to other scientific communities looking to assemble virtual observatories or similar virtual research environments.
