Throughput Optimal Policies for Energy Harvesting Wireless Transmitters with Non-Ideal Circuit Power

Characterizing the fundamental tradeoffs for maximizing energy efficiency (EE) versus spectrum efficiency (SE) is a key problem in wireless communication. In this paper, we address this problem for a point-to-point additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with the transmitter powered solely via energy harvesting from the environment. In addition, we assume a practical on-off transmitter model with non-ideal circuit power, i.e., when the transmitter is on, its consumed power is the sum of the transmit power and a constant circuit power. Under this setup, we study the optimal transmit power allocation to maximize the average throughput over a finite horizon, subject to the time-varying energy constraint and the non-ideal circuit power consumption. First, we consider the off-line optimization under the assumption that the energy arrival time and amount are a priori known at the transmitter. Although this problem is non-convex due to the non-ideal circuit power, we show an efficient optimal solution that in general corresponds to a two-phase transmission: the first phase with an EE-maximizing on-off power allocation, and the second phase with a SE-maximizing power allocation that is non-decreasing over time, thus revealing an interesting result that both the EE and SE optimizations are unified in an energy harvesting communication system. We then extend the optimal off-line algorithm to the case with multiple parallel AWGN channels, based on the principle of nested optimization. Finally, inspired by the off-line optimal solution, we propose a new online algorithm under the practical setup with only the past and present energy state information (ESI) known at the transmitter.
