Secret sharing on the $d$-dimensional cube

We prove that for $d>1$ the best information ratio of the perfect secret sharing scheme based on the edge set of the $d$-dimensional cube is exactly $d/2$. Using the technique developed, we also prove that the information ratio of the infinite $d$-dimensional lattice is $d$.
