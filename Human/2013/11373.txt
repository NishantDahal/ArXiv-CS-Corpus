Large-scale analysis of frequency modulation in birdsong databases

Birdsong often contains large amounts of rapid frequency modulation (FM). It is believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic environment, and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills in aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often absent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis or linear prediction. Hence it is important to consider high resolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird vocalisations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a further advantage as large datasets become available.
  We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go beyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a signal at very short timescales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus, we investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures the species signal encoded in birdsong. In order to find tools useful in practical analysis of large databases, we also study the computational time taken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3 compression.
  We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM attributes, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the best. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species identity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas bandwidth features do not encode additional information.
  Large-scale FM analysis can efficiently extract information useful for bioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterise vocalisations.
