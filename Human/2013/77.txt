The phase transition in inhomogeneous random intersection graphs

We analyze the component evolution in inhomogeneous random intersection graphs when the average degree is close to 1. As the average degree increases, the size of the largest component in the random intersection graph goes through a phase transition. We give bounds on the size of the largest components before and after this transition. We also prove that the largest component after the transition is unique. These results are similar to the phase transition in Erdős-Rényi random graphs; one notable difference is that the jump in the size of the largest component varies in size depending on the parameters of the random intersection graph.
