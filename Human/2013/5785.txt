Survey of Multiscale and Multiphysics Applications and Communities

Multiscale and multiphysics applications are now commonplace, and many researchers focus on combining existing models to construct combined multiscale models. Here we present a concise review of multiscale applications and their source communities. We investigate the prevalence of multiscale projects in the EU and the US, review a range of coupling toolkits they use to construct multiscale models and identify areas where collaboration between disciplines could be particularly beneficial. We conclude that multiscale computing has become increasingly popular in recent years, that different communities adopt very different approaches to constructing multiscale simulations, and that simulations on a length scale of a few metres and a time scale of a few hours can be found in many of the multiscale research domains. Communities may receive additional benefit from sharing methods that are geared towards these scales.
