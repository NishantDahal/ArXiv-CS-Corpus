Stanley-Reisner resolution of constant weight linear codes

Given a constant weight linear code, we investigate its weight hierarchy and the Stanley-Reisner resolution of its associated matroid regarded as a simplicial complex. We also exhibit conditions on the higher weights sufficient to conclude that the code is of constant weight
