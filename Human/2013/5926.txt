Enhanced Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Embedding (ETEA)

As computer systems become more pervasive and complex, security is increasingly important. Secure Transmission refers to the transfer of data such as confidential or proprietary information over a secure channel. Many secure transmission methods require a type of encryption. Secure transmissions are put in place to prevent attacks such as ARP spoofing and general data loss. Hence, in order to provide a better security mechanism, in this paper we propose Enhanced Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Embedding (ETEA), a data hiding technique called steganography along with the technique of encryption (Cryptography). The advantage of ETEA is that it incorporates cryptography and steganography. The advantage proposed algorithm is that it hides the messages.
