Using the Dempster-Shafer Scheme in a Diagnostic Expert System Shell

This paper discusses an expert system shell that integrates rule-based reasoning and the Dempster-Shafer evidence combination scheme. Domain knowledge is stored as rules with associated belief functions. The reasoning component uses a combination of forward and backward inferencing mechanisms to allow interaction with users in a mixed-initiative format.
