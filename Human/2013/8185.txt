Approximated Symbolic Computations over Hybrid Automata

Hybrid automata are a natural framework for modeling and analyzing systems which exhibit a mixed discrete continuous behaviour. However, the standard operational semantics defined over such models implicitly assume perfect knowledge of the real systems and infinite precision measurements. Such assumptions are not only unrealistic, but often lead to the construction of misleading models. For these reasons we believe that it is necessary to introduce more flexible semantics able to manage with noise, partial information, and finite precision instruments. In particular, in this paper we integrate in a single framework based on approximated semantics different over and under-approximation techniques for hybrid automata. Our framework allows to both compare, mix, and generalize such techniques obtaining different approximated reachability algorithms.
