Multipath Approach for Reliability in Query Network based Overlaid Multicasting

In Application layer multicast (ALM) also called Overlay Multicast, multicast-related functionalities are moved to end-hosts. The key advantages, overlays offers, are flexibility, adaptability and ease of deployment [1]. Application layer multicast builds a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay multicast tree topology consisting of end-to-end unicast connections between end-hosts. End users self organize themselves into logical overlay networks for efficient data delivery. Major concern in designing ALM protocol is how to build and maintain a topology, to route data efficiently and reliably. We propose here a scheme in which the topology is built incrementally while maintaining dual feeds of the media stream to any node from the source with minimum differential delay in receiving packets from both alternatives. We have made the assumption of availability of a P2P query search network. This enables building of multicast tree directly as an overlay. There is no need of maintaining an overlaid mesh and running multicast routing protocol to maintain a multicast tree in this mesh. Thus the scheme is much more simplified than in the earlier work on multicast overlay mesh creation and management and then creation and management of multicast trees using this mesh.
