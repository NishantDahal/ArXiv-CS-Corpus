Optimal Fully Electric Vehicle load balancing with an ADMM algorithm in Smartgrids

In this paper we present a system architecture and a suitable control methodology for the load balancing of Fully Electric Vehicles at Charging Station (CS). Within the proposed architecture, control methodologies allow to adapt Distributed Energy Resources (DER) generation profiles and active loads to ensure economic benefits to each actor. The key aspect is the organization in two levels of control: at local level a Load Area Controller (LAC) optimally calculates the FEVs charging sessions, while at higher level a Macro Load Area Aggregator (MLAA) provides DER with energy production profiles, and LACs with energy withdrawal profiles. Proposed control methodologies involve the solution of a Walrasian market equilibrium and the design of a distributed algorithm.
