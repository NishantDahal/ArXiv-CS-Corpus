Vision-Guided Robot Hearing

Natural human-robot interaction in complex and unpredictable environments is one of the main research lines in robotics. In typical real-world scenarios, humans are at some distance from the robot and the acquired signals are strongly impaired by noise, reverberations and other interfering sources. In this context, the detection and localisation of speakers plays a key role since it is the pillar on which several tasks (e.g.: speech recognition and speaker tracking) rely. We address the problem of how to detect and localize people that are both seen and heard by a humanoid robot. We introduce a hybrid deterministic/probabilistic model. Indeed, the deterministic component allows us to map the visual information into the auditory space. By means of the probabilistic component, the visual features guide the grouping of the auditory features in order to form AV objects. The proposed model and the associated algorithm are implemented in real-time (17 FPS) using a stereoscopic camera pair and two microphones embedded into the head of the humanoid robot NAO. We performed experiments on (i) synthetic data, (ii) a publicly available data set and (iii) data acquired using the robot. The results we obtained validate the approach and encourage us to further investigate how vision can help robot hearing.
