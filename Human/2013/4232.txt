A Model for an Intelligent and Adaptive Tutor based on Web by Jackson's Learning Styles Profiler and Expert Systems

Todays, Intelligent and web-based E-Learning is one of the important area in E-Learning. This paper integrates an intelligent and web-based E-Learning with expert system technology to be able to model the learning styles of the learners using Jackson's model. It is intelligent because it can interact with the learners and offer them some subjects in Pedagogy view. Learning process of this system is in the following. First it determines learner's individual characteristics and learning styles based on a questionnaire in Jackson's learning styles profiler. Learning styles profiler is a modern measure of individual differences in learning style. Then learner's model is obtained and an Expert system simulator plans a "pre-test" and rates him. The concept would be presented if the learner scores enough. Subsequently, the system evaluates him by a "post-test". Finally the learner's model would be updated by the modeler based on try-and-error. The proposed system can be available Every Time and Every Where (ETEW) through the web. It improves the learning performance and has some important advantages such as high speed, simplicity of learning, low cost and be available ETEW.
