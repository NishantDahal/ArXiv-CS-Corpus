Analysing the Assumed Benefits of Software Requirements

Often during the requirements engineering (RE) process, the value of a requirement is assessed, e.g., in requirement prioritisation, release planning, and trade-off analysis. In order to support these activities, this research evaluates Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) methods for the description of a requirement's value. Specifically, we investigate the goal-to-goal contribution relationship for its ability to demonstrate the value of a requirement, and propose that it is enriched with concepts such as correlation, confidence, and utility.
