Design-Efficiency in Security

In this document, we present our applied results on balancing security and performance using a running example, which is based on sensor networks. These results are forming a basis for a new approach to balance security and performance, and therefore provide design-efficiency of key updates.
  We employ probabilistic model checking approach and present our modelling and analysis study using PRISM model checker.
