Context-aware QR-codes

This paper describes a new model for presenting local information based on the network proximity. We present a novelty mobile mashup which combines Wi-Fi proximity measurements with QR-codes. Our mobile mashup automatically adds context information the content presented by QR-codes. It simplifies the deployment schemes and allows to use unified presentation for all data points, for example. This paper describes how to combine QR-codes and network proximity information.
