On an algorithm for multiperiodic words

We consider an algorithm by Tijdeman and Zamboni constructing a word of a given length that has a given set of periods, and the richest possible alphabet. We show that this algorithm can be easily stated and its correctness briefly proved using the class equivalence approach.
