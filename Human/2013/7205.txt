Silence is Golden: exploiting jamming and radio silence to communicate

Jamming techniques require just moderate resources to be deployed, while their effectiveness in disrupting communications is unprecedented. In this paper we introduce several contributions to jamming mitigation. In particular, we introduce a novel adversary model that has both (unlimited) jamming reactive capabilities as well as powerful (but limited) proactive jamming capabilities. Under this powerful but yet realistic adversary model, the communication bandwidth provided by current anti-jamming solutions drops to zero. We then present Silence is Golden (SiG): a novel anti jamming protocol that, introducing a tunable, asymmetric communication channel, is able to mitigate the adversary capabilities, enabling the parties to communicate. For instance, with SiG it is possible to deliver a 128 bits long message with a probability greater than 99% in 4096 time slots in the presence of a jammer that jams all the on-the-fly communications and the 74% of the silent radio spectrum---while competing proposals simply fail. The provided solution enjoys a thorough theoretical analysis and is supported by extensive experimental results, showing the viability of our proposal.
