Flexible Interpretations: A Computational Model for Dynamic Uncertainty Assessment

The investigations reported in this paper center on the process of dynamic uncertainty assessment during interpretation tasks in real domain. In particular, we are interested here in the nature of the control structure of computer programs that can support multiple interpretation and smooth transitions between them, in real time. Each step of the processing involves the interpretation of one input item and the appropriate re-establishment of the system's confidence of the correctness of its interpretation(s).
