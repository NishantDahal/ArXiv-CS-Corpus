This paper is aimed to evaluate the importance of XML Signature and XML Encryption in Web Service Security. In today's business scenario, organizations are investing huge amount of resources in Web Services. Web Service Transactions are done mainly through plain-text XML formats like SOAP and WSDL, hence hacking into them is not a tedious task. XML Signature and XML Encryption ensure security to XML documents as well as retain the structure of documents, thereby making it easy to implement them. These two methods are evaluated on the parameters of authentication, authorization, integration, confidentiality and non-repudiation.
