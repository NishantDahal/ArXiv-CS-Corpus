Application of Fourier and Wavelet Transform for analysing 300 years Sunspot numbers to Explain the Solar Cycles

In this paper Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform are applied in case of recent 300 years of sunspot numbers to explain the solar cycles. Here basically parallel study of Fourier and Wavelet analysis are done and we have observed that the better result can be obtained from Wavelet analysis during sunspot number analysis. We are able to show various minima and maxima in the recent ages of solar cycles with this tool. The exact periodicity and other possible periodicities in the cyclic phenomenon of sunspot activity are determined.
