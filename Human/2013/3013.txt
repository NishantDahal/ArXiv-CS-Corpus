A Multilingual Semantic Wiki Based on Attempto Controlled English and Grammatical Framework

We describe a semantic wiki system with an underlying controlled natural language grammar implemented in Grammatical Framework (GF). The grammar restricts the wiki content to a well-defined subset of Attempto Controlled English (ACE), and facilitates a precise bidirectional automatic translation between ACE and language fragments of a number of other natural languages, making the wiki content accessible multilingually. Additionally, our approach allows for automatic translation into the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which enables automatic reasoning over the wiki content. The developed wiki environment thus allows users to build, query and view OWL knowledge bases via a user-friendly multilingual natural language interface. As a further feature, the underlying multilingual grammar is integrated into the wiki and can be collaboratively edited to extend the vocabulary of the wiki or even customize its sentence structures. This work demonstrates the combination of the existing technologies of Attempto Controlled English and Grammatical Framework, and is implemented as an extension of the existing semantic wiki engine AceWiki.
