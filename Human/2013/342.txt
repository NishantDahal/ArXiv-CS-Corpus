Connecting the Dots: Computer Systems Education using a Functional Hardware Description Language

A functional hardware description language enables students to gain a working understanding of computer systems, and to see how the levels of abstraction fit together. By simulating circuits, digital design becomes a living topic, like programming, and not just a set of inert facts to memorise. Experiences gained from more than 20 years of teaching computer systems via functional programming are discussed.
