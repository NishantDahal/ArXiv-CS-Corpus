Short lists with short programs in short time - a short proof

Bauwens, Mahklin, Vereshchagin and Zimand [ECCC TR13-007] and Teutsch [arxiv:1212.6104] have shown that given a string x it is possible to construct in polynomial time a list containing a short description of it. We simplify their technique and present a shorter proof of this result.
