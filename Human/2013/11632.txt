Coding based Data Broadcasting for Time Critical Applications with Rate Adaptation

In this paper, we dynamically select the transmission rate and design wireless network coding to improve the quality of services such as delay for time critical applications. In a network coded system, with low transmission rate and hence longer transmission range, more packets may be encoded, which increases the coding opportunity. However, low transmission rate may incur extra transmission delay, which is intolerable for time critical applications. We design a novel joint rate selection and wireless network coding (RSNC) scheme with delay constraint, so as to maximize the total benefit (where we can define the benefit based on the priority or importance of a packet for example) of the packets that are successfully received at the destinations without missing their deadlines. We prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard, and propose a novel graph model to mathematically formulate the problem. For the general case, we propose a transmission metric and design an efficient algorithm to determine the transmission rate and coding strategy for each transmission. For a special case when all delay constraints are the same, we study the pairwise coding and present a polynomial time pairwise coding algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of 1 - 1/e to the optimal pairwise coding solution, where e is the base of the natural logarithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RSNC scheme.
