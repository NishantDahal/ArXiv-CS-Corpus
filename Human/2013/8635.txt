A Survey of Spline-based Volumetric Data Modeling Framework and Its Applications

The rapid advances in 3D scanning and acquisition techniques have given rise to the explosive increase of volumetric digital models in recent years. This dissertation systematically trailblazes a novel volumetric modeling framework to represent 3D solids. The need to explore more efficient and robust 3D modeling framework has gained the prominence. Although the traditional surface representation (e.g., triangle mesh) has many attractive properties, it is incapable of expressing the interior space and materials. Such a serious drawback overshadows many potential modeling and analysis applications. Consequently volumetric modeling techniques become the well-known solution to this problem. Nevertheless, many unsolved research issues remain when developing an efficient modeling paradigm for existing 3D models: complex geometry (fine details and extreme concaveness), arbitrary topology, heterogenous materials, large-scale data storage and processing, etc.
