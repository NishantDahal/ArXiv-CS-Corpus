A New PVSS Scheme with a Simple Encryption Function

A Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing (PVSS) scheme allows anyone to verify the validity of the shares computed and distributed by a dealer. The idea of PVSS was introduced by Stadler in [18] where he presented a PVSS scheme based on Discrete Logarithm. Later, several PVSS schemes were proposed. In [2], Behnad and Eghlidos present an interesting PVSS scheme with explicit membership and disputation processes. In this paper, we present a new PVSS having the advantage of being simpler while offering the same features.
