Point values and normalization of two-direction multiwavelets and their derivatives

Two-direction multiscaling functions $\boldsymbolφ$ and two-direction multiwavelets $\boldsymbolψ$ associated with $\boldsymbolφ$ are more general and more flexible setting than one-direction multiscaling functions and multiwavelets. In this paper, we investigate how to find and normalize point values and those of derivatives of the two-direction multiscaling functions $\boldsymbolφ$ and multiwavelets $\boldsymbolψ$. %associated with $\boldsymbolφ$. For finding point values, we investigate the eigenvalue approach. For normalization, we investigate the normalizing conditions for them by normalizing the zeroth continuous moment of $\boldsymbolφ$. Examples for illustrating the general theory are given.
