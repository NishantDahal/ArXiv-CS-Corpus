On Diagnosis of Forwarding Plane via Static Forwarding Rules in Software Defined Networks

Software Defined Networks (SDN) decouple the forwarding and control planes from each other. The control plane is assumed to have a global knowledge of the underlying physical and/or logical network topology so that it can monitor, abstract and control the forwarding plane. In our paper, we present solutions that install an optimal or near-optimal (i.e., within 14% of the optimal) number of static forwarding rules on switches/routers so that any controller can verify the topology connectivity and detect/locate link failures at data plane speeds without relying on state updates from other controllers. Our upper bounds on performance indicate that sub-second link failure localization is possible even at data-center scale networks. For networks with hundreds or few thousand links, tens of milliseconds of latency is achievable.
