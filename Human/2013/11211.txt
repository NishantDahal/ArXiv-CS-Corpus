Stitched Panoramas from Toy Airborne Video Cameras

Effective panoramic photographs are taken from vantage points that are high. High vantage points have recently become easier to reach as the cost of quadrotor helicopters has dropped to nearly disposable levels. Although cameras carried by such aircraft weigh only a few grams, their low-quality video can be converted into panoramas of high quality and high resolution. Also, the small size of these aircraft vastly reduces the risks inherent to flight.
