Proceedings 7th International Workshop on Computing with Terms and Graphs

This   volume contains  the   proceedings of  the  Seventh International Workshop  on  Computing with Terms  and  Graphs (TERMGRAPH  2013). The workshop  took place in  Rome, Italy, on March 23rd, 2013, as part of the  sixteenth edition of the  European Joint Conferences  on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2013).
  Research in term and graph rewriting ranges from theoretical questions to practical  issues.  Computing  with  graphs handles  the sharing of common subexpressions in a natural and  seamless way, and improves the efficiency of  computations in space and  time.  Sharing is ubiquitous in several research areas, as witnessed by the modelling of first- and higher-order term  rewriting by (acyclic  or cyclic)  graph rewriting, the  modelling  of biological   or  chemical  abstract  machines, and the implementation     techniques    of   programming     languages:  many implementations of  functional, logic, object-oriented, concurrent and mobile calculi are based on term graphs.  Term graphs are also used in automated theorem proving and symbolic  computation systems working on shared structures.   The  aim of this  workshop  is to bring  together researchers    working  in  different  domains   on   term  and  graph transformation and to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and  to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in term graph rewriting.
  These proceedings  contain six  accepted papers  and the  abstracts of two  invited   talks. All   submissions  were   subject  to  careful refereeing. The topics of accepted papers  range over a wide spectrum, including theoretical aspects of term  graph rewriting, concurrency, semantics as well as application issues of term graph transformation.
