Global Life Patterns: A Methodology for Designing a Personal Global Life

In this paper, we propose the Global Life Patterns, a methodology to support people to maintain individuality and design their own actions in respect to the "globalizing" society - a Global Life. Today, globalization requires each person to maintain individuality in respect to Globalization. Because methods to acquire such ability are tacit, a clarified methodology to live a Global Life is needed.This methodology is based on the format of a Pattern Language - specifically, this methodology is in the format of the Pattern Language 3.0 (Iba, 2012).
