Enabling Context-awareness by Predicate Detection in Asynchronous Pervasive Computing Environments

Pervasive applications are involving more and more autonomous computing and communicating devices, augmented with the abilities of sensing and controlling the logical / physical environment. To enable context-awareness for such applications, we are challenged by the intrinsic asynchrony among the context collecting devices. To this end, we introduce the predicate detection theory and propose the Predicate-Detection-based Context-Awareness (PD-CA) framework, in which: a) logical time is used to explicitly cope with the asynchrony; b) specification of predicates enables the applications to express contextual properties of their concerns; c) online and incremental predicate detection algorithms effectively enable context-awareness at runtime. Under the guidance of the PD-CA framework, we present the design and implementation of the MIPA middleware, which shields the applications from the burden of processing the asynchronous contexts. We also demonstrate how PD-CA simplifies the development of context-aware applications. Experimental evaluations show the performance of MIPA in supporting context-aware applications despite of the asynchrony.
