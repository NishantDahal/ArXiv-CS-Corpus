Evolving Boolean Regulatory Networks with Epigenetic Control

The significant role of epigenetic mechanisms within natural systems has become increasingly clear. This paper uses a recently presented abstract, tunable Boolean genetic regulatory network model to explore aspects of epigenetics. It is shown how dynamically controlling transcription via a DNA methylation-inspired mechanism can be selected for by simulated evolution under various single and multiple cell scenarios. Further, it is shown that the effects of such control can be inherited without detriment to fitness.
