Using Blogs to Promote Writing Skill in ESL Classroom

This study provides details on the motivational factors for using blogs as an essential tool to promote students writing skills in ESL classrooms. The study aims to discuss how using blogs may be integrated into classroom activities to promote students writing skills as well as polishing their skills. It would also illustrate the features offered in blogs as well as the motivational essence that is attached to the blogs. To achieve the aim of the study, a semi-structured interview protocol was used to collect the required qualitative data. The findings of the study would serve as an insistent reminder that the blogs which have been clearly underlined in the curriculum should be re-orchestrated more effectively again by the teachers of English as a Second Language (ESL).
