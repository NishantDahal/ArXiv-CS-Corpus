Vocalnayno: Designing a Game-Based Intervention to Support Reading Development in Primary Schools

Encouraging children to read frequently and helping them to develop their reading skills as effectively as possible can be a challenge for some primary schools. This research questions whether the use of a game-based intervention can integrate into the existing teaching culture to aid volunteer teaching assistants in achieving a more significant impact on pupil reading development. A prototype based on the initial process of requirements gathering is presented using Multimedia Fusion Developer 2. The design incorporates a game-like exercise where a foam volcano character releases bubbles containing letters and words. Pupils must read these aloud in order to burst them open, which is recorded as a metric of reading ability.
