Layered Interference Networks with Delayed CSI: DoF Scaling with Distributed Transmitters

The layered interference network is investigated with delayed channel state information (CSI) at all nodes. It is demonstrated how multi-hopping can be utilized to increase the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF). In particular, a multi-phase transmission scheme is proposed for the $K$-user $2K$-hop interference network in order to systematically exploit the layered structure of the network and delayed CSI to achieve DoF values that scale with $K$. This result provides the first example of a network with distributed transmitters and delayed CSI whose DoF scales with the number of users.
