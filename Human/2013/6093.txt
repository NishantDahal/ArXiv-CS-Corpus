A generalization of bounds for cyclic codes, including the HT and BS bounds

We use the algebraic structure of cyclic codes and some properties of the discrete Fourier transform to give a reformulation of several classical bounds for the distance of cyclic codes, by extending techniques of linear algebra. We propose a bound, whose computational complexity is polynomial bounded, which is a generalization of the Hartmann-Tzeng bound and the Betti-Sala bound. In the majority of computed cases, our bound is the tightest among all known polynomial-time bounds, including the Roos bound.
