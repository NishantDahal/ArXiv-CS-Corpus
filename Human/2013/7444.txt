Software as a Service - Common Service Bus (SAAS-CSB)

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a form of cloud computing that relieves the user from the concern of hardware, software installation and management. It is an emerging business model that delivers software applications to the users through Web-based technology. Software vendors have varying requirements and SaaS applications most typically support such requirements. The various applications used by unique customers in a single instance are known as Multi-Tenancy. There would be a delay in service when the user sends the data from multiple applications to multiple destinations and from multiple applications to single destination due to the use of single CSB. This problem can be overcome by using multiple CSB concepts and hence multiple senders can efficiently send their data to multiple receivers at the same time. The multiple clouds are monitored and managed by the SaaS-CSB portal. The idea of SaaS-CSB Portal is to provide a single pane of glass for the user to consume and govern any service from any cloud. Thus, SaaS-CSB application allows companies to save their IT cost and valuable time.
