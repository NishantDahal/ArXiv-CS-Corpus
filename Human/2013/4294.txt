Network connectivity through small openings

Network connectivity is usually addressed for convex domains where a direct line of sight exists between any two transmitting/receiving nodes. Here, we develop a general theory for the network connectivity properties across a small opening, rendering the domain essentially non-convex. Our analytic approach can go only so far as we encounter what is referred to in statistical physics as quenched disorder making the problem non-trivial. We confirm our theory through computer simulations, obtain leading order approximations and discuss possible extensions and applications.
