Framework Model for Database Replication within the Availability Zones

This paper presents a proposed model for database replication model in private cloud availability regions, which is an enhancement of the SQL Server AlwaysOn Layers of Protection Model presents by Microsoft in 2012. The enhancement concentrates in the database replication for private cloud availability regions through the use of primary and secondary servers. The processes of proposed model during the client send Write/Read Request to the server, in synchronous and semi synchronous replication level has been described in details also the processes of proposed model when the client send Write/Read Request to the Primary Server presented in details. All the types of automatic failover situations are presented in this thesis. Using the proposed models will increase the performance because each one of the secondary servers will open for Read / Write and allow the clients to connect to the nearby secondary and less loading on each server. Keywords: Availability Regions, Cloud Computing, Database Replication, SQL Server AlwaysOn, Synchronization.
