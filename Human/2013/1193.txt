Numerical analysis of topological characteristics of three-dimensional geological models of oil and gas fields

We discuss the study of topological characteristics of random fields that are used for numerical simulation of oil and gas reservoirs and numerical algorithms (see arXiv:1302.3669), for computing such characteristics, for which we demonstrate results of their applications.
