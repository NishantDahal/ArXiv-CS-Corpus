QoS Based Framework for Effective Web Services in Cloud Computing

Enhancements in technology always follow Consumer requirements. Consumer requires best of service with least possible mismatch and on time. Numerous applications available today are based on Web Services and Cloud Computing. Recently, there exist many Web Services with similar functional characteristics. Choosing a right Service from group of similar Web Service is a complicated task for Service Consumer. In that case, Service Consumer can discover the required Web Service using non functional attributes of the Web Services such as QoS. Proposed layered architecture and Web Service Cloud i.e.WS Cloud computing Framework synthesizes the Non functional attributes that includes reliability, availability, response time, latency etc. The Service Consumer is projected to provide the QoS requirements as part of Service discovery query. This framework will discover and filter the Web Services form the cloud and rank them according to Service Consumer preferences to facilitate Service on time.
