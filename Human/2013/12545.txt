Computational impact of hydrophobicity in protein stability

Among the various features of amino acids, the hydrophobic property has most visible impact on stability of a sequence folding. This is mentioned in many protein folding related work, in this paper we more elaborately discuss the computational impact of the well defined hydrophobic aspect in determining stability, approach with the help of a developed free energy computing algorithm covering various aspects preprocessing of an amino acid sequence, generating the folding and calculating free energy. Later discussing its use in protein structure related research work.
