Optical Disk with Blu-Ray Technology

Blu-ray is the name of a next-generation optical disc format jointly developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association a group of the world's leading consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers. The format was developed to enable recording, rewriting and playback of high-definition video, as well as storing large amounts of data. This extra capacity combined with the use of advanced video and audio codec will offer consumers an unprecedented HD experience. While current optical disc technologies such as DVD and DVDRAM rely on a red laser to read and write data, the new format uses a blue-violet laser instead, hence the name Blu-ray. Blu ray also promises some added security, making ways for copyright protections. Blu-ray discs can have a unique ID written on them to have copyright protection inside the recorded streams. Blu .ray disc takes the DVD technology one step further, just by using a laser with a nice color.
