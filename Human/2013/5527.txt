A Novel Symmetric Key Cryptographic Technique at Bit Level Based on Spiral Matrix Concept

In this paper, we propose a session based bit level symmetric key cryptographic technique and it is termed as Spiral Matrix Based Bit Orientation Technique (SMBBOT). SMBBOT consider the input plain text as binary bit stream. During encryption this stream is chopped into manageable sized blocks with variable lengths. Bits of these blocks are taken from MSB to LSB to fit into a square matrix of suitable order following the concept of Spiral matrix. This square matrix splits into 2x2 sub-matrices. Bits are taken column-wise from all 2x2 sub-matrices to form the encrypted binary string. Cipher text is generated from this encrypted binary string. Combination of values of block length and no. of blocks of a session generates the session key for SMBBOT. For decryption the cipher text is considered as binary bit string. Processing the session key information, this binary string is broken down into predefined blocks. Bits of these blocks are taken from MSB to LSB to fit column-wise into 2x2 square matrices. Using these sub-matrices a single square matrix with suitable order is formed. The decrypted binary string is formed after taking the bits from the square matrix following the reverse concept of Spiral Matrix. The plain text is regenerated from decrypted binary string. A comparison of SMBBOT with existing and industrially accepted TDES and AES has been done.
