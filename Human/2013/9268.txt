Four-Pose Synthesis of Angle-Symmetric 6R Linkages

We use the recently introduced factorization theory of motion polynomials over the dual quaternions for the synthesis of closed kinematic loops with six revolute joints that visit four prescribed poses. Our approach admits either no or a one-parametric family of solutions. We suggest strategies for picking good solutions from this family.
