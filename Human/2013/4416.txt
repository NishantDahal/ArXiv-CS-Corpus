Logical Fuzzy Optimization

We present a logical framework to represent and reason about fuzzy optimization problems based on fuzzy answer set optimization programming. This is accomplished by allowing fuzzy optimization aggregates, e.g., minimum and maximum in the language of fuzzy answer set optimization programming to allow minimization or maximization of some desired criteria under fuzzy environments. We show the application of the proposed logical fuzzy optimization framework under the fuzzy answer set optimization programming to the fuzzy water allocation optimization problem.
