Resonant Clocking Circuits for Reversible Computation

A mechanism for the reduction of dynamic energy dissipation in the computing circuit is described. The resonant circuit with controlled switches conserves the stored energy by recovering upto 90% of energy that would be otherwise lost during logic state transitions. This energy-conserving approach preserves thermodynamic entropy, ideally preventing heat generation in the system. This approach is used in a proposed resonant clocking and logic application without dynamic energy dissipation.
