TouchDevelop is a new programming environment that allows users to create applications on mobile devices. Applications created with TouchDevelop have continued to grow in popularity since TouchDevelop was first released to public in 2011. This paper presents a field study of 31,699 applications, focusing on different characteristics between 539 game scripts and all other non-game applications, as well as what make some game applications more popular than others to users. The study provides a list of findings on characteristics of game scripts and also implications for improving end-user programming of game applications.
