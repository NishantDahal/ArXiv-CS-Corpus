An Adaptive and Intelligent Tutor by Expert Systems for Mobile Devices

Mobile Learning (M-Learning) is an emerging discipline in the area of education and educational technology. So researchers are trying to optimize and expanding its application in the field of education. The aim of this paper is to investigate the role of mobile devices and expert systems in disseminating and supporting the knowledge gained by intelligent tutors and to propose a system based on integration of intelligent M-Learning with expert systems. It acts as an intelligent tutor which can perform three processes - pre-test, learning concept and post-test - according to characteristic of the learner. The proposed system can improves the education efficiency highly as well as decreases costs. As a result, every time and everywhere (ETEW) simple and cheap learning would be provided via SMS, MMS and so on in this system. The global intention of M-Learning is to make learning "a way of being".
