Removal of Data Incest in Multi-agent Social Learning in Social Networks

Motivated by online reputation systems, we investigate social learning in a network where agents interact on a time dependent graph to estimate an underlying state of nature. Agents record their own private observations, then update their private beliefs about the state of nature using Bayes' rule. Based on their belief, each agent then chooses an action (rating) from a finite set and transmits this action over the social network. An important consequence of such social learning over a network is the ruinous multiple re-use of information known as data incest (or mis-information propagation). In this paper, the data incest management problem in social learning context is formulated on a directed acyclic graph. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph topology of social interactions to eliminate data incest. A data incest removal algorithm is proposed such that the public belief of social learning (and hence the actions of agents) is not affected by data incest propagation. This results in an online reputation system with a higher trust rating. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed optimal data incest removal algorithm.
