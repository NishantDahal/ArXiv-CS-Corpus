Microelectromechanical Resonators for Radio Frequency Communication Applications

Over the past few years, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based on-chip resonators have shown significant potential for sensing and high frequency signal processing applications. This is due to their excellent features like small size, large frequency-quality factor product, low power consumption, low cost batch fabrication, and integrability with CMOS IC technology. Radio frequency communication circuits like reference oscillators, filters, and mixers based on such MEMS resonators can be utilized for meeting the increasing count of RF components likely to be demanded by the next generation multi-band/multi-mode wireless devices. MEMS resonators can provide a feasible alternative to the present day well established quartz crystal technology that is riddled with major drawbacks like relatively large size, high cost, and low compatibility with IC chips. This article presents a survey of the developments in this field of resonant MEMS structures with detailed enumeration on the various micromechanical resonator types, modes of vibration, equivalent mechanical and electrical models, materials and technologies used for fabrication, and the application of the resonators for implementing oscillators and filters. These are followed by a discussion on the challenges for RF MEMS technology in comparison to quartz crystal technology; like high precision, stability, reliability, need for hermetic packaging etc. which remain to be addressed for enabling the inclusion of micromechanical resonators into tomorrow's highly integrated communication systems.
