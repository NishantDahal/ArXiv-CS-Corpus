Bottleneck combinatorial optimization problems with uncertain costs and the OWA criterion

In this paper a class of bottleneck combinatorial optimization problems with uncertain costs is discussed. The uncertainty is modeled by specifying a discrete scenario set containing a finite number of cost vectors, called scenarios. In order to choose a solution the Ordered Weighted Averaging aggregation operator (shortly OWA) is applied. The OWA operator generalizes traditional criteria in decision making under uncertainty such as the maximum, minimum, average, median, or Hurwicz criterion. New complexity and approximation results in this area are provided. These results are general and remain valid for many problems, in particular for a wide class of network problems.
