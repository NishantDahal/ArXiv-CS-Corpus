A New Trusted and E-Commerce Architecture for Cloud Computing

Cloud computing platform gives people the opportunity for sharing resources, services and information among the people of the whole world. In private cloud system, information is shared among the persons who are in that cloud. Presently, different types of internet based systems are running in Cloud Computing environment. E-commerce is one of them. Present models are not secured enough for executing e-transactions easily, especially in cloud platform. Again, most of the time, clients fail to distinguish between the good online business companies and the bad one, which discourages clients and companies to migrate in cloud. In this paper, we have proposed a newer e-commerce architecture depends on encryption based secured and fuzzy logic based certain trust model which will be helpful to solve present e-commerce problems. We had discussed about the whole working procedure of the model in this paper. Finally, at the end of this paper, we have discussed some experimental results about our proposed model which will help to show the validity of our model.
