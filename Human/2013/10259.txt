Towards Application of the RBNK Model

The computational modeling of genetic regulatory networks is now common place, either by fitting a system to experimental data or by exploring the behaviour of abstract systems with the aim of identifying underlying principles. This paper presents an approach to the latter, considering the response to environmental changes of a well-known model placed upon tunable fitness landscapes. The effects on genome size and gene connectivity are explored.
