Analysis and Synthesis of a Subsystem of the Manual Control Loop for Manned Spacecraft

A salient feature of the manned spacecraft is the predominance of discrete information in the manual control loop of the onboard systems. Specifically, command-signaling control panels (CSCP) as a subsystem of the manual control loop are widely used in the Russian manned spacecraft. In this paper CSCP are classified into four types: a) control panels based on multi-channel control; b) control panels based on command-information compression; c) control panels based on command and signaling information compression; d) integrated control consoles (ICC) based on computer and information technology. It is shown that ICC underlies modern information display systems (IDS). ICC first appeared in the Russian manned space program in the IDS of the Soyuz-TMA spacecraft and the Russian modules of the International Space Station. Results of engineering and psychological studies of different types of panels are produced.
