Report: GPU Based Massive Parallel Kawasaki Kinetics In Monte Carlo Modelling of Lipid Microdomains

This paper introduces novel method of simulation of lipid biomembranes based on Metropolis Hastings algorithm and Graphic Processing Unit computational power. Method gives up to 55 times computational boost in comparison to classical computations. Extensive study of algorithm correctness is provided. Analysis of simulation results and results obtained with classical simulation methodologies are presented.
