Exploration of Recent Advances in the Field of Brain Computer Interfaces

A new approach for implementing number of expressions, emotions and, actions to operate objects through the thoughts of brain using a Non-Invasive Brain Computing Interface (BCI) technique has been proposed. In this paper a survey on brain and its operations are presented. The steps involved in the brain signal processing are discussed. The current systems are able to present few expressions and emotions on a single device. The proposed system provides the extended number of expressions on multiple numbers of objects.
