Airborne Base Stations for Emergency and Temporary Events

This paper introduces a rapidly deployable wireless network based on Low Altitude Platforms and portable land units to support disaster-relief activities, and to extend capacity during temporary mass events. The system integrates an amalgam of radio technologies such as LTE, WLAN and TETRA to provide heterogeneous communications in the deployment location. Cognitive radio is used for autonomous network configuration. Sensor networks monitor the environment in real-time during relief activities and provide distributed spectrum sensing capacities. Finally, remote communications are supported via S-band satellite links.
