All Linear-Time Congruences for Familiar Operators

The detailed behaviour of a system is often represented as a labelled transition system (LTS) and the abstract behaviour as a stuttering-insensitive semantic congruence. Numerous congruences have been presented in the literature. On the other hand, there have not been many results proving the absence of more congruences. This publication fully analyses the linear-time (in a well-defined sense) region with respect to action prefix, hiding, relational renaming, and parallel composition. It contains 40 congruences. They are built from the alphabet, two kinds of traces, two kinds of divergence traces, five kinds of failures, and four kinds of infinite traces. In the case of finite LTSs, infinite traces lose their role and the number of congruences drops to 20. The publication concentrates on the hardest and most novel part of the result, that is, proving the absence of more congruences.
