Says who? Automatic Text-Based Content Analysis of Television News

We perform an automatic analysis of television news programs, based on the closed captions that accompany them. Specifically, we collect all the news broadcasted in over 140 television channels in the US during a period of six months. We start by segmenting, processing, and annotating the closed captions automatically. Next, we focus on the analysis of their linguistic style and on mentions of people using NLP methods. We present a series of key insights about news providers, people in the news, and we discuss the biases that can be uncovered by automatic means. These insights are contrasted by looking at the data from multiple points of view, including qualitative assessment.
