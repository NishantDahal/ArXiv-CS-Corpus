Sockpuppet Detection in Wikipedia: A Corpus of Real-World Deceptive Writing for Linking Identities

This paper describes the corpus of sockpuppet cases we gathered from Wikipedia. A sockpuppet is an online user account created with a fake identity for the purpose of covering abusive behavior and/or subverting the editing regulation process. We used a semi-automated method for crawling and curating a dataset of real sockpuppet investigation cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first corpus available on real-world deceptive writing. We describe the process for crawling the data and some preliminary results that can be used as baseline for benchmarking research. The dataset will be released under a Creative Commons license from our project website: http://docsig.cis.uab.edu.
