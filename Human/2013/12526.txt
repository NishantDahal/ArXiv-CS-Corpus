CACO : Competitive Ant Colony Optimization, A Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic For Large-Scale Global Optimization

Large-scale problems are nonlinear problems that need metaheuristics, or global optimization algorithms. This paper reviews nature-inspired metaheuristics, then it introduces a framework named Competitive Ant Colony Optimization inspired by the chemical communications among insects. Then a case study is presented to investigate the proposed framework for large-scale global optimization.
