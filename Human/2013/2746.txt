Agent-based modelling of social organisations

In the paper, the model of the society represented by a social network and the model of a multi-agent system built on the basis of this, is presented. The particular aim of the system is to predict the evolution of a society and an analysis of the communities that appear, their characteristic features and reasons for coming into being. As an example of application, an analysis was made of a social portal which makes it possible to offer and reserve places in rooms for travelling tourists
