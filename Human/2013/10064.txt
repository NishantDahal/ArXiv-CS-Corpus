The age of information in gossip networks

We introduce models of gossip based communication networks in which each node is simultaneously a sensor, a relay and a user of information. We model the status of ages of information between nodes as a discrete time Markov chain. In this setting a gossip transmission policy is a decision made at each node regarding what type of information to relay at any given time (if any). When transmission policies are based on random decisions, we are able to analyze the age of information in certain illustrative structured examples either by means of an explicit analysis, an algorithm or asymptotic approximations. Our key contribution is presenting this class of models.
