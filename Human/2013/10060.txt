Online Ensemble Learning for Imbalanced Data Streams

While both cost-sensitive learning and online learning have been studied extensively, the effort in simultaneously dealing with these two issues is limited. Aiming at this challenge task, a novel learning framework is proposed in this paper. The key idea is based on the fusion of online ensemble algorithms and the state of the art batch mode cost-sensitive bagging/boosting algorithms. Within this framework, two separately developed research areas are bridged together, and a batch of theoretically sound online cost-sensitive bagging and online cost-sensitive boosting algorithms are first proposed. Unlike other online cost-sensitive learning algorithms lacking theoretical analysis of asymptotic properties, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is guaranteed under certain conditions, and the experimental evidence with benchmark data sets also validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.
