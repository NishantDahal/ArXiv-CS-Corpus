Randomness Conservation over Algorithms

Current discrete randomness and information conservation inequalities are over total recursive functions, i.e. restricted to deterministic processing. This restriction implies that an algorithm can break algorithmic randomness conservation inequalities. We address this issue by proving tight bounds of randomness and information conservation with respect to recursively enumerable transformations, i.e. processing by algorithms. We also show conservation of randomness of finite strings with respect to enumerable distributions, i.e. semicomputable semi-measures.
