k-Modulus Method for Image Transformation

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to make a novel spatial image transformation. The proposed approach aims to reduce the bit depth used for image storage. The basic technique for the proposed transformation is based of the modulus operator. The goal is to transform the whole image into multiples of predefined integer. The division of the whole image by that integer will guarantee that the new image surely less in size from the original image. The k-Modulus Method could not be used as a stand alone transform for image compression because of its high compression ratio. It could be used as a scheme embedded in other image processing fields especially compression. According to its high PSNR value, it could be amalgamated with other methods to facilitate the redundancy criterion.
