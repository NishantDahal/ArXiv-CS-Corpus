About the Discriminant Power of the Subgraph Centrality and Other Centrality Measures About the Discriminant Power of the Subgraph Centrality and Other Centrality Measures(Working paper)

The discriminant power of centrality indices for the degree, eigenvector, closeness, betweenness and subgraph centrality is analyzed. It is defined by the number of graphs for which the standard deviation of the centrality of its nodes is zero. On the basis of empirical analysis it is concluded that the subgraph centrality displays better discriminant power than the rest of centralities. We also propose some new conjectures about the types of graphs for which the subgraph centrality does not discriminate among nonequivalent nodes.
