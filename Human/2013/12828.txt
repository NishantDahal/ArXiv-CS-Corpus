Food Recommendation using Ontology and Heuristics

Recommender systems are needed to find food items of ones interest. We review recommender systems and recommendation methods. We propose a food personalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia. We extend Hermes framework with food recommendation functionality. We combine TF-IDF term extraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and standard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the performed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general outperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy, precision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure than existing semantic recommenders.
