Pennants for Descriptors

We present a new technique (called pennants) for displaying the descriptors related to a descriptor across literatures, rather in a thesaurus. It has definite implications for online searching and browsing. Pennants, named for the flag they resemble, are a form of algorithmic prediction. Their cognitive base is in relevance theory (RT) from linguistic pragmatics (Sperber & Wilson 1995).
