On Context Bisimulation for Parameterized Higher-order Processes

This paper studies context bisimulation for higher-order processes, in the presence of parameterization (viz. abstraction). We show that the extension of higher-order processes with process parameterization retains the characterization of context bisimulation by a much simpler form of bisimulation called normal bisimulation (viz. they are coincident), in which universal quantifiers are eliminated; whereas it is not the same with name parameterization. These results clarify further the bisimulation theory of higher-order processes, and also shed light on the essential distinction between the two kinds of parameterization.
