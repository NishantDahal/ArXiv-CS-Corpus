Unifying the Linear Time-Branching Time Spectrum of Process Semantics

Van Glabbeek's linear time-branching time spectrum is one of the most relevant work on comparative study on process semantics, in which semantics are partially ordered by their discrimination power. In this paper we bring forward a refinement of this classification and show how the process semantics can be dealt with in a uniform way: based on the very natural concept of constrained simulation we show how we can classify the spectrum in layers; for the families lying in the same layer we show how to obtain in a generic way equational, observational, logical and operational characterizations; relations among layers are also very natural and differences just stem from the constraint imposed on the simulations that rule the layers. Our methodology also shows how to achieve a uniform treatment of semantic preorders and equivalences.
