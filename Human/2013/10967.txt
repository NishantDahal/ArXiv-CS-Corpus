A framework for the automation of generalised stability theory

The traditional approach to investigating the stability of a physical system is to linearise the equations about a steady base solution, and to examine the eigenvalues of the linearised operator. Over the past several decades, it has been recognised that this approach only determines the asymptotic stability of the system, and neglects the possibility of transient perturbation growth arising due to the nonnormality of the system. This observation motivated the development of a more powerful generalised stability theory (GST), which focusses instead on the singular value decomposition of the linearised propagator of the system. While GST has had significant successes in understanding the stability of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, its more widespread applicability has been hampered by the fact that computing the SVD requires both the tangent linear operator and its adjoint: deriving the tangent linear and adjoint models is usually a considerable challenge, and manually embedding them inside an eigensolver is laborious. In this paper, we present a framework for the automation of generalised stability theory, which overcomes these difficulties. Given a compact high-level symbolic representation of a finite element discretisation implemented in the FEniCS system, efficient C++ code is automatically generated to assemble the forward, tangent linear and adjoint models; these models are then used to calculate the optimally growing perturbations to the forward model, and their growth rates. By automating the stability computations, we hope to make these powerful tools a more routine part of computational analysis. The efficiency and generality of the framework is demonstrated with applications drawn from geophysical fluid dynamics, phase separation and quantum mechanics.
