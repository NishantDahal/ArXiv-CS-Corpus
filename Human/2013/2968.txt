Business information through Spain's Chambers of Commerce: meeting business needs

From different public and private instances, mechanisms have been set in action that allow for companies to obtain information in order to make decisions with a stronger foundation. This article is focused on the description of an entire information system for the business world, developed in the realm of the Chambers of Commerce of Spain, which have given rise to the creation of an authentic network of inter-chamber information.
  In Spain, the obligatory membership of businesses to the Chambers of Commerce in their geographic areas, and therefore the compulsory payment of member quotas, has traditionally generated some polemics, above all because many firms have not perceived a material usefulness of the services offered by these Chambers.
  Notwithstanding, the 85 Chambers currently existing in Spain, as well as the organism that coordinates them -the Upper Council or Consejo Superior de Camaras de Comercio- and the company created expressly to commercialize informational services online, Camerdata, have developed genuinely informative tools that cover a good part of the informational demands that a business might claim, described here.
