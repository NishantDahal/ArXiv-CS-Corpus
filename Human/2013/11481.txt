Chapter 10: Algebraic Algorithms

Our Chapter in the upcoming Volume I: Computer Science and Software Engineering of Computing Handbook (Third edition), Allen Tucker, Teo Gonzales and Jorge L. Diaz-Herrera, editors, covers Algebraic Algorithms, both symbolic and numerical, for matrix computations and root-finding for polynomials and systems of polynomials equations. We cover part of these large subjects and include basic bibliography for further study. To meet space limitation we cite books, surveys, and comprehensive articles with pointers to further references, rather than including all the original technical papers.
