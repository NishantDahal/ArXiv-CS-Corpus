Proceedings 14th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of Infinity'12, the 14th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems, which was held in Paris, France on the 27th of August 2012 as a satellite event of FM'12. The aim of the INFINITY workshop is to provide a forum for researchers interested in the development of formal methods and algorithmic techniques for the analysis of systems with infinitely many states, and their application in automated verification of complex software and hardware systems.
