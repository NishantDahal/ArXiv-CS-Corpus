Near-optimal Binary Compressed Sensing Matrix

Compressed sensing is a promising technique that attempts to faithfully recover sparse signal with as few linear and nonadaptive measurements as possible. Its performance is largely determined by the characteristic of sensing matrix. Recently several zero-one binary sensing matrices have been deterministically constructed for their relative low complexity and competitive performance. Considering the complexity of implementation, it is of great practical interest if one could further improve the sparsity of binary matrix without performance loss. Based on the study of restricted isometry property (RIP), this paper proposes the near-optimal binary sensing matrix, which guarantees nearly the best performance with as sparse distribution as possible. The proposed near-optimal binary matrix can be deterministically constructed with progressive edge-growth (PEG) algorithm. Its performance is confirmed with extensive simulations.
