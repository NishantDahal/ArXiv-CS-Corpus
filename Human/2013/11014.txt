RIPless compressed sensing from anisotropic measurements

Compressed sensing is the art of reconstructing a sparse vector from its inner products with respect to a small set of randomly chosen measurement vectors. It is usually assumed that the ensemble of measurement vectors is in isotropic position in the sense that the associated covariance matrix is proportional to the identity matrix. In this paper, we establish bounds on the number of required measurements in the anisotropic case, where the ensemble of measurement vectors possesses a non-trivial covariance matrix. Essentially, we find that the required sampling rate grows proportionally to the condition number of the covariance matrix. In contrast to other recent contributions to this problem, our arguments do not rely on any restricted isometry properties (RIP's), but rather on ideas from convex geometry which have been systematically studied in the theory of low-rank matrix recovery. This allows for a simple argument and slightly improved bounds, but may lead to a worse dependency on noise (which we do not consider in the present paper).
