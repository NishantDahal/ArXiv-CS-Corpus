Identifying Correlated Heavy-Hitters in a Two-Dimensional Data Stream

We consider online mining of correlated heavy-hitters from a data stream. Given a stream of two-dimensional data, a correlated aggregate query first extracts a substream by applying a predicate along a primary dimension, and then computes an aggregate along a secondary dimension. Prior work on identifying heavy-hitters in streams has almost exclusively focused on identifying heavy-hitters on a single dimensional stream, and these yield little insight into the properties of heavy-hitters along other dimensions. In typical applications however, an analyst is interested not only in identifying heavy-hitters, but also in understanding further properties such as: what other items appear frequently along with a heavy-hitter, or what is the frequency distribution of items that appear along with the heavy-hitters. We consider queries of the following form: In a stream S of (x, y) tuples, on the substream H of all x values that are heavy-hitters, maintain those y values that occur frequently with the x values in H. We call this problem as Correlated Heavy-Hitters (CHH). We formulate an approximate formulation of CHH identification, and present an algorithm for tracking CHHs on a data stream. The algorithm is easy to implement and uses workspace which is orders of magnitude smaller than the stream itself. We present provable guarantees on the maximum error, as well as detailed experimental results that demonstrate the space-accuracy trade-off.
