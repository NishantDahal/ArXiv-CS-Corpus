Intensity and State Estimation in Quantum Cryptography

This paper describes how the communicating parties can employ intensity and state estimation to detect if the eavesdropper has siphoned off and injected photons in the received communication. This is of relevance in quantum cryptography based on random rotations of photon polarizations.
