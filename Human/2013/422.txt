A new approach towards the self-adaptability of Service-Oriented Architectures to the context based on workflow

Distributed information systems are needed to be autonomous, heterogeneous and adaptable to the context. This is the reason why they resort Web services based on SOA Based on the advanced technology of SOA. These technologies can evolve in a dynamic environment in a well-defined context and according to events automatically, such as time, temperature, location, authentication, etc... This is what we call self-adaptability to context. In this paper, we are interested in improving the different needs of this criterion and we propose a new approach towards a self-adaptability of SOA to the context based on workflow and showing the feasibility of this approach by integration the workflow under a platform and test this integration by a case study.
