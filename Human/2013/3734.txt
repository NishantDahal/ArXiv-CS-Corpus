Stable image reconstruction using total variation minimization

This article presents near-optimal guarantees for accurate and robust image recovery from under-sampled noisy measurements using total variation minimization. In particular, we show that from O(slog(N)) nonadaptive linear measurements, an image can be reconstructed to within the best s-term approximation of its gradient up to a logarithmic factor, and this factor can be removed by taking slightly more measurements. Along the way, we prove a strengthened Sobolev inequality for functions lying in the null space of suitably incoherent matrices.
