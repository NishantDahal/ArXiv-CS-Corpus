Sensing and Recognition When Primary User Has Multiple Power Levels

In this paper, we present a new cognitive radio (CR) scenario when the primary user (PU) operates under more than one transmit power levels. Different from the existing studies where PU is assumed to have only one constant transmit power, the new consideration well matches the practical standards, i.e., IEEE 802.11 Series, GSM, LTE, LTE-A, etc., as well as the adaptive power concept that has been studied over the past decades. The primary target in this new CR scenario is, of course, still to detect the presence of PU. However, there appears a secondary target as to identify the PU's transmit power level. Compared to the existing works where the secondary user (SU) only senses the ``on-off'' status of PU, recognizing the power level of PU achieves more ``cognition", and could be utilized to protect different powered PU with different interference levels. We derived quite many closed-form results for either the threshold expressions or the performance analysis, from which many interesting points and discussions are raised. We then further study the cooperative sensing strategy in this new cognitive scenario and show its significant difference from traditional algorithms. Numerical examples are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.
