Software Defined Radio Architecture Survey for Cognitive Testbeds

In this paper we present a survey of existing prototypes dedicated to software defined radio. We propose a classification related to the architectural organization of the pro- totypes and provide some conclusions about the most promising architectures. This study should be useful for cognitive radio testbed designers who have to choose between many possible computing platforms. We also introduce a new cognitive radio testbed currently under construction and explain how this study have influenced the test-bed designers choices.
