Statistiques et visibilité des bibliothèques numériques : quelles stratégies de diffusion ?

We compared statistics of major digital libraries and we tried to see if there is a relationship between the volume of digital libraries and online visibility of each digitized document. Finally, we analyzed the consequences of the diffusion strategies of French digital libraries. The statistics were obtained by survey, gray literature, alexa.com, and Google Trends.
