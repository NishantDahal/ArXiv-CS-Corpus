Sharp Bounds on Davenport-Schinzel Sequences of Every Order

One of the longest-standing open problems in computational geometry is to bound the lower envelope of $n$ univariate functions, each pair of which crosses at most $s$ times, for some fixed $s$. This problem is known to be equivalent to bounding the length of an order-$s$ Davenport-Schinzel sequence, namely a sequence over an $n$-letter alphabet that avoids alternating subsequences of the form $a \cdots b \cdots a \cdots b \cdots$ with length $s+2$. These sequences were introduced by Davenport and Schinzel in 1965 to model a certain problem in differential equations and have since been applied to bounding the running times of geometric algorithms, data structures, and the combinatorial complexity of geometric arrangements.
  Let $位_s(n)$ be the maximum length of an order-$s$ DS sequence over $n$ letters. What is $位_s$ asymptotically? This question has been answered satisfactorily (by Hart and Sharir, Agarwal, Sharir, and Shor, Klazar, and Nivasch) when $s$ is even or $s\le 3$. However, since the work of Agarwal, Sharir, and Shor in the mid-1980s there has been a persistent gap in our understanding of the odd orders.
  In this work we effectively close the problem by establishing sharp bounds on Davenport-Schinzel sequences of every order $s$. Our results reveal that, contrary to one's intuition, $位_s(n)$ behaves essentially like $位_{s-1}(n)$ when $s$ is odd. This refutes conjectures due to Alon et al. (2008) and Nivasch (2010).
