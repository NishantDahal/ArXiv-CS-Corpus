Parameters Optimization for Improving ASR Performance in Adverse Real World Noisy Environmental Conditions

From the existing research it has been observed that many techniques and methodologies are available for performing every step of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system, but the performance (Minimization of Word Error Recognition-WER and Maximization of Word Accuracy Rate- WAR) of the methodology is not dependent on the only technique applied in that method. The research work indicates that, performance mainly depends on the category of the noise, the level of the noise and the variable size of the window, frame, frame overlap etc is considered in the existing methods. The main aim of the work presented in this paper is to use variable size of parameters like window size, frame size and frame overlap percentage to observe the performance of algorithms for various categories of noise with different levels and also train the system for all size of parameters and category of real world noisy environment to improve the performance of the speech recognition system. This paper presents the results of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Accuracy test by applying variable size of parameters. It is observed that, it is really very hard to evaluate test results and decide parameter size for ASR performance improvement for its resultant optimization. Hence, this study further suggests the feasible and optimum parameter size using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for enhancing resultant accuracy in adverse real world noisy environmental conditions. This work will be helpful to give discriminative training of ubiquitous ASR system for better Human Computer Interaction (HCI).
