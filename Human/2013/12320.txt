An Overview of the Commercial Cloud Monitoring Tools: Research Dimensions, Design Issues, and State-of-the-Art

Cloud monitoring activity involves dynamically tracking the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters related to virtualized resources (e.g., VM, storage, network, appliances, etc.), the physical resources they share, the applications running on them and data hosted on them. Applications and resources configuration in cloud computing environment is quite challenging considering a large number of heterogeneous cloud resources. Further, considering the fact that at each point of time, there will be a different and specific cloud service which may be massively required. Hence, cloud monitoring tools can assist a cloud providers or application developers in: (i) keeping their resources and applications operating at peak efficiency; (ii) detecting variations in resource and application performance; (iii) accounting the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations of certain QoS parameters; and (iv) tracking the leave and join operations of cloud resources due to failures and other dynamic configuration changes.
  In this paper, we identify and discuss the major research dimensions and design issues related to engineering cloud monitoring tools. We further discuss how aforementioned research dimensions and design issues are handled by current academic research as well as by commercial monitoring tools.
