Object Recognition with Imperfect Perception and Redundant Description

This paper deals with a scene recognition system in a robotics contex.  The general problem is to match images with <I>a priori</I> descriptions.  A typical mission would consist in identifying an object in an installation with a vision system situated at the end of a manipulator and with a human operator provided description, formulated in a pseudo-natural language, and possibly redundant.  The originality of this work comes from the nature of the description, from the special attention given to the management of imprecision and uncertainty in the interpretation process and from the way to assess the description redundancy so as to reinforce the overall matching likelihood.
