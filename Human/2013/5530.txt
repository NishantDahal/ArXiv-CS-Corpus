New hybrid distributed voting algorithm

Increasing data volumes requires additional rating techniques. Reputation systems are the subject of much research. There are various techniques to rate content that facilitate the search of quality content. Page rank, citation index and votes from users are some rating examples. In the article I focus on decentralized vote systems. The article reviews several distributed vote designs. I list the distributed vote requirements. A new hybrid algorithm is proposed which operates in the structured overlay P2P DHT Kademlia network.
