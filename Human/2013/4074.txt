Bisimulation-Based Comparisons for Interpretations in Description Logics

We study comparisons between interpretations in description logics with respect to "logical consequences" of the form of semi-positive concepts (like semi-positive concept assertions). Such comparisons are characterized by conditions similar to the ones of bisimulations. The simplest among the considered logics is a variant of PDL (propositional dynamic logic). The others extend that logic with inverse roles, nominals, quantified number restrictions, the universal role, and/or the concept constructor for expressing the local reflexivity of a role. The studied problems are: preservation of semi-positive concepts with respect to comparisons, the Hennessy-Milner property for comparisons, and minimization of interpretations that preserves semi-positive concepts.
