Partitions of Frobenius Rings Induced by the Homogeneous Weight

The values of the homogeneous weight are determined for finite Frobenius rings that are a direct product of local Frobenius rings. This is used to investigate the partition induced by this weight and its dual partition under character-theoretic dualization. A characterization is given of those rings for which the induced partition is reflexive or even self-dual.
