Beamforming for MISO Interference Channels with QoS and RF Energy Transfer

We consider a multiuser multiple-input single-output interference channel where the receivers are characterized by both quality-of-service (QoS) and radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) constraints. We consider the power splitting RF-EH technique where each receiver divides the received signal into two parts a) for information decoding and b) for battery charging. The minimum required power that supports both the QoS and the RF-EH constraints is formulated as an optimization problem that incorporates the transmitted power and the beamforming design at each transmitter as well as the power splitting ratio at each receiver. We consider both the cases of fixed beamforming and when the beamforming design is incorporated into the optimization problem. For fixed beamforming we study three standard beamforming schemes, the zero-forcing (ZF), the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) and the maximum ratio transmission (MRT); a hybrid scheme, MRT-ZF, comprised of a linear combination of MRT and ZF beamforming is also examined. The optimal solution for ZF beamforming is derived in closed-form, while optimization algorithms based on second-order cone programming are developed for MRT, RZF and MRT-ZF beamforming to solve the problem. In addition, the joint-optimization of beamforming and power allocation is studied using semidefinite programming (SDP) with the aid of rank relaxation.
