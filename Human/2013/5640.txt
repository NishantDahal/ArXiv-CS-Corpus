Upgraded Approximation of Non-Binary Alphabets for Polar Code Construction

An algorithm is presented for approximating a single-user channel with a prime input alphabet size. The result is an upgraded version of the channel with a reduced output alphabet size. It is shown that this algorithm can be used to reduce the output alphabet size to the input alphabet size in most cases.
