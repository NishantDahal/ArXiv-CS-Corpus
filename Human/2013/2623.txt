Evaluating Reputation Systems for Agent Mediated e-Commerce

Agent mediated e-commerce involves buying and selling on Internet through software agents. The success of an agent mediated e-commerce system lies in the underlying reputation management system which is used to improve the quality of services in e-market environment. A reputation system encourages the honest behaviour of seller agents and discourages the malicious behaviour of dishonest seller agents in the e-market where actual traders never meet each other. This paper evaluates various reputation systems for assigning reputation rating to software agents acting on behalf of buyers and sellers in e-market. These models are analysed on the basis of a number of features viz. reputation computation and their defence mechanisms against different attacks. To address the problems of traditional reputation systems which are relatively static in nature, this paper identifies characteristics of a dynamic reputation framework which ensures judicious use of information sharing for inter-agent cooperation and also associates the reputation of an agent with the value of a transaction so that the market approaches an equilibrium state and dishonest agents are weeded out of the market.
