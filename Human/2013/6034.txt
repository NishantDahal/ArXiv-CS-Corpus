On Investigating EMD Parameters to Search for Gravitational Waves

The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is a novel, adaptive approach to time series analysis. It does not impose a basis set on the data or otherwise make assumptions about the data form, and so the time--frequency decomposition is not limited by spreading due to uncertainty. Because of the high resolution of the time--frequency, we investigate the possibility of the application of the HHT to the search for gravitational waves. It is necessary to determine some parameters in the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is a component of the HHT, and in this paper we propose and demonstrate a method to determine the optimal values of the parameters to use in the search for gravitational waves.
