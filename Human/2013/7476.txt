Supporting Therapeutic Relationships and Communication about Mental Health

Effective communication and strong therapeutic relationships are critical to successful mental health interventions. For example, in 1957 Carl Rogers, a pioneer of person-centred therapy, proposed that an empowering relationship could, in and of itself, create the necessary and sufficient conditions for positive therapeutic outcomes [1]. Whilst modern psychological theories no longer favour an exclusive focus on relationships, positive relationships and the dynamics of client-therapist communication remain cornerstones of mental health intervention theories. A more recent meta-review concluded that across all interventions models, irrespective of the theoretical approach, the quality of the relationship between therapists and clients is the second leading determinant of successful clinical outcomes [2]. Over the past ten years we (David Coyle and Gavin Doherty) have designed and evaluated a wide range to systems that provide support for psychological (or talk- based) mental health interventions [3]. Here we briefly consider two recent examples. In each case our aim was to enhance communication and reshape clinical practice in a manner that empowers patients. gNats Island is a computer game that supports face-to-face interventions for adolescents [4]. MindBalance is an online treatment programme for adults experiencing difficulties with depression [5].
