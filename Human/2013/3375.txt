Joint Ultra-wideband and Signal Strength-based Through-building Tracking for Tactical Operations

Accurate device free localization (DFL) based on received signal strength (RSS) measurements requires placement of radio transceivers on all sides of the target area. Accuracy degrades dramatically if sensors do not surround the area. However, law enforcement officers sometimes face situations where it is not possible or practical to place sensors on all sides of the target room or building. For example, for an armed subject barricaded in a motel room, police may be able to place sensors in adjacent rooms, but not in front of the room, where the subject would see them. In this paper, we show that using two ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radios, in addition to multiple RSS sensors, improves the localization accuracy, particularly on the axis where no sensors are placed (which we call the x-axis). We introduce three methods for combining the RSS and UWB data. By using UWB radios together with RSS sensors, it is still possible to localize a person through walls even when the devices are placed only on two sides of the target area. Including the data from the UWB radios can reduce the localization area of uncertainty by more than 60%.
