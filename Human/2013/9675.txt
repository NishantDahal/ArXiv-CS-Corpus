Advances in the Logical Representation of Lexical Semantics

The integration of lexical semantics and pragmatics in the analysis of the meaning of natural lan- guage has prompted changes to the global framework derived from Montague. In those works, the original lexicon, in which words were assigned an atomic type of a single-sorted logic, has been re- placed by a set of many-facetted lexical items that can compose their meaning with salient contextual properties using a rich typing system as a guide. Having related our proposal for such an expanded framework \LambdaTYn, we present some recent advances in the logical formalisms associated, including constraints on lexical transformations and polymorphic quantifiers, and ongoing discussions and research on the granularity of the type system and the limits of transitivity.
