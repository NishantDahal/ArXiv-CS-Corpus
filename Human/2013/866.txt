Algebraic Semantics of Similarity-Based Bitten Rough Set Theory

We develop two algebraic semantics for bitten rough set theory (\cite{SW}) over similarity spaces and their abstract granular versions. Connections with choice based generalized rough semantics developed in \cite{AM69} by the present author and general cover based rough set theories are also considered.
