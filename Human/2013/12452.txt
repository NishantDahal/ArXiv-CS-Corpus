Counting Triangulations and other Crossing-free Structures via Onion Layers

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. A crossing-free structure on $P$ is a plane graph with vertex set $P$. Examples of crossing-free structures include triangulations of $P$, spanning cycles of $P$, also known as polygonalizations of $P$, among others. In this paper we develop a general technique for computing the number of crossing-free structures of an input set $P$. We apply the technique to obtain algorithms for computing the number of triangulations, matchings, and spanning cycles of $P$. The running time of our algorithms is upper bounded by $n^{O(k)}$, where $k$ is the number of onion layers of $P$. In particular, for $k = O(1)$ our algorithms run in polynomial time. In addition, we show that our algorithm for counting triangulations is never slower than $O^{*}(3.1414^{n})$, even when $k = Θ(n)$. Given that there are several well-studied configurations of points with at least $Ω(3.464^{n})$ triangulations, and some even with $Ω(8^{n})$ triangulations, our algorithm asymptotically outperforms any enumeration algorithm for such instances. In fact, it is widely believed that any set of $n$ points must have at least $Ω(3.464^{n})$ triangulations. If this is true, then our algorithm is strictly sub-linear in the number of triangulations counted. We also show that our techniques are general enough to solve the "Restricted-Triangulation-Counting-Problem", which we prove to be $W[2]$-hard in the parameter $k$. This implies a "no free lunch" result: In order to be fixed-parameter tractable, our general algorithm must rely on additional properties that are specific to the considered class of structures.
