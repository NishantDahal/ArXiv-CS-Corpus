Maximum Coverage and Maximum Connected Covering in Social Networks with Partial Topology Information

Viral marketing campaigns seek to recruit the most influential individuals to cover the largest target audience. This can be modeled as the well-studied maximum coverage problem. There is a related problem when the recruited nodes are connected. It is called the maximum connected cover problem. This problem ensures a strong coordination between the influential nodes which are the backbone of the marketing campaign. In this work, we are interested on both of these problems. Most of the related literature assumes knowledge about the topology of the network. Even in that case, the problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we propose heuristics to the maximum connected cover problem and the maximum coverage problem with different knowledge levels about the topology of the network. We quantify the difference between these heuristics and the local and global greedy algorithms.
