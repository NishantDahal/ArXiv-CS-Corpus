An Evaluation of Two Alternatives to Minimax

In the field of Artificial Intelligence, traditional approaches to choosing moves in games involve the we of the minimax algorithm. However, recent research results indicate that minimizing may not always be the best approach. In this paper we summarize the results of some measurements on several model games with several different evaluation functions. These measurements, which are presented in detail in [NPT], show that there are some new algorithms that can make significantly better use of evaluation function values than the minimax algorithm does.
