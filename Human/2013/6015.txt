Combinatorial method of polynomial expansion of symmetric Boolean functions

A novel polynomial expansion method of symmetric Boolean functions is described. The method is efficient for symmetric Boolean function with small set of valued numbers and has the linear complexity for elementary symmetric Boolean functions, while the complexity of the known methods for this class of functions is quadratic. The proposed method is based on the consequence of the combinatorial Lucas theorem.
