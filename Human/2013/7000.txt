Policy as Types

Drossopoulou and Noble argue persuasively for the need for a means to express policy in object-capability-based systems. We investigate a practical means to realize their aim via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Specifically, we investigate representing policy as types in a behavioral type system for the RHO-calculus, a reflective higher-order variant of the pi-calculus.
