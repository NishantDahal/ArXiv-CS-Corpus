Nonasymptotic Probability Bounds for Fading Channels Exploiting Dedekind Zeta Functions

In this paper, new probability bounds are derived for algebraic lattice codes. This is done by using the Dedekind zeta functions of the algebraic number fields involved in the lattice constructions. In particular, it is shown how to upper bound the error performance of a finite constellation on a Rayleigh fading channel and the probability of an eavesdropper's correct decision in a wiretap channel. As a byproduct, an estimate of the number of elements with a certain algebraic norm within a finite hyper-cube is derived. While this type of estimates have been, to some extent, considered in algebraic number theory before, they are now brought into novel practice in the context of fading channel communications. Hence, the interest here is in small-dimensional lattices and finite constellations rather than in the asymptotic behavior.
