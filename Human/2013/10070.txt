About Summarization in Large Fuzzy Databases

Moved by the need increased for modeling of the fuzzy data, the success of the systems of exact generation of summary of data, we propose in this paper, a new approach of generation of summary from fuzzy data called Fuzzy-SaintEtiQ. This approach is an extension of the SaintEtiQ model to support the fuzzy data. It presents the following optimizations such as 1) the minimization of the expert risk; 2) the construction of a more detailed and more precise summaries hierarchy, and 3) the co-operation with the user by giving him fuzzy summaries in different hierarchical levels
