Universal Cycles for Weak Orders

Universal cycles are generalizations of de Bruijn cycles and Gray codes that were introduced originally by Chung, Diaconis, and Graham in 1990. They have been developed by many authors since, for various combinatorial objects such as strings, subsets, permutations, partitions, vector spaces, and designs. One generalization of universal cycles, which require almost complete overlap of consecutive words, is s-overlap cycles, which relax such a constraint. In this paper we study weak orders, which are relations that are transitive and complete. We prove the existence of universal and s-overlap cycles for weak orders, as well as for fixed height and/or weight weak orders, and apply the results to cycles for ordered partitions as well.
