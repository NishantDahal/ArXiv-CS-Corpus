On Consistency of Operational Transformation Approach

The Operational Transformation (OT) approach, used in many collaborative editors, allows a group of  users to concurrently update replicas of a shared object and exchange their updates in any order.  The basic idea of this approach is to transform any received update operation before its execution  on a replica of the object. This transformation aims to ensure the convergence of the different replicas  of the object, even though the operations are executed in different orders. However, designing transformation  functions for achieving convergence is a critical and challenging issue. Indeed, the transformation  functions proposed in the literature are all revealed incorrect.
  In this paper, we investigate the existence of transformation functions for a shared string altered by insert and delete operations. From the theoretical point of view, two properties - named TP1 and TP2 - are necessary and sufficient to ensure convergence. Using controller synthesis technique, we show that there are some transformation functions which satisfy only TP1 for the basic signatures of insert and delete operations. As a matter of fact, it is impossible to meet both properties TP1 and TP2 with these simple signatures.
