Classical Encryption and Authentication under Quantum Attacks

Post-quantum cryptography studies the security of classical, i.e. non-quantum cryptographic protocols against quantum attacks. Until recently, the considered adversaries were assumed to use quantum computers and behave like classical adversaries otherwise. A more conservative approach is to assume that also the communication between the honest parties and the adversary is (partly) quantum. We discuss several options to define secure encryption and authentication against these stronger adversaries who can carry out 'superposition attacks'. We re-prove a recent result of Boneh and Zhandry, stating that a uniformly random function (and hence also a quantum-secure pseudorandom function) can serve as a message-authentication code which is secure, even if the adversary can evaluate this function in superposition.
