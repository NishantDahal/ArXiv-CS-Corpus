Symmetries in Modal Logics

We generalize the notion of symmetries of propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form to modal formulas.  Our framework uses the coinductive models and, hence, the results apply to a wide class of modal logics including, for example, hybrid logics.  Our main result shows that the symmetries of a modal formula preserve entailment.
