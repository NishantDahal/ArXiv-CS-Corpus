Wideband Spectrum Sensing with Sub-Nyquist Sampling in Cognitive Radios

Multi-rate asynchronous sub-Nyquist sampling (MASS) is proposed for wideband spectrum sensing. Corresponding spectral recovery conditions are derived and the probability of successful recovery is given. Compared to previous approaches, MASS offers lower sampling rate, and is an attractive approach for cognitive radio networks.
