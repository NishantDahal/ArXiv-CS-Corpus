Inventions on Keyboard Illumination - A TRIZ Based Analysis

The conventional computers are not usable in dark, as the user cannot see the keyboard to operate properly. But there are many situations where the user may like to work on his computer under low light conditions, such as, during nights, while traveling in flights/ trains having low lights, working in the garden during evening etc. So it is necessary to provide some light to the laptop to operate the keyboard under low light situations.
  Luminescence of the keyboard is a desirable feature for portable computers. There may be several methods to illuminate the keyboard, the most crude may be carrying an external light and fixing at a point where it can light the keyboard. But solutions like this are not very convenient. The inventors have been looking for better solutions. This article analyses 6 patents on keyboard illumination.
  A good illumination system do not consume more battery, do not increase the size and weight of the laptop, do not increase heat inside the laptop box, and do not cost much to manufacture. The light should uniformly illuminate the whole keyboard and should not throw light on other areas that are not required.
