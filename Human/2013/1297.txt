Generation of Biometric key for use in DES

Cryptography is an important field in the area of data encryption. There are different cryptographic techniques available varying from the simplest to complex. One of the complex symmetric key cryptography techniques is using Data Encryption Standard Algorithm. This paper explores a unique approach to generation of key using fingerprint. The generated key is used as an input key to the DES Algorithm
