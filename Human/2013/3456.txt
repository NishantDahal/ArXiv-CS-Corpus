Indian Sign Language Recognition Using Eigen Value Weighted Euclidean Distance Based Classification Technique

Sign Language Recognition is one of the most growing fields of research today. Many new techniques have been developed recently in these fields. Here in this paper, we have proposed a system using Eigen value weighted Euclidean distance as a classification technique for recognition of various Sign Languages of India. The system comprises of four parts: Skin Filtering, Hand Cropping, Feature Extraction and Classification. Twenty four signs were considered in this paper, each having ten samples, thus a total of two hundred forty images was considered for which recognition rate obtained was 97 percent.
