An Efficient Authorship Protection Scheme for Shared Multimedia Content

Many electronic content providers today like Flickr and Google, offer space to users to publish their electronic media (e.g. photos and videos) in their cloud infrastructures, so that they can be publicly accessed. Features like including other information, such as keywords or owner information into the digital material is already offered by existing providers. Despite the useful features made available to users by such infrastructures, the authorship of the published content is not protected against various attacks such as compression. In this paper we propose a robust scheme that uses digital invisible watermarking and hashing to protect the authorship of the digital content and provide resistance against malicious manipulation of multimedia content. The scheme is enhanced by an algorithm called MMBEC, that is an extension of an established scheme MBEC, towards higher resistance.
