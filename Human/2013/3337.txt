Intercausal Reasoning with Uninstantiated Ancestor Nodes

Intercausal reasoning is a common inference pattern involving probabilistic dependence of causes of an observed common effect.  The sign of this dependence is captured by a qualitative property called product synergy.  The current definition of product synergy is insufficient for intercausal reasoning where there are additional uninstantiated causes of the common effect.  We propose a new definition of product synergy and prove its adequacy for intercausal reasoning with direct and indirect evidence for the common effect.  The new definition is based on a new property matrix half positive semi-definiteness, a weakened form of matrix positive semi-definiteness.
