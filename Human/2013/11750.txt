A Comparative Study on Linguistic Feature Selection in Sentiment Polarity Classification

Sentiment polarity classification is perhaps the most widely studied topic. It classifies an opinionated document as expressing a positive or negative opinion. In this paper, using movie review dataset, we perform a comparative study with different single kind linguistic features and the combinations of these features. We find that the classic topic-based classifier(Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) do not perform as well on sentiment polarity classification. And we find that with some combination of different linguistic features, the classification accuracy can be boosted a lot. We give some reasonable explanations about these boosting outcomes.
