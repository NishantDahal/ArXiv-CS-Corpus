Keyboard for inputting Chinese language

As the structure of Chinese characters are very different, it is very difficult to input Chinese characters into computer quickly and conveniently. The conventional keyboard does not support the pictorial characters in Chinese language. There are 3000 to 6000 commonly used pictorial Chinese characters (Hanzi).
  There are a few existing systems which include "PinYin" (phonetic) system, a combination of the PinYin system and character form techniques, whole character encoding, stroke input encoding, and stoke form encoding. Each of the methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. This article describes two inventions on inputting Chinese language through a standard keyboard.
