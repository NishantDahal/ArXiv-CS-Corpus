Normalization and the Representation of Nonmonotonic Knowledge in the Theory of Evidence

We discuss the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. We introduce a concept of monotonicity which is related to the diminution of the range between belief and plausibility. We show that the accumulation of knowledge in this framework exhibits a nonmonotonic property. We show how the belief structure can be used to represent typical or commonsense knowledge.
