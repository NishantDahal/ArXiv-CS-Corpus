Performance comparison of IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11n in the presence of interference from 802.15.4 networks

In this paper we compare the packet error rate (PER) and maximum throughput of IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11g under interference from IEEE 802.15.4 by using MATLAB to simulate the IEEE PHY for 802.11n and 802.11g networks.
