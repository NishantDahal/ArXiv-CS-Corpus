Understanding the Benefits of Open Access in Femtocell Networks: Stochastic Geometric Analysis in the Uplink

We introduce a comprehensive analytical framework to compare between open access and closed access in two-tier femtocell networks, with regard to uplink interference and outage. Interference at both the macrocell and femtocell levels is considered. A stochastic geometric approach is employed as the basis for our analysis. We further derive sufficient conditions for open access and closed access to outperform each other in terms of the outage probability, leading to closed-form expressions to upper and lower bound the difference in the targeted received power between the two access modes. Simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the analytical model and the correctness of the bounds.
