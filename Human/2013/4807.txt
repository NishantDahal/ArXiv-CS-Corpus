Autocorrelations of Binary Sequences and Run Structure

We analyze the connection between the autocorrelation of a binary sequence and its run structure given by the run length encoding. We show that both the periodic and the aperiodic autocorrelation of a binary sequence can be formulated in terms of the run structure. The run structure is given by the consecutive runs of the sequence. Let C=(C(0), C(1),...,C(n)) denote the autocorrelation vector of a binary sequence. We prove that the kth component of the second order difference operator of C can be directly calculated by using the consecutive runs of total length k. In particular this shows that the kth autocorrelation is already determined by all consecutive runs of total length L<k. In the aperiodic case we show how the run vector R can be efficiently calculated and give a characterization of skew-symmetric sequences in terms of their run length encoding.
