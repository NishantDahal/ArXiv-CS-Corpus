Modulation Coding for Flash Memories

The aggressive scaling down of flash memories has threatened data reliability since the scaling down of cell sizes gives rise to more serious degradation mechanisms such as cell-to-cell interference and lateral charge spreading. The effect of these mechanisms has pattern dependency and some data patterns are more vulnerable than other ones. In this paper, we will categorize data patterns taking into account degradation mechanisms and pattern dependency. In addition, we propose several modulation coding schemes to improve the data reliability by transforming original vulnerable data patterns into more robust ones.
