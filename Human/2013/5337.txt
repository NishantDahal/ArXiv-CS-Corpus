A Heuristic Approach for Web-Service Discovery and Selection

In today's businesses, service-oriented architectures represent the main paradigm for IT infrastructures. Indeed, the emergence of Internet made it possible to set up an exploitable environment to distribute applications on a large scale, and this, by adapting the notion of "service". With the integration of this paradigm in Business to Business Domain (B2B), the number of web services becomes very significant. Due to this increase, the discovery and selection of web services meeting customer requirement become a very difficult operation. Further, QoS properties must be taking into account in the web service selection. Moreover, with the significant number of web service, necessary time for the discovery of a service will be rather long. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a new heuristic method called "Bees Algorithm" inspired from honey bees behavior. We use this technique of optimization in order to discover appropriate web services, meeting customer requirements, in least time and taking into account the QoS properties.
