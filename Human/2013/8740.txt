Efficiency of Entanglement Concentration by Photon Subtraction

We introduce a measure of efficiency for the photon subtraction protocol aimed at entanglement concentration on a single copy of bipartite continuous variable state. We then show that iterating the protocol does not lead to higher efficiency than a single application. In order to overcome this limit we present an adaptive version of the protocol able to greatly enhance its efficiency.
