Phase Retrieval via Structured Modulations in Paley-Wiener Spaces

This paper considers the recovery of continuous time signals from the magnitude of its samples. It uses a combination of structured modulation and oversampling and provides sufficient conditions on the signal and the sampling system such that signal recovery is possible. In particular, it is shown that an average sampling rate of four times the Nyquist rate is sufficient to reconstruct a signal from its magnitude measurements.
