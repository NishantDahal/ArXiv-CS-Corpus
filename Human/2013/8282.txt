Compressive Sampling for the Packet Loss Recovery in Audio Multimedia Streaming

The aim of this paper is to introduce a new schema, based on a Compressive Sampling technique, for the recovery of lost data in multimedia streaming. The audio streaming data are encapsuled in different packets by using an interleaving technique. The Compressive Sampling technique is used to recover audio information in case of lost packets. Experimental results are presented on speech and musical audio signals to illustrate the performances and the capabilities of the proposed methodology.
