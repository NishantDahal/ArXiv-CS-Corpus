Complexity Analysis in Presence of Control Operators and Higher-Order Functions (Long Version)

A polarized version of Girard, Scedrov and Scott's Bounded Linear Logic is introduced and its normalization properties studied. Following Laurent, the logic naturally gives rise to a type system for the lambda-mu-calculus, whose derivations reveal bounds on the time complexity of the underlying term. This is the first example of a type system for the lambda-mu-calculus guaranteeing time complexity bounds for typable programs.
