Determination, Calculation and Representation of the Upper and Lower Sealing Zones During Virtual Stenting of Aneurysms

In this contribution, a novel method for stent simulation in preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) acquisitions of patients is presented where the sealing zones are automatically calculated and visualized. The method is eligible for non-bifurcated and bifurcated stents (Y-stents). Results of the proposed stent simulation with an automatic calculation of the sealing zones for specific diseases (abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), iliac aneurysms) are presented. The contribution is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed approach. In Section 3, experimental results are discussed. Section 4 concludes the contribution and outlines areas for future work.
