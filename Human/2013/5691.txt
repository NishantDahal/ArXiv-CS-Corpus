Repairing Multiple Failures in the Suh-Ramchandran Regenerating Codes

Using the idea of interference alignment, Suh and Ramchandran constructed a class of minimum-storage regenerating codes which can repair one systematic or one parity-check node with optimal repair bandwidth. With the same code structure, we show that in addition to single node failure, double node failures can be repaired collaboratively with optimal repair bandwidth as well. We give an example of how to repair double failures in the Suh-Ramchandran regenerating code with six nodes, and give the proof for the general case.
