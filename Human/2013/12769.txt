Load Balancing using Ant Colony in Cloud Computing

Ants are very small insects.They are capable to find food even they are complete blind. The ants lives in their nest and their job is to search food while they get hungry. We are not interested in their living style, such as how they live, how they sleep. But we are interested in how they search for food, and how they find the shortest path. The technique for finding the shortest path are now applying in cloud computing. The Ant Colony approach towards Cloud Computing gives better performance.
