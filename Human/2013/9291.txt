Measuring the Success of Software Process Improvement: The Dimensions

Quality managers, change agents and researchers are often troubled in defining and demonstrating the level of success achieved in software process improvement (SPI) initiatives. So far, there exist only few frameworks for identifying the level of success achieved in SPI. Analysis shows that these frameworks do not provide a comprehensive view from all relevant stakeholders involved in SPI. Early results from an ongoing research effort to discover and operationalise success dimensions are reported. Adapted from the project management literature it is suggested that five dimensions characterise the level of success achieved in SPI: (1) project efficiency, (2) impact on the process user, (3) business success, (4) direct operational success and (5) process improvement fit. Results from an empirical analysis are reported where 23 change agents evaluated the relative level of importance of each dimension. Early results indicate that change agents valued the process user satisfaction the most and the process improvement fit the least. This finding confirms the need of having various stakeholders and dimensions acknowledged in a framework that is used to measure the overall success of an SPI initiative.
