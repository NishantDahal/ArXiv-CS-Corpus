Enabling Self-Powered Autonomous Wireless Sensors with New-Generation I2C-RFID Chips

A self-powered autonomous RFID device with sensing and computing capabilities is presented in this paper. Powered by an RF energy-harvesting circuit enhanced by a DC-DC voltage booster in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, the device relies on a microcontroller and a new generation I2C-RFID chip to wirelessly deliver sensor data to standard RFID EPC Class-1 Generation-2 (Gen2) readers. When the RF power received from the interrogating reader is -14 dBm or higher, the device, fabricated on an FR4 substrate using low-cost discrete components, is able to produce 2.4-V DC voltage to power its circuitry. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the device to perform reliable sensor data transmissions up to 5 meters in fully-passive mode. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the longest read range ever reported for passive UHF RFID sensors compliant with the EPC Gen2 standard.
