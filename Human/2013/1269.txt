Finding overlapping communities in networks using evolutionary method

Community structure is a typical property of many real-world networks, and has become a key to understand the dynamics of the networked systems. In these networks most nodes apparently lie in a community while there often exists a few nodes straddling several communities. An ideal algorithm for community detection is preferable which can identify the overlapping communities in such networks. To represent an overlapping division we develop a encoding schema composed of two segments, the first one represents a disjoint partition and the second one represents a extension of the partition that allows of multiple memberships. We give a measure for the informativeness of a node, and present an evolutionary method for detecting the overlapping communities in a network.
