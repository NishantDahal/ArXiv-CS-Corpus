PeerShare: A System Secure Distribution of Sensitive Data Among Social Contacts

We present the design and implementation of the PeerShare, a system that can be used by applications to securely distribute sensitive data to social contacts of a user. PeerShare incorporates a generic framework that allows different applications to distribute data with different security requirements. By using interfaces available from existing popular social networks. PeerShare is designed to be easy to use for both end users as well as developers of applications. PeerShare can be used to distribute shared keys, public keys and any other data that need to be distributed with authenticity and confidentiality guarantees to an authorized set of recipients, specified in terms of social relationships. We have used \peershare already in three different applications and plan to make it available for developers.
