Opacity of Memory Management in Software Transactional Memory

Opacity of Transactional Memory is proposed to be established by incremental validation. Quiescence in terms of epoch-based memory reclamation is applied to deal with doomed transactions causing memory access violations. This method unfortunately involves increased memory consumption and does not cover reclamations outside of transactions. This paper introduces a different method which combines incremental validation with elements of sandboxing to solve these issues.
