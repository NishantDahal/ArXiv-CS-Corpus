Towards a better approximation for sparsest cut?

We give a new $(1+ε)$-approximation for sparsest cut problem on graphs where small sets expand significantly more than the sparsest cut (sets of size $n/r$ expand by a factor $\sqrt{\log n\log r}$ bigger, for some small $r$; this condition holds for many natural graph families). We give two different algorithms. One involves Guruswami-Sinop rounding on the level-$r$ Lasserre relaxation. The other is combinatorial and involves a new notion called {\em Small Set Expander Flows} (inspired by the {\em expander flows} of ARV) which we show exists in the input graph. Both algorithms run in time $2^{O(r)} \mathrm{poly}(n)$. We also show similar approximation algorithms in graphs with genus $g$ with an analogous local expansion condition. This is the first algorithm we know of that achieves $(1+ε)$-approximation on such general family of graphs.
