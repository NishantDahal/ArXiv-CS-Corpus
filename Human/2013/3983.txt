Assessment of Path Reservation in Distributed Real-Time Vehicle Guidance

In this paper we assess the impact of path reservation as an additional feature in our distributed real-time vehicle guidance protocol BeeJamA. Through our microscopic simulations we show that na√Øve reservation of links without any further measurements is only an improvement in case of complete market penetration, otherwise it even reduces the performance of our approach based on real-time link loads. Moreover, we modified the reservation process to incorporate current travel times and show that this improves the results in our simulations when at least 40% market penetration is possible.
