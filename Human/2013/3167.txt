Work Issues in Software Engineering

Using data from a web-based survey of software developers, the author attempts to determine root causes of "death march" projects and excessive work hours in the software industry in relation to company practices and management. Special emphasis is placed on the factor of business/technical supervisor background. An analysis of variance revealed significant differences between these supervisor groups with regard to a "Pointy-Haired Boss" (PHB) sentiment index. This difference, combined with correlations between the PHB index and the endpoints of project failure and use of software engineering practices, indicate some disparity in the suitability of businessbackground supervisors to manage software development projects compared with their technical-background counterparts. Other survey data points to improved project management skills as the biggest necessity for supervisors in the business-background group.
