The Disclosure of University Research for Third Parties: A Non-Market Perspective on an Italian University

Nations, universities, and regional governments commit resources to promote the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge. One focuses on knowledge-based innovations and the economic function of the university in terms of technology transfer, intellectual property, university-industry-government relations, etc. Faculties other than engineering or applied sciences, however, may not be able to recognize opportunities in this "linear model" of technology transfer. We elaborate a non-market perspective on the third mission in terms of disclosure of the knowledge and areas of expertise available for disclosure to other audiences at a provincial university. The use of ICT can enhance communication between actors on the supply and demand sides. Using an idea originally developed in the context of the Dutch science shops, the university staff was questionnaired about keywords and areas of expertise with the specific purpose of disclosing this information to audiences other than academic colleagues. The results were brought online in a thesaurus-like structure that enables users to access the university at the level of individual email address. This model stimulates variation on both the supply and demand side of the innovation process, and strengthens the accessibility and embeddedness of the knowledge base in a regional economy.
