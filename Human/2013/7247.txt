Homology and Bisimulation of Asynchronous Transition Systems and Petri Nets

Homology groups of labelled asynchronous transition systems and Petri nets are introduced. Examples of computing the homology groups are given. It is proved that if labelled asynchronous transition systems are bisimulation equivalent, then they have isomorphic homology groups. A method of constructing a Petri net with given homology groups is found.
