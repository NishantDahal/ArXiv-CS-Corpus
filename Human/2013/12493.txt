Post-Quantum Cryptography: Code-based Signatures

This survey provides a comparative overview of code-based signature schemes with respect to security and performance. Furthermore, we explicitly describe serveral code-based signature schemes with additional properties such as identity-based, threshold ring and blind signatures.
