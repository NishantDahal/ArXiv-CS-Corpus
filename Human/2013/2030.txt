On the Fundamental Feedback-vs-Performance Tradeoff over the MISO-BC with Imperfect and Delayed CSIT

This work considers the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC), where a transmitter with M antennas transmits information to K single-antenna users, and where - as expected - the quality and timeliness of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is imperfect. Motivated by the fundamental question of how much feedback is necessary to achieve a certain performance, this work seeks to establish bounds on the tradeoff between degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance and CSIT feedback quality. Specifically, this work provides a novel DoF region outer bound for the general K-user MISO BC with partial current CSIT, which naturally bridges the gap between the case of having no current CSIT (only delayed CSIT, or no CSIT) and the case with full CSIT. The work then characterizes the minimum CSIT feedback that is necessary for any point of the sum DoF, which is optimal for the case with M >= K, and the case with M=2, K=3.
