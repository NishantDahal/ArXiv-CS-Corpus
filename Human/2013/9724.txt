Multiparameter Monitoring and Fault Indication Using Inductive Power Transfer System

The paper aims at demonstrating communication capabilities of IPT. For this data communication is performed between two modules using the concept of IPT. IPT was deemed to be the best solution to the system houses a multi parameter acquisition module such as temperature, speed, voltage, current and data transfer from the motor. The receiver side is another microcontroller coupled to an inductive coil that gets the data and displays in the LCD. A brief background to IPT Inductive Power Transfer technology and its applications is given and the design criteria for the paper are defined in detail. To be accurate, IPT data communication helps to reduce unnecessary wire connections and data is transmitted without any touch. Further the paper can be enhanced by looking for fault analysis inside the motor. This can be done by analyzing various parameters of the motor. A novel two-way IPT communication system was designed, which worked on the concept of pulsing the system on and off to send data serially. The paper involves transmission of data through inductive flux without any contact between the two modules. Further as no frequency tunings or any calibration is required between different modules a single system can be used with multiple clients. This reduces a lot of hazards such as interference with other modules and RF transmitters in the vicinity.
