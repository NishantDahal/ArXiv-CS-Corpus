Major Limitations of Satellite images

Remote sensing has proven to be a powerful tool for the monitoring of the Earth surface to improve our perception of our surroundings has led to unprecedented developments in sensor and information technologies. However, technologies for effective use of the data and for extracting useful information from the data of Remote sensing are still very limited since no single sensor combines the optimal spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. This paper briefly reviews the limitations of satellite remote sensing. Also, reviews on the problems of image fusion techniques. The conclusion of this, According to literature, the remote sensing is still the lack of software tools for effective information extraction from remote sensing data. The trade-off in spectral and spatial resolution will remain and new advanced data fusion approaches are needed to make optimal use of remote sensors for extract the most useful information.
