Methods have been used for identification of human by recognizing lip prints. Human lips have a number of elevation and depressions features called lip prints and examination of lip prints is referred to as cheiloscopy. Lip prints of each human being are unique in nature like many others features of human. In this paper lip print is first smoothened using a Gaussian Filter. Next Sobel Edge Detector and Canny Edge Detector are used to detect the vertical and horizontal groove pattern in the lip. This method of identification will be useful both in criminal forensics and personal identification. It is our assumption that study of lip prints and their types are well connected to play a song in a better way that are well accepted to people who loves to hear songs.
