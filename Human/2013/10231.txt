Extreme Scaling of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics

As the complexity and size of challenges in science and engineering are continually increasing, it is highly important that applications are able to scale strongly to very large numbers of cores (>100,000 cores) to enable HPC systems to be utilised efficiently. This paper presents results of strong scaling tests performed with an MPI only and a hybrid MPI + OpenMP version of the Lattice QCD application BQCD on the European Tier-0 system SuperMUC at LRZ.
