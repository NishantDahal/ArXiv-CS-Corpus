On dually flat $(α,β)$-metrics

In this paper, I will show how to use $β$-deformations to deal with dual flatness of $(α,β)$-metrics. It is a natural continuation of the research on dually flat Randers metrics(see arxiv:1209.1150). $β$-deformations is a new method in Riemann-Finsler geometry, it is introduced by the author(see arxiv:1209.0845).
