Propagation of 2-Monotone Lower Probabilities on an Undirected Graph

Lower and upper probabilities, also known as Choquet capacities, are widely used as a convenient representation for sets of probability distributions.  This paper presents a graphical decomposition and exact propagation algorithm for computing marginal posteriors of 2-monotone lower probabilities (equivalently, 2-alternating upper probabilities).
