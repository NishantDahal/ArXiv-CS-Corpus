Validated Real Time Middle Ware For Distributed Cyber Physical Systems Using HMM

Distributed Cyber Physical Systems designed for different scenario must be capable enough to perform in an efficient manner in every situation. Earlier approaches, such as CORBA, has performed but with different time constraints. Therefore, there was the need to design reconfigurable, robust, validated and consistent real time middle ware systems with end-to-end timing. In the DCPS-HMM we have proposed the processor efficiency and data validation which may proof crucial in implementing various distributed systems such as credit card systems or file transfer through network.
