A Multiscale Sub-linear Time Fourier Algorithm for Noisy Data

We extend the recent sparse Fourier transform algorithm of (Lawlor, Christlieb, and Wang, 2013) to the noisy setting, in which a signal of bandwidth N is given as a superposition of k << N frequencies and additive noise. We present two such extensions, the second of which exhibits a novel form of error-correction in its frequency estimation not unlike that of the beta-encoders in analog-to-digital conversion (Daubechies et al, 2006). The algorithm runs in time O(k log(k) log(N/k)) on average, provided the noise is not overwhelming. The error-correction property allows the algorithm to outperform FFTW, a highly optimized software package for computing the full discrete Fourier transform, over a wide range of sparsity and noise values, and is to the best of our knowledge novel in the sparse Fourier transform context.
