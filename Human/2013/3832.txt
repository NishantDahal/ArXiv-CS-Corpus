MDMP: Managed Data Message Passing

MDMP is a new parallel programming approach that aims to provide users with an easy way to add parallelism to programs, optimise the message passing costs of traditional scientific simulation algorithms, and enable existing MPI-based parallel programs to be optimised and extended without requiring the whole code to be re-written from scratch. MDMP utilises a directives based approach to enable users to specify what communications should take place in the code, and then implements those communications for the user in an optimal manner using both the information provided by the user and data collected from instrumenting the code and gathering information on the data to be communicated. This work will present the basic concepts and functionality of MDMP and discuss the performance that can be achieved using our prototype implementation of MDMP on some model scientific simulation applications.
