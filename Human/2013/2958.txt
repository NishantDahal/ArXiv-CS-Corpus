On whether and how D-RISC and Microgrids can be kept relevant (self-assessment report)

This report lays flat my personal views on D-RISC and Microgrids as of March 2013. It reflects the opinions and insights that I have gained from working on this project during the period 2008-2013. This report is structed in two parts: deconstruction and reconstruction. In the deconstruction phase, I review what I believe are the fundamental motivation and goals of the D-RISC/Microgrids enterprise, and identify what I judge are shortcomings: that the project did not deliver on its expectations, that fundamental questions are left unanswered, and that its original motivation may not even be relevant in scientific research any more in this day and age. In the reconstruction phase, I start by identifying the merits of the current D-RISC/Microgrids technology and know-how taken at face value, re-motivate its existence from a different angle, and suggest new, relevant research questions that could justify continued scientific investment.
