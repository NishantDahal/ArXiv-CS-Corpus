A Nobel Defence Scheme Against Selfish Node Attack in MANET

Security is one of the major issue in wired and wireless network but due to the presence of centralized administration not difficult to find out misbehavior in network other than in Mobile Ad hoc Network due to the absence of centralized management and frequently changes in topology security is one of a major issue in MANET. Only prevention methods for attack are not enough. In this paper a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) algorithm has proposed against selfish node attack to secure MANET. Here the behavior of selfish node is unnecessary flooding the information in network and block all types of packets transferring between the reliable nodes. Proposed IDS Algorithm identifies the behavior of selfish node and also blocked their misbehavior activities. In case of selfish node attack network performance is almost negligible but after applying IDS on attack network performance is enhanced up to 92% and provides 0% Infection rate from attack.
