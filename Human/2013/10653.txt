Offline and Online Incentive Mechanism Design for Smart-phone Crowd-sourcing

In this paper, we consider the problem of incentive mechanism design for smart-phone crowd-sourcing. Each user participating in crowd-sourcing submits a set of tasks it can accomplish and its corresponding bid. The platform then selects the users and their payments to maximize its utility while ensuring truthfulness, individual rationality, profitability, and polynomial algorithm complexity. Both the offline and the online scenarios are considered, where in the offline case, all users submit their profiles simultaneously, while in the online case they do it sequentially, and the decision whether to accept or reject each user is done instantaneously with no revocation. The proposed algorithms for both the offline and the online case are shown to satisfy all the four desired properties of an efficient auction. Through extensive simulation, the performance of the offline and the online algorithm is also compared.
