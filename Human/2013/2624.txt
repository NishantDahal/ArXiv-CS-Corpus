Holographaic Alogorithms on Bases of Rank 2

An essential problem in the design of holographic algorithms is to decide whether the required signatures can be realized by matchgates under a suitable basis transformation (SRP). For holographic algorithms on domain size 2, [1, 2, 4, 5] have built a systematical theory. In this paper, we reduce SRP on domain size k>2 to SRP on domain size 2 for holographic algorithms on bases of rank 2. Furthermore, we generalize the collapse theorem of [3] to domain size k>2.
