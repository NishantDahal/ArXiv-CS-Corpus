On Implementing Usual Values

In many cases commonsense knowledge consists of knowledge of what is usual. In this paper we develop a system for reasoning with usual information. This system is based upon the fact that these pieces of commonsense information involve both a probabilistic aspect and a granular aspect. We implement this system with the aid of possibility-probability granules.
