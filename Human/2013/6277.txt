The MMT API: A Generic MKM System

The MMT language has been developed as a scalable representation and interchange language for formal mathematical knowledge. It permits natural representations of the syntax and semantics of virtually all declarative languages while making MMT-based MKM services easy to implement. It is foundationally unconstrained and can be instantiated with specific formal languages.
  The MMT API implements the MMT language along with multiple backends for persistent storage and frontends for machine and user access. Moreover, it implements a wide variety of MMT-based knowledge management services. The API and all services are generic and can be applied to any language represented in MMT. A plugin interface permits injecting syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies of individual formal languages.
