A Spline-based Volumetric Data Modeling Framework and Its Applications

In this dissertation, we concentrate on the challenging research issue of developing a spline-based modeling framework, which converts the conventional data (e.g., surface meshes) to tensor-product trivariate splines. This methodology can represent both boundary/volumetric geometry and real volumetric physical attributes in a compact and continuous fashion. The regular tensor-product structure enables our new developed methods to be embedded into the industry standard seamlessly. These properties make our techniques highly preferable in many physically-based applications including mechanical analysis, shape deformation and editing, virtual surgery training, etc.
