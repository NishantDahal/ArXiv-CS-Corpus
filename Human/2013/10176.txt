Knowledge, Awareness, and Bisimulation

We compare different epistemic notions in the presence of awareness of propositional variables: the logics of implicit knowledge (in which explicit knowledge is definable), explicit knowledge, and speculative knowledge. Different notions of bisimulation are suitable for these logics. We provide correspondence between bisimulation and modal equivalence on image-finite models for these logics. The logic of speculative knowledge is equally expressive as the logic of explicit knowledge, and the logic of implicit knowledge is more expressive than both. We also provide axiomatizations for the three logics -- only the one for speculative knowledge is novel. Then we move to the study of dynamics by recalling action models incorporating awareness. We show that any conceivable change of knowledge or awareness can be modelled in this setting, we give a complete axiomatization for the dynamic logic of implicit knowledge. The dynamic versions of all three logics are, surprising, equally expressive.
