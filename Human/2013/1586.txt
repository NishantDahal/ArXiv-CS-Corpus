On the Fly Self-Organized Base Station Placement

In this paper, we address the deployment of base stations (BSs) in a one-dimensional network in which the users are randomly distributed.In order to take into account the users' distribution to optimally place the BSs we optimize the uplink MMSE sum rate. Moreover, given a massive number of antennas at the BSs we propose a novel random matrix theory-based technique so as to obtain tight approximations for the MMSE sum rate in the uplink. We investigate a cooperative (CP) scenario where the BSs jointly decode the messages and a non-cooperative (NCP) scheme in which the BS can only decode its own users. Our results show that the CP strategy considerably outperforms the NCP case. Moreover, we show that there exists a trade off in the BS deployment regarding the position of each BS. Thus, through location games we can optimize the position of each BS in order to maximize the system performance.
