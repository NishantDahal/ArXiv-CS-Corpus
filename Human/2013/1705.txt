Learning Equivalence Classes of Bayesian Networks Structures

Approaches to learning Bayesian networks from data typically combine a scoring function with a heuristic search procedure.  Given a Bayesian network structure, many of the scoring functions derived in the literature return a score for the entire equivalence class to which the structure belongs.  When using such a scoring function, it is appropriate for the heuristic search algorithm to search over equivalence classes of Bayesian networks as opposed to individual structures.  We present the general formulation of a search space for which the states of the search correspond to equivalence classes of structures.  Using this space, any one of a number of heuristic search algorithms can easily be applied.  We compare greedy search performance in the proposed search space to greedy search performance in a search space for which the states correspond to individual Bayesian network structures.
