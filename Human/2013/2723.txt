Simulation of Fractional Brownian Surfaces via Spectral Synthesis on Manifolds

Using the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator we simulate fractal surfaces as random series of eigenfunctions. This approach allows us to generate random fields over smooth manifolds of arbitrary dimension, generalizing previous work with fractional Brownian motion with multi-dimensional parameter. We give examples of surfaces with and without boundary and discuss implementation.
