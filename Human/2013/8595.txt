The Need for an R&D and Upgrade Program for CMS Software and Computing

Over the next ten years, the physics reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) will be greatly extended through increases in the instantaneous luminosity of the accelerator and large increases in the amount of collected data. Due to changes in the way Moore's Law computing performance gains have been realized in the past decade, an aggressive program of R&D is needed to ensure that the computing capability of CMS will be up to the task of collecting and analyzing this data.
