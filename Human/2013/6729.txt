Upper Bounds on the Size of Grain-Correcting Codes

In this paper, we re-visit the combinatorial error model of Mazumdar et al. that models errors in high-density magnetic recording caused by lack of knowledge of grain boundaries in the recording medium. We present new upper bounds on the cardinality/rate of binary block codes that correct errors within this model.
