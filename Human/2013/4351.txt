Analysis of Citizens Acceptance for E-government Services: Applying the UTAUT Model

E-government services aims to provide citizens with more accessible, accurate, real-time and high quality services and information. Although the public sectors in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) have promoted their e-Government services for many years, its uses and achievements are few. Therefore, this paper explores the key factors of Saudi citizens acceptance through a research survey and by gathering empirical evidence based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and the Use of Technology (UTAUT). Survey Data collected from 400 respondents was examined using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique and utilized AMOS tools. The study results explored the factors that affect the acceptance of e-government services in KSA based on UTAUT model. Moreover, as a result of this study an amended UTAUT model was proposed. Such a model contributes to the discussion and development of adoption models for technology.
