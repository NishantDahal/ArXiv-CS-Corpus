Extending a Microsimulation of the Port of Dover

Modelling and simulating the traffic of heavily used but secure environments such as seaports and airports is of increasing importance. This paper discusses issues and problems that may arise when extending an existing microsimulation strategy. We also discuss how extensions of these simulations can aid planners with optimal physical and operational feedback. Conclusions are drawn about how microsimulations can be moved forward as a robust planning tool for the 21st century.
