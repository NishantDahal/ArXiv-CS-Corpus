Dipole-Loaded Monopole Optimized Using VSO, v.3

A dipole-loaded monopole antenna is optimized for uniform hemispherical coverage using VSO, a new global search design and optimization algorithm. The antenna's performance is compared to genetic algorithm and hill-climber optimized loaded monopoles, and VSO is tested against two suites of benchmark functions and several other algorithms.
