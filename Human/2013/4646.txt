Joint Optimization of Throughput and Packet Drop Rate for Delay Sensitive Applications in TDD Satellite Network Coded Systems

In this paper, we consider the issue of throughput and packet drop rate (PDR) optimization as two performance metrics for delay sensitive applications in network coded time division duplex (TDD) satellite systems with large round trip times (RTT). We adopt random linear network coding (RLNC) under two different scenarios, feedback-less and with feedback, and our goal is to jointly optimize the mean throughputs and PDRs of users in the system. For this purpose, we propose a systematic framework and start with formulating and optimizing these performance metrics for the single-user case. This framework enables us to analytically compare the performance metrics under different system parameters and settings. By comparing RLNC schemes under feedback-less and feedback scenarios for different RTTs, we show that the feedback-less schemes outperform the schemes with feedback in TDD systems with large RTTs. Then, we extend the study of feedback-less RLNC schemes to the multi-user broadcast case. Here, we consider a number of different broadcast scenarios and optimize the system parameters such that the best overall performance is achieved. Furthermore, the complicated interplay of the mean throughputs and PDRs of different users with different packet erasure conditions in each of the considered broadcast scenarios is discussed.
