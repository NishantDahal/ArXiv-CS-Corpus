A Derivation of the Asymptotic Random-Coding Prefactor

This paper studies the subexponential prefactor to the random-coding bound for a given rate. Using a refinement of Gallager's bounding techniques, an alternative proof of a recent result by AltuÄŸ and Wagner is given, and the result is extended to the setting of mismatched decoding.
