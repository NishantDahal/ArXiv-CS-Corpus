DUNE as an Example of Sustainable Open Source Scientific Software Development

In this paper we describe how DUNE, an open source scientific software framework, is developed. Having a sustainable software framework for the solution of partial differential equations is the main driver of DUNE's development. We take a look how DUNE strives to stay sustainable software.
