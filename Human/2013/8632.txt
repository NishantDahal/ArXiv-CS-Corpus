Head Gesture Recognition using Optical Flow based Classification with Reinforcement of GMM based Background Subtraction

This paper describes a technique of real time head gesture recognition system. The method includes Gaussian mixture model (GMM) accompanied by optical flow algorithm which provided us the required information regarding head movement. The proposed model can be implemented in various control system. We are also presenting the result and implementation of both mentioned method.
