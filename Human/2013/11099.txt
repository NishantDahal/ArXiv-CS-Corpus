A Proposal for the Characterization of Multi-Dimensional Inter-relationships of RDF Graphs Based on Set Theoretic Approach

In this paper a Set Theoretic approach has been reported for analyzing inter-relationship between any numbers of RDF Graphs. An RDF Graph represents triples in Resource Description Format of semantic web. So the identification and characterization of criteria for inter-relationship of RDF Graphs shows a new road in semantic search. Using set theoretic approach, a sound framing criteria can be designed that examine whether two RDF Graphs are related and if yes, how these relationships could be described with formal set theory. Along with this, by introducing RDF Schema, the inter-relationship status is refined into n-dimensional induced relationships.
