How Do We Find Early Adopters Who Will Guide a Resource Constrained Network Towards a Desired Distribution of Behaviors?

We identify influential early adopters that achieve a target behavior distribution for a resource constrained social network with multiple costly behaviors. This problem is important for applications ranging from collective behavior change to corporate viral marketing campaigns. In this paper, we propose a model of diffusion of multiple behaviors when individual participants have resource constraints. Individuals adopt the set of behaviors that maximize their utility subject to available resources. We show that the problem of influence maximization for multiple behaviors is NP-complete. Thus we propose heuristics, which are based on node degree and expected immediate adoption, to select early adopters. We evaluate the effectiveness under three metrics: unique number of participants, total number of active behaviors and network resource utilization. We also propose heuristics to distribute the behaviors amongst the early adopters to achieve a target distribution in the population. We test our approach on synthetic and real-world topologies with excellent results. Our heuristics produce 15-51\% increase in resource utilization over the na√Øve approach.
