Making simple proofs simpler

An open partition π [Cod09a, Cod09b] of a tree T is a partition of the vertices of T with the property that, for each block B of π, the upset of B is a union of blocks of π. This paper deals with the number, NP(n), of open partitions of the tree, V_n, made of two chains with n points each, that share the root.
