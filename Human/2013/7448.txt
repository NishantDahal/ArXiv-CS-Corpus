Universal truncation error upper bounds in sampling restoration

Universal (pointwise uniform and time shifted) truncation error upper bounds are presented for the Whittaker--Kotel'nikov--Shannon (WKS) sampling restoration sum for Bernstein function classes $B_{Ï€,d}^q,\, q>1,\, d\in \mathbb N$, when the decay rate of the sampled functions is unknown. The case of regular sampling is discussed. Extremal properties of related series of sinc functions are investigated.
