Software for Evaluating Relevance of Steps in Algebraic Transformations

Students of our department solve algebraic exercises in mathematical logic in a computerized environment. They construct transformations step by step and the program checks the syntax, equivalence of expressions and completion of the task. With our current project, we add a program component for checking relevance of the steps.
