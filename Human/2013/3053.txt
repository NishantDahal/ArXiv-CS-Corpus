Potential Maximal Clique Algorithms for Perfect Phylogeny Problems

Kloks, Kratsch, and Spinrad showed how treewidth and minimum-fill, NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems related to minimal triangulations, are broken into subproblems by block subgraphs defined by minimal separators. These ideas were expanded on by Bouchitté and Todinca, who used potential maximal cliques to solve these problems using a dynamic programming approach in time polynomial in the number of minimal separators of a graph. It is known that solutions to the perfect phylogeny problem, maximum compatibility problem, and unique perfect phylogeny problem are characterized by minimal triangulations of the partition intersection graph. In this paper, we show that techniques similar to those proposed by Bouchitté and Todinca can be used to solve the perfect phylogeny problem with missing data, the two- state maximum compatibility problem with missing data, and the unique perfect phylogeny problem with missing data in time polynomial in the number of minimal separators of the partition intersection graph.
