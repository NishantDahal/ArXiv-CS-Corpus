Design space exploration in the microthreaded many-core architecture

Design space exploration is commonly performed in embedded system, where the architecture is a complicated piece of engineering. With the current trend of many-core systems, design space exploration in general-purpose computers can no longer be avoided. Microgrid is a complicated architecture, and therefor we need to perform design space exploration. Generally, simulators are used for the design space exploration of an architecture. Different simulators with different levels of complexity, simulation time and accuracy are used. Simulators with little complexity, low simulation time and reasonable accuracy are desirable for the design space exploration of an architecture. These simulators are referred as high-level simulators and are commonly used in the design of embedded systems. However, the use of high-level simulation for design space exploration in general-purpose computers is a relatively new area of research.
