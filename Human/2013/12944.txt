On quadratic orbital networks

These are some informal remarks on quadratic orbital networks over finite fields. We discuss connectivity, Euler characteristic, number of cliques, planarity, diameter and inductive dimension. We find a non-trivial disconnected graph for d=3. We prove that for d=1 generators, the Euler characteristic is always non-negative and for d=2 and large enough p the Euler characteristic is negative. While for d=1, all networks are planar, we suspect that for d larger or equal to 2 and large enough prime p, all networks are non-planar. As a consequence on bounds for the number of complete sub graphs of a fixed dimension, the inductive dimension of all these networks goes 1 as p goes to infinity.
