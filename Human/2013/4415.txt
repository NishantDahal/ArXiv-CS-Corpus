Blind Interference Suppression and Power Adjustment with Alternating Optimization for Cooperative DS-CDMA Networks

This work presents blind joint interference suppression and power allocation algorithms for DS-CDMA networks with multiple relays and decode and forward protocols. A scheme for joint allocation of power levels across the relays subject to group-based power constraints and the design of linear receivers for interference suppression is proposed. A code-constrained constant modulus (CCM) design for the receive filters and the power allocation vectors is devised along with a blind channel estimator. In order to solve the proposed optimization efficiently, an alternating optimization strategy is presented with recursive least squares (RLS)-type algorithms for estimating the parameters of the receiver, the power allocation and the channels. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms obtain significant gains in capacity and performance over existing schemes.
