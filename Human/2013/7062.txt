Diffusion Least Mean P-Power Algorithms for Distributed Estimation in Alpha-Stable Noise Environments

We propose a diffusion least mean p-power (LMP) algorithm for distributed estimation in alpha stable noise environments, which is one of the widely used models that appears in various environments. Compared with the diffusion least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, better performance is obtained for the diffusion LMP methods when the noise is with alpha-stable distribution.
