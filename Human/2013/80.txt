Decentralized Minimum-Cost Repair for Distributed Storage Systems

There have been emerging lots of applications for distributed storage systems e.g., those in wireless sensor networks or cloud storage. Since storage nodes in wireless sensor networks have limited battery, it is valuable to find a repair scheme with optimal transmission costs (e.g., energy). The optimal-cost repair has been recently investigated in a centralized way. However a centralized control mechanism may not be available or is very expensive. For the scenarios, it is interesting to study optimal-cost repair in a decentralized setup. We formulate the optimal-cost repair as convex optimization problems for the network with convex transmission costs. Then we use primal and dual decomposition approaches to decouple the problem into subproblems to be solved locally. Thus, each surviving node, collaborating with other nodes, can minimize its transmission cost such that the global cost is minimized. We further study the optimality and convergence of the algorithms. Finally, we discuss the code construction and determine the field size for finding feasible network codes in our approaches.
