Computer Simulation of 3-D Finite-Volume Liquid Transport in Fibrous Materials: a Physical Model for Ink Seepage into Paper

A physical model for the simulation ink/paper interaction at the mesoscopic scale is developed. It is based on the modified Ising model, and is generalized to consider the restriction of the finite-volume of ink and also its dynamic seepage. This allows the model to obtain the ink distribution within the paper volume. At the mesoscopic scale, the paper is modeled using a discretized fiber structure. The ink distribution is obtained by solving its equivalent optimization problem, which is solved using a modified genetic algorithm, along with a new boundary condition and the quasi-linear technique. The model is able to simulate the finite-volume distribution of ink.
