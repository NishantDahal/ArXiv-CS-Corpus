Real Time Data Warehouse

Data Warehouse (DW) is an essential part of Business Intelligence. DW emerged as a fast growing reporting and analysis technique in early 1980s. Today, it has almost replaced relational databases. However, with passage of time, static and historic data of DWs could not produce Real Time reporting and analysis, thus giving a way to emerge the Idea of Real Time Data Warehouse (RTDW). Although, there are problems with RTDWs, but with advancement in technology and researchers focus, RTDWs will be able to generate real time reports, analysis and forecasting.
