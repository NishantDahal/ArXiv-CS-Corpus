Parallel Suffix Array Construction by Accelerated Sampling

A deterministic BSP algorithm for constructing the suffix array of a given string is presented, based on a technique which we call accelerated sampling. It runs in optimal O(n/p) local computation and communication, and requires a near optimal O(log log p) synchronisation steps. The algorithm provides an improvement over the synchronisation costs of existing algorithms, and reinforces the importance of the sampling technique.
