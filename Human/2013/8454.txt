Sparse Command Generator for Remote Control

In this article, we consider remote-controlled systems, where the command generator and the controlled object are connected with a bandwidth-limited communication link. In the remote-controlled systems, efficient representation of control commands is one of the crucial issues because of the bandwidth limitations of the link. We propose a new representation method for control commands based on compressed sensing. In the proposed method, compressed sensing reduces the number of bits in each control signal by representing it as a sparse vector. The compressed sensing problem is solved by an L1-L2 optimization, which can be effectively implemented with an iterative shrinkage algorithm. A design example also shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
