Rate Control Adaptation for Heterogeneous Handovers

We present enhancements to the TCP-Friendly Rate Control mechanism (TFRC) designed to better handle the intermittent connectivity occurring in mobility situations. Our aim is to quickly adapt to new network conditions and better support real-time applications for which the user-perceived quality depends on the immediate transmission rate. We propose to suspend the transmission before disconnections occur, in a way inspired by Freeze-TCP, and extend the solution by probing the network after reconnecting to enable full use of the newly available capacity.
  We first introduce a numerical model of TFRC's performance after a network handover and use it to evaluate the potential performance gains for realistic network parameters. We then describe a set of additions to TFRC to achieve these gains. Implementations within the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) for ns -2 and Linux have been adapted to support these enhancements. Comparisons of experimental results for the original and modified DCCP are presented for a number of example mobility scenarios.
  We thus show how the proposed modifications enable faster recovery after disconnected periods as well as significantly improved adjustments to the newly available network conditions and an improvement in the quality of experience (QoE) for video-streaming applications.
