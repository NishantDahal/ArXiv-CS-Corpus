Towards Structural Natural Language Formalization: Mapping Discourse to Controlled Natural Language

The author describes a conceptual study towards mapping grounded natural language discourse representation structures to instances of controlled language statements. This can be achieved via a pipeline of preexisting state of the art technologies, namely natural language syntax to semantic discourse mapping, and a reduction of the latter to controlled language discourse, given a set of previously learnt reduction rules. Concludingly a description on evaluation, potential and limitations for ontology-based reasoning is presented.
