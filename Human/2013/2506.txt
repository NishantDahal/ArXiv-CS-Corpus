Deciding Consistency of Databases Containing Defeasible and Strict Information

We propose a norm of consistency for a mixed set of defeasible and strict sentences, based on a probabilistic semantics.  This norm establishes a clear distinction between knowledge bases depicting exceptions and those containing outright contradictions.  We then define a notion of entailment based also on probabilistic considerations and provide a characterization of the relation between consistency and entailment. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency, and provide a simple decision procedure for testing consistency and deciding whether a sentence is entailed by a database.  Finally, it is shown that if al1 sentences are Horn clauses, consistency and entailment can be tested in polynomial time.
