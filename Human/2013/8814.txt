Comparison between the two definitions of AI

Two different definitions of the Artificial Intelligence concept have been proposed in papers [1] and [2]. The first definition is informal. It says that any program that is cleverer than a human being, is acknowledged as Artificial Intelligence. The second definition is formal because it avoids reference to the concept of human being. The readers of papers [1] and [2] might be left with the impression that both definitions are equivalent and the definition in [2] is simply a formal version of that in [1]. This paper will compare both definitions of Artificial Intelligence and, hopefully, will bring a better understanding of the concept.
