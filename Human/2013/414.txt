Simultaneous computation of the row and column rank profiles

Gaussian elimination with full pivoting generates a PLUQ matrix decomposition. Depending on the strategy used in the search for pivots, the permutation matrices can reveal some information about the row or the column rank profiles of the matrix. We propose a new pivoting strategy that makes it possible to recover at the same time both row and column rank profiles of the input matrix and of any of its leading sub-matrices. We propose a rank-sensitive and quad-recursive algorithm that computes the latter PLUQ triangular decomposition of an m \times n matrix of rank r in O(mnr^{ω-2}) field operations, with ωthe exponent of matrix multiplication. Compared to the LEU decomposition by Malashonock, sharing a similar recursive structure, its time complexity is rank sensitive and has a lower leading constant. Over a word size finite field, this algorithm also improveLs the practical efficiency of previously known implementations.
