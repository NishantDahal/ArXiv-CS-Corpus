Reachability in Two-Clock Timed Automata is PSPACE-complete

A recent result of Haase et al. has shown that reachability in two-clock timed automata is log-space equivalent to reachability in bounded one-counter automata. We show that reachability in bounded one-counter automata is PSPACE-complete.
