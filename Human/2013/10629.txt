First Author Advantage: Citation Labeling in Research

Citations among research papers, and the networks they form, are the primary object of study in scientometrics. The act of making a citation reflects the citer's knowledge of the related literature, and of the work being cited. We aim to gain insight into this process by studying citation keys: user-chosen labels to identify a cited work. Our main observation is that the first listed author is disproportionately represented in such labels, implying a strong mental bias towards the first author.
