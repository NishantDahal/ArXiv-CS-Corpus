Functional Package Management with Guix

We describe the design and implementation of GNU Guix, a purely functional package manager designed to support a complete GNU/Linux distribution. Guix supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and garbage collection. It builds upon the low-level build and deployment layer of the Nix package manager. Guix uses Scheme as its programming interface. In particular, we devise an embedded domain-specific language (EDSL) to describe and compose packages. We demonstrate how it allows us to benefit from the host general-purpose programming language while not compromising on expressiveness. Second, we show the use of Scheme to write build programs, leading to "two-tier" programming system.
