A novice looks at emotional cognition

Modeling emotional-cognition is in a nascent stage and therefore wide-open for new ideas and discussions. In this paper the author looks at the modeling problem by bringing in ideas from axiomatic mathematics, information theory, computer science, molecular biology, non-linear dynamical systems and quantum computing and explains how ideas from these disciplines may have applications in modeling emotional-cognition.
