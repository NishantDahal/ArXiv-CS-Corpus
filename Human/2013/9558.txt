Zahir: a Object-Oriented Framework for Computer Graphics

In this article we present Zahir, a framework for experimentation in Computer Graphics that provides a group of object-oriented base components that take care of common tasks in rendering techniques and algorithms, specially those of Non Photo-realistic Rendering (NPR). These components allow developers to implement rendering techniques and algorithms over static and animated meshes. Currently, Zahir is being used in a Master's Thesis and as support material in the undergraduate Computer Graphics course in University of Chile.
