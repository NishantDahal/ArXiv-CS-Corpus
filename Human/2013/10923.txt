Inferring Fitness in Finite Populations with Moran-like dynamics

Biological fitness is not an observable quantity and must be inferred from population dynamics. Bayesian inference applied to the Moran process and variants yields a robust inference method that can infer fitness in populations evolving via a Moran dynamic and generalizations. Information about fitness is derived solely from birth-events in birth-death and death-birth processes in which selection acts proportionally to fitness, which allows the method to be applied to populations on a network where the network itself may be changing in time. Populations may also be allowed to change size while still allowing estimates for fitness to be inferred.
