Evidential Reasoning in Image Understanding

In this paper, we present some results of evidential reasoning in understanding multispectral images of remote sensing systems. The Dempster-Shafer approach of combination of evidences is pursued to yield contextual classification results, which are compared with previous results of the Bayesian context free classification, contextual classifications of dynamic programming and stochastic relaxation approaches.
