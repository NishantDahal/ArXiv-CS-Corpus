Using Visual Aids as a Motivational Tool in Enhancing Students Interest in Reading Literary Texts

This study aims to investigate the teachers perceptions on the use of visual aids (e.g., animation videos, pictures, films and projectors) as a motivational tool in enhancing students interest in reading literary texts. To achieve the aim of the study, the mixed-method approach was used to collect the required data. Therefore, 52 English teachers from seven national secondary schools in Kapit, Sarawak, Malaysia were selected. Five of the respondents were also randomly selected for the interview. The analysis of the data indicated that the majority of the teachers had positive perceptions of the use of visual aids. The use of visual aids enable the teachers to engage their students closely with the literary texts despite of being able to facilitate students of different English proficiency level in reading the texts with interest. This aspect is vital as literature helps to generate students creative and critical thinking skills. Although the teachers had positive attitudes towards the use of visual aids, the study suggests that it will be more interesting and precise if it includes students perceptions as well.
