WikiPulse - A News-Portal Based on Wikipedia

More and more user-generated content is complementing conventional journalism. While we don't think that CNN or New York Times and its professional journalists will disappear anytime soon, formidable competition is emerging through humble Wikipedia editors. In earlier work (Becker 2012), we found that entertainment and sports news appeared on average about two hours earlier on Wikipedia than on CNN and Reuters online. In this project we build a news-reader that automatically identifies late-breaking news among the most recent Wikipedia articles and then displays it on a dedicated Web site.
