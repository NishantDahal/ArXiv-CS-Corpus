Simulation-Based Performance Evaluation of Routing Protocols in Vehicular Ad-hoc Network

A Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is a collection of wireless vehicle nodes forming a temporary network without using any centralized Road Side Unit (RSU). VANET protocols have to face high challenges due to dynamically changing topologies and symmetric links of networks. A suitable and effective routing mechanism helps to extend the successful deployment of vehicular ad-hoc networks. An attempt has been made to compare the performance of two On-demand reactive routing protocols namely AODV and DSR which works on gateway discovery algorithms and a geographical routing protocol namely GPSR which works on an algorithm constantly geographical based updates network topology information available to all nodes in VANETs for different scenarios. Comparison is made on the basis of different metrics like throughput, packet loss, packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay using SUMO and NS2 simulator. In this paper we have taken different types of scenarios for simulation and then analysed the performance results.
