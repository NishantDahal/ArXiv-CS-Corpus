TARK 2013 - Proceedings of the 14. Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge

The biannual TARK conferences bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields sharing a common interest in reasoning about rationality and knowledge. The impact of this tradition, going back to 1986, is apparent in many of today's research trends and in the growth of an intellectual community beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. This volume documents the 14th TARK conference, held at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India on January 7 to 9, 2013. It includes 18 contributed talks, 8 poster presentations, and 3 invited talks given at the conference. Like earlier volumes in this series, it gives a sense of the state of the art in studies of knowledge and rationality in areas such as game theory, decision theory, belief revision, language analysis, and computation. It should be of value to researchers, teachers, and students.
