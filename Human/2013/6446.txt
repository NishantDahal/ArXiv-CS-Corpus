Stable equilibrium study cascaded one bit sigma-delta modulator

In the paper defines a boundary of stability zone for sigma-delta modulator. The boundary depends from inner sigma-delta modulator coefficients. For designing purposes such result could be used to find or compare some appropriate schemes with each other. It is proved some statements and showed that boundary could be found theoretically for any order of sigma-delta modulator, but practically till 5-th order.
