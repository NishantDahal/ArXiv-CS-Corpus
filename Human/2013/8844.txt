Efficient Inner-product Algorithm for Stabilizer States

Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on conventional computers using Omega(n^2) bits, where n is the number of qubits. Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for: (i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general, but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC (e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly 4(2^n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms to compute the inner product between two such frames.
