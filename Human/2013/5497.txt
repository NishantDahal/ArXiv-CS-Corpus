Towards User Profile Modelling in Recommender System

The notion of profile appeared in the 1970s decade, which was mainly due to the need to create custom applications that could be adapted to the user. In this paper, we treat the different aspects of the user's profile, defining it, profile, its features and its indicators of interest, and then we describe the different approaches of modelling and acquiring the user's interests.
