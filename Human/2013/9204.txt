Advances in computer architecture

In the past, efforts were taken to improve the performance of a processor via frequency scaling. However, industry has reached the limits of increasing the frequency and therefore concurrent execution of instructions on multiple cores seems the only possible option. It is not enough to provide concurrent execution by the hardware, software also have to introduce concurrency in order to exploit the parallelism.
