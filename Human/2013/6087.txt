Recognition of Named-Event Passages in News Articles

We extend the concept of Named Entities to Named Events - commonly occurring events such as battles and earthquakes. We propose a method for finding specific passages in news articles that contain information about such events and report our preliminary evaluation results. Collecting "Gold Standard" data presents many problems, both practical and conceptual. We present a method for obtaining such data using the Amazon Mechanical Turk service.
