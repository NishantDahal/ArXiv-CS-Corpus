DNA Pen: A Tool for Drawing on a Molecular Canvas

DNA origami is an interdisciplinary area where DNA can be used as a building block for making useful stuff at nanoscale. This work presents an open source software DNA pen (based on the recent work of Peng Yin and his group) which can be used (using free hand and digital molecular canvas) to draw an object at nanoscale. Software generates error free DNA sequences which can be used in the wet lab to create the object at the nanoscale. Using DNA pen we have drawn several objects including the map of India and sanskrit letter "Om" from free hand molecular canvas and digital letter DNA using digitized molecular canvas.
