Social Secret Sharing for Resource Management in Cloud

We first explain the notion of secret sharing and also threshold schemes, which can be implemented with the Shamir's secret sharing. Subsequently, we review social secret sharing (NSG'10,NS'10) and its trust function. In a secret sharing scheme, a secret is shared among a group of players who can later recover the secret. We review the construction of a social secret sharing scheme and its application for resource management in cloud, as explained in NS'12. To clarify the social secret sharing scheme, we first review its trust function according to NL'06. In this scheme, a secret is maintained by assigning a trust value to each player based on his behavior, i.e., availability.
