Environmental Bisimulations for Delimited-Control Operators

We present a theory of environmental bisimilarity for the delimited-control operators {\it shift} and {\it reset}. We consider two different notions of contextual equivalence: one that does not require the presence of a top-level control delimiter when executing tested terms, and another one, fully compatible with the original CPS semantics of shift and reset, that does. For each of them, we develop sound and complete environmental bisimilarities, and we discuss up-to techniques.
