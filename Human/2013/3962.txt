Software Design Principles of a DFS Tower A-CWP Prototype

SESAR is supposed to boost the development of new operational procedures together with the supporting systems in order to modernize the pan-European air traffic management (ATM). One consequence of this development is that more and more information is presented to - and has to be processed by - air traffic control officers (ATCOs). Thus, there is a strong need for a software design concept that fosters the development of an advanced (tower) controller working position (A-CWP) that comprehensively integrates the still counting amount of information while reducing the data management workload of ATCOs. We report on our first hands-on experiences obtained during the development of an A-CWP prototype that was used in two SESAR validation sessions.
