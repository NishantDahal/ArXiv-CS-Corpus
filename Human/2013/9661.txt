Planning and Optimization of Wireless LANs through Field Measurements

In this paper, the field measurements of signal strength taken at the frequency of 2432 MHz in indoor & outdoor environments are presented and analyzed. The received signal levels from the base station were monitored manually. Total coverage area considered for the measurement campaign consisted of a mixture of different propagation environments. Based on the experimental data obtained, path loss exponent and standard deviation of signal strength variability are derived. It is shown that the values of these parameters vary from region to region in the coverage area. The analysis is purely statistical & is compared with the existing propagation model to determine the path loss exponent & deviation.
