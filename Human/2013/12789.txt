Flexible queries in XML native databases

To date, most of the XML native databases (DB) flexible querying systems are based on exploiting the tree structure of their semi structured data (SSD). However, it becomes important to test the efficiency of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) formalism for this type of data since it has been proved a great performance in the field of information retrieval (IR). So, the IR in XML databases based on FCA is mainly based on the use of the lattice structure. Each concept of this lattice can be interpreted as a pair (response, query). In this work, we provide a new flexible modeling of XML DB based on fuzzy FCA as a first step towards flexible querying of SSD.
