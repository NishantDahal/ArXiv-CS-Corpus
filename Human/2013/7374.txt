Shuffling: Improving Data Security in Ad Hoc Networks based on Unipath Routing

An ad hoc network is a self-organizing network with help of Access Point (AP) of wireless links connecting nodes to another. The nodes can communicate without infrastructure network. They form an random topology (BSS/ESS), where the nodes play the role of routers and are free to move arbitrarily. Ad hoc networks confirmed their efficiency being used in different fields but they are highly vulnerable to security attacks and dealing with this is one of the main challenges of these networks today. In recent times, a few solutions are proposed to provide authentication, confidentiality, availability, secure routing and intrusion prevention in ad hoc networks. Employ security in such dynamically changing networks is a hard task. Ad hoc network uniqueness must be taken into contemplation to be clever to design efficient clarification. Here we spotlight on improving the flow transmission confidentiality in ad hoc networks based on unipath routing. Definitely, we take advantage of the being of multiple paths between nodes in an ad hoc network to increase the confidentiality robustness of transmitted data with the help of Access Point. In our approach the original message to secure is split into shares through access point that are encrypted and combined then transmitted along different disjointed existing paths between sender and receiver. Still if an attacker succeeds to attain one or more transmitted contribute to the probability that the unique message will be reconstituted is very low.
