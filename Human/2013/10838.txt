On Axiomatization of Inconsistency Indicators for Pairwise Comparisons

We examine the notion of inconsistency in pairwise comparisons and propose an axiomatization which is independent of any method of approximation or the inconsistency indicator definition (e.g., Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP). It has been proven that the eigenvalue-based inconsistency (proposed as a part of AHP) is incorrect.
