The Story of Telebrain: A multi-performer telematic platform for performatization

This paper presents Telebrain, a browser-based performatization platform invented for organizing real-time telematic performances. Performatization is the human performance of algorithms. When computers and humans performatize cooperatively, the human-computer interaction (HCI) becomes the location of computation. Novel modes of machine-human communication are necessary for organizing performatizations. Telebrain is designed to facilitate machine-human languages. Capitalizing on the ubiquity and cross-platform compatibility of the Internet, Telebrain is an open-source web application supporting PerPL (Performer Programming Language), a human-interpreted configurable language of multi-media instructions used to program performers. Telebrain facilitates a variety of performance disciplines such as music, theater, dance, computational performance, networked scoring (image and audio), prompted improvisation, real-space multi-player gaming, collaborative transdisciplinary karaoke and quantum square-dancing.
