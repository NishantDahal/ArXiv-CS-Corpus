Cellular Automata get their Wires Crossed

In three spatial dimensions, communication channels are free to pass over or under each other so as to cross without intersecting; in two dimensions, assuming channels of strictly positive thickness, this is not the case. It is natural, then, to ask whether one can, in a suitable, two-dimensional model, cross two channels in such a way that each successfully conveys its data, in particular without the channels interfering at the intersection. We formalize this question by modelling channels as cellular automata, and answer it affirmatively by exhibiting systems whereby channels are crossed without compromising capacity. We consider the efficiency (in various senses) of these systems, and mention potential applications.
