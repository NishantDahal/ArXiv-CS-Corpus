Increasing Compression Ratio in PNG Images by k-Modulus Method for Image Transformation

Image compression is an important filed in image processing. The science welcomes any tinny contribution that may increase the compression ratio by whichever insignificant percentage. Therefore, the essential contribution in this paper is to increase the compression ratio for the well known Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image file format. The contribution starts with converting the original PNG image into k-Modulus Method (k-MM). Practically, taking k equals to ten, and then the pixels in the constructed image will be integers divisible by ten. Since PNG uses Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, then the ability to reduce file size will increase according to the repetition in pixels in each k-by-k window according to the transformation done by k-MM. Experimental results show that the proposed technique (k-PNG) produces high compression ratio with smaller file size in comparison to the original PNG file.
