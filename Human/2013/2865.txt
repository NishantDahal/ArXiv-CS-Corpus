Generalizing Jeffrey Conditionalization

Jeffrey's rule has been generalized by Wagner to the case in which new evidence bounds the possible revisions of a prior probability below by a Dempsterian lower probability. Classical probability kinematics arises within this generalization as the special case in which the evidentiary focal elements of the bounding lower probability are pairwise disjoint.  We discuss a twofold extension of this generalization, first allowing the lower bound to be any two-monotone capacity and then allowing the prior to be a lower envelope.
