Secure Transmission of Password Using Speech Watermarking

Internet is one of the most valuable resources for information communication and retrievals. Most multimedia signals today are in digital formats. The digital data can be duplicated and edited with great ease which has led to a need for data integrity and protection of digital data. The security requirements such as integrity or data authentication can be met by implementing security measures using digital watermarking techniques. In this paper a blind speech watermarking algorithm that embeds the watermark signal data in the musical (sequence) host signal by using frequency masking is used. A different logarithmic approach is proposed. In this regard a logarithmic function is first applied to watermark data. Then the transformed signal is embedded to the converted version of host signal which is obtained by applying Fast Fourier transform method. Finally using inverse Fast Fourier Transform and antilogarithmic function watermark signal is retrieved.
