K model for designing Data Driven Test Automation Frameworks and its Design Architecture Snow Leopard

Automated testing improves the efficiency of testing practice at various levels of projects in the organization. Unfortunately, we do not have a common architecture or common standards for designing frameworks across different test levels, projects and test tools which can assist developers, testers and business analysts. To address the above problem, in this paper, I have first proposed a unique reference model and then a design architecture using the proposed model for designing any Data Driven Automation Frameworks. The reference model is K model which can be used for modeling any data-driven automation framework. The unique Design architecture, based on above model is Snow Leopard.
