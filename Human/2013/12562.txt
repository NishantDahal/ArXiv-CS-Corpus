Designing a brown planthoppers surveillance network based on wireless sensor network approach

This paper proposes a new approach for monitoring brown planthoppers (BPH) swarms using a surveillance network at provincial scale. The topology of this network is identified to a wireless sensor network (WSN), where each node is a real light trap and each edge describes the influence between two nodes, allowing gathering BPH information. Different communication ranges are evaluated to choose a suitable network. The experiments are performed on the light traps surveillance network of Hau Giang province, a typical rice province in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam.
