An Overview of the Research on Texture Based Plant Leaf Classification

Plant classification has a broad application prospective in agriculture and medicine, and is especially significant to the biology diversity research. As plants are vitally important for environmental protection, it is more important to identify and classify them accurately. Plant leaf classification is a technique where leaf is classified based on its different morphological features. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of different aspects of texture based plant leaf classification and related things. At last we will be concluding about the efficient method i.e. the method that gives better performance compared to the other methods.
