Using Bias Optimization for Reversible Data Hiding Using Image Interpolation

In this paper, we propose a reversible data hiding method in the spatial domain for compressed grayscale images. The proposed method embeds secret bits into a compressed thumbnail of the original image by using a novel interpolation method and the Neighbour Mean Interpolation (NMI) technique as scaling up to the original image occurs. Experimental results presented in this paper show that the proposed method has significantly improved embedding capacities over the approach proposed by Jung and Yoo.
