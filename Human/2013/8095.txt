Measuring digital crime investigation capacity to guide international crime prevention strategies

This work proposes a method for the measurement of a country's digital investigation capacity and saturation for the assessment of future capacity expansion. The focus is on external, or international, partners being a factor that could negatively affect the return on investment when attempting to expand investigation capacity nationally. This work concludes with the argument that when dealing with digital crime, target international partners should be a consideration in expansion, and could potentially be a bottleneck of investigation requests.
