Network Access Control Technology - Proposition to contain new security challenges

Traditional products working independently are no longer sufficient, since threats are continually gaining in complexity, diversity and performance; In order to proactively block such threats we need more integrated information security solution. To achieve this objective, we will analyze a real-world security platform, and focus on some key components Like, NAC, Firewall, and IPS/IDS then study their interaction in the perspective to propose a new security posture that coordinate and share security information between different network security components, using a central policy server that will be the NAC server or the PDP (the Policy Decision Point), playing an orchestration role as a central point of control. Finally we will conclude with potential research paths that will impact NAC technology evolution.
