On Finite Block-Length Quantization Distortion

We investigate the upper and lower bounds on the quantization distortions for independent and identically distributed sources in the finite block-length regime. Based on the convex optimization framework of the rate-distortion theory, we derive a lower bound on the quantization distortion under finite block-length, which is shown to be greater than the asymptotic distortion given by the rate-distortion theory. We also derive two upper bounds on the quantization distortion based on random quantization codebooks, which can achieve any distortion above the asymptotic one. Moreover, we apply the new upper and lower bounds to two types of sources, the discrete binary symmetric source and the continuous Gaussian source. For the binary symmetric source, we obtain the closed-form expressions of the upper and lower bounds. For the Gaussian source, we propose a computational tractable method to numerically compute the upper and lower bounds, for both bounded and unbounded quantization codebooks.Numerical results show that the gap between the upper and lower bounds is small for reasonable block length and hence the bounds are tight.
