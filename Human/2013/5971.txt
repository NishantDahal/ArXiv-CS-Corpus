Investigating Immune System Aging: System Dynamics and Agent-Based Modeling

System dynamics and agent based simulation models can both be used to model and understand interactions of entities within a population. Our modeling work presented here is concerned with understanding the suitability of the different types of simulation for the immune system aging problems and comparing their results. We are trying to answer questions such as: How fit is the immune system given a certain age? Would an immune boost be of therapeutic value, e.g. to improve the effectiveness of a simultaneous vaccination? Understanding the processes of immune system aging and degradation may also help in development of therapies that reverse some of the damages caused thus improving life expectancy. Therefore as a first step our research focuses on T cells; major contributors to immune system functionality. One of the main factors influencing immune system aging is the output rate of naive T cells. Of further interest is the number and phenotypical variety of these cells in an individual, which will be the case study focused on in this paper.
