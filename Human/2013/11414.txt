The CAITLIN Auralization System: Hierarchical Leitmotif Design as a Clue to Program Comprehension

Early experiments have suggested that program auralization can convey information about program structure [8]. Languages like Pascal contain classes of construct that are similar in nature allowing hierarchical classification of their features. This taxonomy can be reflected in the design of musical signatures which are used within the CAITLIN program auralization system. Experiments using these hierarchical leitmotifs indicate whether or not their similarities can be put to good use in communicating information about program structure and state. (Note, at time of going to press experimental results could not be included. These will be presented at the conference and included later.)
