Analyzing Big Data with Dynamic Quantum Clustering

How does one search for a needle in a multi-dimensional haystack without knowing what a needle is and without knowing if there is one in the haystack? This kind of problem requires a paradigm shift - away from hypothesis driven searches of the data - towards a methodology that lets the data speak for itself. Dynamic Quantum Clustering (DQC) is such a methodology. DQC is a powerful visual method that works with big, high-dimensional data. It exploits variations of the density of the data (in feature space) and unearths subsets of the data that exhibit correlations among all the measured variables. The outcome of a DQC analysis is a movie that shows how and why sets of data-points are eventually classified as members of simple clusters or as members of - what we call - extended structures. This allows DQC to be successfully used in a non-conventional exploratory mode where one searches data for unexpected information without the need to model the data. We show how this works for big, complex, real-world datasets that come from five distinct fields: i.e., x-ray nano-chemistry, condensed matter, biology, seismology and finance. These studies show how DQC excels at uncovering unexpected, small - but meaningful - subsets of the data that contain important information. We also establish an important new result: namely, that big, complex datasets often contain interesting structures that will be missed by many conventional clustering techniques. Experience shows that these structures appear frequently enough that it is crucial to know they can exist, and that when they do, they encode important hidden information. In short, we not only demonstrate that DQC can be flexibly applied to datasets that present significantly different challenges, we also show how a simple analysis can be used to look for the needle in the haystack, determine what it is, and find what this means.
