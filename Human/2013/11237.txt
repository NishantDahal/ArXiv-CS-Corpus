Intelligent Agent for Prediction in E- Negotiation: An Approach

With the proliferation of web technologies it becomes more and more important to make the traditional negotiation pricing mechanism automated and intelligent. The behaviour of software agents which negotiate on behalf of humans is determined by their tactics in the form of decision functions. Prediction of partners behaviour in negotiation has been an active research direction in recent years as it will improve the utility gain for the adaptive negotiation agent and also achieve the agreement much quicker or look after much higher benefits. In this paper we review the various negotiation methods and the existing architecture. Although negotiation is practically very complex activity to automate without human intervention we have proposed architecture for predicting the opponents behaviour which will take into consideration various factors which affect the process of negotiation. The basic concept is that the information about negotiators, their individual actions and dynamics can be used by software agents equipped with adaptive capabilities to learn from past negotiations and assist in selecting appropriate negotiation tactics.
