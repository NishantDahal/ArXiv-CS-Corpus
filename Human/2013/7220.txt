On house renovation and coauthoring (with a little excursus on the Holy Grail of bibliometrics)

More than a paper, this is just a little divertissement about coauthoring, the Hirsch h-index, and bibliometric evaluation in general. Without pretending to yield any general conclusions, what I found rummaging through the physics literature made me think quite a bit. I hope the same will happen to my readers, even it they will likely be much less than 25, which is the audience one of the greatest Italian writers (whom, is left to the reader to single out) addresses to.
