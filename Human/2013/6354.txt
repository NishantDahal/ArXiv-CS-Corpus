Ber Performance Analysis of WiMAX PHY Layer under different channel conditions

This paper gives an introduction on the IEEE 802.16 standard WIMAX or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access. The different parts give details on the architectural specifications of WiMAX networks and also on the working principle of WiMAX networks including its services provided. It also provides brief descriptions on its salient features of this technology and how it benefits the networking industry. A brief outline of the basic building blocks or equipment of WiMAX architecture is also provided. This paper also evaluates the simulation performance of IEEE 802.16 OFDM PHY layer. The Stanford University Interim (SUI) channel model under varying parameters is selected for the wireless channel in the simulation. The performance measurements and analysis was done in simulation developed in MATLAB.
