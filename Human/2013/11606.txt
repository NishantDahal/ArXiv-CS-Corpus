Joint recovery algorithms using difference of innovations for distributed compressed sensing

Distributed compressed sensing is concerned with representing an ensemble of jointly sparse signals using as few linear measurements as possible. Two novel joint reconstruction algorithms for distributed compressed sensing are presented in this paper. These algorithms are based on the idea of using one of the signals as side information; this allows to exploit joint sparsity in a more effective way with respect to existing schemes. They provide gains in reconstruction quality, especially when the nodes acquire few measurements, so that the system is able to operate with fewer measurements than is required by other existing schemes. We show that the algorithms achieve better performance with respect to the state-of-the-art.
