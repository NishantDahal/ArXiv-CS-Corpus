Multi-agent based protection system for distribution system with DG

This paper introduces the basic structure of multi-agent based protection system for distribution system with DGs. The entire system consists of intelligent agents and communication system. Intelligent agents can be divided into three layers, the bottom layer, the middle layer and the upper layer. The design of the agent in different layer is analyzed in detail. Communication system is the bridge of multi-agent system (MAS). The transmission mode, selective communication and other principles are discussed to improve the transmission efficiency. Finally, some evaluations are proposed, which provides the design of MAS with reference.
