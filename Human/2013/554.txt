Many to Many Matching with Demands and Capacities

Let A and B be two finite sets of points with total cardinality n, the many to many point matching with demands and capacities matches each point ai in A to at least alpha'i and at most alphai points in B, and each point bj in B to at least betaj and at most beta'j points in A for all 1 <= i <= s and 1 <= j <= t. In this paper, we present an upper bound for this problem using our new polynomial time algorithm.
