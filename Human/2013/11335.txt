Visual Representation of 3D Language Constructs Specified by Generic Depictions

Several modeling domains make use of three-dimensional representations, e.g., the "ball-and-stick" models of molecules. Our generator framework DEViL3D supports the design and implementation of visual 3D languages for such modeling purposes. The front-end of a language implementation generated by DEViL3D is a dedicated 3D graphical structure editor, which is used to construct programs in that domain. DEViL3D supports the language designer to describe the visual appearance of the constructs of the particular language in terms of generic 3D depictions. Their parameters specify where substructures are embedded, and how the graphic adapts to space requirements of nested constructs. The 3D editor used for such specifications is generated by DEViL3D, too. In this paper, we briefly introduce the research field of 3D visual languages and report about our generator framework and the role that generic depictions play in the specification process for 3D languages. Our results show that our approach is suitable for a wide range of 3D languages. We emphasize this suitability by presenting requirements on the visual appearance for different languages.
