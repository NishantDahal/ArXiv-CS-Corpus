On construction and analysis of sparse random matrices and expander graphs with applications to compressed sensing

We revisit the probabilistic construction of sparse random matrices where each column has a fixed number of nonzeros whose row indices are drawn uniformly at random. These matrices have a one-to-one correspondence with the adjacency matrices of lossless expander graphs. We present tail bounds on the probability that the cardinality of the set of neighbors for these graphs will be less than the expected value. The bounds are derived through the analysis of collisions in unions of sets using a {\em dyadic splitting} technique. This analysis led to the derivation of better constants that allow for quantitative theorems on existence of lossless expander graphs and hence the sparse random matrices we consider and also quantitative compressed sensing sampling theorems when using sparse non mean-zero measurement matrices.
