Linear and Geometric Mixtures - Analysis

Linear and geometric mixtures are two methods to combine arbitrary models in data compression. Geometric mixtures generalize the empirically well-performing PAQ7 mixture. Both mixture schemes rely on weight vectors, which heavily determine their performance. Typically weight vectors are identified via Online Gradient Descent. In this work we show that one can obtain strong code length bounds for such a weight estimation scheme. These bounds hold for arbitrary input sequences. For this purpose we introduce the class of nice mixtures and analyze how Online Gradient Descent with a fixed step size combined with a nice mixture performs. These results translate to linear and geometric mixtures, which are nice, as we show. The results hold for PAQ7 mixtures as well, thus we provide the first theoretical analysis of PAQ7.
