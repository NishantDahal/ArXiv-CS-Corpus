Comparision and analysis of photo image forgery detection techniques

Digital Photo images are everywhere, on the covers of magazines, in newspapers, in courtrooms, and all over the Internet. We are exposed to them throughout the day and most of the time. Ease with which images can be manipulated; we need to be aware that seeing does not always imply believing. We propose methodologies to identify such unbelievable photo images and succeeded to identify forged region by given only the forged image. Formats are additive tag for every file system and contents are relatively expressed with extension based on most popular digital camera uses JPEG and Other image formats like png, bmp etc. We have designed algorithm running behind with the concept of abnormal anomalies and identify the forgery regions.
