Normative Engineering Risk Management Systems

This paper describes a normative system design that incorporates diagnosis, dynamic evolution, decision making, and information gathering.  A single influence diagram demonstrates the design's coherence, yet each activity is more effectively modeled and evaluated separately.  Application to offshore oil platforms illustrates the design.  For this application, the normative system is embedded in a real-time expert system.
