Tripartite Blind Quantum Computation

This paper proposes a model of tripartite blind quantum computation (TBQC), in which three independent participants hold different resources and accomplish a computational task through cooperation. The three participants are called C,S,T separately, where C needs to compute on his private data, and T has the required quantum algorithm, and S provides sufficient quantum computational resources. Then two concrete TBQC protocols are constructed. The first protocol is designed based on Broadbent-Fitzsimons-Kashefi protocol, and it cannot prevent from collusive attack of two participants. Then based on universal quantum circuit, we present the second protocol which can prevent from collusive attack. In the latter protocol, for each appearance of $R$-gate in the circuit, one call to a classical AND-BOX is required for privacy.
