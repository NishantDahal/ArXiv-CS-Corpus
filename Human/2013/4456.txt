A Multi-Dimensional Block-Circulant Perfect Array Construction

We present a $N$-dimensional generalization of the two-dimensional block-circulant perfect array construction by \cite{Blake2013}. As in \cite{Blake2013}, the families of $N$-dimensional arrays possess pairwise \textit{good} zero correlation zone (ZCZ) cross-correlation. Both constructions use a perfect autocorrelation sequence with the array orthogonality property (AOP).
