Knowledge-based Expressive Technologies within Cloud Computing Environments

Presented paper describes the development of comprehensive approach for knowledge processing within e-Sceince tasks. Considering the task solving within a simulation-driven approach a set of knowledge-based procedures for task definition and composite application processing can be identified. This procedures could be supported by the use of domain-specific knowledge being formalized and used for automation purpose. Within this work the developed conceptual and technological knowledge-based toolbox for complex multidisciplinary task solv-ing support is proposed. Using CLAVIRE cloud computing environment as a core platform a set of interconnected expressive technologies were developed.
