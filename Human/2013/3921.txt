Network Control Systems RTAI framework A Review

With the advancement in the automation industry, to perform complex remote operations is required. Advancements in the networking technology has led to the development of different architectures to implement control from a large distance. In various control applications of the modern industry, the agents, such as sensors, actuators, and controllers are basically geographically distributed. For efficient working of a control application, all of the agents have to exchange information through a communication media. At present, an increasing number of distributed control systems are based on platforms made up of conventional PCs running open-source real-time operating systems. Often, these systems needed to have networked devices supporting synchronized operations with respect to each node. A framework is studied that relies on standard software and protocol as RTAI, EtherCAT, RTnet and IEEE 1588. RTAI and its various protocols are studied in network control systems environment.
