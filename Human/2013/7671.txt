On the extremal values of the number of vertices with an interval spectrum on the set of proper edge colorings of the graph of the $n$-dimensional cube

For an undirected, simple, finite, connected graph $G$, we denote by $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ the sets of its vertices and edges, respectively. A function $\varphi:E(G)\rightarrow \{1,...,t\}$ is called a proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph $G$, if adjacent edges are colored differently and each of $t$ colors is used. The least value of $t$ for which there exists a proper edge $t$-coloring of a graph $G$ is denoted by $χ'(G)$. For any graph $G$, and for any integer $t$ satisfying the inequality $χ'(G)\leq t\leq |E(G)|$, we denote by $α(G,t)$ the set of all proper edge $t$-colorings of $G$. Let us also define a set $α(G)$ of all proper edge colorings of a graph $G$: $$ α(G)\equiv\bigcup_{t=χ'(G)}^{|E(G)|}α(G,t). $$
  An arbitrary nonempty finite subset of consecutive integers is called an interval. If $\varphi\inα(G)$ and $x\in V(G)$, then the set of colors of edges of $G$ which are incident with $x$ is denoted by $S_G(x,\varphi)$ and is called a spectrum of the vertex $x$ of the graph $G$ at the proper edge coloring $\varphi$. If $G$ is a graph and $\varphi\inα(G)$, then define $f_G(\varphi)\equiv|\{x\in V(G)/S_G(x,\varphi) \textrm{is an interval}\}|$.
  For a graph $G$ and any integer $t$, satisfying the inequality $χ'(G)\leq t\leq |E(G)|$, we define: $$ μ_1(G,t)\equiv\min_{\varphi\inα(G,t)}f_G(\varphi),\qquad μ_2(G,t)\equiv\max_{\varphi\inα(G,t)}f_G(\varphi). $$
  For any graph $G$, we set: $$ μ_{11}(G)\equiv\min_{χ'(G)\leq t\leq|E(G)|}μ_1(G,t),\qquad μ_{12}(G)\equiv\max_{χ'(G)\leq t\leq|E(G)|}μ_1(G,t), $$ $$ μ_{21}(G)\equiv\min_{χ'(G)\leq t\leq|E(G)|}μ_2(G,t),\qquad μ_{22}(G)\equiv\max_{χ'(G)\leq t\leq|E(G)|}μ_2(G,t). $$
  For any positive integer $n$, the exact values of the parameters $μ_{11}$, $μ_{12}$, $μ_{21}$ and $μ_{22}$ are found for the graph of the $n$-dimensional cube.
