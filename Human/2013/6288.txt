Improving production process performance thanks to neuronal analysis

Product quality level is become a key factor for companies' competitiveness. A lot of time and money are required to ensure and guaranty it. Besides, motivated by the need of traceability, collecting production data is now commonplace in most companies. Our paper aims to show that we can ensure the required quality thanks to an "on-line quality approch" and proposes a neural network based process to determine the optimal setting for production machines. We will illustrate this with the Acta-Mobilier case, which is a high quality lacquerer company.
