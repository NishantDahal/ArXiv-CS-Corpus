A gambling interpretation of some quantum information-theoretic quantities

It is known that repeated gambling over the outcomes of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables gives rise to alternate operational meaning of entropies in the classical case in terms of the doubling rates. We give a quantum extension of this approach for gambling over the measurement outcomes of tensor product states. Under certain parameters of the gambling setup, one can give operational meaning of von Neumann entropies. We discuss two variants of gambling when a helper is available and it is shown that the difference in their doubling rates is the quantum discord. Lastly, a quantum extension of Kelly's gambling setup in the classical case gives a doubling rate that is upper bounded by the Holevo information.
