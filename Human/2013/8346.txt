ZigBee Based Wireless Data Acquisition Using LabVIEW for Implementing Smart Driving Skill Evaluation System

The Smart Driving Skill Evaluation (SDSE) System presented in this paper expedite the testing of candidates aspiring for a driving license in a more efficient and transparent manner, as compared to the present manual testing procedure existing in most parts of Asia and Pacific region. The manual test procedure is also subjected to multiple limitations like time consuming, costly and heavily controlled by the experience of examiner in conducting the test. This technological solution is developed by customizing 8051 controller based embedded system and LabVIEW based virtual instrument. The controller module senses the motion of the test vehicle on the test track referred to as zero rpm measurement and the LabVIEW based virtual instrument provides a Graphical User Interface for remote end monitoring of the sensors embedded on the test track. The proposed technological solution for the automation of existing manual test process enables the elimination of human intervention and improves the driving test accuracy while going paperless with Driving Skill Evaluation System. As a contribution to the society this technological solution can reduce the number of road accidents because most accidents results from lack of planning, anticipation and control which are highly dependent on driving skill.
