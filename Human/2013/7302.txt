Integrating Datalog and Constraint Solving

LP is a common formalism for the field of databases and CSP, both at the theoretical level and the implementation level in the form of Datalog and CLP. In the past, close correspondences have been made between both fields at the theoretical level. Yet correspondence at the implementation level has been much less explored. In this article we work towards relating them at the implementation level. Concretely, we show how to derive the efficient Leapfrog Triejoin execution algorithm of Datalog from a generic CP execution scheme.
