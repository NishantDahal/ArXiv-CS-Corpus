Extremal words in morphic subshifts

Given an infinite word X over an alphabet A a letter b occurring in X, and a total order σon A, we call the smallest word with respect to σstarting with b in the shift orbit closure of X an extremal word of X. In this paper we consider the extremal words of morphic words. If X = g(f^ω(a)) for some morphisms f and g, we give two simple conditions on f and g that guarantees that all extremal words are morphic. This happens, in particular, when X is a primitive morphic or a binary pure morphic word. Our techniques provide characterizations of the extremal words of the Period-doubling word and the Chacon word and give a new proof of the form of the lexicographically least word in the shift orbit closure of the Rudin-Shapiro word.
