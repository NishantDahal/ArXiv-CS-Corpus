Patterns to analyze requirements of a Decisional Information System

The domain of analysis and conception of Decisional Information System (DIS) is, highly, applying new techniques and methods to succeed the process of the decision and minimizing the time of conception. Our objective in this paper is to define a group of patterns to ensure a systematic reuse of our approach to analyse a DIS s business requirements. We seek, through this work, to guide the discovery of an organizations business requirements, expressed as goals by introducing the notion of context, to promote good processes design for a DIS, to capitalize the process and models proposed in our approach and systematize reuse steps of this approach to analyze similar projects or adapt them as needed. The patterns are at the same time the process s patterns and product s patterns as they capitalize models and their associated processes. These patterns are represented according to the PSIGMA formalism.
