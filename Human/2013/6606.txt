Slime mould tactile sensor

Slime mould P. polycephalum is a single cells visible by unaided eye. The cells shows a wide spectrum of intelligent behaviour. By interpreting the behaviour in terms of computation one can make a slime mould based computing device. The Physarum computers are capable to solve a range of tasks of computational geometry, optimisation and logic. Physarum computers designed so far lack of localised inputs. Commonly used inputs --- illumination and chemo-attractants and -repellents --- usually act on extended domains of the slime mould's body. Aiming to design massive-parallel tactile inputs for slime mould computers we analyse a temporal dynamic of P. polycephalum's electrical response to tactile stimulation. In experimental laboratory studies we discover how the Physarum responds to application and removal of a local mechanical pressure with electrical potential impulses and changes in its electrical potential oscillation patterns.
