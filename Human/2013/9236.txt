A short note on Simulation and Abstraction

This short note is written in celebration of David Schmidt's sixtieth birthday.  He has now been active in the program analysis research community for over thirty years and we have enjoyed many interactions with him.  His work on characterising simulations between Kripke structures using Galois connections was particularly influential in our own work on using probabilistic abstract interpretation to study Larsen and Skou's notion of probabilistic bisimulation.  We briefly review this work and discuss some recent applications of these ideas in a variety of different application areas.
