Novel Factorization Strategies for Higher Order Tensors: Implications for Compression and Recovery of Multi-linear Data

In this paper we propose novel methods for compression and recovery of multilinear data under limited sampling. We exploit the recently proposed tensor- Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD)[1], which is a group theoretic framework for tensor decomposition. In contrast to popular existing tensor decomposition techniques such as higher-order SVD (HOSVD), t-SVD has optimality properties similar to the truncated SVD for matrices. Based on t-SVD, we first construct novel tensor-rank like measures to characterize informational and structural complexity of multilinear data. Following that we outline a complexity penalized algorithm for tensor completion from missing entries. As an application, 3-D and 4-D (color) video data compression and recovery are considered. We show that videos with linear camera motion can be represented more efficiently using t-SVD compared to traditional approaches based on vectorizing or flattening of the tensors. Application of the proposed tensor completion algorithm for video recovery from missing entries is shown to yield a superior performance over existing methods. In conclusion we point out several research directions and implications to online prediction of multilinear data.
