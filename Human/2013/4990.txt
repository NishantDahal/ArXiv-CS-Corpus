New Construction of Authentication Codes with Arbitration from Pseudo-Symplectic Geometry over Finite Fields

A new construction of authentication codes with arbitration from pseudo-symplectic geometry over finite fields is given. The parameters and the probabilities of deceptions of the codes are also computed.
