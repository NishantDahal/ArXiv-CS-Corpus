Pattern Languages as Media for the Creative Society

This paper proposes new languages for basic skills in the Creative Society, where people create their own goods, tools, concepts, knowledge, and mechanisms with their own hands: the skills of learning, presentation, and collaboration. These languages are written as a pattern language, which is a way of describing the tacit practical knowledge. In this paper, a new type of pattern languages are proposed as "Pattern Languages 3.0" and three examples are introduced: Learning Patterns, Collaboration Patterns, and Presentation Patterns. By analyzing the functions with the social systems theory and the creative systems theory, pattern languages are considered as communication media and discovery media.
