Study On Universal Lossless Data Compression by using Context Dependence Multilevel Pattern Matching Grammar Transform

In this paper, the context dependence multilevel pattern matching(in short CDMPM) grammar transform is proposed; based on this grammar transform, the universal lossless data compression algorithm, CDMPM code is then developed. Moreover we get a upper bound of this algorithms' worst case redundancy among all individual sequences of length n from a finite alphabet.
