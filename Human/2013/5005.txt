Calculation of geometric characteristics of land cover and urban canyon for multi-scale parameterization of megalopolis meteorological models

The results of studies on the development of computational techniques for geometric and thematic characteristics of the underlying surface and urban canyon are presented. These characteristics are intended for parameterization of the local model of energy-mass exchange between the surface layer of the atmosphere and the surface of the active layer of the underlying urban areas (cities). Multiscale database of parameters of the underlying surface with a resolution of 200, 500 and 1000 meters is obtained. The use of micro-meteorology models that take into account the specificity of the urban environment, coupled with mesoscale prognostic models will significantly improve the sound quality of the meteorological fields and local operational weather forecasting in the metropolitan areas where considering the hydrometeorological situation is particularly important.
