Tag-based Semantic Website Recommendation for Turkish Language

With the dramatic increase in the number of websites on the internet, tagging has become popular for finding related, personal and important documents. When the potentially increasing internet markets are analyzed, Turkey, in which most of the people use Turkish language on the internet, found to be exponentially increasing. In this paper, a tag-based website recommendation method is presented, where similarity measures are combined with semantic relationships of tags. In order to evaluate the system, an experiment with 25 people from Turkey is undertaken and participants are firstly asked to provide websites and tags in Turkish and then they are asked to evaluate recommended websites.
