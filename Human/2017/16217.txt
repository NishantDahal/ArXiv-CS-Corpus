Snowflake: A Model Agnostic Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the deep learning model of choice for performing object detection, classification, semantic segmentation and natural language processing tasks. CNNs require billions of operations to process a frame. This computational complexity, combined with the inherent parallelism of the convolution operation make CNNs an excellent target for custom accelerators. However, when optimizing for different CNN hierarchies and data access patterns, it is difficult for custom accelerators to achieve close to 100% computational efficiency. In this work, we present Snowflake, a scalable and efficient accelerator that is agnostic to CNN workloads, and was designed to always perform at near-peak hardware utilization. Snowflake is able to achieve a computational efficiency of over 91% on modern CNN models. Snowflake, implemented on a Xilinx Zynq XC7Z045 SoC is capable of achieving a peak throughput of 128G-ops/s and a measured throughput of 100 frames per second and 120 G-ops/s on the AlexNet CNN model, 36 frames per second and 116G- ops/s on the GoogLeNet CNN model and 17 frames per second and 122 G-ops/s on the ResNet-50 CNN model. To the best of our knowledge, Snowflake is the only implemented system capable of achieving over 91% efficiency on modern CNNs and the only implemented system with GoogLeNet and ResNet as part of the benchmark suite.
