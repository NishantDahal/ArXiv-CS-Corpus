Isogeometric Analysis Simulation of TESLA Cavities Under Uncertainty

In the design of electromagnetic devices the accurate representation of the geometry plays a crucial role in determining the device performance. For accelerator cavities, in particular, controlling the frequencies of the eigenmodes is important in order to guarantee the synchronization between the electromagnetic field and the accelerated particles. The main interest of this work is in the evaluation of eigenmode sensitivities with respect to geometrical changes using Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic collocation. The choice of an IGA approach for the spatial discretization allows for an exact handling of the domains and their deformations, guaranteeing, at the same time, accurate and highly regular solutions.
