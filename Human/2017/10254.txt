A Note on the Alon-Kleitman Argument for Sum-free Subset Theorem

In 1990, Alon and Kleitman proposed an argument for the sum-free subset problem: every set of n nonzero elements of a finite Abelian group contains a sum-free subset A of size |A|>\frac{2}{7}n. In this note, we show that the argument confused two different randomness. It applies only to the finite Abelian group G = (Z/pZ)^s where p is a prime. For the general case, the problem remains open.
