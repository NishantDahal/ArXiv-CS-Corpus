On the error probability of stochastic decision and stochastic decoding

This paper investigates the error probability of a stochastic decision and the way in which it differs from the error probability of an optimal decision, i.e., the maximum a posteriori decision. This paper calls attention to the fact that the error probability of a stochastic decision with the a posteriori distribution is at most twice the error probability of the maximum a posteriori decision. It is shown that, by generating an independent identically distributed random sequence subject to the a posteriori distribution and making a decision that maximizes the a posteriori probability over the sequence, the error probability approaches exponentially the error probability of the maximum a posteriori decision as the sequence length increases. Using these ideas as a basis, we can construct stochastic decoders for source/channel codes.
