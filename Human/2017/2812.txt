Transplantation of Data Mining Algorithms to Cloud Computing Platform when Dealing Big Data

This paper made a short review of Cloud Computing and Big Data, and discussed the portability of general data mining algorithms to Cloud Computing platform. It revealed the Cloud Computing platform based on Map-Reduce cannot solve all the Big Data and data mining problems. Transplanting the general data mining algorithms to the real-time Cloud Computing platform will be one of the research focuses in Cloud Computing and Big Data.
