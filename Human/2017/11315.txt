Towards Adaptive Resilience in High Performance Computing

Failure rates in high performance computers rapidly increase due to the growth in system size and complexity. Hence, failures became the norm rather than the exception. Different approaches on high performance computing (HPC) systems have been introduced, to prevent failures (e. g., redundancy) or at least minimize their impacts (e. g., checkpoint and restart). In most cases, when these approaches are employed to increase the resilience of certain parts of a system, energy consumption rapidly increases, or performance significantly degrades. To address this challenge, we propose on-demand resilience as an approach to achieve adaptive resilience in HPC systems. In this work, the HPC system is considered in its entirety and resilience mechanisms such as checkpointing, isolation, and migration, are activated on-demand. Using the proposed approach, the unavoidable increase in total energy consumption and system performance degradation is decreased compared to the typical checkpoint/restart and redundant resilience mechanisms. Our work aims to mitigate a large number of failures occurring at various layers in the system, to prevent their propagation, and to minimize their impact, all of this in an energy-saving manner. In the case of failures that are estimated to occur but cannot be mitigated using the proposed on-demand resilience approach, the system administrators will be notified in view of performing further investigations into the causes of these failures and their impacts.
