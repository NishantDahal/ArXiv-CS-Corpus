Novel Delivery Schemes for Decentralized Coded Caching in the Finite File Size Regime

This paper analyzes the achievable tradeoff between cache~size and download~rate in decentralized caching systems with the uncoded cache placement originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen. It proposes two novel delivery schemes that take advantage of the multicasting opportunities that arise when a file is demanded by multiple users. These delivery schemes are extensions of known ones to the regime where the file size is finite. Numerical evaluations for the case of file uniform popularity show that the proposed schemes outperform previous ones for all value of the cache size.
