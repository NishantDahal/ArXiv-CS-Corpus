Some remarks regarding Quaternions and Octonions

In this paper, we present some applications of quaternions and octonions. We present the real matrix representations for complex octonions and some of their properties which can be used in computations where these elements are involved. Moreover, we give a set of invertible elements in split quaternion algebras and in split octonion algebras.
