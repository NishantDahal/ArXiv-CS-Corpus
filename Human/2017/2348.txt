Achievable information rates estimates in optically-amplified transmission systems using nonlinearity compensation and probabilistic shaping

Achievable information rates (AIRs) of wideband optical communication systems using ~40 nm (~5 THz) EDFA and ~100 nm (~12.5 THz) distributed Raman amplification are estimated based on a first-order perturbation analysis. The AIRs of each individual channel have been evaluated for DP-64QAM, DP-256QAM, and DP-1024QAM modulation formats. The impact of full-field nonlinear compensation (FF-NLC) and probabilistically shaped constellations using a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution were studied and compared to electronic dispersion compensation. It is found that a probabilistically shaped DP-1024QAM constellation combined with FF-NLC yields AIRs of ~75 Tbit/s for the EDFA scheme and ~223 Tbit/s for the Raman amplification scheme over 2000 km standard single mode fibre transmission.
