Opinion Exchange Dynamics

We survey a range of models of opinion exchange. From the introduction: "The exchange of opinions between individuals is a fundamental social interaction... Moreover, many models in this field are an excellent playground for mathematicians, especially those working in probability, algorithms and combinatorics. The goal of this survey is to introduce such models to mathematicians, and especially to those working in discrete mathematics, information theory, optimization, probability and statistics."
