Mobile Encryption Gateway (MEG) for Email Encryption

Email cryptography applications often suffer from major problems that prevent their widespread implementation. MEG, or the Mobile Encryption Gateway aims to fix the issues associated with email encryption by ensuring that encryption is easy to perform while still maintaining data security. MEG performs automatic decryption and encryption of all emails using PGP. Users do not need to understand the internal workings of the encryption process to use the application. MEG is meant to be email-client-agnostic, enabling users to employ virtually any email service to send messages. Encryption actions are performed on the user's mobile device, which means their keys and data remain personal. MEG can also tackle network effect problems by inviting non-users to join. Most importantly, MEG uses end-to-end encryption, which ensures that all aspects of the encrypted information remains private. As a result, we are hopeful that MEG will finally solve the problem of practical email encryption.
