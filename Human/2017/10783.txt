Mobile Phone Forensics: An Investigative Framework based on User Impulsivity and Secure Collaboration Errors

This paper uses a scenario-based role-play experiment based on the usage of QR codes to detect how mobile users respond to social engineering attacks conducted via mobile devices. The results of this experiment outline a guided mobile phone forensics investigation method which could facilitate the work of digital forensics investigators while analysing the data from mobile devices. The behavioural response of users could be impacted by several aspects, such as impulsivity, smartphone usage and security or simply awareness that QR codes could contain malware. The findings indicate that the impulsivity of users is one of the key areas that determine the common mistakes of mobile device users. As a result, an investigative framework for mobile phone forensics is proposed based on the impulsivity and common mistakes of mobile device users. As a result, an investigative framework for mobile phone forensics is proposed based on the impulsivity and common mistakes of mobile device users. It could help the forensics investigators by potentially shortening the time spent on investigation of possible breach scenarios.
