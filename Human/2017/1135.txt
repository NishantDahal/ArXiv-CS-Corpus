Sound Structure-Preserving Transformation for Weakly-Left-Linear Deterministic Conditional Term Rewriting Systems

In this paper, we show that the SR transformation, a computationally equivalent transformation proposed by Serbanuta and Rosu, is a sound structure-preserving transformation for weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting systems. More precisely, we show that every weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting system can be converted to an equivalent weakly-left-linear and ultra-weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting system and prove that the SR transformation is sound for weakly-left-linear and ultra-weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting systems. Here, soundness for a conditional term rewriting system means that reduction of the transformed unconditional term rewriting system creates no undesired reduction sequence for the conditional system.
