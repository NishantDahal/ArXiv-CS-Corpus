Nearest-Neighbor and Contact Distance Distributions for Matern Cluster Process

In this letter, we derive the cumulative density function (CDF) of the nearest neighbor and contact distance distributions of the Matern cluster process (MCP) in R2. These results will be useful in the performance analysis of many real-world wireless networks that exhibit inter-node attraction. Using these results, we concretely demonstrate that the contact distance of the MCP stochastically dominates its nearest-neighbor distance as well as the contact distance of the homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) with the same density.
