A Synchronization Algorithm Based on Moving Average for Robust Audio Watermarking Scheme

A synchronization code scheme based on moving average is proposed for robust audio watermarking in the paper. Two proper positive integers are chosen to compute the moving average sequence by sliding one sample every time. The synchronization bits are embedded at crosses of the two moving average sequences with the quantization index modulation. The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme maintains high audio quality and is robust to common attacks such as additive white Gaussian noise, re-sampling, low-pass filtering, random cropping, MP3 compression, jitter attack and time scale modification. Simultaneously, the algorithm has high search efficiency and low false alarm rate.
