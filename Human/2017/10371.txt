Resource Allocation and Outage Analysis for An Adaptive Cognitive Two-Way Relay Network

In this paper, an adaptive two-way relay cooperation scheme is studied for multiple-relay cognitive radio networks to improve the performance of secondary transmissions. The power allocation and relay selection schemes are derived to minimize the secondary outage probability where only statistical channel information is needed. Exact closed-form expressions for secondary outage probability are derived under a constraint on the quality of service of primary transmissions in terms of the required primary outage probability. To better understand the impact of primary user interference on secondary transmissions, we further investigate the asymptotic behaviors of the secondary relay network including power allocation and outage probability, when the primary signal-to-noise ratio goes to infinity. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed schemes.
