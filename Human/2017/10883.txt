Microservices Science and Engineering

In this paper we offer an overview on the topic of Microservices Science and Engineering (MSE) and we provide a collection of bibliographic references and links relevant to understand an emerging field. We try to clarify some misunderstandings related to microservices and Service-Oriented Architectures, and we also describe projects and applications our team have been working on in the recent past, both regarding programming languages construction and intelligent buildings.
