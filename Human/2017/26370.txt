Hypergraphical Clustering Games of Mis-Coordination

We introduce and motivate the study of hypergraphical clustering games of mis-coordination. For two specific variants we prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium and provide bounds on the price of anarchy as a function of the cardinality of the action set and the size of the hyperedges.
