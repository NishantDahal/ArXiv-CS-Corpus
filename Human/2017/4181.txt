A Benchmark on Reliability of Complex Discrete Systems: Emergency Power Supply of a Nuclear Power Plant

This paper contains two parts: the description of a real electrical system, with many redundancies, reconfigurations and repairs, then the description of a reliability model of this system, based on the BDMP (Boolean logic Driven Markov Processes) formalism and partial results of a reliability and availability calculation made from this model.
