Construction Inspection through Spatial Database

This paper presents a novel pipeline for development of an efficient set of tools for extracting information from the video of a structure, captured by an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to produce as-built documentation to aid inspection of large multi-storied building during construction. Our system uses the output from a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system and a 3D CAD model of the structure in order to construct a spatial database to store images into the 3D CAD model space. This allows the user to perform a spatial query for images through spatial indexing into the 3D CAD model space. The image returned by the spatial query is used to extract metric information. The spatial database is also used to generate a 3D textured model which provides a visual as-built documentation.
