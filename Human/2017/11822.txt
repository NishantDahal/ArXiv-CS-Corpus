Optimal Relaying in Energy Harvesting Wireless Networks with Wireless-Powered Relays

In this paper, we consider a wireless cooperative network with an energy harvesting relay which is powered by the energy harvested from ambient RF waves, such as that of a data packet. At any given time, the relay operates either in the energy harvesting (EH) mode or the data decoding (DD) mode, but not both. Separate energy and data buffers are kept at the relay to store the harvested energy and decoded data packets, respectively. In this paper, we optimize a time switching policy that switches between the EH mode and DD mode to maximize the system throughput or minimize the average transmission delay. Both static and dynamic time switching policies are derived. In particular, static policies are the ones where EH or DD mode is selected with a pre-determined probability. In contrast, in a dynamic policy, the mode is selected dynamically according to the states of data and energy buffers. We prove that the throughput-optimal static and dynamic policies keep the relay data buffer at the boundary of stability. More specifically, we show that the throughput-optimal dynamic policy has a threshold-based structure. Moreover, we prove that the delay-optimal dynamic policy also has a threshold-based structure and keeps at most one packet at the relay. We notice that the delay-optimal and throughput-optimal dynamic policies coincide in most cases. However, it is not true for optimal static policies. Finally, through extensive numerical results, we show the efficiency of optimal dynamic policies compared with the static ones in different conditions.
