Parameterized Complexity of CSP for Infinite Constraint Languages

We study parameterized Constraint Satisfaction Problem for infinite constraint languages. The parameters that we study are weight of the satisfying assignment, number of constraints, maximum number of occurrences of a variable in the instance, and maximum number of occurrences of a variable in each constraint. A dichotomy theorem is already known for finite constraint languages with the weight parameter. We prove some general theorems that show, as new results, that some well-known problems are fixed-parameter tractable and some others are in W[1].
