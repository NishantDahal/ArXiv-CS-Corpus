Testing a Saturation-Based Theorem Prover: Experiences and Challenges (Extended Version)

This paper attempts to address the question of how best to assure the correctness of saturation-based automated theorem provers using our experience developing the theorem prover Vampire. We describe the techniques we currently employ to ensure that Vampire is correct and use this to motivate future challenges that need to be addressed to make this process more straightforward and to achieve better correctness guarantees.
