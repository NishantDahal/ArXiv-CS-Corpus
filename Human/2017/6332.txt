SREFI: Synthesis of Realistic Example Face Images

In this paper, we propose a novel face synthesis approach that can generate an arbitrarily large number of synthetic images of both real and synthetic identities. Thus a face image dataset can be expanded in terms of the number of identities represented and the number of images per identity using this approach, without the identity-labeling and privacy complications that come from downloading images from the web. To measure the visual fidelity and uniqueness of the synthetic face images and identities, we conducted face matching experiments with both human participants and a CNN pre-trained on a dataset of 2.6M real face images. To evaluate the stability of these synthetic faces, we trained a CNN model with an augmented dataset containing close to 200,000 synthetic faces. We used a snapshot of this trained CNN to recognize extremely challenging frontal (real) face images. Experiments showed training with the augmented faces boosted the face recognition performance of the CNN.
