Computability in the Lattice of Equivalence Relations

We investigate computability in the lattice of equivalence relations on the natural numbers. We mostly investigate whether the subsets of appropriately defined subrecursive equivalence relations -for example the set of all polynomial-time decidable equivalence relations- form sublattices of the lattice.
