Derivation of Network Reprogramming Protocol with Z3

Networks protocols are the heart of communication networks. An efficient network protocol does maximum utilization of the underlying network capabilities. Network Protocol synthesis is the process of synthesizing or deriving network specific protocols from the requirements of a given specific network. In this report, we present a step-by-step approach for the automated synthesis of network protocols from the network specifications. Using SMT solvers to automate the protocol generation is the key idea behind the presented synthesis approach. The protocols generated using this approach followed the most optimal way of data transmission for the given network requirements.
