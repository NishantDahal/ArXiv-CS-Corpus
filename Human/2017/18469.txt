Characterizations of o-polynomials by the Walsh transform

The notion of o-polynomial comes from finite projective geometry. In 2011 and later, it has been shown that those objects play an important role in symmetric cryptography and coding theory to design bent Boolean functions, bent vectorial Boolean functions, semi-bent functions and to construct good linear codes. In this note, we characterize o-polynomials by the Walsh transform of the associated vectorial functions.
