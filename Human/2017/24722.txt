On the Frequency Dependency of Radio Channel's Delay Spread: Analyses and Findings From mmMAGIC Multi-frequency Channel Sounding

This paper analyzes the frequency dependency of the radio propagation channel's root mean square (rms) delay spread (DS), based on the multi-frequency measurement campaigns in the mmMAGIC project. The campaigns cover indoor, outdoor, and outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) scenarios and a wide frequency range from 2 to 86 GHz. Several requirements have been identified that define the parameters which need to be aligned in order to make a reasonable comparison among the different channel sounders employed for this study. A new modelling approach enabling the evaluation of the statistical significance of the model parameters from different measurements and the establishment of a unified model is proposed. After careful analysis, the conclusion is that any frequency trend of the DS is small considering its confidence intervals. There is statistically significant difference from the 3GPP New Radio (NR) model TR 38.901, except for the O2I scenario.
