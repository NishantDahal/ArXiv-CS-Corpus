Resource Allocation for a Full-Duplex Base Station Aided OFDMA System

Exploiting full-duplex (FD) technology on base stations (BSs) is a promising solution to enhancing the system performance. Motivated by this, we revisit a full-duplex base station (FD-BS) aided OFDMA system, which consists of one BS, several uplink/downlink users and multiple subcarriers. A joint 3-dimensional (3D) mapping scheme among subcarriers, down-link users (DUEs), uplink users (UUEs) is considered as well as an associated power allocation optimization. In detail, we first decompose the complex 3D mapping problem into three 2-dimensional sub ones and solve them by using the iterative Hungarian method, respectively. Then based on the Lagrange dual method, we sequentially solve the power allocation and 3- dimensional mapping problem by fixing a dual point. Finally, the optimal solution can be obtained by utilizing the sub-gradient method. Unlike existing work that only solves either 3D mapping or power allocation problem but with a high computation complexity, we tackle both of them and have successfully reduced computation complexity from exponential to polynomial order. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed scheme.
