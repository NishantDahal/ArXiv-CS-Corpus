Equivalences Between Network Codes With Link Errors and Index Codes With Side Information Errors

In this paper, new equivalence relationships between a network code with link errors (NCLE) and an index code with side information errors (ICSIE) are studied. First, for a given network coding instance, the equivalent index coding instance is derived, where an NCLE is converted to the corresponding ICSIE and vice versa. Next, for a given index coding instance, the equivalent network coding instance is also derived, where an ICSIE is converted to the corresponding NCLE and vice versa if a pair of encoding functions of an original link and the duplicated link are functionally related in the network code. Finally, several properties of an NCLE are derived from those of the equivalent ICSIE using the fact that the NCLE and the ICSIE are equivalent.
