Sensing and Modeling Human Behavior Using Social Media and Mobile Data

In the past years we have witnessed the emergence of the new discipline of computational social science, which promotes a new data-driven and computation-based approach to social sciences. In this article we discuss how the availability of new technologies such as online social media and mobile smartphones has allowed researchers to passively collect human behavioral data at a scale and a level of granularity that were just unthinkable some years ago. We also discuss how these digital traces can then be used to prove (or disprove) existing theories and develop new models of human behavior.
