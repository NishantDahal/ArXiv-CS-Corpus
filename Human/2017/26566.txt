On the Conjugacy Problem in Certain Metabelian Groups

Weanalyzethecomputationalcomplexityofanalgorithmtosolve the conjugacy search problem in a certain family of metabelian groups. We prove that in general the time complexity of the conjugacy search problem for these groups is at most exponential. For a subfamily of groups we prove that the conjugacy search problem is polynomial. We also show that for a different subfamily the conjugacy search problem reduces to the discrete logarithm problem.
