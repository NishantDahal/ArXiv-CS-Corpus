Stable Desynchronization for Wireless Sensor Networks: (II) Performance Evaluation

In this paper, we evaluate M-DWARF performance by experimentation and simulation. We validate its functionalities on TelosB motes and compare its performance with EXT-DESYNC, and LIGHTWEIGHT on TOSSIM. On simulation, we test the algorithms on several multihop topologies and discuss both the average and problematic cases. In addition, we investigate the impacts of period length (T) and compare channel utilization fairness among the desynchronization algorithms. Finally, we propose a method to reduce desynchronization overhead.
