Epsilon-approximations and epsilon-nets

The use of random samples to approximate properties of geometric configurations has been an influential idea for both combinatorial and algorithmic purposes. This chapter considers two related notions---$ε$-approximations and $ε$-nets---that capture the most important quantitative properties that one would expect from a random sample with respect to an underlying geometric configuration.
