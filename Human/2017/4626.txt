Provenance Threat Modeling

Provenance systems are used to capture history metadata, applications include ownership attribution and determining the quality of a particular data set. Provenance systems are also used for debugging, process improvement, understanding data proof of ownership, certification of validity, etc. The provenance of data includes information about the processes and source data that leads to the current representation. In this paper we study the security risks provenance systems might be exposed to and recommend security solutions to better protect the provenance information.
