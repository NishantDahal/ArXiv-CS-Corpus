Reflections on Cyberethics Education for Millennial Software Engineers

Software is a key component of solutions for 21st Century problems. These problems are often "wicked", complex, and unpredictable. To provide the best possible solution, millennial software engineers must be prepared to make ethical decisions, thinking critically, and acting systematically. This reality demands continuous changes in educational systems and curricula delivery, as misjudgment might have serious social impact. This study aims to investigate and reflect on Software Engineering (SE) Programs, proposing a conceptual framework for analyzing cyberethics education and a set of suggestions on how to integrate it into the SE undergraduate curriculum.
