Rainbow matchings in properly-coloured multigraphs

Aharoni and Berger conjectured that in any bipartite multigraph that is properly edge-coloured by $n$ colours with at least $n + 1$ edges of each colour there must be a matching that uses each colour exactly once. In this paper we consider the same question without the bipartiteness assumption. We show that in any multigraph with edge multiplicities $o(n)$ that is properly edge-coloured by $n$ colours with at least $n + o(n)$ edges of each colour there must be a matching of size $n-O(1)$ that uses each colour at most once.
