Challenges and potentials for visible light communications: State of the art

Visible Light Communication is the emerging field in the area of Indoor Optical Wireless Communication which uses white light LEDs for transmitting data and light simultaneously. LEDs can be modulated at very high speeds which increases its efficiency and enabling it for the dual purposes of data communication and illumination simultaneously. Radio Frequency have some limitations which is not at par with the current demand of bandwidth but using visible light, it is possible to achieve higher data rates per user. In this paper, we discuss some challenges, potentials and possible future applications for this new technology. Basically, visible light communication is for indoor application capable of multiuser access. We also design a very basic illumination pattern inside a room using uniform power distribution.
