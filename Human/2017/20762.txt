Alternate Derivation of Geometric Extended Kalman Filter by MEKF Approach

This note is devoted to deriving the measurement update of the geometric extended Kalman filter using the multiplicative extended Kalman filtering approach, resulting in the attitude estimator referred as geometric multiplicative extended Kalman filter. The equivalence of the derived geometric multiplicative extended Kalman filter and geometric extended Kalman filter is also demonstrated in this note.
