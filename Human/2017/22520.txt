Towards a Magnetically Actuated Laser Scanner for Endoscopic Microsurgeries

This article presents the design and assembly of a novel magnetically actuated endoscopic laser scanner device. The device is designed to perform 2D position control and high speed scanning of a fiber-based laser for operation in narrow workspaces. The device includes laser focusing optics to allow non-contact incisions and tablet-based control interface for intuitive teleoperation. The performance of the proof-of-concept device is analysed through controllability and the usability studies. The computer-controlled high-speed scanning demonstrates repeatable results with 21 um precision and a stable response up to 48 Hz. Teleoperation user trials, were performed for trajectory-following tasks with 12 subjects, show an accuracy of 39 um. The innovative design of the device can be applied to both surgical and diagnostic (imaging) applications in endoscopic systems.
