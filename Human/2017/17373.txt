Kolmogorov Complexity and Information Content

In this paper, we revisit a central concept in Kolmogorov complexity in which one would equate program-size complexity with information content. Despite the fact that Kolmogorov complexity has been widely accepted as an objective measure of the information content of a string, it has been the subject of many criticisms including the fundamental one directed by logicians and philosophers towards the statistical and semantical theories of information, which is about confusing an object and its name. In this paper, we clarify a number of subtle issues that are at the center of this debate.
