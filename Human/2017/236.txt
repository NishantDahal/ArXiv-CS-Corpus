Sorting by Reversals and the Theory of 4-Regular Graphs

We show that the theory of sorting by reversals fits into the well-established theory of circuit partitions of 4-regular multigraphs (which also involves the combinatorial structures of circle graphs and delta-matroids). In this way, we expose strong connections between the two theories that have not been fully appreciated before. We also discuss a generalization of sorting by reversals involving the double-cut-and-join (DCJ) operation. Finally, we also show that the theory of sorting by reversals is closely related to that of gene assembly in ciliates.
