An Improved Dictatorship Test with Perfect Completeness

A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is called a dictator if it depends on exactly one variable i.e $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = x_i$ for some $i\in [n]$. In this work, we study a $k$-query dictatorship test. Dictatorship tests are central in proving many hardness results for constraint satisfaction problems.
  The dictatorship test is said to have {\em perfect completeness} if it accepts any dictator function. The {\em soundness} of a test is the maximum probability with which it accepts any function far from a dictator. Our main result is a $k$-query dictatorship test with perfect completeness and soundness $ \frac{2k + 1}{2^k}$, where $k$ is of the form $2^t -1$ for any integer $t > 2$. This improves upon the result of \cite{TY15} which gave a dictatorship test with soundness $ \frac{2k + 3}{2^k}$.
