We present an efficient algorithm to compute such a $\eps'$-approximation of size $\kalg$, where $\eps'$ is function of $\eps$, and $\kalg$ is a function of the minimum size $\kopt$ of such an $\eps$-approximation. Surprisingly, there is no dependency on the dimension $d$ in both bounds. Furthermore, every point of $\dataset$ can be $\eps$-approximated by a convex-combination of points of $\algset$ that is $O(1/\eps^2)$-sparse.
  Our result can be viewed as a method for sparse, convex autoencoding: approximately representing the data in a compact way using sparse combinations of a small subset $\algset$ of the original data. The new algorithm can be kernelized, and it preserves sparsity in the original input.
