Antenna Selection in MIMO Cognitive Radio-Inspired NOMA Systems

This letter investigates a joint antenna selection (AS) problem for a MIMO cognitive radio-inspired non-orthogonal multiple access (CR-NOMA) network. In particular, a new computationally efficient joint AS algorithm, namely subset-based joint AS (SJ-AS), is proposed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the secondary user under the condition that the quality of service (QoS) of the primary user is satisfied. The asymptotic closed-form expression of the outage performance for SJ-AS is derived, and the minimal outage probability achieved by SJ-AS among all possible joint AS schemes is proved. The provided numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.
