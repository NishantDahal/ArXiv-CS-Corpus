A study of posture judgement on vehicles using wearable acceleration sensor

We study methods to estimate drivers' posture in vehicles using acceleration data of wearable sensor and conduct field tests. To prevent fatal accidents, demands for safety management of bus and taxi are high. However, acceleration of vehicles is added to wearable sensor in vehicles. Therefore, we study methods to estimate driving posture using acceleration data acquired from shirt type wearable sensor hitoe and conduct field tests.
