A Temporal Tree Decomposition for Generating Temporal Graphs

Discovering the underlying structures present in large real world graphs is a fundamental scientific problem. Recent work at the intersection of formal language theory and graph theory has found that a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (HRG) can be extracted from a tree decomposition of any graph. This HRG can be used to generate new graphs that share properties that are similar to the original graph. Because the extracted HRG is directly dependent on the shape and contents of the of tree decomposition, it is unlikely that informative graph-processes are actually being captured with the extraction algorithm. To address this problem, the current work presents a new extraction algorithm called temporal HRG (tHRG) that learns HRG production rules from a temporal tree decomposition of the graph. We observe problems with the assumptions that are made in a temporal HRG model. In experiments on large real world networks, we show and provide reasoning as to why tHRG does not perform as well as HRG and other graph generators.
