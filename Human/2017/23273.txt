MaaS and GDPR: an overview

In MaaS (Mobility as a Service), means of transport are virtualized in mobility resources and provided to users using the Internet.

This contribution, after a short description of MaaS and an introduction to the issues of data protection in ITS, explores the impact of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the European Union, detecting possible threats and remedies and suggesting a plausible approach.
