Learning to Predict Streaming Video QoE: Distortions, Rebuffering and Memory

Mobile streaming video data accounts for a large and increasing percentage of wireless network traffic. The available bandwidths of modern wireless networks are often unstable, leading to difficulties in delivering smooth, high-quality video. Streaming service providers such as Netflix and YouTube attempt to adapt their systems to adjust in response to these bandwidth limitations by changing the video bitrate or, failing that, allowing playback interruptions (rebuffering). Being able to predict end user' quality of experience (QoE) resulting from these adjustments could lead to perceptually-driven network resource allocation strategies that would deliver streaming content of higher quality to clients, while being cost effective for providers. Existing objective QoE models only consider the effects on user QoE of video quality changes or playback interruptions. For streaming applications, adaptive network strategies may involve a combination of dynamic bitrate allocation along with playback interruptions when the available bandwidth reaches a very low value. Towards effectively predicting user QoE, we propose Video Assessment of TemporaL Artifacts and Stalls (Video ATLAS): a machine learning framework where we combine a number of QoE-related features, including objective quality features, rebuffering-aware features and memory-driven features to make QoE predictions. We evaluated our learning-based QoE prediction model on the recently designed LIVE-Netflix Video QoE Database which consists of practical playout patterns, where the videos are afflicted by both quality changes and rebuffering events, and found that it provides improved performance over state-of-the-art video quality metrics while generalizing well on different datasets. The proposed algorithm is made publicly available at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/Quality/VideoATLAS release_v2.rar.
