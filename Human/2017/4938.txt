Wireless Powered Dual-Hop Multi-Antenna Relaying Systems: Impact of CSI and Antenna Correlation

This paper investigates the impact of the channel state information (CSI) and antenna correlation at the multi-antenna relay on the performance of wireless powered dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying systems. Depending on the available CSI at the relay, two different scenarios are considered, namely, instantaneous CSI and statistical CSI where the relay has access only to the antenna correlation matrix. Adopting the power-splitting architecture, we present a detailed performance study for both cases. Closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability and ergodic capacity. In addition, simple high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage approximations are obtained. Our results show that, antenna correlation itself does not affect the achievable diversity order, the availability of CSI at the relay determines the achievable diversity order. Full diversity order can be achieved with instantaneous CSI, while only a diversity order of one can be achieved with statistical CSI. In addition, the transmit antenna correlation and receive antenna correlation exhibit different impact on the ergodic capacity. Moreover, the impact of antenna correlation on the ergodic capacity also depends heavily on the available CSI and operating SNR.
