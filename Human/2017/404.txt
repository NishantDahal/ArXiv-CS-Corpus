Bandwidth management VMs live migration in wireless fog computing for 5G networks

Live virtual machine migration aims at enabling the dynamic balanced use of the networking/computing physical resources of virtualized data-centers, so to lead to reduced energy consumption. Here, we analytically characterize, prototype in software and test an optimal bandwidth manager for live migration of VMs in wireless channel. In this paper we present the optimal tunable-complexity bandwidth manager (TCBM) for the QoS live migration of VMs under a wireless channel from smartphone to access point. The goal is the minimization of the migration-induced communication energy under service level agreement (SLA)-induced hard constrains on the total migration time, downtime and overall available bandwidth.
