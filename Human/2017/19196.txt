Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Robust Speech Recognition via Variational Autoencoder-Based Data Augmentation

Domain mismatch between training and testing can lead to significant degradation in performance in many machine learning scenarios. Unfortunately, this is not a rare situation for automatic speech recognition deployments in real-world applications. Research on robust speech recognition can be regarded as trying to overcome this domain mismatch issue. In this paper, we address the unsupervised domain adaptation problem for robust speech recognition, where both source and target domain speech are presented, but word transcripts are only available for the source domain speech. We present novel augmentation-based methods that transform speech in a way that does not change the transcripts. Specifically, we first train a variational autoencoder on both source and target domain data (without supervision) to learn a latent representation of speech. We then transform nuisance attributes of speech that are irrelevant to recognition by modifying the latent representations, in order to augment labeled training data with additional data whose distribution is more similar to the target domain. The proposed method is evaluated on the CHiME-4 dataset and reduces the absolute word error rate (WER) by as much as 35% compared to the non-adapted baseline.
