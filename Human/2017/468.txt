Antenna Deployment Method for MIMO Radar under the Situation of Multiple Interference Regions

In this paper, considering multiple interference regions simultaneously, an optimal antenna deployment problem for distributed Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) radar is investigated. The optimal antenna deployment problem is solved by proposing an antenna deployment method based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Firstly, we construct a multi-objective optimization problem for MIMO radar antenna deployment by choosing the interference power densities of different regions as objective functions. Then, to obtain the optimal deployment result without wasting time and computational resources, an iteration convergence criterion based on interval distance is proposed. The iteration convergence criterion can be used to stop the MOPSO optimization process efficiently when the optimal antenna deployment algorithm reaches the desired convergence level. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the validity of the proposed algorithm.
