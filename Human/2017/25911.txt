Proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving

This volume of EPTCS contains the proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Proof Exchange for Theorem Proving (PxTP 2017), held on September 23-24, 2017 as part of the Tableaux, FroCoS and ITP conferences in Brasilia, Brazil. The PxTP workshop series brings together researchers working on various aspects of communication, integration, and cooperation between reasoning systems and formalisms, with a special focus on proofs. The progress in computer-aided reasoning, both automated and interactive, during the past decades, made it possible to build deduction tools that are increasingly more applicable to a wider range of problems and are able to tackle larger problems progressively faster. In recent years, cooperation between such tools in larger systems has demonstrated the potential to reduce the amount of manual intervention. Cooperation between reasoning systems relies on availability of theoretical formalisms and practical tools to exchange problems, proofs, and models. The PxTP workshop series strives to encourage such cooperation by inviting contributions on all aspects of cooperation between reasoning tools, whether automatic or interactive.
