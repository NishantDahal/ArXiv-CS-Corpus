Cryptanalyzing an Image-Scrambling Encryption Algorithm of Pixel Bits

Position scrambling (permutation) is widely used in multimedia encryption schemes and some international encryption standards, such as the Data Encryption Standard and the Advanced Encryption Standard. In this article, the authors re-evaluate the security of a typical image-scrambling encryption algorithm (ISEA). Using the internal correlation remaining in the cipher image, they disclose important visual information of the corresponding plain image in a ciphertext-only attack scenario. Furthermore, they found that the real scrambling domain--the position-scrambling scope of ISEA's scrambled elements--can be used to support an efficient known or chosen-plaintext attack on it. Detailed experimental results have verified these points and demonstrate that some advanced multimedia processing techniques can facilitate the cryptanalysis of multimedia encryption algorithms.
