Generalized Entropy Agglomeration

Entropy Agglomeration (EA) is a hierarchical clustering algorithm introduced in 2013. Here, we generalize it to define Generalized Entropy Agglomeration (GEA) that can work with multiset blocks and blocks with rational occurrence numbers. We also introduce a numerical categorization procedure to apply GEA to numerical datasets. The software REBUS 2.0 is published with these capabilities: http://fidaner.wordpress.com/science/rebus2
