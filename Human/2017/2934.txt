Handwritten Recognition Using SVM, KNN and Neural Network

Handwritten recognition (HWR) is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from source such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. In this paper we will using three (3) classification t o re cognize the handwritten which is SVM, KNN and Neural Network.
