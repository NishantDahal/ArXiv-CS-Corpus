An FPTAS for the Knapsack Problem with Parametric Weights

In this paper, we investigate the parametric weight knapsack problem, in which the item weights are affine functions of the form $w_i(λ) = a_i + λ\cdot b_i$ for $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ depending on a real-valued parameter $λ$. The aim is to provide a solution for all values of the parameter. It is well-known that any exact algorithm for the problem may need to output an exponential number of knapsack solutions. We present the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the problem that, for any desired precision $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$, computes $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate solutions for all values of the parameter. Our FPTAS is based on two different approaches and achieves a running time of $\mathcal{O}(n^3/\varepsilon^2 \cdot \min\{ \log^2 P, n^2 \} \cdot \min\{\log M, n \log (n/\varepsilon) / \log(n \log (n/\varepsilon) )\})$ where $P$ is an upper bound on the optimal profit and $M := \max\{W, n \cdot \max\{a_i,b_i: i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}\}\}$ for a knapsack with capacity $W$.
