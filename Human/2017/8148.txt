On the Design and Invariants of a Ruled Surface

This paper deals with a kind of design of a ruled surface. It combines concepts from the fields of computer aided geometric design and kinematics. A dual unit spherical Bézier-like curve on the dual unit sphere (DUS) is obtained with respect the control points by a new method. So, with the aid of Study [1] transference principle, a dual unit spherical Bézier-like curve corresponds to a ruled surface. Furthermore, closed ruled surfaces are determined via control points and integral invariants of these surfaces are investigated. The results are illustrated by examples.
