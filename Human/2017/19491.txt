Recent Advances in Local Energy Trading in the Smart Grid Based on Game--Theoretic Approaches

The global move towards efficient energy consumption and production has led to remarkable advancements in the design of the smart grid infrastructure. Local energy trading is one way forward. It typically refers to the transfer of energy from an entity of the smart grid surplus energy to one with a deficit. In this paper, we present a detailed review of the recent advances in the application of game--theoretic methods to local energy trading scenarios. An extensive description of a complete game theory-based energy trading framework is presented. It includes a taxonomy of the methods and an introduction to the smart grid architecture with a focus on renewable energy generation and energy storage. Finally, we present a critical evaluation of the current shortcomings and identify areas for future research.
