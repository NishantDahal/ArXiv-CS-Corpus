A Unified Ensemble of Concatenated Convolutional Codes

We introduce a unified ensemble for turbo-like codes (TCs) that contains the four main classes of TCs: parallel concatenated codes, serially concatenated codes, hybrid concatenated codes, and braided convolutional codes. We show that for each of the original classes of TCs, it is possible to find an equivalent ensemble by proper selection of the design parameters in the unified ensemble. We also derive the density evolution (DE) equations for this ensemble over the binary erasure channel. The thresholds obtained from the DE indicate that the TC ensembles from the unified ensemble have similar asymptotic behavior to the original TC ensembles.
