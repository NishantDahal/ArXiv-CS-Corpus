On One Generalization of LRC Codes with Availability

We investigate one possible generalization of locally recoverable codes (LRC) with all-symbol locality and availability when recovering sets can intersect in a small number of coordinates. This feature allows us to increase the achievable code rate and still meet load balancing requirements. In this paper we derive an upper bound for the rate of such codes and give explicit constructions of codes with such a property. These constructions utilize LRC codes developed by Wang et al.
