A Synthetic Statistical MIMO PLC Channel Model Applied to an In-Home Scenario

This paper proposes a synthetic statistical top-down MIMO power line communications channel model based on a pure phenomenological approach. The basic idea consists of directly synthesizing the experimental channel statistical properties to obtain an extremely compact model that requires a small set of parameters. The model is derived from the analysis of the in-home 2 $\times$ 3 MIMO PLC channel data set obtained by the ETSI Specialist Task Force 410 measurement campaign in the band 1.8-100 MHz. The challenge of modeling the channel statistical correlation, exhibited among the frequencies and between the MIMO modes, in compact form is tackled and it is shown that a small set of parameters can be used to reconstruct such a correlation behavior. The model is validated and compared to the measured channels, showing a good agreement in terms of average channel gain, root-mean-square delay spread, coherence bandwidth, and channel capacity distribution.
