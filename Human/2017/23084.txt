Assessing Agile Transformation Success Factors

Research on success factors involved in the agile transformation process is not conclusive and there is still need for guidelines to help in the transformation process considering the organizational context (culture, values, needs, reality and goals). The usage of success factors as a tool to help agile adoption raises the following research question: What are the success factors for an organization and their teams in preparation for the agile transformation process? This research presents an assessment of the organizational environment including the company's goals and the perception of the team members to provide awareness of how the organization should prepare for the next steps in the agile transformation. The findings show that a company based in Chicago, USA, succeeded implementing customer involvement and self-organized teams but faces challenges with measurement models and training. The main contribution of the research is understand which success factors exist in their environment and how they can be used during agile adoption.
