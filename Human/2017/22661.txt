Gazing into the Abyss: Real-time Gaze Estimation

Gaze and face tracking algorithms have traditionally battled a compromise between computational complexity and accuracy; the most accurate neural net algorithms cannot be implemented in real time, but less complex real-time algorithms suffer from higher error. This project seeks to better bridge that gap by improving on real-time eye and facial recognition algorithms in order to develop accurate, real-time gaze estimation with an emphasis on minimizing training data and computational complexity. Our goal is to use eye and facial recognition techniques to enable users to perform limited tasks based on gaze and facial input using only a standard, low-quality web cam found in most modern laptops and smart phones and the limited computational power and training data typical of those scenarios. We therefore identified seven promising, fundamentally different algorithms based on different user features and developed one outstanding, one workable, and one honorable mention gaze tracking pipelines that match the performance of modern gaze trackers while using no training data.
