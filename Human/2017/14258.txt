Photonic Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter Wave RoF Systems

Large propagation path loss and limited scattering of millimeter wave (mmwave) channels create new challenges for physical layer signal processing. Hence, in this article, we propose a photonic hybrid precoding model for mmwave radio-over-fiber systems that overcomes hardware constraints on radio frequency precoding. With help of silicon photonic integrated circuits (Si-PICs), the photonic precoding strategy combats the large losses of mmwave and mitigates inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed model can offer significant coding gains over conventional precoding systems.
