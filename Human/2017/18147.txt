Cost-Based Assessment of Partitioning Algorithms of Agent-Based Systems on Hybrid Cloud Environments

Distributing agent-based simulators reveals many challenges while deploying them on a hybrid cloud infrastructure. In fact, a researcher's main motivations by running simulations on hybrid clouds, are reaching more scalable systems as well as reducing monetary costs. Indeed, hybrid cloud environment, despite providing scalability and effective control over proper data, requires an efficient deployment strategy combining both an efficient partitioning mechanism and cost savings. In this paper, we propose a cost deployment model dedicated to distributed agent-based simulation systems. This cost model, combining general performance partitioning criteria as well as monetary costs, is used to evaluate cluster and grid based partitioning algorithms on hybrid cloud environments. The first experimental results show that, for a given agent-based model, a good partitioning method used with the suitable hybrid cloud environment lead to an efficient and economic deployment.
