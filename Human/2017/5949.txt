A floating point division unit based on Taylor-Series expansion algorithm and Iterative Logarithmic Multiplier

Floating point division, even though being an infrequent operation in the traditional sense, is indis- pensable when it comes to a range of non-traditional applications such as K-Means Clustering and QR Decomposition just to name a few. In such applications, hardware support for floating point division would boost the performance of the entire system. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for a floating point division unit based on the Taylor-series expansion algorithm. We show that the Iterative Logarithmic Multiplier is very well suited to be used as a part of this architecture. We propose an implementation of the powering unit that can calculate an odd power and an even power of a number simultaneously, meanwhile having little hardware overhead when compared to the Iterative Logarithmic Multiplier.
