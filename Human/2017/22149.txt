The Extension Theorem for Bi-invariant Weights over Frobenius Rings and Frobenius Bimodules

We give a sufficient condition for a bi-invariant weight on a Frobenius bimodule to satisfy the extension property. This condition applies to bi-invariant weights on a finite Frobenius ring as a special case. The complex-valued functions on a Frobenius bimodule are viewed as a module over the semigroup ring of the multiplicative semigroup of the coefficient ring.
