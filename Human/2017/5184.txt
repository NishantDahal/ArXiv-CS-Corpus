DTNC: A New Server-side Data Cleansing Framework for Cellular Trajectory Services

It is essential for the cellular network operators to provide cellular location services to meet the needs of their users and mobile applications. However, cellular locations, estimated by network-based methods at the server-side, bear with {\it high spatial errors} and {\it arbitrary missing locations}. Moreover, auxiliary sensor data at the client-side are not available to the operators. In this paper, we study the {\em cellular trajectory cleansing problem} and propose an innovative data cleansing framework, namely \underline{D}ynamic \underline{T}ransportation \underline{N}etwork based \underline{C}leansing (DTNC) to improve the quality of cellular locations delivered in online cellular trajectory services. We maintain a dynamic transportation network (DTN), which associates a network edge with a probabilistic distribution of travel times updated continuously. In addition, we devise an object motion model, namely, {\em travel-time-aware hidden semi-Markov model} ({\em TT-HsMM}), which is used to infer the most probable traveled edge sequences on DTN. To validate our ideas, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world cellular data provided by a major cellular network operator and a GPS dataset collected by smartphones as the ground truth. In the experiments, DTNC displays significant advantages over six state-of-the-art techniques.
