Efficiently Computing Real Roots of Sparse Polynomials

We propose an efficient algorithm to compute the real roots of a sparse polynomial $f\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ having $k$ non-zero real-valued coefficients. It is assumed that arbitrarily good approximations of the non-zero coefficients are given by means of a coefficient oracle. For a given positive integer $L$, our algorithm returns disjoint disks $Δ_{1},\ldots,Δ_{s}\subset\mathbb{C}$, with $s<2k$, centered at the real axis and of radius less than $2^{-L}$ together with positive integers $μ_{1},\ldots,μ_{s}$ such that each disk $Δ_{i}$ contains exactly $μ_{i}$ roots of $f$ counted with multiplicity. In addition, it is ensured that each real root of $f$ is contained in one of the disks. If $f$ has only simple real roots, our algorithm can also be used to isolate all real roots.
  The bit complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in $k$ and $\log n$, and near-linear in $L$ and $τ$, where $2^{-τ}$ and $2^τ$ constitute lower and upper bounds on the absolute values of the non-zero coefficients of $f$, and $n$ is the degree of $f$. For root isolation, the bit complexity is polynomial in $k$ and $\log n$, and near-linear in $τ$ and $\logσ^{-1}$, where $σ$ denotes the separation of the real roots.
