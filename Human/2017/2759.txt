Measures of Threaded Discussion Properties

In this paper, we present a set of measures to quantify certain properties of threaded discussions, which are ubiquitous in online learn-ing platforms. In particular, we address how to measure the redundancy of posts, the compactness of topics, and the degree of hierarchy in sub-threads. This preliminary work would very much benefit from discussion and serves as a starting point for ultimately creating optimal structures of threaded discussions depending on the context.
