Getting Virtualized Wireless Sensor Networks IaaS Ready for PaaS

With the recent advances in sensor hardware and software, architectures for virtualized Wireless Sensor Networks (vWSNs) are now emerging. Through node- and network-level virtualization, vWSNs can be offered as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) which can aid in realizing the true potential of Internet-of-Things (IoT). Cloud computing offers elastic provisioning of large-scale infrastructures to multiple concurrent users where Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) interacts with IaaS in order to efficiently host and execute applications over these infrastructures. Amalgamating IoT with cloud computing potentially allows rapid application and service provisioning in an efficient, scalable and robust manner. However, interactions between vWSNs and PaaS are largely an unexplored area. Indeed, existing vWSN IaaS are not yet ready for PaaS. This paper proposes a vWSN IaaS architecture which is ready for interactions with PaaS. The proposed architecture is based on our previous works and is rooted in the fundamental differences between traditional IaaS and vWSN IaaS. We built a prototype using Java Sunspot as the WSN tool kit and made early performance measurements.
