Verification of Concurrent Engineering Software Using CSM Models

An engineering design process may involve software modules that can executed concurrently. Concurrent modules can be very easily subject to some synchronization errors. This paper discusses verification process for such engineering software. We present a method for verification that requires several steps. First, the state diagram models are constructed that describe the design iterations and interactions with the designer. Next, the state diagram models are transformed into concurrent state machines (CSM). After that, the CSM models are analyzed in order to verify their correctness. In this phase, the modifications are performed in necessary. In the last phase the code is generated. The tools to support our method can be called new concurrent CASE tools. Using these tools the engineering software can be created that is verified for correctness in respect to concurrent execution.
