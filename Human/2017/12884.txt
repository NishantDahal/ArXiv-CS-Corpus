Context-Independent Polyphonic Piano Onset Transcription with an Infinite Training Dataset

Many of the recent approaches to polyphonic piano note onset transcription require training a machine learning model on a large piano database. However, such approaches are limited by dataset availability; additional training data is difficult to produce, and proposed systems often perform poorly on novel recording conditions. We propose a method to quickly synthesize arbitrary quantities of training data, avoiding the need for curating large datasets. Various aspects of piano note dynamics - including nonlinearity of note signatures with velocity, different articulations, temporal clustering of onsets, and nonlinear note partial interference - are modeled to match the characteristics of real pianos. Our method also avoids the disentanglement problem, a recently noted issue affecting machine-learning based approaches. We train a feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers on our generated training data and achieve both good transcription performance on the large MAPS piano dataset and excellent generalization qualities.
