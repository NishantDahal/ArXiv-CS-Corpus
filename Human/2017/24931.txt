On the Information Dimension of Multivariate Gaussian Processes

The authors have recently defined the RÃ©nyi information dimension rate $d(\{X_t\})$ of a stationary stochastic process $\{X_t,\,t\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ as the entropy rate of the uniformly-quantized process divided by minus the logarithm of the quantizer step size $1/m$ in the limit as $m\to\infty$ (B. Geiger and T. Koch, "On the information dimension rate of stochastic processes," in Proc. IEEE Int. Symp. Inf. Theory (ISIT), Aachen, Germany, June 2017). For Gaussian processes with a given spectral distribution function $F_X$, they showed that the information dimension rate equals the Lebesgue measure of the set of harmonics where the derivative of $F_X$ is positive. This paper extends this result to multivariate Gaussian processes with a given matrix-valued spectral distribution function $F_{\mathbf{X}}$. It is demonstrated that the information dimension rate equals the average rank of the derivative of $F_{\mathbf{X}}$. As a side result, it is shown that the scale and translation invariance of information dimension carries over from random variables to stochastic processes.
