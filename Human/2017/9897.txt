A proposal for ethically traceable artificial intelligence

Although the problem of a critique of robotic behavior in near-unanimous agreement to human norms seems intractable, a starting point of such an ambition is a framework of the collection of knowledge a priori and experience a posteriori categorized as a set of synthetical judgments available to the intelligence, translated into computer code. If such a proposal were successful, an algorithm with ethically traceable behavior and cogent equivalence to human cognition is established. This paper will propose the application of Kant's critique of reason to current programming constructs of an autonomous intelligent system.
