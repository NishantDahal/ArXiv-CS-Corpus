License Plate Detection and Recognition Using Deeply Learned Convolutional Neural Networks

This work details Sighthounds fully automated license plate detection and recognition system. The core technology of the system is built using a sequence of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) interlaced with accurate and efficient algorithms. The CNNs are trained and fine-tuned so that they are robust under different conditions (e.g. variations in pose, lighting, occlusion, etc.) and can work across a variety of license plate templates (e.g. sizes, backgrounds, fonts, etc). For quantitative analysis, we show that our system outperforms the leading license plate detection and recognition technology i.e. ALPR on several benchmarks. Our system is available to developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at https://www.sighthound.com/products/cloud
