COMBINE: a novel drug discovery platform designed to capture insight and experience of users

The insight and experience gained by a researcher are often lost because the current productive and analytics software are inherently data-centric, disconnected, and scattered. The connected nature of insight and experience can be captured if the applications themselves are connected. How connected applications concept is implemented in COnstruct cheMical and BIological NEtwork (COMBINE), a novel user-centric drug discovery platform, is described. Using publicly available data, how COMBINE users capture insight and experience is explained, and how COMBINE users perform data organization, data sharing, data analysis, and data visualization is illustrated.
