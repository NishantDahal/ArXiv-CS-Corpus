A Short Survey on Bounding the Union Probability using Partial Information

This is a short survey on existing upper and lower bounds on the probability of the union of a finite number of events using partial information given in terms of the individual or pairwise event probabilities (or their sums). New proofs for some of the existing bounds are provided and new observations regarding the existing Gallot--Kounias bound are given.
