A new adaptive method for hiding data in images

LSB method is one of the well-known steganography methods which hides the message bits into the least significant bit of pixel values. This method changes the statistical information of images, which causes to have an unsecured channel. To increase the security of this method against the steganalysis methods, in this paper an adaptive method for hiding data into images will be proposed. So, the amount of data and the method which is used for hiding data in each area of image will be different. Experimental results show that the security of the proposed method is higher than general LSB method and in some cases the capacity of the carrier signal is increased.
