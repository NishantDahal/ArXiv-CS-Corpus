A Method with Feedback for Aggregation of Group Incomplete Pair-Wise Comparisons

A method for aggregation of expert estimates in small groups is proposed. The method is based on combinatorial approach to decomposition of pair-wise comparison matrices and to processing of expert data. It also uses the basic principles of Analytic Hierarchy/Network Process approaches, such as building of criteria hierarchy to decompose and describe the problem, and evaluation of objects by means of pair-wise comparisons. It allows to derive priorities based on group incomplete pair-wise comparisons and to organize feedback with experts in order to achieve sufficient agreement of their estimates. Double entropy inter-rater index is suggested for usage as agreement measure. Every expert is given an opportunity to use the scale, in which the degree of detail (number of points/grades) most adequately reflects this expert's competence in the issue under consideration, for every single pair comparison. The method takes all conceptual levels of individual expert competence (subject domain, specific problem, individual pair-wise comparison matrix, separate pair-wise comparison) into consideration. The method is intended to be used in the process of strategic planning in weakly-structured subject domains.
