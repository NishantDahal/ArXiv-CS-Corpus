Action Recognition with Dynamic Image Networks

We introduce the concept of "dynamic image", a novel compact representation of videos useful for video analysis, particularly in combination with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A dynamic image encodes temporal data such as RGB or optical flow videos by using the concept of `rank pooling'. The idea is to learn a ranking machine that captures the temporal evolution of the data and to use the parameters of the latter as a representation. When a linear ranking machine is used, the resulting representation is in the form of an image, which we call dynamic because it summarizes the video dynamics in addition of appearance. This is a powerful idea because it allows to convert any video to an image so that existing CNN models pre-trained for the analysis of still images can be immediately extended to videos. We also present an efficient and effective approximate rank pooling operator, accelerating standard rank pooling algorithms by orders of magnitude, and formulate that as a CNN layer. This new layer allows generalizing dynamic images to dynamic feature maps. We demonstrate the power of the new representations on standard benchmarks in action recognition achieving state-of-the-art performance.
