The Paulsen Problem, Continuous Operator Scaling, and Smoothed Analysis

The Paulsen problem is a basic open problem in operator theory: Given vectors $u_1, \ldots, u_n \in \mathbb R^d$ that are $ε$-nearly satisfying the Parseval's condition and the equal norm condition, is it close to a set of vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in \mathbb R^d$ that exactly satisfy the Parseval's condition and the equal norm condition? Given $u_1, \ldots, u_n$, the squared distance (to the set of exact solutions) is defined as $\inf_{v} \sum_{i=1}^n \| u_i - v_i \|_2^2$ where the infimum is over the set of exact solutions. Previous results show that the squared distance of any $ε$-nearly solution is at most $O({\rm{poly}}(d,n,ε))$ and there are $ε$-nearly solutions with squared distance at least $Ω(dε)$. The fundamental open question is whether the squared distance can be independent of the number of vectors $n$.
  We answer this question affirmatively by proving that the squared distance of any $ε$-nearly solution is $O(d^{13/2} ε)$. Our approach is based on a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm and consists of two parts. First, we define a dynamical system based on operator scaling and use it to prove that the squared distance of any $ε$-nearly solution is $O(d^2 n ε)$. Then, we show that by randomly perturbing the input vectors, the dynamical system will converge faster and the squared distance of an $ε$-nearly solution is $O(d^{5/2} ε)$ when $n$ is large enough and $ε$ is small enough. To analyze the convergence of the dynamical system, we develop some new techniques in lower bounding the operator capacity, a concept introduced by Gurvits to analyze the operator scaling algorithm.
