A Visual Representation of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus

In this paper we present a data visualization method together with its potential usefulness in digital humanities and philosophy of language. We compile a multilingual parallel corpus from different versions of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, including the original in German and translations into English, Spanish, French, and Russian. Using this corpus, we compute a similarity measure between propositions and render a visual network of relations for different languages.
