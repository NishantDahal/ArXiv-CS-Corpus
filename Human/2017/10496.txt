User Activity Detection in Massive Random Access: Compressed Sensing vs. Coded Slotted ALOHA

Machine-type communication services in mobile cel- lular systems are currently evolving with an aim to efficiently address a massive-scale user access to the system. One of the key problems in this respect is to efficiently identify active users in order to allocate them resources for the subsequent transmissions. In this paper, we examine two recently suggested approaches for user activity detection: compressed-sensing (CS) and coded slotted ALOHA (CSA), and provide their comparison in terms of performance vs resource utilization. Our preliminary results show that CS-based approach is able to provide the target user activity detection performance with less overall system resource utilization. However, this comes at a price of lower energy- efficiency per user, as compared to CSA-based approach.
