On Energy Efficient Uplink Multi-User MIMO with Shared LNA Control

Implementation cost and power consumption are two important considerations in modern wireless communications, particularly in large-scale multi-antenna systems where the number of individual radio-frequency (RF) chains may be significantly larger than before. In this work, we propose to deploy a single low-noise amplifier (LNA) on the uplink multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) receiver to cover all antennas. This architecture, although favorable from the perspective of cost and power consumption, introduces challenges in the LNA gain control and user transmit power control. We formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem under practical system constraints, and prove that it is a constrained quasi-concave optimization problem. We then propose an efficient algorithm, Bisection -- Gradient Assisted Interior Point (B-GAIP), that solves this optimization problem. The optimality, convergence and complexity of B-GAIP are analyzed, and further corroborated via numerical simulations. In particular, the performance loss due to using a shared LNA as opposed to separate LNAs in each RF chain, when using B-GAIP to determine the LNA gain and user transmit power, is very small in both centralized and distributed MIMO systems.
