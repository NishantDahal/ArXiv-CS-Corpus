Deep Self-Paced Learning for Person Re-Identification

Person re-identification (Re-ID) usually suffers from noisy samples with background clutter and mutual occlusion, which makes it extremely difficult to distinguish different individuals across the disjoint camera views. In this paper, we propose a novel deep self-paced learning (DSPL) algorithm to alleviate this problem, in which we apply a self-paced constraint and symmetric regularization to help the relative distance metric training the deep neural network, so as to learn the stable and discriminative features for person Re-ID. Firstly, we propose a soft polynomial regularizer term which can derive the adaptive weights to samples based on both the training loss and model age. As a result, the high-confidence fidelity samples will be emphasized and the low-confidence noisy samples will be suppressed at early stage of the whole training process. Such a learning regime is naturally implemented under a self-paced learning (SPL) framework, in which samples weights are adaptively updated based on both model age and sample loss using an alternative optimization method. Secondly, we introduce a symmetric regularizer term to revise the asymmetric gradient back-propagation derived by the relative distance metric, so as to simultaneously minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance in each triplet unit. Finally, we build a part-based deep neural network, in which the features of different body parts are first discriminately learned in the lower convolutional layers and then fused in the higher fully connected layers. Experiments on several benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of our method as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.
