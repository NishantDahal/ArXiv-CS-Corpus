The omega-inequality problem for concatenation hierarchies of star-free languages

The problem considered in this paper is whether an inequality of omega-terms is valid in a given level of a concatenation hierarchy of star-free languages. The main result shows that this problem is decidable for all (integer and half) levels of the Straubing-Th√©rien hierarchy.
