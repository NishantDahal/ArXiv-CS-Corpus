Overview of the Triple Scoring Task at the WSDM Cup 2017

This paper provides an overview of the triple scoring task at the WSDM Cup 2017, including a description of the task and the dataset, an overview of the participating teams and their results, and a brief account of the methods employed. In a nutshell, the task was to compute relevance scores for knowledge-base triples from relations, where such scores make sense. Due to the way the ground truth was constructed, scores were required to be integers from the range 0..7. For example, reasonable scores for the triples "Tim Burton profession Director" and "Tim Burton profession Actor" would be 7 and 2, respectively, because Tim Burton is well-known as a director, but he acted only in a few lesser known movies.
  The triple scoring task attracted considerable interest, with 52 initial registrations and 21 teams who submitted a valid run before the deadline. The winning team achieved an accuracy of 87%, that is, for that fraction of the triples from the test set (which was revealed only after the deadline) the difference to the score from the ground truth was at most 2. The best result for the average difference from the test set scores was 1.50.
