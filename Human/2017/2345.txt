ns-3 Implementation of the 3GPP MIMO Channel Model for Frequency Spectrum above 6 GHz

Communications at mmWave frequencies will be a key enabler of the next generation of cellular networks, due to the multi-Gbps rate that can be achieved. However, there are still several problems that must be solved before this technology can be widely adopted, primarily associated with the interplay between the variability of mmWave links and the complexity of mobile networks. An end-to-end network simulator represents a great tool to assess the performance of any proposed solution to meet the stringent 5G requirements. Given the criticality of channel propagation characteristics at higher frequencies, we present our implementation of the 3GPP channel model for the 6-100 GHz band for the ns-3 end-to-end 5G mmWave module, and detail its associated MIMO beamforming architecture.
