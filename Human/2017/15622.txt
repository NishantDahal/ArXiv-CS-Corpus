An Efficient Single Chord-based Accumulation Technique (SCA) to Detect More Reliable Corners

Corner detection is a vital operation in numerous computer vision applications. The Chord-to-Point Distance Accumulation (CPDA) detector is recognized as the contour-based corner detector producing the lowest localization error while localizing corners in an image. However, in our experiment part, we demonstrate that CPDA detector often misses some potential corners. Moreover, the detection algorithm of CPDA is computationally costly. In this paper, We focus on reducing localization error as well as increasing average repeatability. The preprocessing and refinements steps of proposed process are similar to CPDA. Our experimental results will show the effectiveness and robustness of proposed process over CPDA.
