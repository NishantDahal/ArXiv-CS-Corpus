Capacity Enhancement with Meta-Multiplexing

Multiplexing services as a key communication technique to effectively combine multiple signals into one signal and transmit over a shared medium. Multiplexing can increase the channel capacity by requiring more resources on the transmission medium. For instance, the space-division multiplexing accomplished through the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme achieves significant capacity increase by the realized parallel channel, but it requires expensive hardware resources. Here, we present a novel multiplexing methodology, named meta-multiplexing, which allows ordinary modulated signals overlap together to form a set of "artificial" parallel channels, meanwhile, it only requires similar resources as ordinary modulation schemes. We prove the capacity law for the meta-multiplexing system and disclose that under broad conditions, the capacity of a single channel increases linearly with the signal to noise ratio (SNR), which breaks the conventional logarithmic growth of the capacity over SNR. Numerous simulation studies verify the capacity law and demonstrate the high efficiency of meta-multiplexing. Through proof-of-concept hardware experiments, we tested the proposed method in communication practices and achieved a spectral efficiency of 81.7 bits/s/Hz over a single channel, which is significantly higher than the efficiency of any existing communication system.
