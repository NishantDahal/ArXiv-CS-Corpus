Trace codes over $\Z_4$ and Boolean function

We construct trace codes over $\Z_4$ by using Boolean functions and skew sets, respectively. Their Lee weight distribution is studied by using a Galois ring version of the Walsh-Hadamard transform and exponential sums. We obtain a new family of optimal two-weight codes over $\Z_4.$
