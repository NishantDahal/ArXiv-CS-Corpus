Performance Evaluation of Spatial Complementary Code Keying Modulation in MIMO Systems

Spatial complementary code keying modulation (SCCKM) is proposed as a novel block coding modulation scheme. An input binary sequence is modulated based on the different lengths of complementary code keying (CCK) modulation and then spread across the transmit antennas (spatial domain) in a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system exploiting orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). At the receiver side, zero forcing equalization is applied to the OFDM modulated data to mitigate the effect of the multipath fast fading channel and then followed by maximum likelihood (ML) detection to retrieve the input sequence. The performance of SCCKM in different MIMO systems is compared to that of spatial modulation (SM) as a baseline scheme. Simulation results show that for the same spectral efficiency, SCCKM is able to substantially improve the bit error rate (BER).
