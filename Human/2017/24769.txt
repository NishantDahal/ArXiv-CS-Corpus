Mobile Phone Based Portable Field Sensor System for Real-Time In-situ River Water Quality Monitoring During Endangered Dolphin Monitoring Surveys

Mobile phone based potable water quality assessment device is developed to analyze and study water pollution level at Indus river. Indus river is habitat of endangered Indus river dolphin and water pollution is one of major causes of survivability threats for this specie. We tested device performance at the six locations of Lahore canal. pH of canal water deviates from the normal range of the irrigation water. In future, we will study correlation between water pollution level and habitat usage of Indus river dolphin using water quality assessment device and hydrophone array based passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) system.
