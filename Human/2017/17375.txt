Identifying Student Communities in Blended Courses

Blended courses have become the norm in post-secondary education. Universities use large-scale learning management systems to manage class content. Instructors deliver readings, lectures, and office hours online; students use intelligent tutors, web forums, and online submission systems; and classes communicate via web forums. These online tools allow students to form new social networks or bring social relationships online. They also allow us to collect data on students' social relationships. In this paper we report on our research on community formation in blended courses based on online forum interactions. We found that it was possible to group students into communities using standard community detection algorithms via their posts and reply structure and that the students' grades are significantly correlated with their closest peers.
