Proceedings Second International Workshop on Pre- and Post-Deployment Verification Techniques

This volume contains the proceedings of PrePost 2017 (the Second International Workshop on Pre- and Post-Deployment Verification Techniques), taking place on 19th September 2017 in Torino, Italy, as a satellite event of the 13th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2017).
  PrePost aims to bridge two areas of research and academic communities: on one hand techniques for analysis of systems prior to deployment, on the other techniques for the analysis of systems once they have already been deployed. The workshop brings together researchers working in the field of computer-aided validation, programming languages and verification to discuss the connections and interplay between pre- and post-deployment verification techniques. This includes exploring relationships between techniques such as classic model checking and testing, with ones such as runtime verification and statistical model checking, between type systems that may be checked either statically or dynamically through techniques such as runtime monitoring, gradual typing and contracts.
