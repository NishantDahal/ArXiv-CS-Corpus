Online Time Sharing Policy in Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Network with Channel Uncertainty

This paper considers an energy harvesting underlay cognitive radio network operating in a slotted fashion. The secondary transmitter scavenges energy from environmental sources in half duplex fashion and stores it in finite capacity rechargeable battery. It splits each slot into two phases: harvesting phase and transmission phase. We model the energy availability at the secondary user as first order stationary Markov process. We propose a robust online transmission policy by jointly optimizing the time sharing between the two phases and transmit power of secondary user, which maximizes its average throughput by a given time deadline.We show the comparison of our proposed policy with the offline and myopic policies.
