Annotation of Car Trajectories based on Driving Patterns

Nowadays, the ubiquity of various sensors enables the collection of voluminous datasets of car trajectories. Such datasets enable analysts to make sense of driving patterns and behaviors: in order to understand the behavior of drivers, one approach is to break a trajectory into its underlying patterns and then analyze that trajectory in terms of derived patterns. The process of trajectory segmentation is a function of various resources including a set of ground truth trajectories with their driving patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no such ground-truth dataset exists in the literature. In this paper, we describe a trajectory annotation framework and report our results to annotate a dataset of personal car trajectories. Our annotation methodology consists of a crowd-sourcing task followed by a precise process of aggregation. Our annotation process consists of two granularity levels, one to specify the annotation (segment border) and the other one to describe the type of the segment (e.g. speed-up, turn, merge, etc.). The output of our project, Dataset of Annotated Car Trajectories (DACT), is available online at https://figshare.com/articles/dact_dataset_of_annotated_car_trajectories/5005289 .
