Phaseless compressive sensing using partial support information

We study the recovery conditions of weighted $\ell_1$ minimization for real-valued signal reconstruction from phaseless compressive sensing measurements when partial support information is available. A strong restricted isometry property condition is provided to ensure the stable recovery. Moreover, we present the weighted null space property as the sufficient and necessary condition for the success of $k$-sparse phaseless recovery via weighted $\ell_1$ minimization. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results.
