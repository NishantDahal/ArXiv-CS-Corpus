Imperfect Knowledge in Autonomous Urban Traffic Manoeuvres

Urban Multi-lane Spatial Logic (UMLSL) was introduced in [13] for proving safety (collision freedom) in autonomous urban traffic manoeuvres with perfect knowledge. We now consider a concept of imperfect knowledge, where cars have less information about other cars. To this end, we introduce the concept of a multi-view and propose crossing controllers using broadcast communication with data constraints for turning manoeuvres at intersections.
