MIMO Beamforming for Secure and Energy-Efficient Wireless Communication

Considering a multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with an eavesdropper, this letter develops a beamformer design to optimize the energy efficiency in terms of secrecy bits per Joule under secrecy quality-of-service constraints. This is a very difficult design problem with no available exact solution techniques. A path-following procedure, which iteratively improves its feasible points by using a simple quadratic program of moderate dimension, is proposed. Under any fixed computational tolerance the procedure terminates after finitely many iterations, yielding at least a locally optimal solution. Simulation results show the superior performance of the obtained algorithm over other existing methods.
