Saliency Fusion in Eigenvector Space with Multi-Channel Pulse Coupled Neural Network

Saliency computation has become a popular research field for many applications due to the useful information provided by saliency maps. For a saliency map, local relations around the salient regions in multi-channel perspective should be taken into consideration by aiming uniformity on the region of interest as an internal approach. And, irrelevant salient regions have to be avoided as much as possible. Most of the works achieve these criteria with external processing modules; however, these can be accomplished during the conspicuity map fusion process. Therefore, in this paper, a new model is proposed for saliency/conspicuity map fusion with two concepts: a) input image transformation relying on the principal component analysis (PCA), and b) saliency conspicuity map fusion with multi-channel pulsed coupled neural network (m-PCNN). Experimental results, which are evaluated by precision, recall, F-measure, and area under curve (AUC), support the reliability of the proposed method by enhancing the saliency computation.
