Effective Straggler Mitigation: Which Clones Should Attack and When?

Redundancy for straggler mitigation, originally in data download and more recently in distributed computing context, has been shown to be effective both in theory and practice. Analysis of systems with redundancy has drawn significant attention and numerous papers have studied pain and gain of redundancy under various service models and assumptions on the straggler characteristics. We here present a cost (pain) vs. latency (gain) analysis of using simple replication or erasure coding for straggler mitigation in executing jobs with many tasks. We quantify the effect of the tail of task execution times and discuss tail heaviness as a decisive parameter for the cost and latency of using redundancy. Specifically, we find that coded redundancy achieves better cost vs. latency and allows for greater achievable latency and cost tradeoff region compared to replication and can yield reduction in both cost and latency under less heavy tailed execution times. We show that delaying redundancy is not effective in reducing cost.
