Sync-DRAW: Automatic Video Generation using Deep Recurrent Attentive Architectures

This paper introduces a novel approach for generating videos called Synchronized Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (Sync-DRAW). Sync-DRAW can also perform text-to-video generation which, to the best of our knowledge, makes it the first approach of its kind. It combines a Variational Autoencoder~(VAE) with a Recurrent Attention Mechanism in a novel manner to create a temporally dependent sequence of frames that are gradually formed over time. The recurrent attention mechanism in Sync-DRAW attends to each individual frame of the video in sychronization, while the VAE learns a latent distribution for the entire video at the global level. Our experiments with Bouncing MNIST, KTH and UCF-101 suggest that Sync-DRAW is efficient in learning the spatial and temporal information of the videos and generates frames with high structural integrity, and can generate videos from simple captions on these datasets.
