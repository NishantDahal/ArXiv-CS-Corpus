Maximizing the order of a regular graph of given valency and second eigenvalue

From Alon and Boppana, and Serre, we know that for any given integer $k\geq 3$ and real number $λ<2\sqrt{k-1}$, there are finitely many $k$-regular graphs whose second largest eigenvalue is at most $λ$. In this paper, we investigate the largest number of vertices of such graphs.
