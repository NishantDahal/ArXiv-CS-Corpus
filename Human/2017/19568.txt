On Unique Decoding from Insertions and Deletions

In this paper, we study how often unique decoding from $t$ insertions or $t$ deletions occurs for error correcting codes. Insertions and deletions frequently occur in synchronization problems and DNA, a medium which is beginning to be used for long term data storage.
  We define natural probabilistic channels that make $t$ insertions or $t$ deletions, and study the probability of unique decoding. Our most substantial contribution is the derivation of tight upper bounds on the probability of unique decoding for messages passed though these channels. We also consider other aspects of the problem, and derive improved upper bounds for linear codes and VT-codes.
