Relation Extraction : A Survey

With the advent of the Internet, large amount of digital text is generated everyday in the form of news articles, research publications, blogs, question answering forums and social media. It is important to develop techniques for extracting information automatically from these documents, as lot of important information is hidden within them. This extracted information can be used to improve access and management of knowledge hidden in large text corpora. Several applications such as Question Answering, Information Retrieval would benefit from this information. Entities like persons and organizations, form the most basic unit of the information. Occurrences of entities in a sentence are often linked through well-defined relations; e.g., occurrences of person and organization in a sentence may be linked through relations such as employed at. The task of Relation Extraction (RE) is to identify such relations automatically. In this paper, we survey several important supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised RE techniques. We also cover the paradigms of Open Information Extraction (OIE) and Distant Supervision. Finally, we describe some of the recent trends in the RE techniques and possible future research directions. This survey would be useful for three kinds of readers - i) Newcomers in the field who want to quickly learn about RE; ii) Researchers who want to know how the various RE techniques evolved over time and what are possible future research directions and iii) Practitioners who just need to know which RE technique works best in various settings.
