A multilayer network dataset of interaction and influence spreading in a virtual world

Presented data contains the record of five spreading campaigns that occurred in a virtual world platform. Users distributed avatars between each other during the campaigns. The processes varied in time and range and were either incentivized or not incentivized. Campaign data is accompanied by events. The data can be used to build a multilayer network to place the campaigns in a wider context. To the best of the authors knowledge, the study is the first publicly available dataset containing a complete real multilayer social network together, along with five complete spreading processes in it.
