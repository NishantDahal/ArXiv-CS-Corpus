Optimal User Scheduling and Power Allocation for Millimeter Wave NOMA Systems

This paper investigates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications by exploiting beamforming, user scheduling and power allocation. Random beamforming is invoked for reducing the feedback overhead of considered systems. A nonconvex optimization problem for maximizing the sum rate is formulated, which is proved to be NP-hard. The branch and bound (BB) approach is invoked to obtain the optimal power allocation policy, which is proved to converge to a global optimal solution. To elaborate further, low complexity suboptimal approach is developed for striking a good computational complexity-optimality tradeoff, where matching theory and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques are invoked for tackling the user scheduling and power allocation problems, respectively. Simulation results reveal that: i) the proposed low complexity solution achieves a near-optimal performance; and ii) the proposed mmWave NOMA systems is capable of outperforming conventional mmWave orthogonal multiple access (OMA) systems in terms of sum rate and the number of served users.
