X-WACoDa: An XML-based approach for Warehousing and Analyzing Complex Data

Data warehousing and OLAP applications must nowadays handle complex data that are not only numerical or symbolic. The XML language is well-suited to logically and physically represent complex data. However, its usage induces new theoretical and practical challenges at the modeling, storage and analysis levels, and a new trend toward XML warehousing has been emerging for a couple of years. Unfortunately, no standard XML data warehouse architecture emerges. In this paper, we propose a unified XML warehouse reference model that synthesizes and enhances related work, and fits into a global XML warehousing and analysis approach we have developed. We also present a software platform that is based on this model, as well as a case study that illustrates its usage.
