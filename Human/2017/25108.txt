Global research collaboration: Networks and partners in South East Asia

This is an empirical paper that addresses the role of bilateral and multilateral international co-authorships in the six leading science systems among the ASEAN group of countries (ASEAN6). The paper highlights the different ways that bilateral and multilateral co-authorships structure global networks and the collaborations of the ASEAN6. The paper looks at the influence of the collaboration styles of major collaborating countries of the ASEAN6, particularly the USA and Japan. It also highlights the role of bilateral and multilateral co-authorships in the production of knowledge in the leading specialisations of the ASEAN6. The discussion section offers some tentative explanations for major dynamics evident in the results and summarises the next steps in this research.
