A novel online scheduling protocol for energy-efficient TWDM-OLT design

Design of energy-efficient access networks has emerged as an important area of research, since access networks consume $80-90\%$ of the overall Internet power consumption. TWDM-PON is envisaged to be one of the widely accepted future access technologies. TWDM-PON offers an additional opportunity to save energy at the OLT along with the existing energy-efficient ONU design. In this paper, we focus on the energy-efficient OLT design in a TWDM-PON. While most of the conventional methods employ a minimization of the number of wavelengths, we propose a novel approach which aims at minimizing the number of voids created due to scheduling. In the process, for the first time, we present a low-complexity on-line scheduling algorithm for the upstream traffic considering delay constraints. Our extensive simulations demonstrate a significant improvement in energy efficiency of $\sim 25\%$ for high load at the OLT receivers. Furthermore, we provide an analytical upper-bound on the energy-efficiency of the OLT receivers and demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves an energy efficiency very close to the bound with a maximum deviation $\sim 2\%$ for $64$ ONUs.
