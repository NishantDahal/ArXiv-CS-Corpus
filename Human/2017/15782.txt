Multilingual Website Usability Analysis Based on an International User Survey

A study was undertaken to determine the important usability factors (UF) used in the English and the non-English version of a website. The important usability factors were determined, based on a detailed questionnaire used in an international survey. Analysis of the questionnaire found inequalities in the user satisfaction and a general dissatisfaction with the non-English version of the website. The study concluded that more care should be taken in creating the text, taking into account the cultural and linguistic background of the users and the use of graphics in multilingual websites.
