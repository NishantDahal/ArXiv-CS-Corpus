Feature Model-to-Ontology for SPL Application Realisation

Feature model are widely used to capture commonalities and variabilities of artefacts in Software Product Line (SPL). Several studies have discussed the formal representation of feature diagram using ontologies with different styles of mapping. However, they still focused on the ontology approach for problem space and keep the solution space aside. In this paper, we present the modelling of feature model using OWL ontology and produce an application based on the ontology. Firstly, we map the features in a running example feature diagram to OWL classes and properties. Secondly, we verify the consistency of the OWL ontology by using reasoning engines. Finally, we use the ontology as an input of Zotonic framework for application realisation.
