Automatically Installing and Deploying Tools for Conducting Systematic Reviews in ReLiS

Conducting systematic reviews (SR) is a time consuming endeavor that requires several iterations to setup right. We present ReLiS, a framework to configure and deploy projects while conducting a SR. It features a domain-specific modeling editor tailored for researchers who perform SRs and an architecture that enables live installation and deployment of multiple concurrently running projects.
