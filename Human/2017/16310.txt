Outage Probability and Rate for $κ$-$μ$ Shadowed Fading in Interference Limited Scenario

The $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading model is a very general fading model as it includes both $κ$-$μ$ and $η$-$μ$ as special cases. In this work, we derive the expression for outage probability when the signal-of-interest (SoI) and interferers both experience $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading in an interference limited scenario. The derived expression is valid for arbitrary SoI parameters, arbitrary $κ$ and $μ$ parameters for all interferers and any value of the parameter $m$ for the interferers excepting the limiting value of $m\rightarrow \infty$. The expression can be expressed in terms of Pochhammer integral where the integrands of integral only contains elementary functions. The outage probability expression is then simplified for various special cases, especially when SoI experiences $η$-$μ$ or $κ$-$μ$ fading. Further, the rate expression is derived when the SoI experiences $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading with integer values of $μ$, and interferers experience $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading with arbitrary parameters. The rate expression can be expressed in terms of sum of Lauricella's function of the fourth kind. The utility of our results is demonstrated by using the derived expression to study and compare FFR and SFR in the presence of $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading. Extensive simulation results are provided and these further validate our theoretical results.
