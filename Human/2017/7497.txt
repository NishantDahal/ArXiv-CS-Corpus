Guess & Check Codes for Deletions and Synchronization

We consider the problem of constructing codes that can correct $δ$ deletions occurring in an arbitrary binary string of length $n$ bits. Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes can correct all possible single deletions $(δ=1)$ with an asymptotically optimal redundancy. Finding similar codes for $δ\geq 2$ deletions is an open problem. We propose a new family of codes, that we call Guess & Check (GC) codes, that can correct, with high probability, a constant number of deletions $δ$ occurring at uniformly random positions within an arbitrary string. The GC codes are based on MDS codes and have an asymptotically optimal redundancy that is $Θ(δ\log n)$. We provide deterministic polynomial time encoding and decoding schemes for these codes. We also describe the applications of GC codes to file synchronization.
