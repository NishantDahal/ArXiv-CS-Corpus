Correlating Satellite Cloud Cover with Sky Cameras

The role of clouds is manifold in understanding the various events in the atmosphere, and also in studying the radiative balance of the earth. The conventional manner of such cloud analysis is performed mainly via satellite images. However, because of its low temporal- and spatial- resolutions, ground-based sky cameras are now getting popular. In this paper, we study the relation between the cloud cover obtained from MODIS images, with the coverage obtained from ground-based sky cameras. This will help us to better understand cloud formation in the atmosphere - both from satellite images and ground-based observations.
