A New Cryptography Model via Fibonacci and Lucas Numbers

Coding/decoding algorithms are of great importance to help in improving information security since information security is a more significiant problem in recent years. In this paper we introduce two new coding/decoding algorithms using Fibonacci $Q$-matrices and $R$-matrices. Our models are based on the blocked message matrices and the encryption of each message matrix with different keys. These new algorithms will not only increase the security of information but also has high correct ability.
