Accurate and Efficient Profile Matching in Knowledge Bases

A profile describes a set of properties, e.g. a set of skills a person may have, a set of skills required for a particular job, or a set of abilities a football player may have with respect to a particular team strategy. Profile matching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requested profile. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theory that uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in the interval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Such lattices can be derived from knowledge bases exploiting description logics to represent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting first question is, how human expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain most accurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together with matching values by some human expert is given, then under some mild plausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that the computed matching values preserve the rankings given by the expert. A second question concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. For matching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching a given one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated on grounds of pre-computed matching values, which in turn allows the maintenance of the knowledge base to be decoupled from the maintenance of profile instances. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can be exploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to be extended in order to improve in the rankings. Finally, the theory of matching will be extended beyond the filters, which lead to a matching theory that exploits fuzzy sets or probabilistic logic with maximum entropy semantics. It will be shown that added fuzzy links can be captured by extending the underlying lattice.
