Text Summarization using Abstract Meaning Representation

With an ever increasing size of text present on the Internet, automatic summary generation remains an important problem for natural language understanding. In this work we explore a novel full-fledged pipeline for text summarization with an intermediate step of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). The pipeline proposed by us first generates an AMR graph of an input story, through which it extracts a summary graph and finally, generate summary sentences from this summary graph. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to the other text summarization routines based on AMR. We also point out some significant problems in the existing evaluation methods, which make them unsuitable for evaluating summary quality.
