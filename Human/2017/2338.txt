Modeling the Throughput of the Linux-Based Agile-SD Transmission Control Protocol

Agile-SD is one of the latest versions of loss-based congestion control algorithm (CCA), which has been proposed to improve the total performance of transmission control protocol (TCP) over high-speed and short-distance networks. It has introduced a new mechanism, called agility factor mechanism, which shortens the epoch time to reduce the sensitivity to packet losses and in turn to increase the average throughput. Agile-SD has only been tested via simulation; however, it has not been mathematically proven or evaluated. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a new mathematical model for the throughput of NewReno and Agile-SD is proposed. This model is designed using the well-known Markov chains to validate the correctness of Agile-SD and to show the impact of buffer size, multiplicative decrease factor, and maximum limit of agility factor (λmax ) on the total performance. Second, an automated algorithm configuration and parameter tuning (AACPT) technique is employed to optimize and automate the configuration of λmax . Furthermore, the numerical results for both NewReno and Agile-SD are compared with the simulation results, in which the validity of the proposed model is confirmed. Moreover, the output of the AACPT is exploited to formulate a new equation, which calculates the optimal λmax from a given \b{eta} in order to conserve the standard interface of the TCP. This equation increases the scalability of Agile-SD and improves its total performance.
