Manifold Regularized Slow Feature Analysis for Dynamic Texture Recognition

Dynamic textures exist in various forms, e.g., fire, smoke, and traffic jams, but recognizing dynamic texture is challenging due to the complex temporal variations. In this paper, we present a novel approach stemmed from slow feature analysis (SFA) for dynamic texture recognition. SFA extracts slowly varying features from fast varying signals. Fortunately, SFA is capable to leach invariant representations from dynamic textures. However, complex temporal variations require high-level semantic representations to fully achieve temporal slowness, and thus it is impractical to learn a high-level representation from dynamic textures directly by SFA. In order to learn a robust low-level feature to resolve the complexity of dynamic textures, we propose manifold regularized SFA (MR-SFA) by exploring the neighbor relationship of the initial state of each temporal transition and retaining the locality of their variations. Therefore, the learned features are not only slowly varying, but also partly predictable. MR-SFA for dynamic texture recognition is proposed in the following steps: 1) learning feature extraction functions as convolution filters by MR-SFA, 2) extracting local features by convolution and pooling, and 3) employing Fisher vectors to form a video-level representation for classification. Experimental results on dynamic texture and dynamic scene recognition datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
