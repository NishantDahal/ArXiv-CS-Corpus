GlobeNet: Convolutional Neural Networks for Typhoon Eye Tracking from Remote Sensing Imagery

Advances in remote sensing technologies have made it possible to use high-resolution visual data for weather observation and forecasting tasks. We propose the use of multi-layer neural networks for understanding complex atmospheric dynamics based on multichannel satellite images. The capability of our model was evaluated by using a linear regression task for single typhoon coordinates prediction. A specific combination of models and different activation policies enabled us to obtain an interesting prediction result in the northeastern hemisphere (ENH).
