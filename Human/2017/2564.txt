Performance of Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with MMSE and LSFD Receivers

Cell-Free Massive MIMO comprises a large number of distributed single-antenna access points (APs) serving a much smaller number of users. There is no partitioning into cells and each user is served by all APs.
  In this paper, the uplink performance of cell-free systems with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and large scale fading decoding (LSFD) receivers is investigated. The main idea of LSFD receiver is to maximize achievable throughput using only large scale fading coefficients between APs and users. Capacity lower bounds for MMSE and LSFD receivers are derived. An asymptotic approximation for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of MMSE receiver is derived as a function of large scale fading coefficients only. The obtained approximation is accurate even for a small number of antennas. MMSE and LSFD receivers demonstrate five-fold and two-fold gains respectively over matched filter (MF) receiver in terms of 5%-outage rate.
