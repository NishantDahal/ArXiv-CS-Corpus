Efficient and Secure Routing Protocol for WSN-A Thesis

Advances in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) have provided the availability of small and low-cost sensors with the capability of sensing various types of physical and environmental conditions, data processing, and wireless communication. Since WSN protocols are application specific, the focus has been given to the routing protocols that might differ depending on the application and network architecture. In this work, novel routing protocols have been proposed which is a cluster-based security protocol is named as Efficient and Secure Routing Protocol (ESRP) for WSN. The goal of ESRP is to provide an energy efficient routing solution with dynamic security features for clustered WSN. During the network formation, a node which is connected to a Personal Computer (PC) has been selected as a sink node. Once the sensor nodes were deployed, the sink node logically segregates the other nodes in a cluster structure and subsequently creates a WSN. This centralized cluster formation method is used to reduce the node level processing burden and avoid multiple communications. In order to ensure reliable data delivery, various security features have been incorporated in the proposed protocol such as Modified Zero-Knowledge Protocol (MZKP), Promiscuous hearing method, Trapping of adversaries and Mine detection. One of the unique features of this ESRP is that it can dynamically decide about the selection of these security methods, based on the residual energy of nodes.
