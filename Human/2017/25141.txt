Index Modulation for 5G: Striving to Do More with Less

The fifth generation (5G) wireless communications brag both high spectrum efficiency and high energy efficiency. To meet the requirements, various new techniques have been proposed. Among these, the recently-emerging index modulation has attracted significant interests. By judiciously activating a subset of certain communication {building blocks, such as} antenna, subcarrier and time slot, index modulation is claimed to have the potential to meet the challenging 5G needs. In this article, we will discuss index modulation and its general and specific representations, enhancements, and potential applications in various 5G scenarios. The objective is to reveal whether, and how, index modulation may strive for more performance gains with less medium resource occupation.
