On the zone of a circle in an arrangement of lines

Let $\mathcal L$ be a set of $n$ lines in the plane, and let $C$ be a convex curve in the plane, like a circle or a parabola. The "zone" of $C$ in $\mathcal L$, denoted $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$, is defined as the set of all cells in the arrangement $\mathcal A(\mathcal L)$ that are intersected by $C$. Edelsbrunner et al. (1992) showed that the complexity (total number of edges or vertices) of $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ is at most $O(nα(n))$, where $α$ is the inverse Ackermann function. They did this by translating the sequence of edges of $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ into a sequence $S$ that avoids the subsequence $ababa$. Whether the worst-case complexity of $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ is only linear is a longstanding open problem.
  Since the relaxation of the problem to pseudolines does have a $Θ(nα(n))$ bound, any proof of $O(n)$ for the case of straight lines must necessarily use geometric arguments.
  In this paper we present some such geometric arguments. We show that, if $C$ is a circle, then certain configurations of straight-line segments with endpoints on $C$ are impossible. In particular, we show that there exists a Hart-Sharir sequence that cannot appear as a subsequence of $S$.
  The Hart-Sharir sequences are essentially the only known way to construct $ababa$-free sequences of superlinear length. Hence, if it could be shown that every family of $ababa$-free sequences of superlinear-length eventually contains all Hart-Sharir sequences, it would follow that the complexity of $\mathcal Z(C,\mathcal L)$ is $O(n)$ whenever $C$ is a circle.
