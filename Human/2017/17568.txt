Prosodic Features from Large Corpora of Child-Directed Speech as Predictors of the Age of Acquisition of Words

The impressive ability of children to acquire language is a widely studied phenomenon, and the factors influencing the pace and patterns of word learning remains a subject of active research. Although many models predicting the age of acquisition of words have been proposed, little emphasis has been directed to the raw input children achieve. In this work we present a comparatively large-scale multi-modal corpus of prosody-text aligned child directed speech. Our corpus contains automatically extracted word-level prosodic features, and we investigate the utility of this information as predictors of age of acquisition. We show that prosody features boost predictive power in a regularized regression, and demonstrate their utility in the context of a multi-modal factorized language models trained and tested on child-directed speech.
