A Proof of the Strong Converse Theorem for Gaussian Broadcast Channels via the Gaussian Poincaré Inequality

We prove that the Gaussian broadcast channel with two destinations admits the strong converse property. This implies that for every sequence of block codes operated at a common rate pair with an asymptotic average error probability $<1$, the rate pair must lie within the capacity region derived by Cover and Bergmans. The main mathematical tool required for our analysis is a logarithmic Sobolev inequality known as the Gaussian Poincaré inequality.
