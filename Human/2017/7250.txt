KRC: KnowInG crowdsourcing platform supporting creativity and innovation

The deep financial and economic crisis, which still characterizes these years, requires searching for tools in order to enhance knowledge sharing, creativity and innovation. The Internet is one of these tools that represents a practically infinite source of resources. In this perspective, the KnowInG project, funded by the STC programme MED, is aimed at developing the KnowInG Resource Centre (KRC), a sociotechnical system that works as a multiplier of innovation. KRC was conceived as a crowdsourcing platform allowing people, universities, research centres, organizations and companies to be active actors of creative and innovation processes from a local to a transnational level.
