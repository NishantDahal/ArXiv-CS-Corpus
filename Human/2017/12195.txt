A Cache Management Scheme for Efficient Content Eviction and Replication in Cache Networks

To cope with the ongoing changing demands of the internet, 'in-network caching' has been presented as an application solution for two decades. With the advent of information-centric network (ICN) architecture, 'in-network caching' becomes a network level solution. Some unique features of ICNs, e.g., rapidly changing cache states, higher request arrival rates, smaller cache sizes, and other factors, impose diverse requirements on the content eviction policies. In particular, eviction policies should be fast and lightweight. In this study, we propose cache replication and eviction schemes, Conditional Leave Cope Everywhere (CLCE) and Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU), which are well suited for the ICN type of cache networks (CNs). The CLCE replication scheme reduces the redundant caching of contents; hence improves the cache space utilization. LFRU approximates the Least Frequently Used (LFU) scheme coupled with the Least Recently Used (LRU) scheme and is practically implementable for rapidly changing cache networks like ICNs.
