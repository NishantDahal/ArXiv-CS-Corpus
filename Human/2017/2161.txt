Parallel needed reduction for pure interaction nets

Reducing interaction nets without any specific strategy benefits from constant time per step. On the other hand, a canonical reduction step for weak reduction to interface normal form is linear by depth of terms. In this paper, we refine the weak interaction calculus to reveal the actual cost of its reduction. As a result, we obtain a notion of needed reduction that can be implemented in constant time per step without allowing any free ports and without sacrificing parallelism.
