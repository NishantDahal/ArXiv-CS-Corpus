Downlink Energy Efficiency of Power Allocation and Wireless Backhaul Bandwidth Allocation in Heterogeneous Small Cell Networks

The widespread application of wireless services and dense devices access have triggered huge energy consumption. Because of the environmental and financial considerations, energy-efficient design in wireless networks becomes an inevitable trend. To the best of the authors' knowledge, energy-efficient orthogonal frequency division multiple access heterogeneous small cell optimization comprehensively considering energy efficiency maximization, power allocation, wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation, and user Quality of Service is a novel approach and research direction, and it has not been investigated. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient power allocation and wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access heterogeneous small cell networks. Different from the existing resource allocation schemes that maximize the throughput, the studied scheme maximizes energy efficiency by allocating both transmit power of each small cell base station to users and bandwidth for backhauling, according to the channel state information and the circuit power consumption. The problem is first formulated as a non-convex nonlinear programming problem and then it is decomposed into two convex subproblems. A near optimal iterative resource allocation algorithm is designed to solve the resource allocation problem. A suboptimal low-complexity approach is also developed by exploring the inherent structure and property of the energy-efficient design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparing with the existing schemes.
