Telugu OCR Framework using Deep Learning

In this paper, we address the task of Optical Character Recognition(OCR) for the Telugu script. We present an end-to-end framework that segments the text image, classifies the characters and extracts lines using a language model. The segmentation is based on mathematical morphology. The classification module, which is the most challenging task of the three, is a deep convolutional neural network. The language is modelled as a third degree markov chain at the glyph level. Telugu script is a complex alphasyllabary and the language is agglutinative, making the problem hard. In this paper we apply the latest advances in neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art error rates. We also review convolutional neural networks in great detail and expound the statistical justification behind the many tricks needed to make Deep Learning work.
