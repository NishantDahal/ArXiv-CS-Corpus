New Directions In Cellular Automata

We Propose A Novel Automaton Model which uses Arithmetic Operations as the Evolving Rules, each cell has the states of the Natural Numbers k = (N), a radius of r = 1/2 and operates on an arbitrary input size. The Automaton reads an Arithmetic Expression as an input and outputs another Arithmetic Expression. In Addition, we simulate a variety of One Dimensional Cellular Automata Structures with different Dynamics including Elementary Cellular Automata.
