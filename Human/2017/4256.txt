Chaotic-Based Processor for Communication and Multimedia Applications

Chaos is a phenomenon that attracted much attention in the past ten years. In this paper, we analyze chaos-based signal processing, and proposed a chaos processor to take advantage of chaos phenomenon. We also analyzed and demonstrated two of its practical applications in communication and sound synthesis.
