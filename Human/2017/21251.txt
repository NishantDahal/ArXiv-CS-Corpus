Mechanism Design for Demand Response Programs with financial and non-monetary (social) Incentives

Most demand management approaches with non-mandatory policies assume full users' cooperation, which may not be the case given users' beliefs, needs and preferences. In this paper we propose a mechanism for demand management including incentives both with and without money. The mechanism is validated by means of simulation, modeling the consumers as a finite multiagent system which evolves until a stable state, and social incentives diffusion using opinion dynamics.
