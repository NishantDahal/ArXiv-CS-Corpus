Around power law for PageRank components in Buckley-Osthus model of web graph

In the paper we investigate power law for PageRank components for the Buckley-Osthus model for web graph. We compare different numerical methods for PageRank calculation. With the best method we do a lot of numerical experiments. These experiments confirm the hypothesis about power law. At the end we discuss real model of web-ranking based on the classical PageRank approach.
