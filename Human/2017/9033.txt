Joint Design of Multi-Tap Analog Cancellation and Digital Beamforming for Reduced Complexity Full Duplex MIMO Systems

Incorporating full duplex operation in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems provides the potential of boosting throughput performance. However, the hardware complexity of the analog self-interference canceller scales with the number of transmit and receive antennas, thus exploiting the benefits of analog cancellation becomes impractical for full duplex MIMO transceivers. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for the analog canceller comprising of reduced number of taps (tap refers to a line of fixed delay and variable phase shifter and attenuator) and simple multiplexers for efficient signal routing among the transmit and receive radio frequency chains. In contrast to the available analog cancellation architectures, the values for each tap and the configuration of the multiplexers are jointly designed with the digital beamforming filters according to certain performance objectives. Focusing on a narrowband flat fading channel model as an example, we present a general optimization framework for the joint design of analog cancellation and digital beamforming. We also detail a particular optimization objective together with its derived solution for the latter architectural components. Representative computer simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed low complexity full duplex MIMO system over lately available ones.
