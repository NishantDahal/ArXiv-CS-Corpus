A Multimodal Anomaly Detector for Robot-Assisted Feeding Using an LSTM-based Variational Autoencoder

The detection of anomalous executions is valuable for reducing potential hazards in assistive manipulation. Multimodal sensory signals can be helpful for detecting a wide range of anomalies. However, the fusion of high-dimensional and heterogeneous modalities is a challenging problem. We introduce a long short-term memory based variational autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) that fuses signals and reconstructs their expected distribution. We also introduce an LSTM-VAE-based detector using a reconstruction-based anomaly score and a state-based threshold. For evaluations with 1,555 robot-assisted feeding executions including 12 representative types of anomalies, our detector had a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8710 than 5 other baseline detectors from the literature. We also show the multimodal fusion through the LSTM-VAE is effective by comparing our detector with 17 raw sensory signals versus 4 hand-engineered features.
