Adaptive 360 VR Video Streaming based on MPEG-DASH SRD

We demonstrate an adaptive bandwidth-efficient 360 VR video streaming system based on MPEG-DASH SRD. We extend MPEG-DASH SRD to the 3D space of 360 VR videos, and showcase a dynamic view-aware adaptation technique to tackle the high bandwidth demands of streaming 360 VR videos to wireless VR headsets. We spatially partition the underlying 3D mesh into multiple 3D sub-meshes, and construct an efficient 3D geometry mesh called hexaface sphere to optimally represent tiled 360 VR videos in the 3D space. We then spatially divide the 360 videos into multiple tiles while encoding and packaging, use MPEG-DASH SRD to describe the spatial relationship of tiles in the 3D space, and prioritize the tiles in the Field of View (FoV) for view-aware adaptation. Our initial evaluation results show that we can save up to 72% of the required bandwidth on 360 VR video streaming with minor negative quality impacts compared to the baseline scenario when no adaptations is applied.
