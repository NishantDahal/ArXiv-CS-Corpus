Fault Tolerant Leader Election in Distributed Systems

There are many distributed systems which use a leader in their logic. When such systems need to be fault tolerant and the current leader suffers a technical problem, it is necesary to apply a special algorithm in order to choose a new leader. In this paper I present a new fault tolerant algorithm which elects a new leader based on a random roulette wheel selection.
