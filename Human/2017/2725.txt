Resource Allocation and Relay Selection In Full-Duplex Cooperative Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access Networks

This paper is on relay selection in uplink of an in-band full-duplex (IBFD) cooperative cellular network. Assuming an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular network, we develop a relay selection and resource allocation algorithm for this network. The relay selection algorithms select the best relay based on distance between users and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) that operate in amplify and forward (AF) mode. The optimization problem allocates the optimum subcarriers and powers to all users to maximize the average sum-rate of the network. In addition, the constraints of the optimization problem are quality of service (QoS) and transmit power of each user. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed method.
