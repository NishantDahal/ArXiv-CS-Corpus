Sparsity and dimension

We prove that posets of bounded height whose cover graphs belong to a fixed class with bounded expansion have bounded dimension. Bounded expansion, introduced by Nešetřil and Ossona de Mendez as a model for sparsity in graphs, is a property that is naturally satisfied by a wide range of graph classes, from graph structure theory (graphs excluding a minor or a topological minor) to graph drawing (e.g. graphs with bounded book thickness). Therefore, our theorem generalizes a number of results including the most recent one for posets of bounded height with cover graphs excluding a fixed graph as a topological minor. We also show that the result is in a sense best possible, as it does not extend to nowhere dense classes; in fact, it already fails for cover graphs with locally bounded treewidth.
