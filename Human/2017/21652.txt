Image Stitching by Line-guided Local Warping with Global Similarity Constraint

Low-textured image stitching remains a challenging problem. It is difficult to achieve good alignment and it is easy to break image structures due to insufficient and unreliable point correspondences. Moreover, because of the viewpoint variations between multiple images, the stitched images suffer from projective distortions. To solve these problems, this paper presents a line-guided local warping method with a global similarity constraint for image stitching. Line features which serve well for geometric descriptions and scene constraints, are employed to guide image stitching accurately. On one hand, the line features are integrated into a local warping model through a designed weight function. On the other hand, line features are adopted to impose strong geometric constraints, including line correspondence and line colinearity, to improve the stitching performance through mesh optimization. To mitigate projective distortions, we adopt a global similarity constraint, which is integrated with the projective warps via a designed weight strategy. This constraint causes the final warp to slowly change from a projective to a similarity transformation across the image. Finally, the images undergo a two-stage alignment scheme that provides accurate alignment and reduces projective distortion. We evaluate our method on a series of images and compare it with several other methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a convincing stitching performance and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
