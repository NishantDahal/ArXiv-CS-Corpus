Sparse Digital Cancellation of Receiver Nonlinear Distortion in Carrier Aggregation Systems

In carrier-aggregation systems, digital baseband cancelation of self-interference generated by receiver nonlinearity requires the estimation of several reference signals contributions. As the nonlinearity order and frequency selectivity of the chip response increase, the number of reference signals significantly increases rendering the estimation of their contributions more complex. We propose a sparsity-based approach for the selection of the reference signals to match the distortion interference using a few reference signals. Simulation results show significant performance improvement over prior art with the same complexity.
