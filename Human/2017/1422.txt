Fast and robust pushbroom hyperspectral imaging via DMD-based scanning

We describe a new pushbroom hyperspectral imaging device that has no macro moving part. The main components of the proposed hyperspectral imager are a digital micromirror device (DMD), a CMOS image sensor with no filter as the spectral sensor, a CMOS color (RGB) image sensor as the auxiliary image sensor, and a diffraction grating. Using the image sensor pair, the device can simultaneously capture hyperspectral data as well as RGB images of the scene. The RGB images captured by the auxiliary image sensor can facilitate geometric co-registration of the hyperspectral image slices captured by the spectral sensor. In addition, the information discernible from the RGB images can lead to capturing the spectral data of only the regions of interest within the scene. The proposed hyperspectral imaging architecture is cost-effective, fast, and robust. It also enables a trade-off between resolution and speed. We have built an initial prototype based on the proposed design. The prototype can capture a hyperspectral image datacube with a spatial resolution of 192x192 pixels and a spectral resolution of 500 bands in less than thirty seconds.
