Performance of Optimal Data Shaping Codes

Data shaping is a coding technique that has been proposed to increase the lifetime of flash memory devices. Several data shaping codes have been described in recent work, including endurance codes and direct shaping codes for structured data. In this paper, we study information-theoretic properties of a general class of data shaping codes and prove a separation theorem stating that optimal data shaping can be achieved by the concatenation of optimal lossless compression with optimal endurance coding. We also determine the expansion factor that minimizes the total wear cost. Finally, we analyze the performance of direct shaping codes and establish a condition for their optimality.
