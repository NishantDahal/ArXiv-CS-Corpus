Roots multiplicity without companion matrices

We show a method for constructing a polynomial interpolating roots' multiplicities of another polynomial, that does not use companion matrices. This leads to a modification to Guersenzvaig--Szechtman square-free decomposition algorithm that is more efficient both in theory and in practice.
