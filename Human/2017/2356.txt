Simflowny 2: An upgraded platform for scientific modeling and simulation

Simflowny is an open platform which automatically generates parallel code of scientific dynamical models for different simulation frameworks. Here we present major upgrades on this software to support an extended set of families of models, in particular: i) a new generic family for partial differential equations, which can include spatial derivatives of any order, ii) a new family for agent based models to study complex phenomena --either on a spatial domain or on a graph--. Additionally we introduce a flexible graphical user interface (GUI) to accommodate these and future families of equations. This paper describes the new GUI architecture and summarizes the formal representation and implementation of these new families, providing several validation results.
