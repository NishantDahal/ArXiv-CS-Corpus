On Channel State Feedback Model and Overhead in Theoretical and Practical Views

Channel state feedback plays an important role to the improvement of link performance in current wireless communication systems, and even more in the next generation. The feedback information, however, consumes the uplink bandwidth and thus generates overhead. In this paper, we investigate the impact of channel state feedback and propose an improved scheme to reduce the overhead in practical communication systems. Compared with existing schemes, we introduce a more accurate channel model to describe practical wireless channels and obtain the theoretical lower bounds of overhead for the periodical and aperiodical feedback schemes. The obtained theoretical results provide us the guidance to optimise the design of feedback systems, such as the number of bits used for quantizing channel states. We thus propose a practical feedback scheme that achieves low overhead and improved performance over currently widely used schemes such as zero holding. Simulation experiments confirm its advantages and suggest its potentially wide applications in the next generation of wireless systems.
