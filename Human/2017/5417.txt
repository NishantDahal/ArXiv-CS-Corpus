What to Expect When You Are Expecting on the Grassmannian

Consider an incoming sequence of vectors, all belonging to an unknown subspace $\operatorname{S}$, and each with many missing entries. In order to estimate $\operatorname{S}$, it is common to partition the data into blocks and iteratively update the estimate of $\operatorname{S}$ with each new incoming measurement block.
  In this paper, we investigate a rather basic question: Is it possible to identify $\operatorname{S}$ by averaging the column span of the partially observed incoming measurement blocks on the Grassmannian?
  We show that in general the span of the incoming blocks is in fact a biased estimator of $\operatorname{S}$ when data suffers from erasures, and we find an upper bound for this bias. We reach this conclusion by examining the defining optimization program for the Fr√©chet expectation on the Grassmannian, and with the aid of a sharp perturbation bound and standard large deviation results.
