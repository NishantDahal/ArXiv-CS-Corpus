Image Authentication using Visual Cryptography

This report gives a novel technique of image encryption and authentication by combining elements of Visual Cryptography and Public Key Cryptography. A prominent attack involving generation of fake shares to cheat honest users has been described and a demonstration of the proposed system employing a centralised server to generate shares and authenticate them on the basis of requests is made as a counter to the described attack.
