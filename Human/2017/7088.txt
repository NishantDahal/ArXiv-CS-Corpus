Short Labeling Schemes for Topology Recognition in Wireless Tree Networks

We consider the problem of topology recognition in wireless (radio) networks modeled as undirected graphs. Topology recognition is a fundamental task in which every node of the network has to output a map of the underlying graph i.e., an isomorphic copy of it, and situate itself in this map. In wireless networks, nodes communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round a node can either transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and listen. At the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in a given round, if $v$ listens in this round, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that transmits in this round. Nodes have labels which are (not necessarily different) binary strings. The length of a labeling scheme is the largest length of a label. We concentrate on wireless networks modeled by trees, and we investigate two problems.
  \begin{itemize} \item What is the shortest labeling scheme that permits topology recognition in all wireless tree networks of diameter $D$ and maximum degree $Δ$?
  \item What is the fastest topology recognition algorithm working for all wireless tree networks of diameter $D$ and maximum degree $Δ$, using such a short labeling scheme? \end{itemize}
  We are interested in deterministic topology recognition algorithms. For the first problem, we show that the minimum length of a labeling scheme allowing topology recognition in all trees of maximum degree $Δ\geq 3$ is $Θ(\log\log Δ)$. For such short schemes, used by an algorithm working for the class of trees of diameter $D\geq 4$ and maximum degree $Δ\geq 3$, we show almost matching bounds on the time of topology recognition: an upper bound $O(DΔ)$, and a lower bound $Ω(DΔ^ε)$, for any constant $ε<1$.
