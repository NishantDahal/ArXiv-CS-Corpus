PRADA Applicability in Industrial Practice

The proliferation of Android devices brings the fragmentation problem. Selecting and prioritizing major device models are critical for mobile app developers to select testbeds and optimize various issues such as quality-assurance, release planning, revenues, and so on. PRADA, an approach proposed in our previous work, was designed to help prioritizing Android devices for apps. In this paper, we conduct a survey in two IT companies to study the applicability of PRADA. Results from the survey show that PRADA has attracted the interests of industrial Android developers.
