Massive MIMO Performance Comparison of Beamforming and Multiplexing in the Terahertz Band

In this paper, we compare the performance of two main MIMO techniques, beamforming and multiplexing, in the Terahertz (THz) band. The main problem with the THz band is its huge propagation loss, which is caused by the tremendous signal attenuation due to molecule absorption of the electro-magnetic wave. To overcome the path loss issue, massive MIMO has been suggested to be employed in the network and is expected to provide Tbps for a distance within a few meters. In this context, beamforming is studied recently as the main technique to take advantage of MIMO in THz and overcome the very high path loss with the assumption that the THz communication channel is Line-of-Sight (LoS) and there are not significant multipath rays. On the other hand, recent studies also showed that the well-known absorbed energy by molecules can be re-radiated immediately in the same frequency. Such re-radiated signal is correlated with the main signal and can provide rich scattering paths for the communication channel. This means that a significant MIMO multiplexing gain can be achieved even in a LoS scenario for the THz band. Our simulation results reveal a surprising observation that the MIMO multiplexing could be a better choice than the MIMO beamforming under certain conditions in THz communications.
