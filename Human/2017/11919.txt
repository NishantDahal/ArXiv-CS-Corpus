More new classes of permutation trinomials over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$

Permutation polynomials over finite fields have wide applications in many areas of science and engineering. In this paper, we present six new classes of permutation trinomials over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ which have explicit forms by determining the solutions of some equations.
