Network-based coverage of mutational profiles reveals cancer genes

A central goal in cancer genomics is to identify the somatic alterations that underpin tumor initiation and progression. This task is challenging as the mutational profiles of cancer genomes exhibit vast heterogeneity, with many alterations observed within each individual, few shared somatically mutated genes across individuals, and important roles in cancer for both frequently and infrequently mutated genes. While commonly mutated cancer genes are readily identifiable, those that are rarely mutated across samples are difficult to distinguish from the large numbers of other infrequently mutated genes. Here, we introduce a method that considers per-individual mutational profiles within the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated, comprise pathways that are perturbed across (i.e., "cover") a large fraction of the individuals. We devise a simple yet intuitive objective function that balances identifying a small subset of genes with covering a large fraction of individuals. We show how to solve this problem optimally using integer linear programming and also give a fast heuristic algorithm that works well in practice. We perform a large-scale evaluation of our resulting method, nCOP, on 6,038 TCGA tumor samples across 24 different cancer types. We demonstrate that our approach nCOP is more effective in identifying cancer genes than both methods that do not utilize any network information as well as state-of-the-art network-based methods that aggregate mutational information across individuals. Overall, our work demonstrates the power of combining per-individual mutational information with interaction networks in order to uncover genes functionally relevant in cancers, and in particular those genes that are less frequently mutated.
