Batch and PIR Codes and Their Connections to Locally Repairable Codes

In this survey, two related families of codes are discussed: batch codes and codes for private information retrieval. These two families can be viewed as natural generalizations of locally repairable codes, which were extensively studied in the context of coding for fault tolerance in distributed data storage systems. Bounds on the parameters of the codes, as well as basic constructions, are presented. Connections between different code families are discussed.
