Sentiment Classification using Images and Label Embeddings

In this project we analysed how much semantic information images carry, and how much value image data can add to sentiment analysis of the text associated with the images. To better understand the contribution from images, we compared models which only made use of image data, models which only made use of text data, and models which combined both data types. We also analysed if this approach could help sentiment classifiers generalize to unknown sentiments.
