Edge Computing and Dynamic Vision Sensing for Low Delay Access to Visual Medical Information

A new method is proposed to decrease the transmission delay of visual and non-visual medical records by using edge computing and Dynamic Vision Sensing (DVS) technologies. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can decrease the transmission delay by 89.15% to 93.23%. The maximum number of patients who can be served by edge devices is analysed.
