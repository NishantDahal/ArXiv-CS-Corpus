Photographic dataset: playing cards

This is a photographic dataset collected for testing image processing algorithms. The idea is to have images that can exploit the properties of total variation, therefore a set of playing cards was distributed on the scene. The dataset is made available at www.fips.fi/photographic_dataset2.php
