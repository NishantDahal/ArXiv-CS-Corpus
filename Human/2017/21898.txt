Image Registration Techniques: A Survey

Image Registration is the process of aligning two or more images of the same scene with reference to a particular image. The images are captured from various sensors at different times and at multiple view-points. Thus to get a better picture of any change of a scene or object over a considerable period of time image registration is important. Image registration finds application in medical sciences, remote sensing and in computer vision. This paper presents a detailed review of several approaches which are classified accordingly along with their contributions and drawbacks. The main steps of an image registration procedure are also discussed. Different performance measures are presented that determine the registration quality and accuracy. The scope for the future research are presented as well.
