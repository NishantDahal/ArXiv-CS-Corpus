Towards a Cloud-based Architecture for Visualization and Augmented Reality to Support Collaboration in Manufacturing Automation

In this report, we present our work in visualization and augmented reality technologies supporting collaboration in manufacturing automation. Our approach is based on (i) analysis based on spatial models of automation environments, (ii) next-generation controllers based on single board computers, (iii) cloud-, service- and web-based technologies and (iv) an emphasis on experimental development using real automation equipment. The contribution of this paper is the documentation of two new demonstrators, one for distributed viewing of 3D scans of factory environments, and another for real time augmented reality display of the status of a manufacturing plant, each based on technologies under development in our lab and in particular applied to a mini-factory.
