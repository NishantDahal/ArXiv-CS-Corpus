Exact Approaches for the Travelling Thief Problem

Many evolutionary and constructive heuristic approaches have been introduced in order to solve the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP). However, the accuracy of such approaches is unknown due to their inability to find global optima. In this paper, we propose three exact algorithms and a hybrid approach to the TTP. We compare these with state-of-the-art approaches to gather a comprehensive overview on the accuracy of heuristic methods for solving small TTP instances.
