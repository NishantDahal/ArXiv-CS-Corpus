Data dependent energy modelling for worst case energy consumption analysis

Safely meeting Worst Case Energy Consumption (WCEC) criteria requires accurate energy modeling of software. We investigate the impact of instruction operand values upon energy consumption in cacheless embedded processors. Existing instruction-level energy models typically use measurements from random input data, providing estimates unsuitable for safe WCEC analysis.
  We examine probabilistic energy distributions of instructions and propose a model for composing instruction sequences using distributions, enabling WCEC analysis on program basic blocks. The worst case is predicted with statistical analysis. Further, we verify that the energy of embedded benchmarks can be characterised as a distribution, and compare our proposed technique with other methods of estimating energy consumption.
