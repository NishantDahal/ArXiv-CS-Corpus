Dappled tiling

We consider a certain tiling problem of a planar region in which there are no long horizontal or vertical strips consisting of copies of the same tile. Intuitively speaking, we would like to create a dappled pattern with two or more kinds of tiles. We give an efficient algorithm to turn any tiling into one satisfying the condition, and discuss its applications in texturing.
