How to Generate Pseudorandom Permutations Over Other Groups

Recent results by Alagic and Russell have given some evidence that the Even-Mansour cipher may be secure against quantum adversaries with quantum queries, if considered over other groups than $(\mathbb{Z}/2)^n$. This prompts the question as to whether or not other classical schemes may be generalized to arbitrary groups and whether classical results still apply to those generalized schemes. In this thesis, we generalize the Even-Mansour cipher and the Feistel cipher. We show that Even and Mansour's original notions of secrecy are obtained on a one-key, group variant of the Even-Mansour cipher. We generalize the result by Kilian and Rogaway, that the Even-Mansour cipher is pseudorandom, to super pseudorandomness, also in the one-key, group case. Using a Slide Attack we match the bound found above. After generalizing the Feistel cipher to arbitrary groups we resolve an open problem of Patel, Ramzan, and Sundaram by showing that the 3-round Feistel cipher over an arbitrary group is not super pseudorandom. We generalize a result by Gentry and Ramzan showing that the Even-Mansour cipher can be implemented using the Feistel cipher as the public permutation. In this result, we also consider the one-key case over a group and generalize their bound. Finally, we consider Zhandry's result on quantum pseudorandom permutations, showing that his result may be generalized to hold for arbitrary groups. In this regard, we consider whether certain card shuffles may be generalized as well.
