Sampling-based Buffer Insertion for Post-Silicon Yield Improvement under Process Variability

At submicron manufacturing technology nodes process variations affect circuit performance significantly. This trend leads to a large timing margin and thus overdesign to maintain yield. To combat this pessimism, post-silicon clock tuning buffers can be inserted into circuits to balance timing budgets of critical paths with their neighbors. After manufacturing, these clock buffers can be configured for each chip individually so that chips with timing failures may be rescued to improve yield. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based method to determine the proper locations of these buffers. The goal of this buffer insertion is to reduce the number of buffers and their ranges, while still maintaining a good yield improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve a significant yield improvement (up to 35%) with only a small number of buffers.
