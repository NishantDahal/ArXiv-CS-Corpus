Distributed Relay Selection for Heterogeneous UAV Communication Networks Using A Many-to-Many Matching Game Without Substitutability

This paper proposes a distributed multiple relay selection scheme to maximize the satisfaction experiences of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communication networks. The multi-radio and multi-channel (MRMC) UAV communication system is considered in this paper. One source UAV can select one or more relay radios, and each relay radio can be shared by multiple source UAVs equally. Without the center controller, source UAVs with heterogeneous requirements compete for channels dominated by relay radios. In order to optimize the global satisfaction performance, we model the UAV communication network as a many-to-many matching market without substitutability. We design a potential matching approach to address the optimization problem, in which the optimizing of local matching process will lead to the improvement of global matching results. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed matching approach yields good matching performance of satisfaction, which is close to the global optimum result. Moreover, the many-to-many potential matching approach outperforms existing schemes sufficiently in terms of global satisfaction within a reasonable convergence time.
