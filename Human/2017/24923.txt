A non-commutative algorithm for multiplying (7 $\times$ 7) matrices using 250 multiplications

We present a non-commutative algorithm for multiplying (7x7) matrices using 250 multiplications and a non-commutative algorithm for multiplying (9x9) matrices using 520 multiplications. These algorithms are obtained using the same divide-and-conquer technique.
