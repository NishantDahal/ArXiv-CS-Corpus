A Distributed Scheduling Algorithm to Provide Quality-of-Service in Multihop Wireless Networks

Control of multihop Wireless networks in a distributed manner while providing end-to-end delay requirements for different flows, is a challenging problem. Using the notions of Draining Time and Discrete Review from the theory of fluid limits of queues, an algorithm that meets delay requirements to various flows in a network is constructed. The algorithm involves an optimization which is implemented in a cyclic distributed manner across nodes by using the technique of iterative gradient ascent, with minimal information exchange between nodes. The algorithm uses time varying weights to give priority to flows. The performance of the algorithm is studied in a network with interference modelled by independent sets.
