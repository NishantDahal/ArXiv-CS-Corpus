Finding Statistically Significant Attribute Interactions

In many data exploration tasks it is meaningful to identify groups of attribute interactions that are specific to a variable of interest. For instance, in a dataset where the attributes are medical markers and the variable of interest (class variable) is binary indicating presence/absence of disease, we would like to know which medical markers interact with respect to the binary class label. These interactions are useful in several practical applications, for example, to gain insight into the structure of the data, in feature selection, and in data anonymisation. We present a novel method, based on statistical significance testing, that can be used to verify if the data set has been created by a given factorised class-conditional joint distribution, where the distribution is parametrised by a partition of its attributes. Furthermore, we provide a method, named ASTRID, for automatically finding a partition of attributes describing the distribution that has generated the data. State-of-the-art classifiers are utilised to capture the interactions present in the data by systematically breaking attribute interactions and observing the effect of this breaking on classifier performance. We empirically demonstrate the utility of the proposed method with examples using real and synthetic data.
