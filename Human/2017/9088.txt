Achieving and Managing Availability SLAs with ITIL Driven Processes, DevOps, and Workflow Tools

System and application availability continues to be a fundamental characteristic of IT services. In recent years the IT Operations team at Wolters Kluwer CT Corporation has placed special focus on this area. Using a combination of goals, metrics, processes, organizational models, communication methods, corrective maintenance, root cause analysis, preventative engineering, automated alerting, and workflow automation significant progress has been made in meeting availability SLAs or Service Level Agreements. This paper presents the background of this work, approach, details of its implementation, and results. A special focus is provided on the use of a classical ITIL view as operationalized in an Agile and DevOps environment.
