Case For Static AMSDU Aggregation in WLANs

Frame aggregation is a mechanism by which multiple frames are combined into a single transmission unit over the air. Frames aggregated at the AMSDU level use a common CRC check to enforce integrity. For longer aggregated AMSDU frames, the packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate. Hence, multiple studies have proposed doing AMSDU aggregation adaptively based on the error rate. This study evaluates if there is a \emph{practical} advantage in doing adaptive AMSDU aggregation based on the link bit error rate. Evaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive AMSDU frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation aspects, it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional mechanisms while keeping the AMSDU aggregation logic simple.
