maskSLIC: Regional Superpixel Generation with Application to Local Pathology Characterisation in Medical Images

Supervoxel methods such as Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) are an effective technique for partitioning an image or volume into locally similar regions, and are a common building block for the development of detection, segmentation and analysis methods. We introduce maskSLIC an extension of SLIC to create supervoxels within regions-of-interest, and demonstrate,on examples from 2-dimensions to 4-dimensions, that maskSLIC overcomes issues that affect SLIC within an irregular mask. We highlight the benefits of this method through examples, and show that it is able to better represent underlying tumour subregions and achieves significantly better results than SLIC on the BRATS 2013 brain tumour challenge data (p=0.001) - outperforming SLIC on 18/20 scans. Finally, we show an application of this method for the analysis of functional tumour subregions and demonstrate that it is more effective than voxel clustering.
