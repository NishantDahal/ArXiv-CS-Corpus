The basic principles and the structure and algorithmically software of computing by hypercomplex number

In article the basic principles put in a basis of algorithmicallysoftware of hypercomplex number calculations, structure of a software, structure of functional subsystems are considered. The most important procedures included in subsystems are considered, program listings and examples of their application are given.
