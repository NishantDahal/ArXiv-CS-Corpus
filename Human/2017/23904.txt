Multiparty Routing: Secure Routing for Mixnets

Anonymous communication networks are important building blocks for online privacy protection. One approach to achieve anonymity is to relay messages through multiple routers, where each router shuffles messages independently. To achieve anonymity, at least one router needs to be honest. In the presence of an adversary that is controlling a subset of the routers unbiased routing is important for guaranteeing anonymity. However, the routing strategy also influenced other factors such as the scalability and the performance of the system. One solution is to use a fixed route for relaying all messages with many routers. If the route is not fixed the routing decision can either be made by the communication initiator or the intermediate routers. However, the existing routing types each have limitations. For example, one faces scalability issues when increasing the throughput of systems with fixed routes. Moreover, when the routing decision is left to the initiator, the initiator needs to maintain an up-to-date view of the system at all times, which also does not scale. If the routing decision is left to intermediate routers the routing of the communication can be influenced by an adversary. In this work, we propose a novel multiparty routing approach for anonymous communication that addresses these shortcomings. We distribute the routing decision and verify the correctness of routing to achieve routing integrity. More concretely, we provide a mixnet design that uses our routing approach and that in addition, addresses load balancing. We show that our system is secure against a global active adversary.
