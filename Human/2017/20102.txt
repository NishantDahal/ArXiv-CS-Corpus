Adapting Engineering Education to Industrie 4.0 Vision

Industrie 4.0 is originally a future vision described in the high-tech strategy of the German government that is conceived upon the information and communication technologies like Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Physical Internet and Internet of Services to achieve a high degree of flexibility in production, higher productivity rates through real-time monitoring and diagnosis, and a lower wastage rate of material in production. An important part of the tasks in the preparation for Industrie 4.0 is the adaption of the higher education to the requirements of this vision, in particular the engineering education. In this work, we introduce a road map consisting of three pillars describing the changes/enhancements to be conducted in the areas of curriculum development, lab concept, and student club activities. We also report our current application of this road map at the Turkish-German University, Istanbul.
