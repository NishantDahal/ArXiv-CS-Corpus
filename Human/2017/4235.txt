Definition of geometric space around analytic fractal trees using derivative coordinate funtions

The concept of derivative coordinate functions proved useful in the formulation of analytic fractal functions to represent smooth symmetric binary fractal trees [1]. In this paper we introduce a new geometry that defines the fractal space around these fractal trees. We present the canonical and degenerate form of this fractal space and extend the fractal geometrical space to R3 specifically and Rn by a recurrence relation. We also discuss the usage of such fractal geometry.
