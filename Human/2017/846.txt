Multi-Antenna Coded Caching

In this paper we consider a single-cell downlink scenario where a multiple-antenna base station delivers contents to multiple cache-enabled user terminals. Based on the multicasting opportunities provided by the so-called Coded Caching technique, we investigate three delivery approaches. Our baseline scheme employs the coded caching technique on top of max-min fair multicasting. The second one consists of a joint design of Zero-Forcing (ZF) and coded caching, where the coded chunks are formed in the signal domain (complex field). The third scheme is similar to the second one with the difference that the coded chunks are formed in the data domain (finite field). We derive closed-form rate expressions where our results suggest that the latter two schemes surpass the first one in terms of Degrees of Freedom (DoF). However, at the intermediate SNR regime forming coded chunks in the signal domain results in power loss, and will deteriorate throughput of the second scheme. The main message of our paper is that the schemes performing well in terms of DoF may not be directly appropriate for intermediate SNR regimes, and modified schemes should be employed.
