On the Lattice of Cyclic Linear Codes Over Finite Chain Rings

Let $\texttt{R}$ be a commutative finite chain ring of invariants $(q,s).$ In this paper, the trace representation of any free cyclic $\texttt{R}$-linear code of length $\ell,$ is presented, via the $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $\ell,$ when $\texttt{gcd}(\ell, q) = 1.$ The lattice $\left(\texttt{Cy}(\texttt{R},\ell), +, \cap\right)$ of cyclic $\texttt{R}$-linear codes of length $\ell,$ is investigated. A lower bound on the Hamming distance of cyclic $\texttt{R}$-linear codes of length $\ell,$ is established. When $q$ is even, a family of MDS and self-orthogonal $\texttt{R}$-linear cyclic codes, is constructed.
