A survey of paraconsistent logics

A survey of paraconsistent logics that are prominent representatives of the different approaches that have been followed to develop paraconsistent logics is provided. The paraconsistent logics that will be discussed are an enrichment of Priest's logic LP, the logic RM3 from the school of relevance logic, da Costa's logics Cn, Jaskowski's logic D2, and Subrahmanian's logics Ptau. A deontic logic based on the first of these logics will be discussed as well. Moreover, some proposed adaptations of the AGM theory of belief revision to paraconsistent logics will be mentioned.
