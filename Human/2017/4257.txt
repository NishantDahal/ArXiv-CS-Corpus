Fully Mechanized Proofs of Dilworths Theorem and Mirskys Theorem

We present two fully mechanized proofs of Dilworths and Mirskys theorems in the Coq proof assistant. Dilworths Theorem states that in any finite partially ordered set (poset), the size of a smallest chain cover and a largest antichain are the same. Mirskys Theorem is a dual of Dilworths Theorem. We formalize the proofs by Perles [2] (for Dilworths Theorem) and by Mirsky [5] (for the dual theorem). We also come up with a library of definitions and facts that can be used as a framework for formalizing other theorems on finite posets.
