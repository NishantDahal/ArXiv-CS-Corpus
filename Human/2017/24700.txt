Power Plexus: A network based analysis

Power generation and distribution remains an important topic of discussion since the industrial revolution. As the system continues to grow, it needs to evolve both in infrastructure, robustness and its resilience to deal with failures. One such potential failure that we target in this work is the cascading failure. This avalanche effect propagates through the network and we study this propagation by Percolation Theory and implement some solutions for mitigation. We have extended the percolation theory as given in Mark Newman. Networks: an introduction,for random nodes to targeted nodes having high load bearing which is eliminated from the network to study the cascade effect. We also implement mitigation strategy to improve the network performance.
