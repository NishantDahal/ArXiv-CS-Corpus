Impacts of Culture and Socio-Economic Circumstances on Users' Behavior and Mobile Broadband Technology Diffusion Trends

The use of Internet and Internet-based services on PCs, Laptops, Net Pads, Mobile Phones, PDAs etc have not only changed the global economy but also the way people communicate and their life styles. It also has evolved people from different origins, cultures, beliefs across the national boundaries. As a result it has become an absolute necessity to address the cross-cultural issues of information systems (IS) reflecting the user behaviours and influencing the way the mobile broadband technology is being accepted as well as the way it is changing the life styles of different groups of people. This paper reports on an on-going research effort which studies the impacts of culture and socio-economic circumstances on users' behavior and mobile broadband technology diffusion trends.
