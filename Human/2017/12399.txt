Efficient Removal Lemmas for Matrices

The authors and Fischer recently proved that any hereditary property of two-dimensional matrices (where the row and column order is not ignored) over a finite alphabet is testable with a constant number of queries, by establishing the following (ordered) matrix removal lemma: For any finite alphabet $Σ$, any hereditary property $\mathcal{P}$ of matrices over $Σ$, and any $ε> 0$, there exists $f_{\mathcal{P}}(ε)$ such that for any matrix $M$ over $Σ$ that is $ε$-far from satisfying $\mathcal{P}$, most of the $f_{\mathcal{P}}(ε) \times f_{\mathcal{P}}(ε)$ submatrices of $M$ do not satisfy $\mathcal{P}$. Here being $ε$-far from $\mathcal{P}$ means that one needs to modify at least an $ε$-fraction of the entries of $M$ to make it satisfy $\mathcal{P}$.
  However, in the above general removal lemma, $f_{\mathcal{P}}(ε)$ grows very fast as a function of $ε^{-1}$, even when $\mathcal{P}$ is characterized by a single forbidden submatrix. In this work we establish much more efficient removal lemmas for several special cases of the above problem. In particular, we show the following: For any fixed $s \times t$ binary matrix $A$ and any $ε> 0$ there exists $δ> 0$ polynomial in $ε$, such that for any binary matrix $M$ in which less than a $δ$-fraction of the $s \times t$ submatrices are equal to $A$, there exists a set of less than an $ε$-fraction of the entries of $M$ that intersects every $A$-copy in $M$.
  We generalize the work of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP'07] and make progress towards proving one of their conjectures. The proofs combine their efficient conditional regularity lemma for matrices with additional combinatorial and probabilistic ideas.
