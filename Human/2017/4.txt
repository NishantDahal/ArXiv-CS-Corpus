Factoring Odd Integers without Multiplication and Division

A method of determining two factors of an odd integer without need of multiplication or division operation in iterative portion of computation is presented. It is feasible for an implementing algorithm to use only integer addition and subtraction throughout. Presentation of material is non-theoretical; intended to be accessible to a broader audience of non academic and theoretical practitioners.
