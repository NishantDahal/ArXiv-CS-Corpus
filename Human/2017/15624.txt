An improved watermarking scheme for Internet applications

In this paper, a data hiding scheme ready for Internet applications is proposed. An existing scheme based on chaotic iterations is improved, to respond to some major Internet security concerns, such as digital rights management, communication over hidden channels, and social search engines. By using Reed Solomon error correcting codes and wavelets domain, we show that this data hiding scheme can be improved to solve issues and requirements raised by these Internet fields.
