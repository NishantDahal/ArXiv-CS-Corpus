Computational Methods for Path-based Robust Flows

Real world networks are often subject to severe uncertainties which need to be addressed by any reliable prescriptive model. In the context of the maximum flow problem subject to arc failure, robust models have gained particular attention. For a path-based model, the resulting optimization problem is assumed to be difficult in the literature, yet the complexity status is widely unknown. We present a computational approach to solve the robust flow problem to optimality by simultaneous primal and dual separation, the practical efficacy of which is shown by a computational study.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel model of robust flows which provides a compromise between stochastic and robust optimization by assigning probabilities to groups of scenarios. The new model can be solved by the same computational techniques as the robust model. A bound on the generalization error is proven for the case that the probabilities are determined empirically. The suggested model as well as the computational approach extend to linear optimization problems more general than robust flows.
