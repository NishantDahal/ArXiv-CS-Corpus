Load Balancing for Skewed Streams on Heterogeneous Cluster

Streaming applications frequently encounter skewed workloads and execute on heterogeneous clusters. Optimal resource utilization in such adverse conditions becomes a challenge, as it requires inferring the resource capacities and input distribution at run time. In this paper, we tackle the aforementioned challenges by modeling them as a load balancing problem. We propose a novel partitioning strategy called Consistent Grouping (CG), which enables each processing element instance (PEI) to process the workload according to its capacity. The main idea behind CG is the notion of small, equal-sized virtual workers at the sources, which are assigned to workers based on their capacities. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm and show via extensive empirical evaluation that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, like key grouping. In particular, CG achieves 3.44x better performance in terms of latency compared to key grouping.
