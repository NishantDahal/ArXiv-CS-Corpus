Computational Aided Design for Generating a Modular, Lightweight Car Concept

Developing an appropriate design process for a conceptual model is a stepping stone toward designing car bodies. This paper presents a methodology to design a lightweight and modular space frame chassis for a sedan electric car. The dual phase high strength steel with improved mechanical properties is employed to reduce the weight of the car body. Utilizing the finite element analysis yields two models in order to predict the performance of each component. The first model is a beam structure with a rapid response in structural stiffness simulation. This model is used for performing the static tests including modal frequency, bending stiffens and torsional stiffness evaluation. Whereas the second model, i.e., a shell model, is proposed to illustrate every module's mechanical behavior as well as its crashworthiness efficiency. In order to perform the crashworthiness analysis, the explicit nonlinear dynamic solver provided by ABAQUS, a commercial finite element software, is used. The results of finite element beam and shell models are in line with the concept design specifications. Implementation of this procedure leads to generate a lightweight and modular concept for an electric car.
