One-Pass Graphic Approximation of Integer Sequences

A variety of network modeling problems begin by generating a degree sequence drawn from a given probability distribution. If the randomly generated sequence is not graphic, we give a new approach for generating a graphic approximation of the sequence. This approximation scheme is fast, requiring only one pass through the sequence, and produces small probability distribution distances for large sequences.
