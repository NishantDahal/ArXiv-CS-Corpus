Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno Working together as a Basic Meteorological Station

The present paper describes a novel Raspberry Pi and Arduino UNO architecture used as a meteorological station. One of the advantages of the proposed architecture is the huge quantity of sensors developed for its usage; practically one can find them for any application, and weather sensing is not an exception. The principle followed is to configure Raspberry as a collector for measures obtained from Arduino, transmitting occurs via USB; meanwhile, Raspberry broadcasts them via a web page. For such activity is possible thanks to Raspbian, a Linux-based operating system. It has a lot of libraries and resources available, among them Apache Web Server, that gives the possibility to host a web-page. On it, the user can observe temperature, humidity, solar radiance, and wind speed and direction. Information on the web-page is refreshed each five minute; however, measurements arrive at Raspberry every ten seconds. This low refreshment rate was determined because weather variables normally do not abruptly change. As an additional feature, system stores all information on the log file, this gives the possibility for future analysis and processing.
