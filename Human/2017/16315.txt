Research on Human Dynamics of Information Release of WeChat Users

The information release behavior of WeChat users is influenced by many factors, and studying the rules of the behavior of users in WeChat can provide theoretical help for the dynamic research of mobile social network users. By crawling WeChat moments information of nine users within 5 years, we used the human behavioral dynamics system to analyze users' behavior. The results show that the information distribution behavior of WeChat users is consistent with the power-law distribution for a certain period of time. Meanwhile, there is an anti-memory characteristic in information release behavior of WeChat users, which is significantly different from other user behavior patterns in online social networks. The results of the study provide theoretical support for the further study of information release behavior of Wechat users.
