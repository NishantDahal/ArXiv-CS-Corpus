Differentially Private Release of Public Transport Data: The Opal Use Case

This document describes the application of a differentially private algorithm to release public transport usage data from Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW), Australia. The data consists of two separate weeks of "tap-on/tap-off" data of individuals who used any of the four different modes of public transport from TfNSW: buses, light rail, train and ferries. These taps are recorded through the smart ticketing system, known as Opal, available in the state of New South Wales, Australia.
