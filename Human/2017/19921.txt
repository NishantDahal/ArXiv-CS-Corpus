Detection and Analysis of Human Emotions through Voice and Speech Pattern Processing

The ability to modulate vocal sounds and generate speech is one of the features which set humans apart from other living beings. The human voice can be characterized by several attributes such as pitch, timbre, loudness, and vocal tone. It has often been observed that humans express their emotions by varying different vocal attributes during speech generation. Hence, deduction of human emotions through voice and speech analysis has a practical plausibility and could potentially be beneficial for improving human conversational and persuasion skills. This paper presents an algorithmic approach for detection and analysis of human emotions with the help of voice and speech processing. The proposed approach has been developed with the objective of incorporation with futuristic artificial intelligence systems for improving human-computer interactions.
