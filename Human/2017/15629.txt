New extremal singly even self-dual codes of lengths $64$ and $66$

For lengths $64$ and $66$, we construct extremal singly even self-dual codes with weight enumerators for which no extremal singly even self-dual codes were previously known to exist. We also construct new $40$ inequivalent extremal doubly even self-dual $[64,32,12]$ codes with covering radius $12$ meeting the Delsarte bound.
