Unified Analytical Modeling of the Error Rates and the Ergodic Channel Capacity in $η$-$μ$ Generalized Fading Channels with Integer $μ$ and Maximal Ratio Combining Receiver

In this paper we introduce a novel performance analysis of the $η$-$μ$ generalized radio fading channels with integer value of the $μ$ fading parameter, i.e. with even number of multipath clusters. This fading model includes other fading models as special cases such as the Nakagami-m, the Hoyt, and the Rayleigh. We obtain novel unified and generic simple closed-form expressions for the average bit error rates and ergodic channel capacity in the additive white generalized Gaussian noise (AWGGN), which includes the additive Gaussian, the gamma, the Laplacian, and the impulsive noise as special cases. The receiver is assumed to be an L-branch maximal ratio combiner where we study the effect of having more deployed receiver antenna. Numerical evaluation as well as results from technical wireless literature validate the generality and the accuracy of the derived unified expressions under the studied test cases.
