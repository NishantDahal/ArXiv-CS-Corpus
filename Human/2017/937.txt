JSON: data model, query languages and schema specification

Despite the fact that JSON is currently one of the most popular formats for exchanging data on the Web, there are very few studies on this topic and there are no agreement upon theoretical framework for dealing with JSON. There- fore in this paper we propose a formal data model for JSON documents and, based on the common features present in available systems using JSON, we define a lightweight query language allowing us to navigate through JSON documents. We also introduce a logic capturing the schema proposal for JSON and study the complexity of basic computational tasks associated with these two formalisms.
