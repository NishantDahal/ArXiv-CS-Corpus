Progressive Bit-Flipping Decoding of Polar Codes Over Layered Critical Sets

In successive cancellation (SC) polar decoding, an incorrect estimate of any prior unfrozen bit may bring about severe error propagation in the following decoding, thus it is desirable to find out and correct an error as early as possible. In this paper, we first construct a critical set $S$ of unfrozen bits, which with high probability (typically $>99\%$) includes the bit where the first error happens. Then we develop a progressive multi-level bit-flipping decoding algorithm to correct multiple errors over the multiple-layer critical sets each of which is constructed using the remaining undecoded subtree associated with the previous layer. The \emph{level} in fact indicates the number of \emph{independent} errors that could be corrected. We show that as the level increases, the block error rate (BLER) performance of the proposed progressive bit flipping decoder competes with the corresponding cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoder, e.g., a level 4 progressive bit-flipping decoder is comparable to the CA-SCL decoder with a list size of $L=32$. Furthermore, the average complexity of the proposed algorithm is much lower than that of a SCL decoder (and is similar to that of SC decoding) at medium to high signal to noise ratio (SNR).
