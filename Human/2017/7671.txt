CoMET: Composite-Input Magnetoelectric-based Logic Technology

This work proposes CoMET, a fast and energy-efficient spintronics device for logic applications. An input voltage is applied to a ferroelectric (FE) material, in contact with a composite structure - a ferromagnet (FM) with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) placed on top of an intra-gate FM interconnect with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through the magnetoelectric (ME) effect, the input voltage nucleates a domain wall (DW) at the input end of the PMA-FM interconnect. An applied current then rapidly propagates the DW towards the output FE structure, where the inverse-ME effect generates an output voltage. This voltage is propagated to the input of the next CoMET device using a novel circuit structure that enables efficient device cascading. The material parameters for CoMET are optimized by systematically exploring the impact of parameter choices on device performance. Simulations on a 7nm CoMET device show fast, low-energy operation, with a delay/energy of 98ps/68aJ for INV and 135ps/85aJ for MAJ3.
