Complexity of Verifying Nonblockingness in Modular Supervisory Control

Complexity analysis becomes a common task in supervisory control. However, many results of interest are spread across different topics. The aim of this paper is to bring several interesting results from complexity theory and to illustrate their relevance to supervisory control by proving new nontrivial results concerning nonblockingness in modular supervisory control of discrete event systems modeled by finite automata.
