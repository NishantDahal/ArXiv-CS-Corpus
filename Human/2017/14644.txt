Towards M-Adhesive Categories based on Coalgebras and Comma Categories

In this contribution we investigate several extensions of the powerset that comprise arbitrarily nested subsets, and call them superpower set. This allows the definition of graphs with possibly infinitely nested nodes. additionally we define edges that are incident to edges. Since we use coalgebraic constructions we refer to these graphs as corecursive graphs. The superpower set functors are examined and then used for the definition of $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive categories which are the basic categories for $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive transformation systems. So, we additionally show that coalgebras $\mathbf{Sets}_F$ are $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive categories provided the functor $F:\mathbf{Sets}_F \to \mathbf{Sets}_F$ preserves pullbacks along monomorphisms.
