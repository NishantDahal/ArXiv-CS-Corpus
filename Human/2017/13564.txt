$Θ_S-$cyclic codes over $A_k$

We study $Θ_S-$cyclic codes over the family of rings $A_k.$ We characterize $Θ_S-$cyclic codes in terms of their binary images. A family of Hermitian inner-products is defined and we prove that if a code is $Θ_S-$cyclic then its Hermitian dual is also $Θ_S-$cyclic. Finally, we give constructions of $Θ_S-$cyclic codes.
