A Minimum Reconfiguration Probability Routing Algorithm for RWA in All-Optical Networks

In this paper, we present a detailed study of Minimum Reconfiguration Probability Routing (MRPR) algorithm, and its performance evaluation in comparison with Adaptive unconstrained routing (AUR) and Least Loaded routing (LLR) algorithms. We have minimized the effects of failures on link and router failure in the network under changing load conditions, we assess the probability of service and number of light path failures due to link or route failure on Wavelength Interchange(WI) network. The computation complexity is reduced by using Kalman Filter(KF) techniques. The minimum reconfiguration probability routing (MRPR) algorithm selects most reliable routes and assign wavelengths to connections in a manner that utilizes the light path(LP) established efficiently considering all possible requests.
