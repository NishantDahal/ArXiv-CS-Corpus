On evolutionary selection of blackjack strategies

We apply the approach of evolutionary programming to the problem of optimization of the blackjack basic strategy. We demonstrate that the population of initially random blackjack strategies evolves and saturates to a profitable performance in about one hundred generations. The resulting strategy resembles the known blackjack basic strategies in the specifics of its prescriptions, and has a similar performance. We also study evolution of the population of strategies initialized to the Thorp's basic strategy.
