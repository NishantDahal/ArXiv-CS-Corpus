Packing and covering with balls on Busemann surfaces

In this note we prove that for any compact subset $S$ of a Busemann surface $({\mathcal S},d)$ (in particular, for any simple polygon with geodesic metric) and any positive number $δ$, the minimum number of closed balls of radius $δ$ with centers at $\mathcal S$ and covering the set $S$ is at most 19 times the maximum number of disjoint closed balls of radius $δ$ centered at points of $S$: $ν(S) \le ρ(S) \le 19ν(S)$, where $ρ(S)$ and $ν(S)$ are the covering and the packing numbers of $S$ by $δ$-balls.
