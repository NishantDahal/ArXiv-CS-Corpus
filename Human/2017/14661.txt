Wide-Residual-Inception Networks for Real-time Object Detection

Since convolutional neural network(CNN)models emerged,several tasks in computer vision have actively deployed CNN models for feature extraction. However,the conventional CNN models have a high computational cost and require high memory capacity, which is impractical and unaffordable for commercial applications such as real-time on-road object detection on embedded boards or mobile platforms. To tackle this limitation of CNN models, this paper proposes a wide-residual-inception (WR-Inception) network, which constructs the architecture based on a residual inception unit that captures objects of various sizes on the same feature map, as well as shallower and wider layers, compared to state-of-the-art networks like ResNet. To verify the proposed networks, this paper conducted two experiments; one is a classification task on CIFAR-10/100 and the other is an on-road object detection task using a Single-Shot Multi-box Detector(SSD) on the KITTI dataset.
