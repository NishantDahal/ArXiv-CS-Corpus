Capacity and Normalized Optimal Detection Error in Gaussian Channels

For vector Gaussian channels, a precise differential connection between channel capacity and a quantity termed normalized optimal detection error (NODE) is presented. Then, this C-NODE relationship is extended to continuous-time Gaussian channels drawing on a waterfilling characterization recently found for the capacity of continuous-time linear time-varying channels. In the latter case, the C-NODE relationship becomes asymptotic in nature. In either case, the C-NODE relationship is compared with the I-MMSE relationship due to Guo et al. connecting mutual information in Gaussian channels with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) of estimation theory.
