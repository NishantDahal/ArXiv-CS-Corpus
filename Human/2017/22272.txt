Feature Selection Facilitates Learning Mixtures of Discrete Product Distributions

Feature selection can facilitate the learning of mixtures of discrete random variables as they arise, e.g. in crowdsourcing tasks. Intuitively, not all workers are equally reliable but, if the less reliable ones could be eliminated, then learning should be more robust. By analogy with Gaussian mixture models, we seek a low-order statistical approach, and here introduce an algorithm based on the (pairwise) mutual information. This induces an order over workers that is well structured for the `one coin' model. More generally, it is justified by a goodness-of-fit measure and is validated empirically. Improvement in real data sets can be substantial.
