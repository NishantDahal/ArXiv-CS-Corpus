Full-Duplex Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks with Wireless Energy Harvesting

This paper proposes and analyzes a new full-duplex (FD) cooperative cognitive radio network with wireless energy harvesting (EH). We consider that the secondary receiver is equipped with a FD radio and acts as a FD hybrid access point (HAP), which aims to collect information from its associated EH secondary transmitter (ST) and relay the signals. The ST is assumed to be equipped with an EH unit and a rechargeable battery such that it can harvest and accumulate energy from radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted by the primary transmitter (PT) and the HAP. We develop a novel cooperative spectrum sharing (CSS) protocol for the considered system. In the proposed protocol, thanks to its FD capability, the HAP can receive the PT's signals and transmit energy-bearing signals to charge the ST simultaneously, or forward the PT's signals and receive the ST's signals at the same time. We derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput of both primary and secondary links by characterizing the dynamic charging/discharging behaviors of the ST battery as a finite-state Markov chain. We present numerical results to validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the merits of the proposed protocol over its non-cooperative counterpart.
