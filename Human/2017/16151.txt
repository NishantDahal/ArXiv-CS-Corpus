TPC Together with Overlapped Time Domain Multiplexing System Based on Turbo Structure

Overlapped time domain multiplexing (OvTDM) is a novel technique for utilizing inter-symbol interference (ISI) to benefit a communication system. We implement the OvTDM technique based on turbo structure and associate a turbo product code (TPC) to construct a novel coded turbo-structure OvTDM system. Two schemes of the iterative receiver and soft input and soft output (SISO) decoding algorithms are presented. Simulation results show the advantage of structures in this paper. In addition, an attractive transmission rate and symbol efficiency of the designed system can also be observed.
