Hidden-Markov-Model Based Speech Enhancement

The goal of this contribution is to use a parametric speech synthesis system for reducing background noise and other interferences from recorded speech signals. In a first step, Hidden Markov Models of the synthesis system are trained.
  Two adequate training corpora consisting of text and corresponding speech files have been set up and cleared of various faults, including inaudible utterances or incorrect assignments between audio and text data. Those are tested and compared against each other regarding e.g. flaws in the synthesized speech, it's naturalness and intelligibility. Thus different voices have been synthesized, whose quality depends less on the number of training samples used, but much more on the cleanliness and signal-to-noise ratio of those. Generalized voice models have been used for synthesis and the results greatly differ between the two speech corpora.
  Tests regarding the adaptation to different speakers show that a resemblance to the original speaker is audible throughout all recordings, yet the synthesized voices sound robotic and unnatural in smaller parts. The spoken text, however, is usually intelligible, which shows that the models are working well.
  In a novel approach, speech is synthesized using side information of the original audio signal, particularly the pitch frequency. Results show an increase of speech quality and intelligibility in comparison to speech synthesized solely from text, up to the point of being nearly indistinguishable from the original.
