On the Local Correctabilities of Projective Reed-Muller Codes

In this paper, we show that the projective Reed-Muller~(PRM) codes form a family of locally correctable codes~(LCC) in the regime of low query complexities. A PRM code is specified by the alphabet size $q$, the number of variables $m$, and the degree $d$. When $d\leq q-1$, we present a perfectly smooth local decoder to recover a symbol by accessing $Î³\leq q$ symbols to the coordinates fall on a line. There are three major parameters considered in LCCs, namely the query complexity, the message length and the code length. This paper shows that PRM codes are shorter than generalized Reed-Muller~(GRM) codes in LCCs. Precisely, given a GRM code over a field of size $q$, there exists a class of shorter codes over a field of size $q-1$, while maintaining the same values on the query complexities and the message lengths.
