Capacity of Some Index Coding Problems with Symmetric Neighboring Interference

A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring interference (SNI) has equal number of $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_{k}$ wanting the $k$th message $x_{k}$ and having the side-information $\mathcal{K}_{k}=(\mathcal{I}_{k} \cup x_{k})^c,$ where ${I}_k= \{x_{k-U},\dots,x_{k-2},x_{k-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+1}, x_{k+2},\dots,x_{k+D}\}$ is the interference with $D$ messages after and $U$ messages before its desired message. Maleki, Cadambe and Jafar obtained the capacity of this symmetric neighboring interference single unicast index coding problem (SNI-SUICP) with $(K)$ tending to infinity and Blasiak, Kleinberg and Lubetzky for the special case of $(D=U=1)$ with $K$ being finite. In this work, for any finite $K$ and arbitrary $D$ we obtain the capacity for the case $U=gcd(K,D+1)-1.$ Our proof is constructive, i.e., we give an explicit construction of a linear index code achieving the capacity.
