Remote Document Encryption - encrypting data for e-passport holders

We show how any party can encrypt data for an e-passport holder such that only with physical possession of the e-passport decryption is possible. The same is possible for electronic identity cards and driver licenses. We also indicate possible applications. Dutch passports allow for 160 bit security, theoretically giving sufficient security beyond the year 2079, exceeding current good practice of 128 bit security. We also introduce the notion of RDE Extraction PIN which effectively provides the same security as a regular PIN. Our results ironically suggest that carrying a passport when traveling abroad might violate export or import laws on strong cryptography.
