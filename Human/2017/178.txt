On the Degrees-of-Freedom of the MIMO Three-Way Channel with Intermittent Connectivity

The degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the multi-antenna three-way channel (3WC) with an intermittent node is studied. Special attention is given to the impact of adaptation. A nonadaptive transmission scheme based on interference alignment, zero-forcing, and erasure-channel treatment is proposed, and its corresponding DoF region is derived. Then, it is shown that this scheme achieves the sum-DoF of the intermittent channel, in addition to the DoF region of the nonintermittent one. Thus, adaptation is not necessary from those perspectives. To the contrary, it is shown that adaptation is necessary for achieving the DoF region of the intermittent case. This is shown by deriving an outer bound for the intermittent channel with nonadaptive encoding, and giving a counterexample of an adaptive scheme which achieves DoF tuples outside this bound. This highlights the importance of cooperation in this intermittent network.
