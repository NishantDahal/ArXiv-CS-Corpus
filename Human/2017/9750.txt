Orthogonal Code-based Block Transmission for Burst Transmission

This paper proposes a new multi-carrier system, called orthogonal code-based block transmission (OCBT). OCBT applies a time-spreading method with an orthogonal code to have a block signal structure and a windowing procedure to reduce the out-of-band (OOB) radiation. The proposed OCBT can transmit the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals to use the conventional multiple input multiple output techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed OCBT using QAM signal has the short burst compared to the filter-bank multi-carrier (FBMC), the low complexity compared to FBMC and windowed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (W-OFDM) and also the low OOB radiation compared to OFDM.
