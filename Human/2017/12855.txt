A Feasibility Study of Using Light Fidelity With Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Indoor Collaborative And Cooperative Networking

This paper evaluates the feasibility of using light fidelity with multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for indoor collaborative and cooperative networking. A number of works have presentedchallenges for wireless networking with multiple UAVs such as bandwidth efficiency, security and environment amongst others. Due to this fact, there is a need to secure information and data in UAV ad hoc network (FANETs) using a secure transmission medium that guarantees bandwidth efficiency such as the light fidelity (Li-Fi). Li-Fi enables data transmission using visible light through a light emitting diode (LED) and is chosen as against wireless fidelity (Wi- Fi) because it is more ideal for high density wireless data coverage in confined areas, better at addressing radio interference related issues and provides better bandwidth, efficiency, availability and security. Thus, using Light Fidelity as a means of communication necessitates the need to develop a Link Velocity Based Connectivity Algorithm (LVCA) that governs communication between the UAVs and the Li-Fi transmitter and receiver circuits for collaborative and cooperative networking.
