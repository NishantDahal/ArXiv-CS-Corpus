Uncountable realtime probabilistic classes

We investigate the minimum cases for realtime probabilistic machines that can define uncountably many languages with bounded error. We show that logarithmic space is enough for realtime PTMs on unary languages. On binary case, we follow the same result for double logarithmic space, which is tight. When replacing the worktape with some limited memories, we can follow uncountable results on unary languages for two counters.
