WiPLoc: Perpetual Indoor Localization with RF Wireless Power Transfer

Indoor localization is a cornerstone of mobile services. Until now most of the research effort has focused on achieving sub-meter localization accuracy because many mobile applications depend on precise localization measurements. In some scenarios, however, it is required to trade location accuracy for system maintainability. For example, in large-scale deployments of indoor networks, such as item-monitoring in smart buildings, attaining room-level localization accuracy may be sufficient, but replacing the batteries of the devices used for localization could lead to high operational costs. As indoor localization systems grow in popularity it will be important to provide them with full energy autonomy. To tackle this problem we propose WiPLoc: an indoor localization system aimed at operating perpetually without batteries. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a novel localization method that exploits capture effect and orthogonal codes to operate at energy levels that are low enough to operate within the energy budget provided by long-range wireless power transmission. Second, we implement WiPLoc using off-the-shelf components and test it extensively in a laboratory environment. Our test results show that with WiPLoc one wireless charger per (16 m$^{\text{2}}$) room can enable perpetual lifetime operation of mobile objects requiring localization with an average accuracy of almost 90%.
