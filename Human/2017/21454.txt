semantify.it, a Platform for Creation, Publication and Distribution of Semantic Annotations

The application of semantic technologies to content on the web is, in many regards, important and urgent. Search engines, chatbots, intelligent personal assistants and other technologies increasingly rely on content published as semantic structured data. Yet, the process of creating this kind of data is still complicated and widely unknown. The semantify.it platform implements an approach to solve three of the most challenging question regarding the publication of structured semantic data, namely: a) what vocabulary to use, b) how to create annotation files and c) how to publish or integrate annotations within a website without programming. This paper presents the idea and the development of the semantify.it platform. It demonstrates that the creation process of semantically annotated data does not have to be hard, shows use cases and pilot users of the created software and presents where the development of this platform or alike projects lead to in the future.
