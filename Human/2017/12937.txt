A Unified Joint Matrix Factorization Framework for Data Integration

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool in data exploratory analysis by discovering the hidden features and part-based patterns from high-dimensional data. NMF and its variants have been successfully applied into diverse fields such as pattern recognition, signal processing, data mining, bioinformatics and so on. Recently, NMF has been extended to analyze multiple matrices simultaneously. However, a unified framework is still lacking. In this paper, we introduce a sparse multiple relationship data regularized joint matrix factorization (JMF) framework and two adapted prediction models for pattern recognition and data integration. Next, we present four update algorithms to solve this framework. The merits and demerits of these algorithms are systematically explored. Furthermore, extensive computational experiments using both synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of JMF framework and related algorithms on pattern recognition and data mining.
