Dynamic Distributed Mobility Management System based on Multiple Mix-Zones over Road Networks

Vehicle have access to the internet for communications to facilitate the need of mobility management and point of interest distribution in emerging Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) . Therefore, its obvious that by changing the road side unit frequently , may require fast handover management to mobile user (MU) for the configuration of new IP address , however the ongoing session remain un-disturbed . Recent study has shown that , the current version of IP mobility protocols are the centralized solutions, In centralized environment data traffic and data management is being routed to an anchor entity.In some situations , the vehicles may be routed in the form of group to pass from one RSU to another RSU.In response the traffic and mobility exchanged messages are increased and it will dramatically affect the performance of network.To cope with these challenges a new construct named DDMM (Dynamic Distributed Mobility management) has been anticipated by IETF DDMM organization. It has been designed on the basis of network-based CMM protocol, which is known as Proxy Mobile IPv6(PMIPv6).However , it has been realized that there can be significance difference among network based DDMM and PMIPv6 with respect to handover latency and packet loss.Therefore , we have envisioned fast handover for network-based DDMM (Dynamic Distributed Mobility management) which is based on fast handover for PMIPv6(PFMIPv6).However , it has been required to include modifications on PFMIPV6 to take on DDMM. We have designed some important additions to support this model, when MU hold IP flows and has many different anchor entities.In addition we also derived analytical expressions to check and made comparison about the handover performance of the given DDMM schemes.It has been revealed that DDMM has outperformed in terms of handover latency , session recovery and packet loss as compared with previous schemes.
