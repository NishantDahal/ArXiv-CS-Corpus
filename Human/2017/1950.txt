Exact Synthesis of Reversible Logic Circuits using Model Checking

Synthesis of reversible logic circuits has gained great atten- tion during the last decade. Various synthesis techniques have been pro- posed, some generate optimal solutions (in gate count) and are termed as exact, while others are scalable in the sense that they can handle larger functions but generate sub-optimal solutions. Although scalable synthe- sis is very much essential for circuit design, exact synthesis is also of great importance as it helps in building design library for the synthesis of larger functions. In this paper, we propose an exact synthesis technique for re- versible circuits using model checking. We frame the synthesis problem as a model checking instance and propose an iterative bounded model checking calls for an optimal synthesis. Experiments on reversible logic benchmarks shows successful synthesis of optimal circuits. We also illus- trate optimal synthesis of random functions with as many as 10 variables and up to 10 gates.
