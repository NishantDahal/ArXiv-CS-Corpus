Secure Channel for Molecular Communications

Molecular communication in nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm that uses molecules as information carriers. Achieving a secure information exchange is one of the practical challenges that need to be considered to address the potential of molecular communications in nanonetworks. In this article, we have introduced secure channel into molecular communications to prevent eavesdropping. First, we propose a Diffie Hellman algorithm-based method by which communicating nanomachines can exchange a secret key through molecular signaling. Then, we use this secret key to perform ciphering. Also, we present both the algorithm for secret key exchange and the secured molecular communication system. The proposed secured system is found effective in terms of energy consumption.
