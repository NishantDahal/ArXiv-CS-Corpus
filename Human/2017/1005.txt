SOI RF Switch for Wireless Sensor Network

The objective of this research was to design a 0-5 GHz RF SOI switch, with 0.18um power Jazz SOI technology by using Cadence software, for health care applications. This paper introduces the design of a RF switch implemented in shunt-series topology. An insertion loss of 0.906 dB and an isolation of 30.95 dB were obtained at 5 GHz. The switch also achieved a third order distortion of 53.05 dBm and 1 dB compression point reached 50.06dBm. The RF switch performance meets the desired specification requirements.
