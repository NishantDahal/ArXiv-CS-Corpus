Multi-Speaker Localization Using Convolutional Neural Network Trained with Noise

The problem of multi-speaker localization is formulated as a multi-class multi-label classification problem, which is solved using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based source localization method. Utilizing the common assumption of disjoint speaker activities, we propose a novel method to train the CNN using synthesized noise signals. The proposed localization method is evaluated for two speakers and compared to a well-known steered response power method.
