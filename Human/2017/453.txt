Low-complexity Receiver for Multi-Level Polar Coded Modulation in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been proved to increase the multiple-access achievable rate with respect to orthogonal multiple access (OMA). In this paper we propose a novel communication system that combines multi-level coded modulation and polar codes in a NOMA scenario. Computational complexity decreases with the proposed scheme with respect to state-of-the-art solutions. We also highlight the trade-off between error rate performance and computational complexity.
