Multiparameter spectral analysis for aeroelastic instability problems

This paper presents a novel application of multiparameter spectral theory to the study of structural stability, with particular emphasis on aeroelastic flutter. Methods of multiparameter analysis allow the development of new solution algorithms for aeroelastic flutter problems; most significantly, a direct solver for polynomial problems of arbitrary order and size, something which has not before been achieved. Two major variants of this direct solver are presented, and their computational characteristics are compared. Both are effective for smaller problems arising in reduced-order modelling and preliminary design optimization. Extensions and improvements to this new conceptual framework and solution method are then discussed.
