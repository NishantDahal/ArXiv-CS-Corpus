ComSens: Exploiting Pilot Diversity for Pervasive Integration of Communication and Sensing in MIMO-TDD-Frameworks

In this paper, we propose a fully-integrated radar and communication system -- named ComSens. We utilize two different pilot sequences (one for uplink and one for downlink) with the condition that they must be uncorrelated to each other. Within such a framework, the signal received from end-user and the back-scattered signal from the desired objects have uncorrelated pilots. Thus, the base-station is able to distinguish data signal from user and back-scattered signal from object. We assume a time division duplex (TDD) framework. The pilot sequences are designed for MIMO channels. We evaluate channel MSE as a figure of merit for communication system. We also show that the designed pilots are uncorrelated for a range of time lags. Moreover, designed uplink pilot has negligible autocorrelation for a range of time lags leading to an impulse-like autocorrelation for radar sensing.
