The INSuRE Project: CAE-Rs Collaborate to Engage Students in Cybersecurity Research

Since fall 2012, several National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research (CAE-Rs) fielded a collaborative course to engage students in solving applied cybersecurity research problems. We describe our experiences with this Information Security Research and Education (INSuRE) research collaborative. We explain how we conducted our project-based research course, give examples of student projects, and discuss the outcomes and lessons learned.
