Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly Linear Time

We give a nearly linear time randomized approximation scheme for the Held-Karp bound [Held and Karp, 1970] for metric TSP. Formally, given an undirected edge-weighted graph $G$ on $m$ edges and $ε> 0$, the algorithm outputs in $O(m \log^4n /ε^2)$ time, with high probability, a $(1+ε)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound on the metric TSP instance induced by the shortest path metric on $G$. The algorithm can also be used to output a corresponding solution to the Subtour Elimination LP. We substantially improve upon the $O(m^2 \log^2(m)/ε^2)$ running time achieved previously by Garg and Khandekar. The LP solution can be used to obtain a fast randomized $\big(\frac{3}{2} + ε\big)$-approximation for metric TSP which improves upon the running time of previous implementations of Christofides' algorithm.
