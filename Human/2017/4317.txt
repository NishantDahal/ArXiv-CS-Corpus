Autocomplete Textures for 3D Printing

Texture is an essential property of physical objects that affects aesthetics, usability, and functionality. However, designing and applying textures to 3D objects with existing tools remains difficult and time-consuming; it requires proficient 3D modeling skills. To address this, we investigated an auto-completion approach for efficient texture creation that automates the tedious, repetitive process of applying texture while allowing flexible customization. We developed techniques for users to select a target surface, sketch and manipulate a texture with 2D drawings, and then generate 3D printable textures onto an arbitrary curved surface. In a controlled experiment our tool sped texture creation by 80% over conventional tools, a performance gain that is higher with more complex target surfaces. This result confirms that auto-completion is powerful for creating 3D textures.
