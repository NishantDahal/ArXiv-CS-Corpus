Optimal control and zero-sum games for Markov chains of mean-field type

We establish existence of Markov chains of mean-field type with unbounded jump intensities by means of a fixed point argument using the Total Variation distance. We further show existence of nearly-optimal controls and, using a Markov chain backward SDE approach, we suggest conditions for existence of an optimal control and a saddle-point for respectively a control problem and a zero-sum differential game associated with payoff functionals of mean-field type, under dynamics driven by such Markov chains of mean-field type.
