Non-linear maximum rank distance codes in the cyclic model for the field reduction of finite geometries

In this paper we construct infinite families of non-linear maximum rank distance codes by using the setting of bilinear forms of a finite vector space. We also give a geometric description of such codes by using the cyclic model for the field reduction of finite geometries and we show that these families contain the non-linear maximum rank distance codes recently provided by Cossidente, Marino and Pavese.
