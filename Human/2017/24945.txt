The Character Thinks Ahead: creative writing with deep learning nets and its stylistic assessment

We discuss how to control outputs from deep learning models of text corpora so as to create contemporary poetic works. We assess whether these controls are successful in the immediate sense of creating stylo- metric distinctiveness. The specific context is our piece The Character Thinks Ahead (2016/17); the potential applications are broad.
