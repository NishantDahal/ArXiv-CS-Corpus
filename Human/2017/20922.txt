Proceedings 2nd International Workshop on Causal Reasoning for Embedded and safety-critical Systems Technologies

The second international CREST workshop continued the focus of the first CREST workshop:  addressing approaches to causal reasoning in engineering complex embedded and safety-critical systems.  Relevant approaches to causal reasoning have been (usually independently) proposed by a variety of communities:  AI, concurrency, model-based diagnosis, software engineering, security engineering, and formal methods.  The goal of CREST is to bring together researchers and practitioners from these communities to exchange ideas, especially between communities, in order to advance the science of determining root cause(s) for failures of critical systems.  The growing complexity of failures such as power grid blackouts, airplane crashes, security and privacy violations, and malfunctioning medical devices or automotive systems makes the goals of CREST more relevant than ever before.
