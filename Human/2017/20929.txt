A Proof of the Orbit Conjecture for Flipping Edge-Labelled Triangulations

Given a triangulation of a point set in the plane, a \emph{flip} deletes an edge $e$ whose removal leaves a convex quadrilateral, and replaces $e$ by the opposite diagonal of the quadrilateral. It is well known that any triangulation of a point set can be reconfigured to any other triangulation by some sequence of flips. We explore this question in the setting where each edge of a triangulation has a label, and a flip transfers the label of the removed edge to the new edge.
  It is not true that every labelled triangulation of a point set can be reconfigured to every other labelled triangulation via a sequence of flips. We characterize when this is possible by proving the \emph{Orbit Conjecture} of Bose, Lubiw, Pathak and Verdonschot which states that \emph{all} labels can be simultaneously mapped to their destination if and only if \emph{each} label individually can be mapped to its destination.
  Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a sequence of flips to reconfigure one labelled triangulation to another, if such a sequence exists, and we prove an upper bound of $O(n^7)$ on the length of the flip sequence.
  Our proof uses the topological result that the sets of pairwise non-crossing edges on a planar point set form a simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to a high-dimensional ball (this follows from a result of Orden and Santos; we give a different proof based on a shelling argument). The dual cell complex of this simplicial ball, called the \emph{flip complex}, has the usual flip graph as its $1$-skeleton. We use properties of the $2$-skeleton of the flip complex to prove the Orbit Conjecture.
