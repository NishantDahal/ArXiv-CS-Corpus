Index and Materialized View Selection in Data Warehouses

The aim of this article is to present an overview of the major families of state-of-the-art index and materialized view selection methods, and to discuss the issues and future trends in data warehouse performance optimization. We particularly focus on data mining-based heuristics we developed to reduce the selection problem complexity and target the most pertinent candidate indexes and materialized views.
