Multilayer Perceptron Algebra

Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) has been phenomenally successful on various pattern recognition tasks. However, the design of neural networks rely heavily on the experience and intuitions of individual developers. In this article, the author introduces a mathematical structure called MLP algebra on the set of all Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks(MLP), which can serve as a guiding principle to build MLPs accommodating to the particular data sets, and to build complex MLPs from simpler ones.
