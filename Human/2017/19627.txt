Study on the Idle Mode Capability with LoS and NLoS Transmissions

In this paper, we study the impact of the base station (BS) idle mode capability (IMC) on the network performance in dense small cell networks (SCNs). Different from existing works, we consider a sophisticated path loss model incorporating both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Analytical results are obtained for the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency (ASE) performance for SCNs with IMCs at the BSs. The upper bound, the lower bound and the approximate expression of the activated BS density are also derived. The performance impact of the IMC is shown to be significant. As the BS density surpasses the UE density, thus creating a surplus of BSs, the coverage probability will continuously increase toward one. For the practical regime of the BS density, the results derived from our analysis are distinctively different from existing results, and thus shed new light on the deployment and the operation of future dense SCNs.
