Different Applications of Mobile Robots in Education

This paper presents different possibilities of using mobile robots in education. Through the application of mobile mechatronic robotic system "Robotino" this paper shows the possibilities of developing interactive lectures and exercises in order to raise the quality of education and to provide new competencies for students. Application of robot as a real system supports strengthening specific areas of knowledge and skills that the students develop through design, creation, assembly and operating with the robot. This way of learning contains a very important element and that is "Playful learning" or learning through play. Along with technical competences, combining this method with teamwork improves also social skills and motivation for learning. This paper will present application of the robot in education on examples of modelling and designing of mechatronic systems, simulating and parameters monitoring of mechatronic systems, and collecting, processing and application of data from sensors in mechatronic systems.
