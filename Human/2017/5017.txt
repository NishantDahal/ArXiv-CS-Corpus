Incident Light Frequency-based Image Defogging Algorithm

Considering the problem of color distortion caused by the defogging algorithm based on dark channel prior, an improved algorithm was proposed to calculate the transmittance of all channels respectively. First, incident light frequency's effect on the transmittance of various color channels was analyzed according to the Beer-Lambert's Law, from which a proportion among various channel transmittances was derived; afterwards, images were preprocessed by down-sampling to refine transmittance, and then the original size was restored to enhance the operational efficiency of the algorithm; finally, the transmittance of all color channels was acquired in accordance with the proportion, and then the corresponding transmittance was used for image restoration in each channel. The experimental results show that compared with the existing algorithm, this improved image defogging algorithm could make image colors more natural, solve the problem of slightly higher color saturation caused by the existing algorithm, and shorten the operation time by four to nine times.
