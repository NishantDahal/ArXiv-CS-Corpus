Hopf and Lie algebras in semi-additive Varieties

We study Hopf monoids in entropic semi-additive varieties with an emphasis on adjunctions related to the enveloping monoid functor and the primitive element functor. These investigations are based on the concept of the abelian core of a semi-additive variety variety and its monoidal structure in case the variety is entropic.
