Further Approximations for Demand Matching: Matroid Constraints and Minor-Closed Graphs

We pursue a study of the Generalized Demand Matching problem, a common generalization of the $b$-Matching and Knapsack problems. Here, we are given a graph with vertex capacities, edge profits, and asymmetric demands on the edges. The goal is to find a maximum-profit subset of edges so the demands of chosen edges do not violate vertex capacities. This problem is APX-hard and constant-factor approximations are known.
  Our results fall into two categories. First, using iterated relaxation and various filtering strategies, we show with an efficient rounding algorithm if an additional matroid structure $\mathcal M$ is given and we further only allow sets $F \subseteq E$ that are independent in $\mathcal M$, the natural LP relaxation has an integrality gap of at most $\frac{25}{3} \approx 8.333$. This can be improved in various special cases, for example we improve over the 15-approximation for the previously-studied Coupled Placement problem [Korupolu et al. 2014] by giving a $7$-approximation.
  Using similar techniques, we show the problem of computing a minimum-cost base in $\mathcal M$ satisfying vertex capacities admits a $(1,3)$-bicriteria approximation. This improves over the previous $(1,4)$-approximation in the special case that $\mathcal M$ is the graphic matroid over the given graph [Fukanaga and Nagamochi, 2009].
  Second, we show Demand Matching admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme in graphs that exclude a fixed minor. If all demands are polynomially-bounded integers, this is somewhat easy using dynamic programming in bounded-treewidth graphs. Our main technical contribution is a sparsification lemma allowing us to scale the demands to be used in a more intricate dynamic programming algorithm, followed by randomized rounding to filter our scaled-demand solution to a feasible solution.
