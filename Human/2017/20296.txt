SPICE Simulation of tunnel FET aiming at 32 kHz crystal-oscillator operation

We numerically investigate the possibility of using Tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) in a 32 kHz crystal oscillator circuit to reduce power consumption. A simulation using SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is carried out based on a conventional CMOS transistor model. It is shown that the power consumption of TFET is one-tenth that of conventional low-power CMOS.
