Indoor Office Wideband Penetration Loss Measurements at 73 GHz

This paper presents millimeter wave (mmWave) penetration loss measurements and analysis at 73 GHz using a wideband sliding correlator channel sounder in an indoor office environment. Penetration loss was measured using a carefully controlled measurement setup for many common indoor building materials such as glass doors, glass windows, closet doors, steel doors, and whiteboard writing walls. Measurements were conducted using narrowbeam transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) horn antennas that were boresight-aligned with a test material between the antennas. Overall, 21 different locations were measured for 6 different materials such that the same type of material was tested in at least two locations in order to characterize the effect of penetration loss for materials with similar composition. As shown here, attenuation through common materials ranged between 0.8 dB/cm and 9.9 dB/cm for co-polarized antennas, while cross-polarized antennas exhibited similar attenuation for most materials, but up to 23.4 dB/cm of attenuation for others. The penetration loss results presented here are useful for site-specific planning tools that will model indoor mmWave networks, without the need for expensive measurement campaigns.
