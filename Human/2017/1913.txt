Free Information Flow Benefits Truth Seeking

How can we approach the truth in a society? It may depend on various factors. In this paper, using a well-established truth seeking model, we show that the persistent free information flow will bring us to the truth. Here the free information flow is modeled as the environmental random noise that could alter one's cognition. Without the random noise, the model predicts that the truth can only be captured by the truth seekers who own active perceptive ability of the truth and their believers, while the other individuals may stick to falsehood. But under the influence of the random noise, we strictly prove that even there is only one truth seeker in the group, all individuals will finally approach the truth.
