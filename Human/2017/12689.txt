Advances in Security in Computing and Communications

In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) and with the explosive worldwide growth of electronic data volume, and associated need of processing, analysis, and storage of such humongous volume of data, several new challenges are faced in protect-ing privacy of sensitive data and securing systems by designing novel schemes for secure authentication, integrity protection, encryption, and non-repudiation. Lightweight symmetric key cryptography and adaptive network security algo-rithms are in demand for mitigating these challenges. This book presents some of the state-of-the-art research work in the field of cryptography and security in computing and communications. It is a valuable source of knowledge for re-searchers, engineers, practitioners, graduates, and doctoral students who are working in the field of cryptography, network security, and security and privacy issues in the Internet of Things (IoT). It will also be useful for faculty members of graduate schools and universities.
