On co-counter-fragments of automata

This paper contains results related to synthesis and presentation of abstract automata by fragments of behaviour and investigates the structure of the classes of finite connected initial output-less automata specified by systems of defining relations considered as fragments, co-fragments, counter-fragments and co-counter-fragments of automata.
