Uplink Performance Analysis in D2D-Enabled mmWave Cellular Networks

In this paper, we provide an analytical framework to analyze the uplink performance of device-to-device (D2D)-enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks. Signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) outage probabilities are derived for both cellular and D2D links using tools from stochastic geometry. The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated into the outage analysis by employing a flexible mode selection scheme and Nakagami fading. Also, the effect of beamforming alignment errors on the outage probability is investigated to get insight on the performance in practical scenarios.
