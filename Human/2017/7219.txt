On the Glitch Phenomenon

The Principle of the Glitch states that for any device which makes a discrete decision based upon a continuous range of possible inputs, there are inputs for which it will take arbitrarily long to reach a decision. The appropriate mathematical setting for studying this principle is described. This involves defining the concept of continuity for mappings on sets of functions. It can then be shown that the glitch principle follows from the continuous behavior of the device.
