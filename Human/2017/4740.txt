Sigil3D: A Crowdsourcing Platform for Interactive 3D Content

In this paper we propose applying the crowdsourcing approach to a software platform that uses a modern and state-of-the-art 3D game engine. This platform could facilitate the generation and manipulation of interactive 3D environments by a community of users producing different content such as cultural heritage, scientific virtual labs, games, novel art forms and virtual museums.
