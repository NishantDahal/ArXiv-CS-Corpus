Fast, large-scale hologram calculation in wavelet domain

We propose a large-scale hologram calculation using WAvelet ShrinkAge-Based superpositIon (WASABI), a wavelet transform-based algorithm. An image-type hologram calculated using the WASABI method is printed on a glass substrate with the resolution of $65,536 \times 65,536$ pixels and a pixel pitch of $1 Î¼$m. The hologram calculation time amounts to approximately 354 s on a commercial CPU, which is approximately 30 times faster than conventional methods.
