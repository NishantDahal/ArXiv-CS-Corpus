Adaptive Quorum-based Channel-hopping Distributed Coordination Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks

In this paper, we propose novel channel-hoppingbased distributed rendezvous algorithm based on grid-basedquorum techniques. The proposed algorithm increases the probability of rendezvous (RDV) within a single cycle by allowing CR nodes to meet more often according to intersection property of quorum systems (QSs). Our proposed algorithm is called Adaptive quorum-based channel-hopping distributed coordination scheme for cognitive radio networks. The main idea of our algorithm is to dynamically adjust the selected QS by CR users according to the varying traffic loads in the CRN. The proposed algorithm decreases the average time to rendezvous (TTR) and increase the probability of RDV. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through simulations. The performance of our algorithm is compared with two different schemes. The results show that our algorithm can reduce TTR, increase the RDV, and decrease the energy consumption per successful RDV.
