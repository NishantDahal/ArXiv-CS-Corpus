Resource Allocation for D2D Communications Underlaying a NOMA-Based Cellular Network

This letter investigates the power control and channel assignment problem in device-to-device (D2D) communications underlaying a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) cellular network. With the successive interference cancellation decoding order constraints, our target is to maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs while guaranteeing the minimum rate requirements of NOMA-based cellular users. Specifically, the optimal conditions for power control of cellular users on each subchannel are derived first. Then, based on these results, we propose a dual-based iterative algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem. Simulation results validate the superiority of proposed resource allocation algorithm over the existing orthogonal multiple access scheme.
