Inferring Conceptual Relationships When Ranking Patients

Searching patients based on the relevance of their medical records is challenging because of the inherent implicit knowledge within the patients' medical records and queries. Such knowledge is known to the medical practitioners but may be hidden from a search system. For example, when searching for the patients with a heart disease, medical practitioners commonly know that patients who are taking the amiodarone medicine are relevant, since this drug is used to combat heart disease. In this article, we argue that leveraging such implicit knowledge improves the retrieval effectiveness, since it provides new evidence to infer the relevance of patients' medical records towards a query. Specifically, built upon existing conceptual representation for both medical records and queries, we proposed a novel expansion of queries that infers additional conceptual relationships from domain-specific resources as well as by extracting informative concepts from the top-ranked patients' medical records. We evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of our proposed approach in the context of the TREC 2011 and 2012 Medical Records track. Our results show the effectiveness of our approach to model the implicit knowledge in patient search, whereby the retrieval performance is significantly improved over both an effective conceptual representation baseline and an existing semantic query expansion baseline. In addition, we provide an analysis of the types of queries that the proposed approach is likely to be effective.
