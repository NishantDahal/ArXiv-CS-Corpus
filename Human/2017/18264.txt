Shapechanger: Environments for Transfer Learning

We present Shapechanger, a library for transfer reinforcement learning specifically designed for robotic tasks. We consider three types of knowledge transfer---from simulation to simulation, from simulation to real, and from real to real---and a wide range of tasks with continuous states and actions. Shapechanger is under active development and open-sourced at: https://github.com/seba-1511/shapechanger/.
