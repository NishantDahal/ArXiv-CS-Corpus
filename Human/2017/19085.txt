EPG-representations with small grid-size

In an EPG-representation of a graph $G$ each vertex is represented by a path in the rectangular grid, and $(v,w)$ is an edge in $G$ if and only if the paths representing $v$ an $w$ share a grid-edge. Requiring paths representing edges to be x-monotone or, even stronger, both x- and y-monotone gives rise to three natural variants of EPG-representations, one where edges have no monotonicity requirements and two with the aforementioned monotonicity requirements. The focus of this paper is understanding how small a grid can be achieved for such EPG-representations with respect to various graph parameters.
  We show that there are $m$-edge graphs that require a grid of area $Ω(m)$ in any variant of EPG-representations. Similarly there are pathwidth-$k$ graphs that require height $Ω(k)$ and area $Ω(kn)$ in any variant of EPG-representations. We prove a matching upper bound of $O(kn)$ area for all pathwidth-$k$ graphs in the strongest model, the one where edges are required to be both x- and y-monotone. Thus in this strongest model, the result implies, for example, $O(n)$, $O(n \log n)$ and $O(n^{3/2})$ area bounds for bounded pathwidth graphs, bounded treewidth graphs and all classes of graphs that exclude a fixed minor, respectively. For the model with no restrictions on the monotonicity of the edges, stronger results can be achieved for some graph classes, for example an $O(n)$ area bound for bounded treewidth graphs and $O(n \log^2 n)$ bound for graphs of bounded genus.
