Proceedings 3rd International Workshop on Symbolic and Numerical Methods for Reachability Analysis

Hybrid systems are complex dynamical systems that combine discrete and continuous components. Reachability questions, regarding whether a system can run into a certain subset of its state space, stand at the core of verification and synthesis problems for hybrid systems. This volume contains papers describing new developments in this area, which were presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Symbolic and Numerical Methods for Reachability Analysis.
