On Generalized Optimal Hard Decision Fusion

In this letter, we formulate a generalized decision fusion problem (GDFP) for sensing with centralized hard decision fusion. We show that various new and existing decision fusion rules are special cases of the proposed GDFP. We then relate our problem to the classical $0-1$ Knapsack problem (KP). Consequently, we apply dynamic programming to solve the exponentially complex GDFP in polynomial time. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
