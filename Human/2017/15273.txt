T-DB: Toward Fully Functional Transparent Encrypted Databases in DBaaS Framework

Individuals and organizations tend to migrate their data to clouds, especially in a DataBase as a Service (DBaaS) pattern. The major obstacle is the conflict between secrecy and utilization of the relational database to be outsourced. We address this obstacle with a Transparent DataBase (T-DB) system strictly following the unmodified DBaaS framework. A database owner outsources an encrypted database to a cloud platform, needing only to store the secret keys for encryption and an empty table header for the database; the database users can make almost all types of queries on the encrypted database as usual; and the cloud can process ciphertext queries as if the database were not encrypted. Experimentations in realistic cloud environments demonstrate that T-DB has perfect query answer precision and outstanding performance.
