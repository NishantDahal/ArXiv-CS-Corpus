A minimum-change version of the Chung-Feller theorem for Dyck paths

A Dyck path with $2k$ steps and $e$ flaws is a path in the integer lattice that starts at the origin and consists of $k$ many $\nearrow$-steps and $k$ many $\searrow$-steps that change the current coordinate by $(1,1)$ or $(1,-1)$, respectively, and that has exactly $e$ many $\searrow$-steps below the line $y=0$. Denoting by $D_{2k}^e$ the set of Dyck paths with $2k$ steps and $e$ flaws, the Chung-Feller theorem asserts that the sets $D_{2k}^0,D_{2k}^1,\ldots,D_{2k}^k$ all have the same cardinality $\frac{1}{k+1}\binom{2k}{k}=C_k$, the $k$-th Catalan number. The standard combinatorial proof of this classical result establishes a bijection $f'$ between $D_{2k}^e$ and $D_{2k}^{e+1}$ that swaps certain parts of the given Dyck path $x$, with the effect that $x$ and $f'(x)$ may differ in many positions. In this paper we strengthen the Chung-Feller theorem by presenting a simple bijection $f$ between $D_{2k}^e$ and $D_{2k}^{e+1}$ which has the additional feature that $x$ and $f(x)$ differ in only two positions (the least possible number). We also present an algorithm that allows to compute a sequence of applications of $f$ in constant time per generated Dyck path. As an application, we use our minimum-change bijection $f$ to construct cycle-factors in the odd graph $O_{2k+1}$ and the middle levels graph $M_{2k+1}$ --- two intensively studied families of vertex-transitive graphs --- that consist of $C_k$ many cycles of the same length.
