Computational Models for Attitude and Actions Prediction

In this paper, we present computational models to predict Twitter users' attitude towards a specific brand through their personal and social characteristics. We also predict their likelihood to take different actions based on their attitudes. In order to operationalize our research on users' attitude and actions, we collected ground-truth data through surveys of Twitter users. We have conducted experiments using two real world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our attitude and action prediction framework. Finally, we show how our models can be integrated with a visual analytics system for customer intervention.
