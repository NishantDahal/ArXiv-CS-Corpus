Tangible Holograms: Towards Mobile Physical Augmentation of Virtual Objects

The last two decades have seen the emergence and steady development of tangible user interfaces. While most of these interfaces are applied for input - with output still on traditional computer screens - the goal of programmable matter and actuated shape-changing materials is to directly use the physical objects for visual or tangible feedback. Advances in material sciences and flexible display technologies are investigated to enable such reconfigurable physical objects. While existing solutions aim for making physical objects more controllable via the digital world, we propose an approach where holograms (virtual objects) in a mixed reality environment are augmented with physical variables such as shape, texture or temperature. As such, the support for mobility forms an important contribution of the proposed solution since it enables users to freely move within and across environments. Furthermore, our augmented virtual objects can co-exist in a single environment with programmable matter and other actuated shape-changing solutions. The future potential of the proposed approach is illustrated in two usage scenarios and we hope that the presentation of our work in progress on a novel way to realise tangible holograms will foster some lively discussions in the CHI community.
