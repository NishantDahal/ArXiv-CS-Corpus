Minimum Degree-Weighted Distance Decoding for Polynomial Residue Codes with Non-Pairwise Coprime Moduli

This paper presents a new decoding for polynomial residue codes, called the minimum degree-weighted distance decoding. The newly proposed decoding is based on the degree-weighted distance and different from the traditional minimum Hamming distance decoding. It is shown that for the two types of minimum distance decoders, i.e., the minimum degree-weighted distance decoding and the minimum Hamming distance decoding, one is not absolutely stronger than the other, but they can complement each other from different points of view.
