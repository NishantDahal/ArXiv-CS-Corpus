Pyroomacoustics: A Python package for audio room simulations and array processing algorithms

We present pyroomacoustics, a software package aimed at the rapid development and testing of audio array processing algorithms. The content of the package can be divided into three main components: an intuitive Python object-oriented interface to quickly construct different simulation scenarios involving multiple sound sources and microphones in 2D and 3D rooms; a fast C implementation of the image source model for general polyhedral rooms to efficiently generate room impulse responses and simulate the propagation between sources and receivers; and finally, reference implementations of popular algorithms for beamforming, direction finding, and adaptive filtering. Together, they form a package with the potential to speed up the time to market of new algorithms by significantly reducing the implementation overhead in the performance evaluation step.
