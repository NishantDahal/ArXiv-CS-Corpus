Tomographic Reconstruction Methods for Decomposing Directional Components

Decomposition of tomographic reconstructions has many different practical application. We propose two new reconstruction methods that combines the task of tomographic reconstruction with object decomposition. We demonstrate these reconstruction methods in the context of decomposing directional objects into various directional components. Furthermore we propose a method for estimating the main direction in a directional object, directly from the measured computed tomography data. We demonstrate all the proposed methods on simulated and real samples to show their practical applicability. The numerical tests show that decomposition and reconstruction can combined to achieve a highly useful fibre-crack decomposition.
