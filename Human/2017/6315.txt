Public bike renting is more and more popular in cities to incentivise a reduction in car journeys and to boost the use of green transportation alternatives. One of the challenges of this application is to effectively plan the resources usage. This paper presents some analysis of Dublin bike renting scheme based on statistics and data mining. It provides available bike patterns at the most interesting bike stations, that is, the busiest and the quietest stations. Consistency checking with new data reinforces confidence in the patterns obtained.
