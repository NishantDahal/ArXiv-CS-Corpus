T-ROME: A Simple and Energy Efficient Tree Routing Protocol for Low-Power Wake-up Receivers

Wireless sensor networks are deployed in many monitoring applications but still suffer from short lifetimes originating from limited energy sources and storages. Due to their low-power consumption and their on-demand communication ability, wake-up receivers represent an energy efficient and simple enhancement to wireless sensor nodes and wireless sensor network protocols. In this context, wake-up receivers have the ability to increase the network lifetime. In this article, we present T-ROME, a simple and energy efficient cross-layer routing protocol for wireless sensor nodes containing wake-up receivers. The protocol makes use of the different transmission ranges of wake-up and main radios in order to save energy by skipping nodes during data transfer. With respect to energy consumption and latency, T-ROME outperforms existing protocols in many scenarios. Here, we describe and analyze the cross layer multi-hop protocol by means of a Markov chain model that we verify using a laboratory test setup.
