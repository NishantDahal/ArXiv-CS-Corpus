Capacity Bounds on the Downlink of Symmetric, Multi-Relay, Single Receiver C-RAN Networks

The downlink of symmetric Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RANs) with multiple relays and a single receiver is studied. Lower and upper bounds are derived on the capacity. The lower bound is achieved by Marton's coding which facilitates dependence among the multiple-access channel inputs. The upper bound uses Ozarow's technique to augment the system with an auxiliary random variable. The bounds are studied over scalar Gaussian C-RANs and are shown to meet and characterize the capacity for interesting regimes of operation.
