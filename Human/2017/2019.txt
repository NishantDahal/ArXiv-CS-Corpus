Algorithm for computing semi-Fourier sequences of expressions involving exponentiations and integrations

We provide an algorithm for computing semi-Fourier sequences for expressions constructed from arithmetic operations, exponentiations and integrations. The semi-Fourier sequence is a relaxed version of Fourier sequence for polynomials (expressions made of additions and multiplications).
