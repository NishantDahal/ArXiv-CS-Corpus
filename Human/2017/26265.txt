Wireless Access for Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC): Principles and Building Blocks

Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) is an important new feature brought by 5G, with a potential to support a vast set of applications that rely on mission-critical links. In this article, we first discuss the principles for supporting URLLC from the perspective of the traditional assumptions and models applied in communication/information theory. We then discuss how these principles are applied in various elements of the system design, such as use of various diversity sources, design of packets and access protocols. The important messages are that there is a need to optimize the transmission of signaling information, as well as a need for a lean use of various sources of diversity.
