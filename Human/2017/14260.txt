An improved isogeometric analysis method for trimmed geometries

Trimming techniques are efficient ways to generate complex geometries in Computer-Aided Design(CAD). In this paper, an improved isogeometric analysis(IGA) method for trimmed geometries is proposed. We will show that the proposed method reduces the numerical error of physical solution by 50% for simple trimmed geometries, and the condition number of stiffness matrix is also decreased. Furthermore, the number of integration elements and integration points involved in the solving process can be significantly reduced compared to previous approaches, drastically improving the computational efficiency for IGA problems on the trimmed geometry. Several examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
