Cartesian trees and Lyndon trees

The article describes the structural and algorithmic relations between Cartesian trees and Lyndon Trees. This leads to a uniform presentation of the Lyndon table of a word corresponding to the Next Nearest Smaller table of a sequence of numbers. It shows how to efficiently compute runs, that is, maximal periodicities occurring in a word.
