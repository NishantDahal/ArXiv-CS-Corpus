Energy-Efficient Memories using Magneto-Electric Switching of Ferromagnets

Voltage driven magneto-electric (ME) switching of ferro-magnets has shown potential for future low-energy spintronic memories. In this paper, we first analyze two different ME devices viz. ME-MTJ and ME-XNOR device with respect to writability, readability and switching speed. Our analysis is based on a coupled magnetization dynamics and electron transport model. Subsequently, we show that the decoupled read/write path of ME-MTJs can be utilized to construct an energy-efficient dual port memory. Further, we also propose a novel content addressable memory (CAM) exploiting the compact XNOR operation enabled by ME-XNOR device.
