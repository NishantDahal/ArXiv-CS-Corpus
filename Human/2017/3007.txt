Blue Sky Ideas in Artificial Intelligence Education from the EAAI 2017 New and Future AI Educator Program

The 7th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI'17, co-chaired by Sven Koenig and Eric Eaton) launched the EAAI New and Future AI Educator Program to support the training of early-career university faculty, secondary school faculty, and future educators (PhD candidates or postdocs who intend a career in academia). As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following "blue sky" questions:
  * How could/should Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses incorporate ethics into the curriculum?
  * How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary school level?
  * AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields?
  This paper is a collection of their responses, intended to help motivate discussion around these issues in AI education.
