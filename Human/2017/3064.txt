ChaLearn Looking at People: A Review of Events and Resources

This paper reviews the historic of ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) events. We started in 2011 (with the release of the first Kinect device) to run challenges related to human action/activity and gesture recognition. Since then we have regularly organized events in a series of competitions covering all aspects of visual analysis of humans. So far we have organized more than 10 international challenges and events in this field. This paper reviews associated events, and introduces the ChaLearn LAP platform where public resources (including code, data and preprints of papers) related to the organized events are available. We also provide a discussion on perspectives of ChaLearn LAP activities.
