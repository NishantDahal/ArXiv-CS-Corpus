A Neural Network Approach to Joint Modeling Social Networks and Mobile Trajectories

The accelerated growth of mobile trajectories in location-based services brings valuable data resources to understand users' moving behaviors. Apart from recording the trajectory data, another major characteristic of these location-based services is that they also allow the users to connect whomever they like. A combination of social networking and location-based services is called as location-based social networks (LBSN). As shown in previous works, locations that are frequently visited by socially-related persons tend to be correlated, which indicates the close association between social connections and trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. In order to better analyze and mine LBSN data, we present a novel neural network model which can joint model both social networks and mobile trajectories. In specific, our model consists of two components: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile trajectories. We first adopt a network embedding method for the construction of social networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key of our model lies in the component of generating mobile trajectories. We have considered four factors that influence the generation process of mobile trajectories, namely user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term sequential contexts and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last two contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential relatedness in mobile trajectories at different levels, i.e., short term or long term. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network representations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Especially, the improvement over baselines is more significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.
