Characterization of an inconsistency ranking for pairwise comparison matrices

Pairwise comparisons between alternatives are a well-known method for measuring preferences of a decision-maker. Since these often do not exhibit consistency, a number of inconsistency indices has been introduced in order to measure the deviation from this ideal case. We axiomatically characterize the inconsistency ranking induced by the Koczkodaj inconsistency index: six independent properties are presented such that they determine a unique linear order on the set of all pairwise comparison matrices.
