Even better correction of genome sequencing data

We introduce an improved version of RECKONER, an error corrector for Illumina whole genome sequencing data. By modifying its workflow we reduce the computation time even 10 times. We also propose a new method of determination of $k$-mer length, the key parameter of $k$-spectrum-based family of correctors. The correction algorithms are examined on huge data sets, i.e., human and maize genomes for both Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq instruments.
