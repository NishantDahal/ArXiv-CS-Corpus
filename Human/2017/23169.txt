Quantitative Comparison of Open-Source Data for Fine-Grain Mapping of Land Use

This paper performs a quantitative comparison of open-source data available on the Internet for the fine-grain mapping of land use. Three points of interest (POI) data sources--Google Places, Bing Maps, and the Yellow Pages--and one volunteered geographic information data source--Open Street Map (OSM)--are compared with each other at the parcel level for San Francisco with respect to a proposed fine-grain land-use taxonomy. The sources are also compared to coarse-grain authoritative data which we consider to be the ground truth. Results show limited agreement among the data sources as well as limited accuracy with respect to the authoritative data even at coarse class granularity. We conclude that POI and OSM data do not appear to be sufficient alone for fine-grain land-use mapping.
