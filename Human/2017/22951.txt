TripletGAN: Training Generative Model with Triplet Loss

As an effective way of metric learning, triplet loss has been widely used in many deep learning tasks, including face recognition and person-ReID, leading to many states of the arts. The main innovation of triplet loss is using feature map to replace softmax in the classification task. Inspired by this concept, we propose here a new adversarial modeling method by substituting the classification loss of discriminator with triplet loss. Theoretical proof based on IPM (Integral probability metric) demonstrates that such setting will help the generator converge to the given distribution theoretically under some conditions. Moreover, since triplet loss requires the generator to maximize distance within a class, we justify tripletGAN is also helpful to prevent mode collapse through both theory and experiment.
