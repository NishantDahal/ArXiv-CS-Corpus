Spectrum Sensing Techniques For Cognitive Radio Networks

In this chapter, we present the state of the art of the spectrum sensing techniques for cognitive radio networks as well and their comparisons. The rest of the chapter is organized as below: Section I.1, Section I.2, and Section I.3 present the spectrum management problem and the cognitive radio cycle as well as the compressive sensing solution; Section II.1 describes the spectrum sensing model; Section II.2 presents the existing spectrum sensing techniques, including energy, autocorrelation, Euclidian distance, wavelet, and matched filter based sensing. Finally, a conclusion is given at the end of the chapter.
