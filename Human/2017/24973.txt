Recognizing Generalized Transmission Graphs of Line Segments and Circular Sectors

Suppose we have an arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ of $n$ geometric objects $x_1, \dots, x_n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ in the plane, with a distinguished point $p_i$ in each object $x_i$. The generalized transmission graph of $\mathcal{A}$ has vertex set $\{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ and a directed edge $x_ix_j$ if and only if $p_j \in x_i$. Generalized transmission graphs provide a generalized model of the connectivity in networks of directional antennas.
  The complexity class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ contains all problems that can be reduced in polynomial time to an existential sentence of the form $\exists x_1, \dots, x_n: φ(x_1,\dots, x_n)$, where $x_1,\dots, x_n$ range over $\mathbb{R}$ and $φ$ is a propositional formula with signature $(+, -, \cdot, 0, 1)$. The class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ aims to capture the complexity of the existential theory of the reals. It lies between $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{PSPACE}$.
  Many geometric decision problems, such as recognition of disk graphs and of intersection graphs of lines, are complete for $\exists \mathbb{R}$. Continuing this line of research, we show that the recognition problem of generalized transmission graphs of line segments and of circular sectors is hard for $\exists \mathbb{R}$. As far as we know, this constitutes the first such result for a class of directed graphs.
