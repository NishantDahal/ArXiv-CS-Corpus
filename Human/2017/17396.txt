Wide and deep volumetric residual networks for volumetric image classification

3D shape models that directly classify objects from 3D information have become more widely implementable. Current state of the art models rely on deep convolutional and inception models that are resource intensive. Residual neural networks have been demonstrated to be easier to optimize and do not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients observed in deep networks. Here we implement a residual neural network for 3D object classification of the 3D Princeton ModelNet dataset. Further, we show that widening network layers dramatically improves accuracy in shallow residual nets, and residual neural networks perform comparable to state-of-the-art 3D shape net models, and we show that widening network layers improves classification accuracy. We provide extensive training and architecture parameters providing a better understanding of available network architectures for use in 3D object classification.
