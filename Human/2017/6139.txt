Security Analysis of Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor for Low Power Hardware

Security and energy are considered as the most important parameters for designing and building a computing system nowadays. Today's attacks target different layers of the computing system (i.e. software and hardware). Introduction of new transistor technologies to the integrated circuits design is beneficial, especially for low energy requirements. The new devices have unique features and properties that provide security advantages. However, these properties may come to the aid of an adversary to design stronger attacks. Therefore, the advantages as well as the disadvantages of these technologies need to be well studied. This paper demonstrates the area and power efficiency of the tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) technology along with analyzing its security aspects.
