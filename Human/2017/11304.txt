Classification of Smart Environment Scenarios in combination with a Human-Wearable-Environment-Communication using wireless connectivity

The development of computer technology has been rapid. Not so long ago, the first computer was developed which was large and bulky. Now, the latest generation of smartphones has a calculation power, which would have been considered those of supercomputers in 1990. For a smart environment, the person recognition and re-recognition is an important topic. The distribution of new technologies like wearable computing is a new approach to the field of person recognition and re-recognition. This article lays out the idea of identifying and re-identifying wearable computing devices by listening to their wireless communication connectivity like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and building a classification of interaction scenarios for the combination of human-wearable-environment.
