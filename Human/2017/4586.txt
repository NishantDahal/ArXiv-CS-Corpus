Multi-user Precoding and Channel Estimation for Hybrid Millimeter Wave Systems

In this paper, we develop a low-complexity channel estimation for hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, where the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is much less than the number of antennas equipped at each transceiver. The proposed mmWave channel estimation algorithm first exploits multiple frequency tones to estimate the strongest angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) at both base station (BS) and user sides for the design of analog beamforming matrices. Then all the users transmit orthogonal pilot symbols to the BS along the directions of the estimated strongest AoAs in order to estimate the channel. The estimated channel will be adopted to design the digital zero-forcing (ZF) precoder at the BS for the multi-user downlink transmission. The proposed channel estimation algorithm is applicable to both nonsparse and sparse mmWave channel environments. Furthermore, we derive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the digital ZF precoding with the proposed channel estimation algorithm scheme. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme obtains a considerable achievable rate of fully digital systems, where the number of RF chains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas. Besides, by taking into account the effect of various types of errors, i.e., random phase errors, transceiver analog beamforming errors, and equivalent channel estimation errors, we derive a closed-form approximation for the achievable rate of the considered scheme. We illustrate the robustness of the proposed channel estimation and multi-user downlink precoding scheme against the system imperfection.
