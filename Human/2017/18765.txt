Real-time convolutional networks for sonar image classification in low-power embedded systems

Deep Neural Networks have impressive classification performance, but this comes at the expense of significant computational resources at inference time. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles use low-power embedded systems for sonar image perception, and cannot execute large neural networks in real-time. We propose the use of max-pooling aggressively, and we demonstrate it with a Fire-based module and a new Tiny module that includes max-pooling in each module. By stacking them we build networks that achieve the same accuracy as bigger ones, while reducing the number of parameters and considerably increasing computational performance. Our networks can classify a 96x96 sonar image with 98.8 - 99.7 accuracy on only 41 to 61 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi 2, which corresponds to speedups of 28.6 - 19.7.
