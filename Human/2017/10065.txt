Millimeter Wave V2V Communications: Distributed Association and Beam Alignment

Recently millimeter-wave bands have been postulated as a means to accommodate the foreseen extreme bandwidth demands in vehicular communications, which result from the dissemination of sensory data to nearby vehicles for enhanced environmental awareness and improved safety level. However, the literature is particularly scarce in regards to principled resource allocation schemes that deal with the challenging radio conditions posed by the high mobility of vehicular scenarios. In this work we propose a novel framework that blends together Matching Theory and Swarm Intelligence to dynamically and efficiently pair vehicles and optimize both transmission and reception beamwidths. This is done by jointly considering Channel State Information (CSI) and Queue State Information (QSI) when establishing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. To validate the proposed framework, simulation results are presented and discussed where the throughput performance as well as the latency/reliability trade-offs of the proposed approach are assessed and compared to several baseline approaches recently proposed in the literature. The results obtained in our study show performance gains in terms of reliability and delay up to 25% for ultra-dense vehicular scenarios and on average 50% more paired vehicles that some of the baselines. These results shed light on the operational limits and practical feasibility of mmWave bands, as a viable radio access solution for future high-rate V2V communications.
