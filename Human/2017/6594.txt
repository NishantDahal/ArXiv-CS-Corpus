The application of the competency-based approach to assess the training and employment adequacy problem

This review paper fits in the context of the adequate matching of training to employment, which is one of the main challenges that universities around the world strive to meet. In higher education, the revision of curricula necessitates a return to the skills required by the labor market to train skilled labors.
  In this research, we started with the presentation of the conceptual framework. Then we quoted different currents that discussed the problematic of the job training match from various perspectives. We proceeded to choose some studies that have attempted to remedy this problem by adopting the competency-based approach that involves the referential line. This approach has as a main characteristic the attainment of the match between training and employment. Therefore, it is a relevant solution for this problem. We scrutinized the selected studies, presenting their objectives, methodologies and results, and we provided our own analysis. Then, we focused on the Moroccan context through observations and studies already conducted. And finally, we introduced the problematic of our future project.
