A New Coding/Decoding Algorithm using Fibonacci Numbers

In this paper we present a new method of coding/decoding algorithms using Fibonacci $Q$-matrices. This method is based on the blocked message matrices. The main advantage of our model is the encryption of each message matrix with different keys. Our approach will not only increase the security of information but also has high correct ability.
