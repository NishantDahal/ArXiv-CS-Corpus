Iterative Hybrid Precoder and Combiner Design for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems

This paper investigates the problem of hybrid precoder and combiner design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems operating in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. We propose a novel iterative scheme to design the codebook-based analog precoder and combiner in forward and reverse channels. During each iteration, we apply compressive sensing (CS) technology to efficiently estimate the equivalent MIMO-OFDM mmWave channel. Then, the analog precoder or combiner is obtained based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm to alleviate the interference between different data streams as well as maximize the spectral efficiency. The digital precoder and combiner are finally obtained based on the effective baseband channel to further enhance the spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed iterative hybrid precoder and combiner algorithm has significant performance advantages.
