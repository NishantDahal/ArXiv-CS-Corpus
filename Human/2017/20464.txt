Map-based Multi-Policy Reinforcement Learning: Enhancing Adaptability of Robots by Deep Reinforcement Learning

In order for robots to perform mission-critical tasks, it is essential that they are able to quickly adapt to changes in their environment as well as to injuries and or other bodily changes. Deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be successful in training robot control policies for operation in complex environments. However, existing methods typically employ only a single policy. This can limit the adaptability since a large environmental modification might require a completely different behavior compared to the learning environment. To solve this problem, we propose Map-based Multi-Policy Reinforcement Learning (MMPRL), which aims to search and store multiple policies that encode different behavioral features while maximizing the expected reward in advance of the environment change. Thanks to these policies, which are stored into a multi-dimensional discrete map according to its behavioral feature, adaptation can be performed within reasonable time without retraining the robot. An appropriate pre-trained policy from the map can be recalled using Bayesian optimization. Our experiments show that MMPRL enables robots to quickly adapt to large changes without requiring any prior knowledge on the type of injuries that could occur.
