Un résultat intrigant en commande sans modèle

An elementary mathematical example proves, thanks to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, a result that is intriguing with respect to today's practical understanding of model-free control, i.e., an "intelligent" proportional controller (iP) may turn to be more difficult to tune than an intelligent proportional-derivative one (iPD). The vast superiority of iPDs when compared to classic PIDs is shown via computer simulations. The introduction as well as the conclusion analyse model-free control in the light of recent advances.
