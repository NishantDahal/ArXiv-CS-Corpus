ReabsNet: Detecting and Revising Adversarial Examples

Though deep neural network has hit a huge success in recent studies and applica- tions, it still remains vulnerable to adversarial perturbations which are imperceptible to humans. To address this problem, we propose a novel network called ReabsNet to achieve high classification accuracy in the face of various attacks. The approach is to augment an existing classification network with a guardian network to detect if a sample is natural or has been adversarially perturbed. Critically, instead of simply rejecting adversarial examples, we revise them to get their true labels. We exploit the observation that a sample containing adversarial perturbations has a possibility of returning to its true class after revision. We demonstrate that our ReabsNet outperforms the state-of-the-art defense method under various adversarial attacks.
