CS591 Report: Application of siamesa network in 2D transformation

Deep learning has been extensively used various aspects of computer vision area. Deep learning separate itself from traditional neural network by having a much deeper and complicated network layers in its network structures. Traditionally, deep neural network is abundantly used in computer vision tasks including classification and detection and has achieve remarkable success and set up a new state of the art results in these fields. Instead of using neural network for vision recognition and detection. I will show the ability of neural network to do image registration, synthesis of images and image retrieval in this report.
