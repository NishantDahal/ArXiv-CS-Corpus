Computer Algebra for Microhydrodynamics

I describe a method for computer algebra that helps with laborious calculations typically encountered in theoretical microhydrodynamics. The program mimics how humans calculate by matching patterns and making replacements according to the rules of algebra and calculus. This note gives an overview and walks through an example, while the accompanying code repository contains the implementation details, a tutorial, and more examples. The code repository is attached as supplementary material to this note, and maintained at https://github.com/jeinarsson/matte
