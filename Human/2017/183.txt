Probabilistic Shaping and Non-Binary Codes

We generalize probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) with binary codes to the case of non-binary codes defined over prime finite fields. Firstly, we introduce probabilistic shaping via time sharing where shaping applies to information symbols only. Then, we design circular quadrature amplitude modulations (CQAM) that allow to directly generalize PAS to prime finite fields with full shaping.
