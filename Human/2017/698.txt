Throughput-Optimal Scheduling for Multi-Hop Networked Transportation Systems With Switch-Over Delay

The emerging connected-vehicle technology provides a new dimension in developing more intelligent traffic control algorithms for signalized intersections in networked transportation systems. An important challenge for the scheduling problem in networked transportation systems is the switch-over delay caused by the guard time before any traffic signal change. The switch-over delay can result in significant loss of system capacity and hence needs to be accommodated in the scheduling design. To tackle this challenge, we propose a distributed online scheduling policy that extends the well-known Max-Pressure policy to address switch-over delay by introducing a bias factor toward the current schedule. We prove that the proposed policy is throughput-optimal with switch-over delay. Furthermore, the proposed policy remains optimal when there are both connected signalized intersections and conventional fixed-time ones in the system. With connected-vehicle technology, the proposed policy can be easily incorporated into the current transportation systems without additional infrastructure. Through extensive simulation in VISSIM, we show that our policy indeed outperforms the existing popular policies.
