Extending LTE into the Unlicensed Spectrum: Technical Analysis of the Proposed Variants

The commercial success of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) and the resulting growth in mobile data demand have urged cellular network operators to strive for new innovations. LTE in unlicensed spectrum has been proposed to allow cellular network operators to offload some of their data traffic by accessing the unlicensed 5 GHz frequency band. Currently, there are three proposed variants for LTE operation in the unlicensed band, namely LTE-U, Licensed Spectrum Access (LAA), and MulteFire. This paper provides a comparative analysis of these variants and explains the current regulations of the 5 GHz band in different parts of the world. We present the technical details of the three proposed versions and analyze them in terms of their operational features and coexistence capabilities to provide an R\&D perspective for their deployment and coexistence with legacy systems.
