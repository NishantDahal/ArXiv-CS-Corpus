Data Modelling for the Evaluation of Virtualized Network Functions Resource Allocation Algorithms

To conduct a more realistic evaluation on Virtualized Network Functions resource allocation algorithms, researches needed data on: (1) potential NFs chains (policies), (2) traffic flows passing through these NFs chains, (3) how the dynamic traffic changes affect the NFs (scale out/in) and (4) different data center architectures for the NFC. However, there are no publicly available real data sets on NF chains and traffic that pass through NF chains. Therefore we have used data from previous empirical analyses and made some assumptions to derive the required data to evaluate resource allocation algorithms for VNFs. We developed four programs to model the gathered data and generate the required data. All gathered data and data modelling programs are publicly available at github repository.
