A Novel Device-to-Device Discovery Scheme for Underlay Cellular Networks

Tremendous growing demand for high data rate services such as video, gaming and social networking in wireless cellular systems, attracted researchers' attention to focus on developing proximity services. In this regard, device-to-device (D2D) communications as a promising technology for future cellular systems, plays crucial rule. The key factor in D2D communication is providing efficient peer discovery mechanisms in ultra dense networks. In this paper, we propose a centralized D2D discovery scheme by employing a signaling algorithm to exchange D2D discovery messages between network entities. In this system, potential D2D pairs share uplink cellular users' resources with collision detection, to initiate a D2D links. Stochastic geometry is used to analyze system performance in terms of success probability of the transmitted signal and minimum required time slots for the proposed discovery scheme. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the proposed system performance.
