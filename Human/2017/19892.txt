A Distributed Parallel Model to Analyze Journal Impact Factors

A simple abstract model is developed as a parallel experimental basis for the aim of exploring the differences of journal impact factors, particularly between different disciplines. Our model endeavors to simulate the publication and citation behaviors of the articles in the journals belonging to a similar discipline, in a distributed manner. Based on simulation experiments, the mechanism of influence from several fundamental factors to the trend of impact factor is revealed. These factors include the average review cycle, average number of references and yearly distribution of references. Moreover, satisfactory approximation could possibly be observed between certain actual data and simulation results.
