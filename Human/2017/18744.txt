A Neural Network Based on Synchronized Pairs of Nano-Oscillators

Artificial neural networks are intensively used to perform cognitive tasks such as image classification on traditional computers. With the end of CMOS scaling and increasing demand for efficient neural networks, alternative architectures implementing neural functions efficiently are being studied. This study leverages the demonstrated frequency tuning capabilities of compact nano-oscillators and their synchronization dynamics to implement a neuron using a pair of synchronized oscillators, and which features an unconventional response curve. We show that this compact neuron can naturally implement generic logic gates, including XOR. A simulated oscillator-based neural network is then shown to achieve results equivalent to standard approaches on two reference classification tasks. Finally, the performance of the system is evaluated in the presence of oscillator phase noise, an important issue of oscillating nanodevices. These results open the way for the design of alternative architectures adapted to efficient neural network execution.
