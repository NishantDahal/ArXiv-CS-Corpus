Study of Joint MSINR and Relay Selection Algorithms for Distributed Beamforming

This paper presents joint maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (MSINR) and relay selection algorithms for distributed beamforming. We propose a joint MSINR and restricted greedy search relay selection (RGSRS) algorithm with a total relay transmit power constraint that iteratively optimizes both the beamforming weights at the relays nodes, maximizing the SINR at the destination. Specifically, we devise a relay selection scheme that based on greedy search and compare it to other schemes like restricted random relay selection (RRRS) and restricted exhaustive search relay selection (RESRS). A complexity analysis is provided and simulation results show that the proposed joint MSINR and RGSRS algorithm achieves excellent bit error rate (BER) and SINR performances.
