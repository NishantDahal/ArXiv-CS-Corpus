A/D Converter Architectures for Energy-Efficient Vision Processor

AI applications have emerged in current world. Among AI applications, computer-vision (CV) related applications have attracted high interest. Hardware implementation of CV processors necessitates a high performance but low-power image detector. The key to energy-efficiency work lies in analog-digital converting, where output of imaging detectors is transferred to digital domain and CV algorithms can be performed on data. In this paper, analog-digital converter architectures are compared, and an example ADC design is proposed which achieves both good performance and low power consumption.
