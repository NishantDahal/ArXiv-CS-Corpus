A non-commutative algorithm for multiplying 5x5 matrices using 99 multiplications

We present a non-commutative algorithm for multiplying 5x5 matrices using 99 multiplications. This algorithm is a minor modification of Makarov's algorithm which exhibit the previous best known bound with 100 multiplications.
