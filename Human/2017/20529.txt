Which is better? A Modularized Evaluation for Topic Popularity Prediction

Topic popularity prediction in social networks has drawn much attention recently. Various elegant models have been proposed for this issue. However, different datasets and evaluation metrics they use lead to low comparability. So far there is no unified scheme to evaluate them, making it difficult to select and compare models. We conduct a comprehensible survey, propose an evaluation scheme and apply it to existing methods. Our scheme consists of four modules: classification; qualitative evaluation on several metrics; quantitative experiment on real world data; final ranking with risk matrix and $\textit{MinDis}$ to reflect performances under different scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze the efficiency and contribution of features used in feature oriented methods. The results show that feature oriented methods are more suitable for scenarios requiring high accuracy, while relation based methods have better consistency. Our work helps researchers compare and choose methods appropriately, and provides insights for further improvements.
