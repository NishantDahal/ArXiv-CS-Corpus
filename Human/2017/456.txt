The Broadcast Channel with Degraded Message Sets and Unreliable Conference

As demonstrated in many recent studies, cooperation between users can greatly improve the performance of communication systems. Most of the works in the literature present models where all the users are aware of the resources available for cooperation. However, the scenario where cooperation links are sometimes unavailable or that some users cannot be updated whether the cooperation links are present or not, is more realistic in today's dynamic ad-hoc communication systems. In such a case we need coding schemes that exploit the cooperation links if they are present, and can still operate if cooperation is not possible. In this work we study the general broadcast channel model with degraded message sets and cooperation links that may be absent, and derive it's capacity region under such uncertainty conditions.
