New descriptions of the weighted Reed-Muller codes and the homogeneous Reed-Muller codes

We give a description of the weighted Reed-Muller codes over a prime field in a modular algebra. A description of the homogeneous Reed-Muller codes in the same ambient space is presented for the binary case. A decoding procedure using the Landrock-Manz method is developed.
