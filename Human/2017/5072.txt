Workload Analysis of Blue Waters

Blue Waters is a Petascale-level supercomputer whose mission is to enable the national scientific and research community to solve "grand challenge" problems that are orders of magnitude more complex than can be carried out on other high performance computing systems. Given the important and unique role that Blue Waters plays in the U.S. research portfolio, it is important to have a detailed understanding of its workload in order to guide performance optimization both at the software and system configuration level as well as inform architectural balance tradeoffs. Furthermore, understanding the computing requirements of the Blue Water's workload (memory access, IO, communication, etc.), which is comprised of some of the most computationally demanding scientific problems, will help drive changes in future computing architectures, especially at the leading edge. With this objective in mind, the project team carried out a detailed workload analysis of Blue Waters.
