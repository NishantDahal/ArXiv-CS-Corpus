Tuning Free Orthogonal Matching Pursuit

Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) is a widely used compressive sensing (CS) algorithm for recovering sparse signals in noisy linear regression models. The performance of OMP depends on its stopping criteria (SC). SC for OMP discussed in literature typically assumes knowledge of either the sparsity of the signal to be estimated $k_0$ or noise variance $σ^2$, both of which are unavailable in many practical applications. In this article we develop a modified version of OMP called tuning free OMP or TF-OMP which does not require a SC. TF-OMP is proved to accomplish successful sparse recovery under the usual assumptions on restricted isometry constants (RIC) and mutual coherence of design matrix. TF-OMP is numerically shown to deliver a highly competitive performance in comparison with OMP having \textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$ or $σ^2$. Greedy algorithm for robust de-noising (GARD) is an OMP like algorithm proposed for efficient estimation in classical overdetermined linear regression models corrupted by sparse outliers. However, GARD requires the knowledge of inlier noise variance which is difficult to estimate. We also produce a tuning free algorithm (TF-GARD) for efficient estimation in the presence of sparse outliers by extending the operating principle of TF-OMP to GARD. TF-GARD is numerically shown to achieve a performance comparable to that of the existing implementation of GARD.
