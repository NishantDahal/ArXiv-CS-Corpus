Artificial Noise Injection for Securing Single-Antenna Systems

We propose a novel artificial noise (AN) injection scheme for wireless systems over quasi-static fading channels, in which a single-antenna transmitter sends confidential messages to a half-duplex receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper. Different from classical AN injection schemes, which rely on a multi-antenna transmitter or external helpers, our proposed scheme is applicable to the scenario where the legitimate transceivers are very simple. We analyze the performance of the proposed scheme and optimize the design of the transmission. Our results highlight that perfect secrecy is always achievable by properly designing the AN injection scheme.
