Comments on "CRB-RPL: A Receiver-based Routing Protocol for Communications in Cognitive Radio Enabled Smart Grid"

A recent paper by Yang et al. [1] proposed CRB-RPL as a new RPL-based routing protocol for communications in cognitive radio (CR) enabled smart grid. Essentially, CRB-RPL adopts the operation of CRB-MAC, which is a medium access control (MAC) protocol for cognitive machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, and depicts it as a network layer enhancement. CRB-RPL suffers from a number of technical flaws in terms of protocol operation and analytical aspects. The main objective of this paper is to highlight these technical flaws of CRB-RPL and provide corrections to analytical modeling.
