Analysis of Feedback Error in Automatic Repeat reQuest

The future wireless networks envision ultra-reliable communication with efficient use of the limited wireless channel resources. Closed-loop repetition protocols where retransmission of a packet is enabled using a feedback channel has been adopted since early days of wireless telecommunication. Protocols such as automatic repeat request (ARQ) are used in today's wireless technologies as a mean to provide the link with reduced rate of packet outage and increased average throughput. The performance of such protocols is strongly dependent to the feedback channel reliability. This paper studies the problem of feedback error and proposes a new method of acknowledging packet delivery for retransmission protocols in unreliable feedback channel conditions. The proposed method is based on backwards composite acknowledgment from multiple packets in a retransmission protocol and provides the scheduler of the wireless channel with additional parameters to configure ultra-reliable communication for a user depending on channel quality. Numerical analysis are presented which show orders of magnitude increase in reliability of the proposed method as compared to ARQ at the cost of a small increase in average experienced delay.
