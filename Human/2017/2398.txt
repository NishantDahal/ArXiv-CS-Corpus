IoT Localization for Bistatic Passive UHF RFID Systems with 3D Radiation Pattern

Passive Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems carry critical importance for Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their energy harvesting capabilities. RFID based position estimation, in particular, is expected to facilitate a wide array of location based services for IoT applications with low-power requirements. In this paper, considering monostatic and bistatic configurations and 3D antenna radiation pattern, we investigate the accuracy of received signal strength based wireless localization using passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID systems. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization accuracy is derived, and is compared with the accuracy of maximum likelihood estimators for various RFID antenna configurations. Numerical results show that due to RFID tag/antenna sensitivity, and the directional antenna pattern, the localization accuracy can degrade at blind locations that remain outside of the RFID reader antennas' main beam patterns. In such cases optimizing elevation angle of antennas are shown to improve localization coverage, while using bistatic configuration improves localization accuracy significantly.
