Supermodularity in Unweighted Graph Opitimization III: Highly-connected Digraphs

By generalizing a recent result of Hong, Liu, and Lai on characterizing the degree-sequences of simple strongly connected directed graphs, a characterization is provided for degree-sequences of simple $k$-node-connected digraphs. More generally, we solve the directed node-connectivity augmentation problem when the augmented digraph is degree-specified and simple. As for edge-connectivity augmentation, we solve the special case when the edge-connectivity is to be increased by one and the augmenting digraph must be simple.
