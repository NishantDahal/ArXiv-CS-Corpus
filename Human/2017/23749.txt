Automatic Streaming Segmentation of Stereo Video Using Bilateral Space

In this paper, we take advantage of binocular camera and propose an unsupervised algorithm based on semi-supervised segmentation algorithm and extracting foreground part efficiently. We creatively embed depth information into bilateral grid in the graph cut model and achieve considerable segmenting accuracy in the case of no user input. The experi- ment approves the high precision, time efficiency of our algorithm and its adaptation to complex natural scenario which is significant for practical application.
