Design Aspects of Multi-Soliton Pulses for Optical Fiber Transmission

We explain how to optimize the nonlinear spectrum of multi-soliton pulses by considering the practical constraints of transmitter, receiver, and lumped-amplified link. The optimization is applied for the experimental transmission of 2ns soliton pulses with independent on-off keying of 10 eigenvalues over 2000 km of NZ-DSF fiber spans.
