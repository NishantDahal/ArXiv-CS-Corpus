Grand Technologies for Grand Energy Challenges: A Futuristic Scenario for Solar Energy in the Age of Information

Instead of getting involved in either extremes of dispute around climate change as one of our grand challenges, we opened the space of potential policy responses from a systemic view and showed why current climate change mitigation policies are not successful as planned. Further, as a potential futuristic scenario, neither a projection nor a prediction, that attracts further discussions, we showed how solar based energy systems are different than other current energy systems and how we can conceive of them as grand technologies which dissolve the whole landscape of energy management in the age of information.
