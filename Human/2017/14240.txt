Compress-and-Estimate Source Coding for a Vector Gaussian Source

We consider the remote vector source coding problem in which a vector Gaussian source is to be estimated from noisy linear measurements. For this problem, we derive the performance of the compress-and-estimate (CE) coding scheme and compare it to the optimal performance. In the CE coding scheme, the remote encoder compresses the noisy source observations so as to minimize the local distortion measure, independent from the joint distribution between the source and the observations. In reconstruction, the decoder estimates the original source realization from the lossy-compressed noisy observations. For the CE coding in the Gaussian vector case, we show that, if the code rate is less than a threshold, then the CE coding scheme attains the same performance as the optimal coding scheme. We also introduce lower and upper bounds for the performance gap above this threshold. In addition, an example with two observations and two sources is studied to illustrate the behavior of the performance gap.
