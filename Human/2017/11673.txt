Experiments of posture estimation on vehicles using wearable acceleration sensors

In this paper, we study methods to estimate drivers' posture in vehicles using acceleration data of wearable sensor and conduct a field test. Recently, sensor technologies have been progressed. Solutions of safety management to analyze vital data acquired from wearable sensor and judge work status are proposed. To prevent huge accidents, demands for safety management of bus and taxi are high. However, acceleration of vehicles is added to wearable sensor in vehicles, and there is no guarantee to estimate drivers' posture accurately. Therefore, in this paper, we study methods to estimate driving posture using acceleration data acquired from T-shirt type wearable sensor hitoe, conduct field tests and implement a sample application.
