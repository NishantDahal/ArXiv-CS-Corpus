A Brownian Motion Model and Extreme Belief Machine for Modeling Sensor Data Measurements

As the title suggests, we will describe (and justify through the presentation of some of the relevant mathematics) prediction methodologies for sensor measurements. This exposition will mainly be concerned with the mathematics related to modeling the sensor measurements.
