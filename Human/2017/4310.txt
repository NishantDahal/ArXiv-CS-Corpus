Medical Image Watermarking using 2D-DWT with Enhanced security and capacity

Teleradiology enables medical images to be transferred over the computer networks for many purposes including clinical interpretation, diagnosis, archive, etc. In telemedicine, medical images can be manipulated while transferring. In addition, medical information security requirements are specified by the legislative rules, and concerned entities must adhere to them. In this research, we propose a new scheme based on 2-dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D DWT) to improve the robustness and authentication of medical images. In addition, the current research improves security and capacity of watermarking using encryption and compression in medical images. The evaluation is performed on the personal dataset, which contains 194 CTI and 68 MRI cases.
