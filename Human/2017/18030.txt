Coded Caching in Partially Cooperative D2D Communication Networks

The backhaul traffic is becoming a major concern in wireless and cellular networks (e.g., 4G-LTE and 5G) with the increasing demands for online video streaming. Caching the popular content in the cache memory of the network users (e.g., mobile devices) is an effective technique to reduce the traffic during the networks' peak time. However, due to the dynamic nature of these networks, users privacy settings, or energy limitations, some users may not be available or intend to participate during the caching procedures. In this paper, we propose caching schemes for device-to-device communication networks where a group of users show selfish characteristics. The selfish users along with the non-selfish users will cache the popular content, but will not share their useful cache content with the other users to satisfy a user request. We show that our proposed schemes are able to satisfy any arbitrary user requests under partial cooperation of the network users.
