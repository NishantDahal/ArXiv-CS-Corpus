Distributed Contingency Analysis over Wide Area Network among Dispatch Centers

Traditionally, a regional dispatch center uses the equivalent method to deal with external grids, which fails to reflect the interactions among regions. This paper proposes a distributed N-1 contingency analysis (DCA) solution, where dispatch centers join a coordinated computation using their private data and computing resources. A distributed screening method is presented to determine the Critical Contingency Set (DCCS) in DCA. Then, the distributed power flow is formulated as a set of boundary equations, which is solved by a Jacobi-Free Newton-GMRES (JFNG) method. During solving the distributed power flow, only boundary conditions are exchanged. Acceleration techniques are also introduced, including reusing preconditioners and optimal resource scheduling during parallel processing of multiple contingencies. The proposed method is implemented on a real EMS platform, where tests using the Southwest Regional Grid of China are carried out to validate its feasibility.
