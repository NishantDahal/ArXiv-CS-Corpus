End-to-end Recurrent Neural Network Models for Vietnamese Named Entity Recognition: Word-level vs. Character-level

This paper demonstrates end-to-end neural network architectures for Vietnamese named entity recognition. Our best model is a combination of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Conditional Random Field (CRF), using pre-trained word embeddings as input, which achieves an F1 score of 88.59% on a standard test set. Our system is able to achieve a comparable performance to the first-rank system of the VLSP campaign without using any syntactic or hand-crafted features. We also give an extensive empirical study on using common deep learning models for Vietnamese NER, at both word and character level.
