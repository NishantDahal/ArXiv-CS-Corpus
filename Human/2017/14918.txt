BMOBench: Black-Box Multi-Objective Optimization Benchmarking Platform

This document briefly describes the Black-Box Multi-Objective Optimization Benchmarking (BMOBench) platform. It presents the test problems, evaluation procedure, and experimental setup. To this end, the BMOBench is demonstrated by comparing recent multi-objective solvers from the literature, namely SMS-EMOA, DMS, and MO-SOO.
