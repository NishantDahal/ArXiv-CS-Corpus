Evaluating Connection Resilience for Self-Organized Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems

Self-organizing cyber-physical systems are expected to become increasingly important in the context of Industry 4.0 automation as well as in everyday scenarios. Resilient communication is crucial for such systems. In general, this can be achieved with redundant communication paths. Mathematically, the amount of redundant paths is expressed with the network connectivity. A high network connectivity is required for collaboration and system-wide self-adaptation even when nodes fail or get compromised by an attacker. In this paper, we analyze the network connectivity of a communication network for large distributed cyber-physical systems. For this, we simulate the communication structure of a CPS with different network parameters to determine its resilience. With our results, we also deduce the required network connectivity for a given number of failing or compromised nodes.
