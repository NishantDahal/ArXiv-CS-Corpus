Private Coded Caching

Recent work by Maddah-Ali and Niesen introduced coded caching which demonstrated the benefits of joint design of storage and transmission policies in content delivery networks. They studied a setup where a server communicates with a set of users, each equipped with a local cache, over a shared error-free link and proposed an order-optimal caching and delivery scheme. In this paper, we introduce the problem of secretive coded caching where we impose the additional constraint that a user should not be able to learn anything, from either the content stored in its cache or the server transmissions, about a file it did not request. We propose a feasible scheme for this setting and demonstrate its order-optimality with respect to information-theoretic lower bounds.
