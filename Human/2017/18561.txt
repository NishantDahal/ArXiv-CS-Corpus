Report: Performance comparison between C2075 and P100 GPU cards using cosmological correlation functions

In this report, some cosmological correlation functions are used to evaluate the differential performance between C2075 and P100 GPU cards. In the past, the correlation functions used in this work have been widely studied and exploited on some previous GPU architectures. The analysis of the performance indicates that a speedup in the range from 13 to 15 is achieved without any additional optimization process for the P100 card.
