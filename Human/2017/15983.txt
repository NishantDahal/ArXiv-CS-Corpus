Creating an A Cappella Singing Audio Dataset for Automatic Jingju Singing Evaluation Research

The data-driven computational research on automatic jingju (also known as Beijing or Peking opera) singing evaluation lacks a suitable and comprehensive a cappella singing audio dataset. In this work, we present an a cappella singing audio dataset which consists of 120 arias, accounting for 1265 melodic lines. This dataset is also an extension our existing CompMusic jingju corpus. Both professional and amateur singers were invited to the dataset recording sessions, and the most common jingju musical elements have been covered. This dataset is also accompanied by metadata per aria and melodic line annotated for automatic singing evaluation research purpose. All the gathered data is openly available online.
