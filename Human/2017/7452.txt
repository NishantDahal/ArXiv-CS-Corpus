Game-theoretic Investigation of Intensional Equalities

This article presents a new game semantics for Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT), in which each game is equipped with selected isomorphism strategies that represent (computational) proofs for (intensional) equality between strategies on the game. These isomorphism strategies interpret propositional equalities in MLTT. As a main result, we have obtained a first game semantics for MLTT that refutes the principle of uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) and validates univalence axiom (UA) though it does not model non-trivial higher equalities. Categorically, our model forms a substructure of the classic groupoid model of MLTT by Hofmann and Streicher. Similarly to the path from the groupoid model to the $ω$-groupoid model, we are planning to generalize the game semantics to give rise to an omega-groupoid structure to interpret non-trivial higher equalities in homotopy type theory (HoTT).
