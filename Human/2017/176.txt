KMC 3: counting and manipulating k-mer statistics

Summary: Counting all k-mers in a given dataset is a standard procedure in many bioinformatics applications. We introduce KMC3, a significant improvement of the former KMC2 algorithm together with KMC tools for manipulating k-mer databases. Usefulness of the tools is shown on a few real problems.
