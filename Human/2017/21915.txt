Open Evaluation Tool for Layout Analysis of Document Images

This paper presents an open tool for standardizing the evaluation process of the layout analysis task of document images at pixel level. We introduce a new evaluation tool that is both available as a standalone Java application and as a RESTful web service. This evaluation tool is free and open-source in order to be a common tool that anyone can use and contribute to. It aims at providing as many metrics as possible to investigate layout analysis predictions, and also provide an easy way of visualizing the results. This tool evaluates document segmentation at pixel level, and support multi-labeled pixel ground truth. Finally, this tool has been successfully used for the ICDAR2017 competition on Layout Analysis for Challenging Medieval Manuscripts.
