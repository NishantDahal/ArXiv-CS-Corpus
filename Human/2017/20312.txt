Preserving Local and Global Information for Network Embedding

Networks such as social networks, airplane networks, and citation networks are ubiquitous. The adjacency matrix is often adopted to represent a network, which is usually high dimensional and sparse. However, to apply advanced machine learning algorithms to network data, low-dimensional and continuous representations are desired. To achieve this goal, many network embedding methods have been proposed recently. The majority of existing methods facilitate the local information i.e. local connections between nodes, to learn the representations, while completely neglecting global information (or node status), which has been proven to boost numerous network mining tasks such as link prediction and social recommendation. Hence, it also has potential to advance network embedding. In this paper, we study the problem of preserving local and global information for network embedding. In particular, we introduce an approach to capture global information and propose a network embedding framework LOG, which can coherently model {\bf LO}cal and {\bf G}lobal information. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to preserve global information of the proposed framework. Further experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of learned representations of the proposed framework.
