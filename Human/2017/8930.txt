New self-dual codes of length 72

In this paper we obtain at least 61 new singly even (Type I) binary [72,36,12] self-dual codes as a quasi-cyclic codes with m=2 (tailbitting convolutional codes) and at least 13 new doubly even (Type II) binary [72,36,12] self-dual codes by replacing the first row in each circulant in a double circulant code by "all ones" and "all zeros" vectors respectively.
