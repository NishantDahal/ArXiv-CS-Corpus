Fronthaul-Aware Group Sparse Precoding and Signal Splitting in SWIPT C-RAN

We investigate the precoding, remote radio head (RRH) selection and signal splitting in the simultaneous wireless information and power transferring (SWIPT) cloud radio access networks \mbox{(C-RANs)}. The objective is to minimize the power consumption of the SWIPT C-RAN. Different from the existing literature, we consider the nonlinear fronthaul power consumption and the multiple antenna RRHs. By switching off the unnecessary RRHs, the group sparsity of the precoding coefficients is introduced, which indicates that the precoding process and the RRH selection are coupled. In order to overcome these issues, a group sparse precoding and signal splitting algorithm is proposed based on the majorization-minimization framework, and the convergence behavior is established. Numerical results are used to verify our proposed studies.
