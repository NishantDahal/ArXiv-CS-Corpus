ImageNet MPEG-7 Visual Descriptors - Technical Report

ImageNet is a large scale and publicly available image database. It currently offers more than 14 millions of images, organised according to the WordNet hierarchy. One of the main objective of the creators is to provide to the research community a relevant database for visual recognition applications such as object recognition, image classification or object localisation. However, only a few visual descriptors of the images are available to be used by the researchers. Only SIFT-based features have been extracted from a subset of the collection. This technical report presents the extraction of some MPEG-7 visual descriptors from the ImageNet database. These descriptors are made publicly available in an effort towards open research.
