Binary Prime Tableau Sequences

This paper proposes a new class of random sequences called binary primes tableau (PT) sequences that have potential applications in cryptography and communications. The PT sequence of rank p is obtained from numbers arranged in a tableau with p columns where primes are marked off until each column has at least one prime and where the column entries are added modulo 2. We also examine the dual to the PT sequences obtained by adding the rows of the tableau. It is shown that PT sequences have excellent autocorrelation properties.
