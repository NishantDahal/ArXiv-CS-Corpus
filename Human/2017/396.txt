Distributed Clustering for Multiuser Networks through Coalition Formation

Clustering mechanisms are essential in certain multiuser networks for achieving efficient resource utilization. This lecture note presents the theory of coalition formation as a useful tool for distributed clustering problems. We reveal the generality of the theory, and study complexity aspects which must be considered in multiuser networks.
