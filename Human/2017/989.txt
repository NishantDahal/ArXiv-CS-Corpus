Group Visual Sentiment Analysis

In this paper, we introduce a framework for classifying images according to high-level sentiment. We subdivide the task into three primary problems: emotion classification on faces, human pose estimation, and 3D estimation and clustering of groups of people. We introduce novel algorithms for matching body parts to a common individual and clustering people in images based on physical location and orientation. Our results outperform several baseline approaches.
