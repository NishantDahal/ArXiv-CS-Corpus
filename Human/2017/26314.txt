Performance evaluation of energy detector over generalized non-linear and shadowed composite fading channels using a Mixture Gamma Distribution

The performance of energy detection (ED) for independent and identically distribution (i.i.d.) signal models is analyzed over generalized composite non-linear line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) shadowed fading scenarios. The novel expressions for α-\k{appa}-μ/Gamma and α-η-μ/Gamma fading channels have been derived to approximate by using the mixture gamma (MG) distribution under low instantaneous signal-to-noise (SNR) condition. On the basis of the deduced fading distributions, novel, exact and close-form detective models are derived to evaluate the sensing performance with different key fading parameters over generalized non-linear and shadowed composite fading channels.
