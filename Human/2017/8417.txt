Parallel Space-Time Kernel Density Estimation

The exponential growth of available data has increased the need for interactive exploratory analysis. Dataset can no longer be understood through manual crawling and simple statistics. In Geographical Information Systems (GIS), the dataset is often composed of events localized in space and time; and visualizing such a dataset involves building a map of where the events occurred.
  We focus in this paper on events that are localized among three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and time), and on computing the first step of the visualization pipeline, space-time kernel density estimation (STKDE), which is most computationally expensive. Starting from a gold standard implementation, we show how algorithm design and engineering, parallel decomposition, and scheduling can be applied to bring near real-time computing to space-time kernel density estimation. We validate our techniques on real world datasets extracted from infectious disease, social media, and ornithology.
