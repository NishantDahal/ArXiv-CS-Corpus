On a Distributed Approach for Density-based Clustering

Efficient extraction of useful knowledge from these data is still a challenge, mainly when the data is distributed, heterogeneous and of different quality depending on its corresponding local infrastructure. To reduce the overhead cost, most of the existing distributed clustering approaches generate global models by aggregating local results obtained on each individual node. The complexity and quality of solutions depend highly on the quality of the aggregation. In this respect, we proposed for distributed density-based clustering that both reduces the communication overheads due to the data exchange and improves the quality of the global models by considering the shapes of local clusters. From preliminary results we show that this algorithm is very promising.
