micompr: An R Package for Multivariate Independent Comparison of Observations

The R package micompr implements a procedure for assessing if two or more multivariate samples are drawn from the same distribution. The procedure uses principal component analysis to convert multivariate observations into a set of linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared using a number of statistical methods. This technique is independent of the distributional properties of samples and automatically selects features that best explain their differences. The procedure is appropriate for comparing samples of time series, images, spectrometric measures or similar high-dimension multivariate observations.
