Delay-Optimal Scheduling for Queueing Systems with Switching Overhead

We study the scheduling polices for asymptotically optimal delay in queueing systems with switching overhead. Such systems consist of a single server that serves multiple queues, and some capacity is lost whenever the server switches to serve a different set of queues. The capacity loss due to this switching overhead can be significant in many emerging applications, and needs to be explicitly addressed in the design of scheduling policies. For example, in 60GHz wireless networks with directional antennas, base stations need to train and reconfigure their beam patterns whenever they switch from one client to another. Considerable switching overhead can also be observed in many other queueing systems such as transportation networks and manufacturing systems. While the celebrated Max-Weight policy achieves asymptotically optimal average delay for systems without switching overhead, it fails to preserve throughput-optimality, let alone delay-optimality, when switching overhead is taken into account. We propose a class of Biased Max-Weight scheduling policies that explicitly takes switching overhead into account. The Biased Max-Weight policy can use either queue length or head-of-line waiting time as an indicator of the system status. We prove that our policies not only are throughput-optimal, but also can be made arbitrarily close to the asymptotic lower bound on average delay. To validate the performance of the proposed policies, we provide extensive simulation with various system topologies and different traffic patterns. We show that the proposed policies indeed achieve much better delay performance than that of the state-of-the-art policy.
