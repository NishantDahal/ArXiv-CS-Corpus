Error Performance of Wireless Powered Cognitive Relay Networks with Interference Alignment

This paper studies a two-hop decode-and-forward underlay cognitive radio system with interference alignment technique. An energy-constrained relay node harvests the energy from the interference signals through a power-splitting (PS) relaying protocol. Firstly, the beamforming matrices design for the primary and secondary networks is demonstrated. Then, a bit error rate (BER) performance of the system under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios for PS protocol is calculated. Finally, the impact of the CSI mismatch parameters on the BER performance is simulated.
