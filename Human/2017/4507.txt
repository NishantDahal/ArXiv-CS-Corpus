Decentralized, Robust and Efficient Services for an Autonomous and Real-time Urban Crisis Management

The globalization of trade and the organization of work are currently causing a large migratory flow towards the cities. This growth of cities requires new urban planning where digital tools take a preponderant place to capture data and understand and decide in face of changes. These tools however hardly resist to natural disasters, terrorism, accidents, etc. Based on the expertise of the CITI laboratory of INSA Lyon and SC3 of the Industrial University of Santander, we propose to create the ALERT project - Autonomous Liable Emergency service in Real Time - with decentralized, reliable and efficient services, physically close to the citizens, taking decisions locally, in a relevant manner without risk of disconnection with a central authority. These information gathering and decision-making will involve the population with participatory and social approaches.
