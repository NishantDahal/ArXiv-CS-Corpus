Fast Asymmetric Fronts Propagation for Image Segmentation

In this paper, we introduce a generalized asymmetric fronts propagation model based on the geodesic distance maps and the Eikonal partial differential equations. One of the key ingredients for the computation of the geodesic distance map is the geodesic metric, which can govern the action of the geodesic distance level set propagation. We consider a Finsler metric with the Randers form, through which the asymmetry and anisotropy enhancements can be taken into account to prevent the fronts leaking problem during the fronts propagation. These enhancements can be derived from the image edge-dependent vector field such as the gradient vector flow. The numerical implementations are carried out by the Finsler variant of the fast marching method, leading to very efficient interactive segmentation schemes. We apply the proposed Finsler fronts propagation model to image segmentation applications. Specifically, the foreground and background segmentation is implemented by the Voronoi index map. In addition, for the application of tubularity segmentation, we exploit the level set lines of the geodesic distance map associated to the proposed Finsler metric providing that a thresholding value is given.
