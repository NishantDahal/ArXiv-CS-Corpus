A MapReduce-based rotation forest classifier for epileptic seizure prediction

In this era, big data applications including biomedical are becoming attractive as the data generation and storage is increased in the last years. The big data processing to extract knowledge becomes challenging since the data mining techniques are not adapted to the new requirements. In this study, we analyse the EEG signals for epileptic seizure detection in the big data scenario using Rotation Forest classifier. Specifically, MSPCA is used for denoising, WPD is used for feature extraction and Rotation Forest is used for classification in a MapReduce framework to correctly predict the epileptic seizure. This paper presents a MapReduce-based distributed ensemble algorithm for epileptic seizure prediction and trains a Rotation Forest on each dataset in parallel using a cluster of computers. The results of MapReduce based Rotation Forest show that the proposed framework reduces the training time significantly while accomplishing a high level of performance in classifications.
