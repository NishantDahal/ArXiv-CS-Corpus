Identifying 3 moss species by deep learning, using the "chopped picture" method

In general, object identification tends not to work well on ambiguous, amorphous objects such as vegetation. In this study, we developed a simple but effective approach to identify ambiguous objects and applied the method to several moss species. As a result, the model correctly classified test images with accuracy more than 90%. Using this approach will help progress in computer vision studies.
