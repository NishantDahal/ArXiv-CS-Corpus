Universal Guard Problems

We provide a spectrum of results for the Universal Guard Problem, in which one is to obtain a small set of points ("guards") that are "universal" in their ability to guard any of a set of possible polygonal domains in the plane. We give upper and lower bounds on the number of universal guards that are always sufficient to guard all polygons having a given set of n vertices, or to guard all polygons in a given set of k polygons on an n-point vertex set. Our upper bound proofs include algorithms to construct universal guard sets of the respective cardinalities.
