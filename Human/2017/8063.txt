Numerically Safe Gaussian Elimination with No Pivoting

Gaussian elimination with no pivoting and block Gaussian elimination are attractive alternatives to the customary but communication intensive Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (hereafter we use the acronyms GENP, BGE, and GEPP} provided that the computations proceed safely and numerically safely}, that is, run into neither division by 0 nor numerical problems. Empirically, safety and numerical safety of GENP have been consistently observed in a number of papers where an input matrix was pre-processed with various structured multipliers chosen ad hoc. Our present paper provides missing formal support for this empirical observation and explains why it was elusive so far. Namely we prove that GENP is numerically unsafe for a specific class of input matrices in spite of its pre-processing with some well-known and well-tested structured multipliers, but we also prove that GENP and BGE are safe and numerically safe for the average input matrix pre-processed with any nonsingular and well-conditioned multiplier. This should embolden search for sparse and structured multipliers, and we list and test some new classes of them. We also seek randomized pre-processing that universally (that is, for all input matrices) supports (i) safe GENP and BGE with probability 1 and/or (ii) numerically safe GENP and BGE with a probability close to 1.We achieve goal (i) with a Gaussian structured multiplier and goal (ii) with a Gaussian unstructured multiplier and alternatively with Gaussian structured augmentation. We consistently confirm all these formal results with our tests of GENP for benchmark inputs. We have extended our approach to other fundamental matrix computations and keep working on further extensions.
