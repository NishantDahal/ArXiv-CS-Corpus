Nearly Optimal Constructions of PIR and Batch Codes

In this work we study two families of codes with availability, namely private information retrieval (PIR) codes and batch codes. While the former requires that every information symbol has $k$ mutually disjoint recovering sets, the latter asks this property for every multiset request of $k$ information symbols. The main problem under this paradigm is to minimize the number of redundancy symbols. We denote this value by $r_P(n,k), r_B(n,k)$, for PIR, batch codes, respectively, where $n$ is the number of information symbols. Previous results showed that for any constant $k$, $r_P(n,k) = Θ(\sqrt{n})$ and $r_B(n,k)=O(\sqrt{n}\log(n)$. In this work we study the asymptotic behavior of these codes for non-constant $k$ and specifically for $k=Θ(n^ε)$. We also study the largest value of $k$ such that the rate of the codes approaches 1, and show that for all $ε<1$, $r_P(n,n^ε) = o(n)$, while for batch codes, this property holds for all $ε< 0.5$.
