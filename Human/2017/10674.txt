Spatial Coding Based on Minimum BER in 1-Bit Massive MIMO Systems

We consider a downlink 1-bit quantized multiuser (MU) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, where 1-bit digital-to-analog (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used at the transmitter and the receiver for economical and computational efficiency. We end up with a discrete memoryless channel with input and output vectors belonging to the QPSK constellation. In the context of massive (MIMO) systems the number of base station (BS) antennas is much larger than the number of receive antennas. This leads to high input cardinality of the channel. In this work we introduce a method to reduce the input set based on the mimimum bit-error-ratio (BER) criterion combined with a non-linear precoding technique. This method is denoted as spatial coding. Simulations show that this spatial coding improves the BER behavior significantly removing the error floor due to coarse quantization.
