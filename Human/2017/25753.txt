A Study on the Perception of Researchers about the Application of Agile Software Development Methods in Research

Papers on Agile Software Development methods are often focused on their applicability in commercial projects or organizations. There are no current studies that we know about addressing the application of these methods in research projects. The objective of this work is to describe the perception of researchers on the application of agile software development practices and principles for research projects. A study was conducted by constructing and applying a questionnaire to Brazilian researchers of different affiliations, formation and research areas in order to obtain information about their knowledge and openness to follow agile software development principles and practices.
