StegIbiza: Steganography in Club Music Implemented in Python

This paper introduces the implementation of steganography method called StegIbiza, which uses tempo modulation as hidden message carrier. With the use of Python scripting language, a bit string was encoded and decoded using WAV and MP3 files. Once the message was hidden into a music files, an internet radio was created to evaluate broadcast possibilities. No dedicated music or signal processing equipment was used in this StegIbiza implementation
