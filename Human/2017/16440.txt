A novel metaheuristic method for solving constrained engineering optimization problems: Drone Squadron Optimization

Several constrained optimization problems have been adequately solved over the years thanks to advances in the metaheuristics area. In this paper, we evaluate a novel self-adaptive and auto-constructive metaheuristic called Drone Squadron Optimization (DSO) in solving constrained engineering design problems. This paper evaluates DSO with death penalty on three widely tested engineering design problems. Results show that the proposed approach is competitive with some very popular metaheuristics.
