The Indoor Mobile Coverage Problem Using UAVs

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as aerial wireless base stations when cellular networks are not operational due to natural disasters. They can also be used to supplement the ground base station in order to provide better coverage and higher data rates for the users. Prior studies on UAV based wireless coverage typically consider an Air-to-Ground path loss model, which assumes that the users are outdoor and located on a 2D plane. In this paper, we propose using UAVs to provide wireless coverage for indoor users inside a high-rise building. First, we present realistic Outdoor-Indoor path loss models and describe the tradeoff introduced by these models. Then we study the problem of efficient placement of a single UAV, where the objective is to minimize the total transmit power required to cover the entire high-rise building. The formulated problem is non-convex and is generally difficult to solve. To that end, we consider three cases of practical interest and provide efficient solutions to the formulated problem under these cases. Then we study the problem of minimizing the number of UAVs required to provide wireless coverage to high rise buildings and prove that this problem is NP-complete. Due to the intractability of the problem, we use clustering to minimize the number of UAVs required to cover the indoor users. We demonstrate through simulations that the method that clusters the building into regular structures and places the UAVs in each cluster requires 80% more number of UAVs relative to our clustering algorithm.
