A Cooperative Proof of Work Scheme for Distributed Consensus Protocols

We propose a refinement to the well known, and widely used, proof-of-work scheme of zeroing a cryptographic hash. Our refinement allows multiple autonomous users to cooperate on the proof-of-work for their own transactions in order to bring about consensus on the order of said transactions.
