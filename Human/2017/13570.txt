Rotations and Interpretability of Word Embeddings: the Case of the Russian Language

Consider a continuous word embedding model. Usually, the cosines between word vectors are used as a measure of similarity of words. These cosines do not change under orthogonal transformations of the embedding space. We demonstrate that, using some canonical orthogonal transformations from SVD, it is possible both to increase the meaning of some components and to make the components more stable under re-learning. We study the interpretability of components for publicly available models for the Russian language (RusVectores, fastText, RDT).
