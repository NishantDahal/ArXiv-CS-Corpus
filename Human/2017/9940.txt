An Examination of the Benefits of Scalable TTI for Heterogeneous Traffic Management in 5G Networks

The rapid growth in the number and variety of connected devices requires 5G wireless systems to cope with a very heterogeneous traffic mix. As a consequence, the use of a fixed TTI during transmission is not necessarily the most efficacious method when heterogeneous traffic types need to be simultaneously serviced.This work analyzes the benefits of scheduling based on exploiting scalable TTI, where the channel assignment and the TTI duration are adapted to the deadlines and requirements of different services. We formulate an optimization problem by taking individual service requirements into consideration. We then prove that the optimization problem is NP-hard and provide a heuristic algorithm, which provides an effective solution to the problem. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm is capable of finding near-optimal solutions to meet the latency requirements of mission critical communication services, while providing a good throughput performance for mobile broadband services.
