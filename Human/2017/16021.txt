Direct-Manipulation Visualization of Deep Networks

The recent successes of deep learning have led to a wave of interest from non-experts. Gaining an understanding of this technology, however, is difficult. While the theory is important, it is also helpful for novices to develop an intuitive feel for the effect of different hyperparameters and structural variations. We describe TensorFlow Playground, an interactive, open sourced visualization that allows users to experiment via direct manipulation rather than coding, enabling them to quickly build an intuition about neural nets.
