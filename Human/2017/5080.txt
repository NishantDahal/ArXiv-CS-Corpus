Towards CNN Map Compression for camera relocalisation

This paper presents a study on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks for camera relocalisation and its application to map compression. We follow state of the art visual relocalisation results and evaluate response to different data inputs -- namely, depth, grayscale, RGB, spatial position and combinations of these. We use a CNN map representation and introduce the notion of CNN map compression by using a smaller CNN architecture. We evaluate our proposal in a series of publicly available datasets. This formulation allows us to improve relocalisation accuracy by increasing the number of training trajectories while maintaining a constant-size CNN.
