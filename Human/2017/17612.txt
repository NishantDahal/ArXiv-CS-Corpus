Integration of Japanese Papers Into the DBLP Data Set

If someone is looking for a certain publication in the field of computer science, the searching person is likely to use the DBLP to find the desired publication. The DBLP data set is continuously extended with new publications, or rather their metadata, for example the names of involved authors, the title and the publication date. While the size of the data set is already remarkable, specific areas can still be improved. The DBLP offers a huge collection of English papers because most papers concerning computer science are published in English. Nevertheless, there are official publications in other languages which are supposed to be added to the data set. One kind of these are Japanese papers. This diploma thesis will show a way to automatically process publication lists of Japanese papers and to make them ready for an import into the DBLP data set. Especially important are the problems along the way of processing, such as transcription handling and Personal Name Matching with Japanese names.
