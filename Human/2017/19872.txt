Secrecy Rate Maximization with Outage Constraint in Multihop Relaying Networks

In this paper, we study the secure transmission in multihop wireless networks with randomize-and-forward (RaF) relaying, in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. By considering adaptive encoder with on-off transmission (OFT) scheme, we investigate the optimal design of the wiretap code and routing strategies to maximize the secrecy rate while satisfying the secrecy outage probability (SOP) constraint. We derive the exact expressions for the optimal rate parameters of the wiretap code. Then the secure routing problem is solved by revising the classical Bellman-Ford algorithm. Simulation results are conducted to verify our analysis.
