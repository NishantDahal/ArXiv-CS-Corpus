Critical Peaks Redefined - $Φ\sqcup Ψ= \top$

Let a cluster be a term with a number of patterns occurring in it. We give two accounts of clusters, a geometric one as sets of (node and edge) positions, and an inductive one as pairs of terms with gaps (2nd order variables) and pattern-substitutions for the gaps. We show both notions of cluster and the corresponding refinement/coarsening orders on them, to be isomorphic. This equips clusters with a lattice structure which we lift to (parallel/multi) steps to yield an alternative account of the notion of critical peak.
