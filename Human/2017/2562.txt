Spatial Oversampling in LOS MIMO Systems with 1-Bit Quantization at the Receiver

In this paper we investigate the achievable rate of LOS MIMO systems that use 1-bit quantization and spatial oversampling at the receiver. We propose that by using additional antennas at the receiver, the loss incurred due to the strong limitation of the quantization can be decreased. Mutual information results show that considerable rate gains can be achieved depending on the number and arrangement of the antennas. In some of the cases, even the full available rate from the transmitter can be attained. Furthermore, the results also reveal that two-dimensional antenna arrays can benefit more from spatial oversampling than one-dimensional arrays, when using 1-bit quantization in the LOS MIMO scenario.
