Relationship between Cross-Polarization Discrimination (XPD) and Spatial Correlation in Indoor Small-Cell MIMO Systems

In this letter, we present a correlated channel model for a dual-polarization antenna to omnidirectional antennas in indoor small-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In an indoor environment, we confirm that the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) in the direction of angle-of-departure can be represented as the spatial correlation of the MIMO channel. We also evaluate a dual-polarization antenna-based MIMO channel model and a spatially correlated channel model using a three-dimensional (3D) ray-tracing simulator. Furthermore, we provide the equivalent distance between adjacent antennas according to the XPD, providing insights into designing a dual-polarization antenna and its arrays.
