Towards Methods for Model-Based Software Development

Software engineering is a young discipline. Despite efforts in recent years, some elements still require further development, research, and systematization. One of these elements are methods. They consist of a set of well-defined activities used in a software development to guide how the work should be performed to achieve the expected results. However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge that effectively guide how work should be done in a variety of areas. Despite the knowledge available in Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), only the classical methods are comprised there, while emerging topics such as Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE), Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), and Model-Based Software Development (MBSE) are only briefly mentioned. We claim that it is also necessary to investigate methods for those emerging software engineering subtracks. In this direction, this paper presents a a speculative and preliminary emerging results on the establishment of methods for MBSE. We report some insights on the conception of methods for MBSE.
