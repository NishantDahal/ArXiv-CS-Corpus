Molecular Communication using Magnetic Nanoparticles

In this paper, we propose to use magnetic nanoparticles as information carriers for molecular communication. This enables the use of an external magnetic field to guide information-carrying particles towards the receiver. We show that the particle movement can be mathematically modeled as diffusion with drift. Thereby, we reveal that the key parameters determining the magnetic force are particle size and magnetic field gradient. As an example, we consider magnetic nanoparticle based communication in a bounded two-dimensional environment. For this model, we derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse response subject to fluid flow and magnetic drift. Furthermore, adopting the symbol error rate as performance metric, we show that using magnetic nanoparticles facilitates reliable communication, even in the presence of fluid flow.
