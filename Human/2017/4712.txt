Technical Report: Outage Performance of Full-Duplex MIMO DF Relaying using Zero-Forcing Beamforming

In this paper, we deal with the performance analysis of full-duplex relaying in decode-&-forward cooperative networks with multiple-antenna terminals. More specifically, by analyzing the end-to-end statistics, we derive the accurate closed-form expressions of the end-to-end outage probability for both transmit and receive ZFBF scheme over Rayleigh fading environments. Some selected results show some interesting observations useful for system designers. Specifically, we observe that the outage performance can be improved by adopting the joint ZF-based precoding with different antenna configurations.
