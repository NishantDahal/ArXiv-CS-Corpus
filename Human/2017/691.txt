Using data-compressors for statistical analysis of problems on homogeneity testing and classification

Nowadays data compressors are applied to many problems of text analysis, but many such applications are developed outside of the framework of mathematical statistics. In this paper we overcome this obstacle and show how several methods of classical mathematical statistics can be developed based on applications of the data compressors.
