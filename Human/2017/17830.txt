Characterization of a RS-LiDAR for 3D Perception

High precision 3D LiDARs are still expensive and hard to acquire. This paper presents the characteristics of RS-LiDAR, a model of low-cost LiDAR with sufficient supplies, in comparison with VLP-16. The paper also provides a set of evaluations to analyze the characterizations and performances of LiDARs sensors. This work analyzes multiple properties, such as drift effects, distance effects, color effects and sensor orientation effects, in the context of 3D perception. By comparing with Velodyne LiDAR, we found RS-LiDAR as a cheaper and acquirable substitute of VLP-16 with similar efficiency.
