Randomly coloring graphs of bounded treewidth

We consider the problem of sampling a proper $k$-coloring of a graph of maximal degree $Δ$ uniformly at random. We describe a new Markov chain for sampling colorings, and show that it mixes rapidly on graphs of bounded treewidth if $k\geq(1+ε)Δ$, for any $ε>0$.
