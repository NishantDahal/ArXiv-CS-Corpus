Proceedings 10th Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE 2017, the 10th Interaction and Concurrency Experience, which was held in Neuchâtel, Switzerland on the 21st and 22nd of June 2017 as a satellite event of DisCoTec'17.
  The ICE procedure for paper selection allows PC members to interact, anonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a discussion forum whose access is restricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of interest. The PC members post comments and questions that the authors reply to. For the first time, the 2017 edition of ICE included a double blind reviewing of original research papers, in order to increase fairness and avoid bias in reviewing. The  gender balance of accepted papers was also more even than in past years.
  Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether five papers were accepted for publication (the workshop also featured five brief announcements which are not part of this volume). We were proud to host three invited talks, by Christian Cachin, Marieke Huismann, and Paweł Sobocinski. The abstracts of these talks are included in this volume together with the regular papers.
