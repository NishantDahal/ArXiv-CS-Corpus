Agent based Tools for Modeling and Simulation of Self-Organization in Peer-to-Peer, Ad-Hoc and other Complex Networks

Agent-based modeling and simulation tools provide a mature platform for development of complex simulations. They however, have not been applied much in the domain of mainstream modeling and simulation of computer networks. In this article, we evaluate how and if these tools can offer any value-addition in the modeling & simulation of complex networks such as pervasive computing, large-scale peer-to-peer systems, and networks involving considerable environment and human/animal/habitat interaction. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of NetLogo - a tool that has been widely used in the area of agent-based social simulation.
