Performance Bounds of Concatenated Polar Coding Schemes

A concatenated coding scheme over binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels using a polarization transformation followed by outer sub-codes is analyzed. Achievable error exponents and upper bounds on the error rate are derived. The first bound is obtained using outer codes which are typical linear codes from the ensemble of parity check matrices whose elements are chosen independently and uniformly. As a byproduct of this bound, it determines the required rate split of the total rate to the rates of the outer codes. A lower bound on the error exponent that holds for all BMS channels with a given capacity is then derived. Improved bounds and approximations for finite blocklength codes using channel dispersions (normal approximation), as well as converse and approximate converse results, are also obtained. The bounds are compared to actual simulation results from the literature. For the cases considered, when transmitting over the binary input additive white Gaussian noise channel, there was only a small gap between the normal approximation prediction and the actual error rate of concatenated BCH-polar codes.
