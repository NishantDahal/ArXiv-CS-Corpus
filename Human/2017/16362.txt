Coverage Analysis in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks with Reflections

The coverage probability of a user in a mmwave system depends on the availability of line-of-sight paths or reflected paths from any base station. Many prior works modelled blockages using random shape theory and analyzed the SIR distribution with and without interference. While, it is intuitive that the reflected paths do not significantly contribute to the coverage (because of longer path lengths), there are no works which provide a model and study the coverage with reflections. In this paper, we model and analyze the impact of reflectors using stochastic geometry. We observe that the reflectors have very little impact on the coverage probability.
