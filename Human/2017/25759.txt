State spaces of convolutional codes, codings and encoders

In this paper we give a compact presentation of the theory of abstract spaces for convolutional codes and convolutional encoders, and show a connection between them that seems to be missing in the literature. We use it for a short proof of two facts: the size of a convolutional encoder of a polynomial matrix is at least its inner degree, and the minimal encoder has the size of the external degree if the matrix is reduced.
