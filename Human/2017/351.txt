Co-design of jump estimators and transmission policies for wireless multi-hop networks with fading channels [Extended]

We study transmission power budget minimization of battery-powered nodes in a remote state estimation problem over multi-hop wireless networks. Communication links between nodes are subject to fading, thereby generating random dropouts. Relay nodes help to transmit measurements from distributed sensors to an estimator node. Hopping through each relay node introduces a unit delay. Motivated by the need for estimators with low computational and implementation cost, we propose a jump estimator whose modes depend on a Markovian parameter that describes measurement transmission outcomes over a finite interval. It is well known that transmission power helps to increase the reliability of measurement transmissions, at the expense of reducing the life-time of the nodes' battery. Motivated by this, we derive a tractable iterative procedure, based on semi-definite programming, to design a finite set of filter gains, and associated power control laws to minimize the energy budget while guaranteeing an estimation performance level. This procedure allows us to tradeoff the complexity of the filter implementation with performance and energy use.
