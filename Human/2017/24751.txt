Computer Algebra Methods in Control Systems

As dynamic and control systems become more complex, relying purely on numerical computations for systems analysis and design might become extremely expensive or totally infeasible. Computer algebra can act as an enabler for analysis and design of such complex systems. It also provides means for characterization of all solutions and studying them before realizing a particular solution. This note provides a brief survey on some of the applications of symbolic computations in control systems analysis and design.
