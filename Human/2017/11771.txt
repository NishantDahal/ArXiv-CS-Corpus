Types of Cognition and its Implications for future High-Level Cognitive Machines

This work summarizes part of current knowledge on High-level Cognitive process and its relation with biological hardware. Thus, it is possible to identify some paradoxes which could impact the development of future technologies and artificial intelligence: we may make a High-level Cognitive Machine, sacrificing the principal attribute of a machine, its accuracy.
