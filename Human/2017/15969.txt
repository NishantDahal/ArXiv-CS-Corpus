Improving Secrecy with Nearly Collinear Main and Wiretap Channels via a Cooperative Jamming Relay

In physical layer security (PHY-security), the frequently observed high correlation between the main and wiretap channels can cause a significant loss of secrecy. This paper investigates a slow fading scenario, where a transmitter (Alice) sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver (Bob) while a passive eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to decode the message from its received signal. It is assumed that Alice is equipped with multiple antennas while Bob and Eve each have a single antenna (i.e., a MISOSE system). In a MISOSE system, high correlation results in nearly collinear main and wiretap channel vectors, which help Eve to see and intercept confidential information. Unfortunately, the signal processing techniques at Alice, such as beamforming and artificial noise (AN), are helpless, especially in the extreme case of completely collinear main and wiretap channel vectors. On this background, we first investigate the achievable secrecy outage probability via beamforming and AN at Alice with the optimal power allocation between the information-bearing signal and AN. Then, an ingenious model, in which a cooperative jamming relay (Relay) is introduced, is proposed to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of high correlation. Based on the proposed model, the power allocation between the information-bearing signal at Alice and the AN at Relay is also studied to maximize secrecy. Finally, to validate our proposed schemes, numerical simulations are conducted, and the results show that a significant performance gain with respect to secrecy is achieved.
