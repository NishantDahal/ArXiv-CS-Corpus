Analysis of Social Group Dynamics

In this thesis the method for social group evolution discovery, called GED, is analyzed. Especially, GED method is compared with other methods tracking changes in groups over time with focus on accuracy, computational cost, ease of implementation and flexibility of the methods. The methods are evaluated on overlapping and disjoint social groups. Finally, GED method is run with different user importance measures.
