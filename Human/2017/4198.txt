On Optimal 2- and 3-Planar Graphs

A graph is $k$-planar if it can be drawn in the plane such that no edge is crossed more than $k$ times. While for $k=1$, optimal $1$-planar graphs, i.e., those with $n$ vertices and exactly $4n-8$ edges, have been completely characterized, this has not been the case for $k \geq 2$. For $k=2,3$ and $4$, upper bounds on the edge density have been developed for the case of simple graphs by Pach and TÃ³th, Pach et al. and Ackerman, which have been used to improve the well-known "Crossing Lemma". Recently, we proved that these bounds also apply to non-simple $2$- and $3$-planar graphs without homotopic parallel edges and self-loops.
  In this paper, we completely characterize optimal $2$- and $3$-planar graphs, i.e., those that achieve the aforementioned upper bounds. We prove that they have a remarkably simple regular structure, although they might be non-simple. The new characterization allows us to develop notable insights concerning new inclusion relationships with other graph classes.
