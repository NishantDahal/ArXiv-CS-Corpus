Complex Correntropy Function: properties, and application to a channel equalization problem

The use of correntropy as a similarity measure has been increasing in different scenarios due to the well-known ability to extract high-order statistic information from data. Recently, a new similarity measure between complex random variables was defined and called complex correntropy. Based on a Gaussian kernel, it extends the benefits of correntropy to complex-valued data. However, its properties have not yet been formalized. This paper studies the properties of this new similarity measure and extends this definition to positive-definite kernels. Complex correntropy is applied to a channel equalization problem as good results are achieved when compared with other algorithms such as the complex least mean square (CLMS), complex recursive least squares (CRLS), and least absolute deviation (LAD).
