LightNN: Filling the Gap between Conventional Deep Neural Networks and Binarized Networks

Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been adopted in many systems because of their higher classification speed. However, although they may be characterized by better accuracy, larger DNNs require significant energy and area, thereby limiting their wide adoption. The energy consumption of DNNs is driven by both memory accesses and computation. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), as a trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption, can achieve great energy reduction, and have good accuracy for large DNNs due to its regularization effect. However, BNNs show poor accuracy when a smaller DNN configuration is adopted. In this paper, we propose a new DNN model, LightNN, which replaces the multiplications to one shift or a constrained number of shifts and adds. For a fixed DNN configuration, LightNNs have better accuracy at a slight energy increase than BNNs, yet are more energy efficient with only slightly less accuracy than conventional DNNs. Therefore, LightNNs provide more options for hardware designers to make trade-offs between accuracy and energy. Moreover, for large DNN configurations, LightNNs have a regularization effect, making them better in accuracy than conventional DNNs. These conclusions are verified by experiment using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for different DNN configurations.
