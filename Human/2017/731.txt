PRSP: A Plugin-based Framework for RDF Stream Processing

In this paper, we propose a plugin-based framework for RDF stream processing named PRSP. Within this framework, we can employ SPARQL query engines to process C-SPARQL queries with maintaining the high performance of those engines in a simple way. Taking advantage of PRSP, we can process large-scale RDF streams in a distributed context via distributed SPARQL engines. Besides, we can evaluate the performance and correctness of existing SPARQL query engines in handling RDF streams in a united way, which amends the evaluation of them ranging from static RDF (i.e., RDF graph) to dynamic RDF (i.e., RDF stream). Finally, within PRSP, we experimently evaluate the correctness and the performance on YABench. The experiments show that PRSP can still maintain the high performance of those engines in RDF stream processing although there are some slight differences among them.
