A new class of permutation trinomials constructed from Niho exponents

Permutation polynomials over finite fields are an interesting subject due to their important applications in the areas of mathematics and engineering. In this paper we investigate the trinomial $f(x)=x^{(p-1)q+1}+x^{pq}-x^{q+(p-1)}$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $q=p^k$ with $k$ being a positive integer. It is shown that when $p=3$ or $5$, $f(x)$ is a permutation trinomial of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ if and only if $k$ is even. This property is also true for more general class of polynomials $g(x)=x^{(q+1)l+(p-1)q+1}+x^{(q+1)l+pq}-x^{(q+1)l+q+(p-1)}$, where $l$ is a nonnegative integer and $\gcd(2l+p,q-1)=1$. Moreover, we also show that for $p=5$ the permutation trinomials $f(x)$ proposed here are new in the sense that they are not multiplicative equivalent to previously known ones of similar form.
