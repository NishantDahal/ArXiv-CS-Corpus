Automatic Music Highlight Extraction using Convolutional Recurrent Attention Networks

Music highlights are valuable contents for music services. Most methods focused on low-level signal features. We propose a method for extracting highlights using high-level features from convolutional recurrent attention networks (CRAN). CRAN utilizes convolution and recurrent layers for sequential learning with an attention mechanism. The attention allows CRAN to capture significant snippets for distinguishing between genres, thus being used as a high-level feature. CRAN was evaluated on over 32,000 popular tracks in Korea for two months. Experimental results show our method outperforms three baseline methods through quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Also, we analyze the effects of attention and sequence information on performance.
