Comparison Study between NOMA and SCMA

In this paper, the performance and system complexity of the candidate multiple access (MA) techniques for the next generation of cellular systems, namely, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) (in this paper, we consider power domain MA as NOMA) and sparse code multiple access (SCMA), are investigated. To this end, for each MA technique, a resource allocation problem considering heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNet) is formulated. We apply successive convex approximation (SCA) method to each problem and obtain their solutions. The simulation results show that SCMA-based system achieves better performance than NOMA-based one at the cost of more complexity.
