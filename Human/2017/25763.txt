Population-based Respiratory 4D Motion Atlas Construction and its Application for VR Simulations of Liver Punctures

Virtual reality (VR) training simulators of liver needle insertion in the hepatic area of breathing virtual patients currently need 4D data acquisitions as a prerequisite. Here, first a population-based breathing virtual patient 4D atlas can be built and second the requirement of a dose-relevant or expensive acquisition of a 4D data set for a new static 3D patient can be mitigated by warping the mean atlas motion. The breakthrough contribution of this work is the construction and reuse of population-based learned 4D motion models.
