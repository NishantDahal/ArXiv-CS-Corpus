Gauss-Legendre Sampling on the Rotation Group

We propose a Gauss-Legendre quadrature based sampling on the rotation group for the representation of a band-limited signal such that the Fourier transform (FT) of a signal can be exactly computed from its samples. Our figure of merit is the sampling efficiency, which is defined as a ratio of the degrees of freedom required to represent a band-limited signal in harmonic domain to the number of samples required to accurately compute the FT. The proposed sampling scheme is asymptotically as efficient as the most efficient scheme developed very recently. For the computation of FT and inverse FT, we also develop fast algorithms of complexity similar to the complexity attained by the fast algorithms for the existing sampling schemes. The developed algorithms are stable, accurate and do not have any pre-computation requirements. We also analyse the computation time and numerical accuracy of the proposed algorithms and show, through numerical experiments, that the proposed Fourier transforms are accurate with errors on the order of numerical precision.
