An Extended Analytic Model for the Heating of Bondwires

We present an extended analytic formula for the calculation of the temperature profile along a bondwire embedded in a package. The resulting closed formula is built by coupling the heat transfer equations of the bondwire and the surrounding moulding compound by means of auxiliary variables that stem from an \emph{ad-hoc} linearisation and mediate the wire-mould thermal interaction. The model, which corrects typical simplifications in previously introduced analytic models, is also optimised against carefully taken experimental samples representing fusing events of bondwires within real packages.
