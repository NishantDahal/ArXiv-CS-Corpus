Integrating Boundary and Center Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking with Aspect Ratio Variation

The aspect ratio variation frequently appears in visual tracking and has a severe influence on performance. Although many correlation filter (CF)-based trackers have also been suggested for scale adaptive tracking, few studies have been given to handle the aspect ratio variation for CF trackers. In this paper, we make the first attempt to address this issue by introducing a family of 1D boundary CFs to localize the left, right, top, and bottom boundaries in videos. This allows us cope with the aspect ratio variation flexibly during tracking. Specifically, we present a novel tracking model to integrate 1D Boundary and 2D Center CFs (IBCCF) where boundary and center filters are enforced by a near-orthogonality regularization term. To optimize our IBCCF model, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on several datasets show that IBCCF can effectively handle aspect ratio variation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.
