What Aspects of Mobile Ads Do Users Care About? An Empirical Study of Mobile In-app Ad Reviews

In the mobile app ecosystem, developers receive ad revenue by placing ads in their apps and releasing them for free. While there is evidence that users do not like ads, we do not know what are the aspects of ads that users dislike nor if they dislike certain aspects of ads more than others. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the different topics of ad related complaints from users. In order to do this, we investigated app reviews that users gave for apps in the app store that were about ads. We manually examined a random sample set of 400 ad reviews to identify ad complaint topics. We found that most ad complaints were about user interface (UI) related topics and three topics were brought up the most often: the frequency with which ads were displayed, the timing of when ads were displayed, and the location of the displayed ads. Our results provide actionable information to software developers regarding the aspects of ads that are most likely to be complained about by users in their reviews.
