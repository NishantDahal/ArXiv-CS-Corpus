C-ITS Deployment in Europe - Current Status and Outlook

Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) refers to applications using vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications at a carrier frequency of 5.9 GHz to increase road traffic safety and road traffic efficiency in Europe (a.k.a. connected vehicle technology in the US). This article will shed some light on the current status of C-ITS in Europe and what is left before deployment can commence in 2019 as announced by C2C-CC. Even though there is an immense activity for the launch of C-ITS in Europe, the automotive industry is also planning for the future.
