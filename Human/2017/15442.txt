Intent Communication between Autonomous Vehicles and Pedestrians

When pedestrians encounter vehicles, they typically stop and wait for a signal from the driver to either cross or wait. What happens when the car is autonomous and there isn't a human driver to signal them? This paper seeks to address this issue with an intent communication system (ICS) that acts in place of a human driver. This intent system has been developed to take into account the psychology behind what pedestrians are familiar with and what they expect from machines. The system integrates those expectations into the design of physical systems and mathematical algorithms. The goal of the system is to ensure that communication is simple, yet effective without leaving pedestrians with a sense of distrust in autonomous vehicles. To validate the ICS, two types of experiments have been run: field tests with an autonomous vehicle to determine how humans actually interact with the ICS and simulations to account for multiple potential behaviors.The results from both experiments show that humans react positively and more predictably when the intent of the vehicle is communicated compared to when the intent of the vehicle is unknown. In particular, the results from the simulation specifically showed a 142 percent difference between the pedestrian's trust in the vehicle's actions when the ICS is enabled and the pedestrian has prior knowledge of the vehicle than when the ICS is not enabled and the pedestrian having no prior knowledge of the vehicle.
