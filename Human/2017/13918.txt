Multiantenna Quantum Backscatter Communications

Quantum illumination (QI) is a revolutionary photonic quantum sensing paradigm that enhances the sensitivity of photodetection in noisy and lossy environments. The QI concept has been recently used to propose a quantum backscatter communication (QBC), with the aim of increasing the receiver sensitivity beyond the limits of its classical counterpart. One of the practical challenges in microwave QI is the slow rate at which the entangled microwave modes can be generated. Here, we propose to mitigate this problem by using a multiple-input multiple-output antenna system to synthetically increase the number of efficiently-distinguishable modes in the QBC context.
