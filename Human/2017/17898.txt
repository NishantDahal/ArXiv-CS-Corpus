Satisfiability Modulo Theory based Methodology for Floorplanning in VLSI Circuits

This paper proposes a Satisfiability Modulo Theory based formulation for floorplanning in VLSI circuits. The proposed approach allows a number of fixed blocks to be placed within a layout region without overlapping and at the same time minimizing the area of the layout region. The proposed approach is extended to allow a number of fixed blocks with ability to rotate and flexible blocks (with variable width and height) to be placed within a layout without overlap. Our target in all cases is reduction in area occupied on a chip which is of vital importance in obtaining a good circuit design. Satisfiability Modulo Theory combines the problem of Boolean satisfiability with domains such as convex optimization. Satisfiability Modulo Theory provides a richer modeling language than is possible with pure Boolean SAT formulas. We have conducted our experiments on MCNC and GSRC benchmark circuits to calculate the total area occupied, amount of deadspace and the total CPU time consumed while placing the blocks without overlapping. The results obtained shows clearly that the amount of dead space or wasted space is reduced if rotation is applied to the blocks.
