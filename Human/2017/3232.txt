Game of Power Allocation on Networks

This paper develops a distributed resource allocation game to study countries' pursuit of targets such as self-survival in the networked international environment. The contributions are two. First, the game formalizes countries' power allocation behaviors which fall into the broad category of humans resource allocation behaviors. Second, the game presents a new technical problem, and establishes pure strategy Nash equilibrium existence.
