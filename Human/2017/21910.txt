Integrating Over Sea Radio Channel for Sea Turtles Localization in the Indian Ocean

This paper deals with the modeling of over sea radio channel with the aim of establishing sea turtle localization off the coast of Reunion Island but also on Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel. In order to model this radio channel, we are making a measurement protocol. In a first approach, measurements of turtle trajectory were done over land and finally it will be conducted over sea. We have scheduled an over sea measurement campaign in the middle of June. This paper shows a signal cross correlation technique used to characterize the over sea propagation channel.
