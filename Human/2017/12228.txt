Relay-Assisted Mixed FSO/RF Systems over Málaga-$\mathcal{M}$ and $κ$-$μ$ Shadowed Fading Channels

This letter presents a unified analytical framework for relay-assisted mixed FSO/RF transmission. In addition to accounting for different FSO detection techniques, the mathematical model offers a twofold unification of mixed FSO/RF systems by considering mixed Málaga-$\mathcal{M}$/$κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading, which includes as special cases nearly all linear turbulence/fading models adopted in the open literature.
