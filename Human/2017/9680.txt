Robust reputation-based ranking on multipartite rating networks

The spread of online reviews, ratings and opinions and its growing influence on people's behavior and decisions boosted the interest to extract meaningful information from this data deluge. Hence, crowdsourced ratings of products and services gained a critical role in business, governments, and others. We propose a new reputation-based ranking system utilizing multipartite rating subnetworks, that clusters users by their similarities, using Kolmogorov complexity. Our system is novel in that it reflects a diversity of opinions/preferences by assigning possibly distinct rankings, for the same item, for different groups of users. We prove the convergence and efficiency of the system and show that it copes better with spamming/spurious users, and it is more robust to attacks than state-of-the-art approaches.
