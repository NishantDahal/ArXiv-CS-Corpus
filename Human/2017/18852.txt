Throughput Optimal Decentralized Scheduling of Multi-Hop Networks with End-to-End Deadline Constraints: II Wireless Networks with Interference

Consider a multihop wireless network serving multiple flows in which wireless link interference constraints are described by a link interference graph. For such a network, we design routing-scheduling policies that maximize the end-to-end timely throughput of the network. Timely throughput of a flow $f$ is defined as the average rate at which packets of flow $f$ reach their destination node $d_f$ within their deadline.
  Our policy has several surprising characteristics. Firstly, we show that the optimal routing-scheduling decision for an individual packet that is present at a wireless node $i\in V$ is solely a function of its location, and "age". Thus, a wireless node $i$ does not require the knowledge of the "global" network state in order to maximize the timely throughput. We notice that in comparison, under the backpressure routing policy, a node $i$ requires only the knowledge of its neighbours queue lengths in order to guarantee maximal stability, and hence is decentralized. The key difference arises due to the fact that in our set-up the packets loose their utility once their "age" has crossed their deadline, thus making the task of optimizing timely throughput much more challenging than that of ensuring network stability. Of course, due to this key difference, the decision process involved in maximizing the timely throughput is also much more complex than that involved in ensuring network-wide queue stabilization. In view of this, our results are somewhat surprising.
