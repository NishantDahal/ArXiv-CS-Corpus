Social media marketing analytics : a multicultural approach applied to the beauty \& cosmetic sector

We present in this paper a multicultural approach to social media marketing analytics, applied in two Facebook brand pages: French (individualistic culture, the country home of the brand) versus Saudi Arabian (collectivistic culture, one of its country hosts), which are published by an internationalbeauty \& cosmetics firm. Using social network analysis and content analysis, we identify the most popular posts and the most influential users within these two brand pages and highlight the different communities emerging from brand and users interactions. These communities seem to be culture oriented when they are constructed around socialization branded posts and product-line oriented when advertising branded posts are concerned.
