A Calculus of Truly Concurrent Mobile Processes

We make a mixture of Milner's $π$-calculus and our previous work on truly concurrent process algebra, which is called $π_{tc}$. We introduce syntax and semantics of $π_{tc}$, its properties based on strongly truly concurrent bisimilarities. Also, we include an axiomatization of $π_{tc}$. $π_{tc}$ can be used as a formal tool in verifying mobile systems in a truly concurrent flavor.
