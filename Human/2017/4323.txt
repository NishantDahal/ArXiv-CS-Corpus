Modeling and Analysis of Non-Orthogonal MBMS Transmission in Heterogeneous Networks

Broadcasting/multicasting is an efficient mechanism for multimedia communications due to its high spectrum efficiency, which achieves point-to-multipoint transmission on the same radio resources. To satisfy the increasing demands for multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), we present a power domain non-orthogonal MBMS transmission scheme in a K-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet). Firstly, the system model, usage scenarios, and fundamentals of the presented scheme are discussed. Next, a tractable framework is developed to analyse the performance of non-orthogonal MBMS transmission, by using stochastic geometry. Based on this framework, the analytical expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability, average number of served users, and sum rate are derived. Furthermore, synchronous non-orthogonal MBMS transmission to further improving the system performance is also studied. The results demonstrate that non-orthogonal MBMS transmission can achieve better performance than the conventional one, in which non-orthogonal multirate one can fully utilize channel conditions to achieve a significant rate gain, while non-orthogonal multi-service one can efficiently use power resources to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of high priority users, and also provide services for low priority users simultaneously.
