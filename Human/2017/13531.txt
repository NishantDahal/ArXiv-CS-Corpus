Constructions of Optimal and Near-Optimal Quasi-Complementary Sequence Sets from an Almost Difference Set

Compared with the perfect complementary sequence sets, quasi-complementary sequence sets (QCSSs) can support more users to work in multicarrier CDMA communications. A near-optimal periodic QCSS is constructed in this paper by using an optimal quaternary sequence set and an almost difference set. With the change of the values of parameters in the almost difference set, the near-optimal QCSS can become asymptotically optimal and the number of users supported by the subcarrier channels in CDMA system has an exponential growth.
