A Straightforward Method to Judge the Completeness of a Polymorphic Gate Set

Polymorphic circuits are a special kind of circuits which possess some different build-in functions and these functions are activated by environment parameters, like light and VDD. Some theories have been proposed to guide the design of polymorphic circuits, including the definition of complete polymorphic gate sets and algorithms to judge the completeness of a polymorphic gate set.
  However, the previous algorithms have to enumerate all the polymorphic signals for judging the completeness of a polymorphic gate set, and it is not easy to be conducted manually. In this paper, a straightforward method is proposed to judge the completeness of a polymorphic gate set. And the correctness of the straightforward method is proved theoretically. Some examples are given to show that the proposed method could be conducted step by step. Its actual computing cost is usually low, and it is suitable for manual operation.
