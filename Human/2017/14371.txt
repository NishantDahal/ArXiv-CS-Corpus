A Policy-Aware Model for Intelligent Transportation Systems

Recent advancements in the field of smart machine-to-machine (M2M) communications impose the necessity to improve the service delivery by enforcing appropriate security rules. Due to the large number of connected devices, the criticality of the M2M applications, and the network stability weaknesses, we need to consider and analyse the security aspects and establish a flexible policy-aware architecture. This paper explores the relevant architectural challenges in this environment and proposes a Policy-Aware smart M2M Architecture (PAArc) based on ETSI M2M communications functional architecture. We explore the policy-based management aspects to improve the security of the M2M components and services and to mitigate the security concerns that arise by evaluating an Intelligent Transportation System use case. It is shown that the policy enforcement enables enhanced security management capabilities, increased agility, and better service levels in the field of smart M2M communications.
