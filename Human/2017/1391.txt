Generic and Effective Specification of Structural Test Objectives

While a wide range of different, sometimes heterogeneous test coverage criteria have been proposed, there exists no generic formalism to describe them, and available test automation tools usually support only a small subset of them. We introduce a unified specification language, called HTOL, providing a powerful generic mechanism to define test objectives, which permits encoding numerous existing criteria and supporting them in a unified way. HTOL comes with a formal semantics and can express complex requirements over several executions (using a novel notion of hyperlabels), as well as alternative requirements or requirements over a whole program execution. A novel classification of a large class of existing criteria is proposed. Finally, a coverage measurement tool for HTOL objectives has been implemented. Initial experiments suggest that the proposed approach is both efficient and practical.
