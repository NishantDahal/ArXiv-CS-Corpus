Cooperative spectrum sensing with enhanced energy detection under GAUSSIAN noise uncertainty in cognitive radios

This paper presents optimization issues of energy detection (ED) thresholds in cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) with regard to general Gaussian noise. Enhanced ED thresholds are proposed to overcome sensitivity of multiple noise uncertainty. Two-steps decision pattern and convex samples thresholds have been put forward under Gaussian noise uncertainty. Through deriving the probability of detection (Pd) and the probability of false alarm (Pf ) for independent and identical distribution (i.i.d.) SUs, we obtain lower total error rate (Qe) with proposed ED thresholds at low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) condition. Furthermore, simulation results show that proposed schemes outperform most other noise uncertainty plans.
