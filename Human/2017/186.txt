A new lower bound for reset threshold of synchronizing automata with sink state

We present a new series of examples of binary slowly synchronizing automata with sink state. The reset threshold of the $n$-state automaton in this series is $\frac{n^2}{4}+2n-9$. This improves on the previously known lower bound for the maximum reset threshold of binary synchronizing $n$-state automata with sink state.
