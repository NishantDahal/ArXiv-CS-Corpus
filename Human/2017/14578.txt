Quantum Spectral Clustering through a Biased Phase Estimation Algorithm

In this brief paper, we go through the theoretical steps of the spectral clustering on quantum computers by employing the phase estimation and the amplitude amplification algorithms. We discuss circuit designs for each step and show how to obtain the clustering solution from the output state. In addition, we introduce a biased version of the phase estimation algorithm which significantly speeds up the amplitude amplification process. The complexity of the whole process is analyzed: it is shown that when the circuit representation of a data matrix of order $N$ is produced through an ancilla based circuit in which the matrix is written as a sum of $L$ number of Householder matrices; the computational complexity is bounded by $O(2^mLN)$ number of quantum gates. Here, $m$ represents the number of qubits (e.g., 6) involved in the phase register of the phase estimation algorithm.
