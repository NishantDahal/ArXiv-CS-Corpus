Detecting and monitoring foodborne illness outbreaks: Twitter communications and the 2015 U.S. Salmonella outbreak linked to imported cucumbers

This research uses Twitter, as a social media device, to track communications related to the 2015 U.S. foodborne illness outbreak linked to Salmonella in imported cucumbers from Mexico. The relevant Twitter data are analyzed in light of the timeline of the official announcements made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The largest number of registered tweets is associated with the period immediately following the CDC initial announcement and the official release of the first recall of cucumbers.
