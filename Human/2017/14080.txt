On the steganographic image based approach to PDF files protection

Digital images can be copied without authorization and have to be protected. Two schemes for watermarking images in PDF document were considered. Both schemes include a converter to extract images from PDF pages and return the protected images back. Frequency and spatial domain embedding were used for hiding a message presented by a binary pattern. We considered visible and invisible watermarking and found that spatial domain LSB technique can be more preferable than frequency embedding using DWT.
