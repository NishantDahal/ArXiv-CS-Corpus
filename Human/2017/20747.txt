Marine Wireless Big Data: Efficient Transmission, Related Applications, and Challenges

The vast volume of marine wireless sampling data and its continuously explosive growth herald the coming of the era of marine wireless big data. Two challenges imposed by these data are how to fast, reliably, and sustainably deliver them in extremely hostile marine environments and how to apply them after collection. In this article, we first propose an architecture of heterogeneous marine networks that flexibly exploits the existing underwater wireless techniques as a potential solution for fast data transmission. We then investigate the possibilities of and develop the schemes for energy-efficient and reliable undersea transmission without or slightly with data rate reduction. After discussing the data transmission, we summarize the possible applications of the collected big data and particularly focus on the problems of applying these data in sea-surface object detection and marine object recognition. Open issues and challenges that need to be further explored regarding transmission and detection/recognition are also discussed in the article.
