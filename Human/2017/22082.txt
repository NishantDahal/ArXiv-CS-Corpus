Seeded Graph Matching: Efficient Algorithms and Theoretical Guarantees

In this paper, a new information theoretic framework for graph matching is introduced. Using this framework, the graph isomorphism and seeded graph matching problems are studied. The maximum degree algorithm for graph isomorphism is analyzed and sufficient conditions for successful matching are rederived using type analysis. Furthermore, a new seeded matching algorithm with polynomial time complexity is introduced. The algorithm uses `typicality matching' and techniques from point-to-point communications for reliable matching. Assuming an Erdos-Renyi model on the correlated graph pair, it is shown that successful matching is guaranteed when the number of seeds grows logarithmically with the number of vertices in the graphs. The logarithmic coefficient is shown to be inversely proportional to the mutual information between the edge variables in the two graphs.
