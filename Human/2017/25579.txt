Weaving Multi-scale Context for Single Shot Detector

Aggregating context information from multiple scales has been proved to be effective for improving accuracy of Single Shot Detectors (SSDs) on object detection. However, existing multi-scale context fusion techniques are computationally expensive, which unfavorably diminishes the advantageous speed of SSD. In this work, we propose a novel network topology, called WeaveNet, that can efficiently fuse multi-scale information and boost the detection accuracy with negligible extra cost. The proposed WeaveNet iteratively weaves context information from adjacent scales together to enable more sophisticated context reasoning while maintaining fast speed. Built by stacking light-weight blocks, WeaveNet is easy to train without requiring batch normalization and can be further accelerated by our proposed architecture simplification. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks show signification performance boost brought by WeaveNet. For 320x320 input of batch size = 8, WeaveNet reaches 79.5% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 test in 101 fps with only 4 fps extra cost, and further improves to 79.7% mAP with more iterations.
