Resource Management in Cloud Computing: Classification and Taxonomy

Cloud Computing is a new era of remote computing / Internet based computing where one can access their personal resources easily from any computer through Internet. Cloud delivers computing as a utility as it is available to the cloud consumers on demand. It is a simple pay-per-use consumer-provider service model. It contains large number of shared resources. So Resource Management is always a major issue in cloud computing like any other computing paradigm. Due to the availability of finite resources it is very challenging for cloud providers to provide all the requested resources. From the cloud providers perspective cloud resources must be allocated in a fair and efficient manner. Research Survey is not available from the perspective of resource management as a process in cloud computing. So this research paper provides a detailed sequential view / steps on resource management in cloud computing. Firstly this research paper classifies various resources in cloud computing. It also gives taxonomy on resource management in cloud computing through which one can do further research. Lastly comparisons on various resource management algorithms has been presented.
