Simplified Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks: part I

We present five variants of the standard Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks by uniformly reducing blocks of adaptive parameters in the gating mechanisms. For simplicity, we refer to these models as LSTM1, LSTM2, LSTM3, LSTM4, and LSTM5, respectively. Such parameter-reduced variants enable speeding up data training computations and would be more suitable for implementations onto constrained embedded platforms. We comparatively evaluate and verify our five variant models on the classical MNIST dataset and demonstrate that these variant models are comparable to a standard implementation of the LSTM model while using less number of parameters. Moreover, we observe that in some cases the standard LSTM's accuracy performance will drop after a number of epochs when using the ReLU nonlinearity; in contrast, however, LSTM3, LSTM4 and LSTM5 will retain their performance.
