Intelligent User Interfaces - A Tutorial

IUIs aim to incorporate intelligent automated capabilities in human computer interaction, where the net impact is a human-computer interaction that improves performance or usability in critical ways. It also involves designing and implementing an artificial intelligence (AI) component that effectively leverages human skills and capabilities, so that human performance with an application excels. IUIs embody capabilities that have traditionally been associated more strongly with humans than with computers: how to perceive, interpret, learn, use language, reason, plan, and decide.
