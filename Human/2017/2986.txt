Location and Orientation Optimisation for Spatially Stretched Tripole Arrays Based on Compressive Sensing

The design of sparse spatially stretched tripole arrays is an important but also challenging task and this paper proposes for the very first time efficient solutions to this problem. Unlike for the design of traditional sparse antenna arrays, the developed approaches optimise both the dipole locations and orientations. The novelty of the paper consists in formulating these optimisation problems into a form that can be solved by the proposed compressive sensing and Bayesian compressive sensing based approaches. The performance of the developed approaches is validated and it is shown that accurate approximation of a reference response can be achieved with a 67% reduction in the number of dipoles required as compared to an equivalent uniform spatially stretched tripole array, leading to a significant reduction in the cost associated with the resulting arrays.
