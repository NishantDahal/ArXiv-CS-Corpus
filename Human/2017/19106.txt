A parameterized activation function for learning fuzzy logic operations in deep neural networks

We present a deep learning architecture for learning fuzzy logic expressions. Our model uses an innovative, parameterized, differentiable activation function that can learn a number of logical operations by gradient descent. This activation function allows a neural network to determine the relationships between its input variables and provides insight into the logical significance of learned network parameters. We provide a theoretical basis for this parameterization and demonstrate its effectiveness and utility by successfully applying our model to five classification problems from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
