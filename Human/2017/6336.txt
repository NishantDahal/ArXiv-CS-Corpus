A cost-effective isogeometric approach for composite plates based on a stress recovery procedure

This paper introduces a cost-effective strategy to simulate the behavior of laminated plates by means of isogeometric 3D solid elements. Exploiting the high continuity of spline functions and their properties, a proper out-of-plane stress state is recovered from a coarse displacement solution using a post-processing step based on the enforcement of equilibrium in strong form. Appealing results are obtained and the method is shown to be particularly Peffective on slender composite stacks with a large number of layers.
