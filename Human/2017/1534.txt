Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs through Reach and Distance Diffusion

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is an indispensable tool when there are few labeled entities and many unlabeled entities for which we want to predict labels. With graph-based methods, entities correspond to nodes in a graph and edges represent strong relations. At the heart of SSL algorithms is the specification of a dense {\em kernel} of pairwise affinity values from the graph structure. A learning algorithm is then trained on the kernel together with labeled entities. The most popular kernels are {\em spectral} and include the highly scalable "symmetric" Laplacian methods, that compute a soft labels using Jacobi iterations, and "asymmetric" methods including Personalized Page Rank (PPR) which use short random walks and apply with directed relations, such as like, follow, or hyperlinks.
  We introduce {\em Reach diffusion} and {\em Distance diffusion} kernels that build on powerful social and economic models of centrality and influence in networks and capture the directed pairwise relations that underline social influence. Inspired by the success of social influence as an alternative to spectral centrality such as Page Rank, we explore SSL with our kernels and develop highly scalable algorithms for parameter setting, label learning, and sampling. We perform preliminary experiments that demonstrate the properties and potential of our kernels.
