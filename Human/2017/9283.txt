Multi-Scale Spatially Weighted Local Histograms in O(1)

Weighting pixel contribution considering its location is a key feature in many fundamental image processing tasks including filtering, object modeling and distance matching. Several techniques have been proposed that incorporate Spatial information to increase the accuracy and boost the performance of detection, tracking and recognition systems at the cost of speed. But, it is still not clear how to efficiently ex- tract weighted local histograms in constant time using integral histogram. This paper presents a novel algorithm to compute accurately multi-scale Spatially weighted local histograms in constant time using Weighted Integral Histogram (SWIH) for fast search. We applied our spatially weighted integral histogram approach for fast tracking and obtained more accurate and robust target localization result in comparison with using plain histogram.
