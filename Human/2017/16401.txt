A Clinical and Finite Elements Study of Stress Urinary Incontinence in Women Using Fluid-Structure Interactions

Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or urine leakage from urethra occurs due to an increase in abdominal pressure resulting from stress like a cough or jumping height. SUI is more frequent among post-menopausal women. In the absence of bladder contraction, vesical pressure exceeds from urethral pressure leading to urine leakage. Despite a large number of patients diagnosed with this problem, few studies have investigated its function and mechanics. The main goal of this study is to model bladder and urethra computationally under an external pressure like sneezing. Finite Element Method and Fluid-Structure Interactions are utilized for simulation. Linear mechanical properties assigned to the bladder and urethra and pressure boundary conditions are indispensable in this model. The results show good accordance between the clinical data and predicted values of the computational models, such as the pressure at the center of the bladder. This indicates that numerical methods and simplified physics of biological systems like inferior urinary tract are helpful to achieve the results similar to clinical results, in order to investigate pathological conditions.
