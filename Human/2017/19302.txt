Bounding Cache Miss Costs of Multithreaded Computations Under General Schedulers

We analyze the caching overhead incurred by a class of multithreaded algorithms when scheduled by an arbitrary scheduler. We obtain bounds that match or improve upon the well-known $O(Q+S \cdot (M/B))$ caching cost for the randomized work stealing (RWS) scheduler, where $S$ is the number of steals, $Q$ is the sequential caching cost, and $M$ and $B$ are the cache size and block (or cache line) size respectively.
