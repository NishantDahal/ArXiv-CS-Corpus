Drought Stress Classification using 3D Plant Models

Quantification of physiological changes in plants can capture different drought mechanisms and assist in selection of tolerant varieties in a high throughput manner. In this context, an accurate 3D model of plant canopy provides a reliable representation for drought stress characterization in contrast to using 2D images. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline including 3D reconstruction, segmentation and feature extraction, leveraging deep neural networks at various stages, for drought stress study. To overcome the high degree of self-similarities and self-occlusions in plant canopy, prior knowledge of leaf shape based on features from deep siamese network are used to construct an accurate 3D model using structure from motion on wheat plants. The drought stress is characterized with a deep network based feature aggregation. We compare the proposed methodology on several descriptors, and show that the network outperforms conventional methods.
