Shape-Color Differential Moment Invariants under Affine Transformations

We propose the general construction formula of shape-color primitives by using partial differentials of each color channel in this paper. By using all kinds of shape-color primitives, shape-color differential moment invariants can be constructed very easily, which are invariant to the shape affine and color affine transforms. 50 instances of SCDMIs are obtained finally. In experiments, several commonly used color descriptors and SCDMIs are used in image classification and retrieval of color images, respectively. By comparing the experimental results, we find that SCDMIs get better results.
