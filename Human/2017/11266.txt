Software Model Checking: A Promising Approach to Verify Mobile App Security

In this position paper we advocate software model checking as a technique suitable for security analysis of mobile apps. Our recommendation is based on promising results that we achieved on analysing app collusion in the context of the Android operating system. Broadly speaking, app collusion appears when, in performing a threat, several apps are working together, i.e., they exchange information which they could not obtain on their own. In this context, we developed the Kandroid tool, which provides an encoding of the Android/Smali code semantics within the K framework. Kandroid allows for software model checking of Android APK files. Though our experience so far is limited to collusion, we believe the approach to be applicable to further security properties as well as other mobile operating systems.
