Deep Learning with Lung Segmentation and Bone Shadow Exclusion Techniques for Chest X-Ray Analysis of Lung Cancer

The recent progress of computing, machine learning, and especially deep learning, for image recognition brings a meaningful effect for automatic detection of various diseases from chest X-ray images (CXRs). Here efficiency of lung segmentation and bone shadow exclusion techniques is demonstrated for analysis of 2D CXRs by deep learning approach to help radiologists identify suspicious lesions and nodules in lung cancer patients. Training and validation was performed on the original JSRT dataset (dataset #01), BSE-JSRT dataset, i.e. the same JSRT dataset, but without clavicle and rib shadows (dataset #02), original JSRT dataset after segmentation (dataset #03), and BSE-JSRT dataset after segmentation (dataset #04). The results demonstrate the high efficiency and usefulness of the considered pre-processing techniques in the simplified configuration even. The pre-processed dataset without bones (dataset #02) demonstrates the much better accuracy and loss results in comparison to the other pre-processed datasets after lung segmentation (datasets #02 and #03).
