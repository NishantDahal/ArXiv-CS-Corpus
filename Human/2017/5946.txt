Quantum codes derived from cyclic codes

In this note, we present a construction of new nonbinary quantum codes with good parameters. These codes are obtained by applying the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. In order to do this, we show the existence of (classical) cyclic codes whose defining set consists of only one cyclotomic coset containing at least two consecutive integers.
