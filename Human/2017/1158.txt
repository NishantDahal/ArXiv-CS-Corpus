Citation indices and dimensional homogeneity

The importance of dimensional analysis and dimensional homogeneity in bibliometric studies is always overlooked. In this paper, we look at this issue systematically and show that most h-type indices have the dimensions of [P], where [P] is the basic dimensional unit in bibliometrics which is the unit publication or paper. The newly introduced Euclidean index, based on the Euclidean length of the citation vector has the dimensions [P3/2]. An empirical example is used to illustrate the concepts.
