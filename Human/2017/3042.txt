Normative theory of visual receptive fields

This article gives an overview of a normative computational theory of visual receptive fields, by which idealized functional models of early spatial, spatio-chromatic and spatio-temporal receptive fields can be derived in an axiomatic way based on structural properties of the environment in combination with assumptions about the internal structure of a vision system to guarantee consistent handling of image representations over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Interestingly, this theory leads to predictions about visual receptive field shapes with qualitatively very good similarity to biological receptive fields measured in the retina, the LGN and the primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals.
