Proceedings Sixth Workshop on Synthesis

The SYNT workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in the broad area of synthesis of computing systems. The goal is to foster the development of frontier techniques in automating the development of computing system. Contributions of interest include algorithms, complexity and decidability analysis, as well as reproducible heuristics, implemented tools, and experimental evaluation. Application domains include software, hardware, embedded, and cyber-physical systems. Computation models include functional, reactive, hybrid and timed systems. Identifying, formalizing, and evaluating synthesis in particular application domains is encouraged. 
  The sixth iteration of the workshop took place in Heidelberg, Germany. It was co-located with the 29th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification. The workshop included four contributed talks, four invited talks, and reports on the Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (SyGuS) and the Reactive Synthesis Competition (SYNTCOMP).
