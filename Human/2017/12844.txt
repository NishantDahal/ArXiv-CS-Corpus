Safety Requirement Specifications for Connected Vehicles

In the coming years, transportation system will be revamped in a manner that there will be more intelligent and autonomous vehicle phenomenon around us such as smart cars, auto driving system, etc. Some of automotive industries are already producing smart cars. However, the main concern of this paper is on the infrastructure for connected vehicles, which can support such intelligent transportation. Current transportation system lacks proper infrastructure to support connected vehicles. Hence, in this article, we have surveyed and analyzed the current transportation system in developed and developing countries. In contrast, we are going to introduce secure intelligent transportation (roadside) infrastructure that is user centric (Driver, Autonomous driver etc.) for connected vehicles. In this paper we present the basic requirements of safety engineering infrastructure of roadside infrastructure in ITS for connected vehicles. Connected vehicles has network infrastructure to communicate with vehicle-to-vehicle (V-to-V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-to-I), lane correction system, and traffic information system etc. The connected vehicle is a good model for learning demands of infrastructure for ITS process because the system having a lot of use-cases and we must understand relationship between public institutions, people, companies in order to proceed ITS System.
