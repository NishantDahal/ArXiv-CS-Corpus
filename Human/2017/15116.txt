Two-stream Flow-guided Convolutional Attention Networks for Action Recognition

This paper proposes a two-stream flow-guided convolutional attention networks for action recognition in videos. The central idea is that optical flows, when properly compensated for the camera motion, can be used to guide attention to the human foreground. We thus develop cross-link layers from the temporal network (trained on flows) to the spatial network (trained on RGB frames). These cross-link layers guide the spatial-stream to pay more attention to the human foreground areas and be less affected by background clutter. We obtain promising performances with our approach on the UCF101, HMDB51 and Hollywood2 datasets.
