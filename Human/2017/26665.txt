Lattice Codes Achieve the Capacity of Common Message Gaussian Broadcast Channels with Coded Side Information

Lattices possess elegant mathematical properties which have been previously used in the literature to show that structured codes can be efficient in a variety of communication scenarios, including coding for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, dirty-paper channel, Wyner-Ziv coding, coding for relay networks and so forth. We consider the family of single-transmitter multiple-receiver Gaussian channels where the source transmits a set of common messages to all the receivers (multicast scenario), and each receiver has 'coded side information', i.e., prior information in the form of linear combinations of the messages. This channel model is motivated by applications to multi-terminal networks where the nodes may have access to coded versions of the messages from previous signal hops or through orthogonal channels. The capacity of this channel is known and follows from the work of Tuncel (2006), which is based on random coding arguments. In this paper, following the approach of Erez and Zamir, we design lattice codes for this family of channels when the source messages are symbols from a finite field 'Fp' of prime size. Our coding scheme utilizes Construction A lattices designed over the same prime field 'Fp', and uses algebraic binning at the decoders to expurgate the channel code and obtain good lattice subcodes, for every possible set of linear combinations available as side information. The achievable rate of our coding scheme is a function of the size 'p' of underlying prime field, and approaches the capacity as 'p' tends to infinity.
