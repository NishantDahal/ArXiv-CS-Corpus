Decoupled molecules with binding polynomials of bidegree (n,2)

We present a result on the number of decoupled molecules for systems binding two different types of ligands. In the case of $n$ and $2$ binding sites respectively, we show that, generically, there are $2(n!)^{2}$ decoupled molecules with the same binding polynomial. For molecules with more binding sites for the second ligand, we provide computational results.
