Yet Another Proof of the Entropy Power Inequality

Yet another simple proof of the entropy power inequality is given, which avoids both the integration over a path of Gaussian perturbation and the use of Young's inequality with sharp constant or RÃ©nyi entropies. The proof is based on a simple change of variables, is formally identical in one and several dimensions, and easily settles the equality case.
