Entanglement production by evolution operator

Entanglement production, generated by an evolution operator, is considered. The measure of entanglement production, introduced earlier by one of the authors, is employed. As an illustration, a two-qubit register is studied and the corresponding measure of evolutional entanglement production is calculated. Such two-qubit registers can be realized by atomic systems in a double well or by trapped atoms with two coherent modes.
