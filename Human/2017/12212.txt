On Coded Caching in the Overloaded MISO Broadcast Channel

This work investigates the interplay of coded caching and spatial multiplexing in an overloaded Multiple-Input-Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC), i.e. a system where the number of users is greater than the number of transmitting antennas. On one hand, coded caching uses the aggregate global cache memory of the users to create multicasting opportunities. On the other hand, multiple antennas at the transmitter leverage the available CSIT to transmit multiple streams simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme which combines both the gain derived from coded-caching and spatial multiplexing and outperforms existing schemes in terms of delivery time and CSIT requirement.
