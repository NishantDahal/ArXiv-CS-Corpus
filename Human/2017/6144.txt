Towards Understanding the Impact of Human Mobility on Police Allocation

Motivated by recent findings that human mobility is proxy for crime behavior in big cities and that there is a superlinear relationship between the people's movement and crime, this article aims to evaluate the impact of how these findings influence police allocation. More precisely, we shed light on the differences between an allocation strategy, in which the resources are distributed by clusters of floating population, and conventional allocation strategies, in which the police resources are distributed by an Administrative Area (typically based on resident population). We observed a substantial difference in the distributions of police resources allocated following these strategies, what evidences the imprecision of conventional police allocation methods.
