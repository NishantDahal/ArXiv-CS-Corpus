Fast mixing for Latent Dirichlet allocation

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are ubiquitous in probability theory in general and in machine learning in particular. A Markov chain is devised so that its stationary distribution is some probability distribution of interest. Then one samples from the given distribution by running the Markov chain for a "long time" until it appears to be stationary and then collects the sample. However these chains are often very complex and there are no theoretical guarantees that stationarity is actually reached. In this paper we study the Gibbs sampler of the posterior distribution of a very simple case of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the arguably most well known Bayesian unsupervised learning model for text generation and text classification. It is shown that when the corpus consists of two long documents of equal length $m$ and the vocabulary consists of only two different words, the mixing time is at most of order $m^2\log m$ (which corresponds to $m\log m$ rounds over the corpus). It will be apparent from our analysis that it seems very likely that the mixing time is not much worse in the more relevant case when the number of documents and the size of the vocabulary are also large as long as each word is represented a large number in each document, even though the computations involved may be intractable.
