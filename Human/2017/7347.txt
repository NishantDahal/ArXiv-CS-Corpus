Wireless Powered Dense Cellular Networks: How Many Small Cells Do We Need?

This paper focuses on wireless powered 5G dense cellular networks, where base station (BS) delivers energy to user equipment (UE) via the microwave radiation in sub-6 GHz or millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, and UE uses the harvested energy for uplink information transmission. By addressing the impacts of employing different number of antennas and bandwidths at lower and higher frequencies, we evaluate the amount of harvested energy and throughput in such networks. Based on the derived results, we obtain the required small cell density to achieve an expected level of harvested energy or throughput. Also, we obtain that when the ratio of the number of sub-6 GHz BSs to that of the mmWave BSs is lower than a given threshold, UE harvests more energy from a mmWave BS than a sub-6 GHz BS. We find how many mmWave small cells are needed to perform better than the sub-6 GHz small cells from the perspectives of harvested energy and throughput. Our results reveal that the amount of harvested energy from the mmWave tier can be comparable to the sub-6 GHz counterpart in the dense scenarios. For the same tier scale, mmWave tier can achieve higher throughput. Furthermore, the throughput gap between different mmWave frequencies increases with the mmWave BS density.
