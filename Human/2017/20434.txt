Symbol Erasure Correction Capability of Spread Codes

We consider data transmission over a network where each edge is an erasure channel and where the inner nodes transmit a random linear combination of their incoming information. We distinguish two channel models in this setting, the row and the column erasure channel model. For both models we derive the symbol erasure correction capabilities of spread codes and compare them to other known codes suitable for those models. Furthermore, we explain how to decode these codes in the two channel models and compare their decoding complexities. The results show that, depending on the application and the to-be-optimized aspect, any combination of codes and channel models can be the best choice.
