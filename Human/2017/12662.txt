On Some Exponential Sums Related to the Coulter's Polynomial

In this paper, the formulas of some exponential sums over finite field, related to the Coulter's polynomial, are settled based on the Coulter's theorems on Weil sums, which may have potential application in the construction of linear codes with few weights.
