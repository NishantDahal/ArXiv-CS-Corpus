Grafting for Combinatorial Boolean Model using Frequent Itemset Mining

This paper introduces the combinatorial Boolean model (CBM), which is defined as the class of linear combinations of conjunctions of Boolean attributes. This paper addresses the issue of learning CBM from labeled data. CBM is of high knowledge interpretability but na√Øve learning of it requires exponentially large computation time with respect to data dimension and sample size. To overcome this computational difficulty, we propose an algorithm GRAB (GRAfting for Boolean datasets), which efficiently learns CBM within the $L_1$-regularized loss minimization framework. The key idea of GRAB is to reduce the loss minimization problem to the weighted frequent itemset mining, in which frequent patterns are efficiently computable. We employ benchmark datasets to empirically demonstrate that GRAB is effective in terms of computational efficiency, prediction accuracy and knowledge discovery.
