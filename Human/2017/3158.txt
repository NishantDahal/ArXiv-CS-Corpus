Bandwidth Enhancement in Multimode Polymer Waveguides Using Waveguide Layout for Optical Printed Circuit Boards

Dispersion studies demonstrate that waveguide layout can be used to enhance the bandwidth performance of multimode polymer waveguides for use in board-level optical interconnects, providing >40 GHzxm without the need for any launch conditioning.
