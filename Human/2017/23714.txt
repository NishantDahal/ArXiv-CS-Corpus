User-centric Composable Services: A New Generation of Personal Data Analytics

Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as Neural Network, are widely used in today's applications. However, there is still a big gap between the current ML systems and users' requirements. ML systems focus on improving the performance of models in training, while individual users cares more about response time and expressiveness of the tool. Many existing research and product begin to move computation towards edge devices. Based on the numerical computing system Owl, we propose to build the Zoo system to support construction, compose, and deployment of ML models on edge and local devices.
