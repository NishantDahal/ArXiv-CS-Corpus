Did the Train Reach its Destination: The Complexity of Finding a Witness

Recently, Dohrau et al. studied a zero-player game on switch graphs and proved that deciding the termination of the game is in NP $\cap$ coNP. In this short paper, we show that the search version of this game on switch graphs, i.e., the task of finding a witness of termination (or of non-termination) is in PLS.
