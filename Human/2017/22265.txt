Correlated Eigenvalues Optical Communications

There is a fundamental limit on the capacity of fibre optical communication system (Shannon Limit). This limit can be potentially overcome via using Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexing. Dealing with noises in these systems is one of the most critical parts in implementing a practical system.
  In this paper, we discover and characterize the correlations among the NFT channels. It is demonstrated that the correlation is universal (i.e., independent of types of system noises) and can be exploited to maximize transmission throughput. We propose and experimentally confirm a noise model showing that end-to-end noise can be modeled as the accumulation of noise associated with each segment of optical communication which can be dealt with independently. Also, each point noise can be further decomposed into different components, some of which are more significant (and even dominating) than others. Hence, one can further approximate and simplify the noise model by focusing on the significant component.
