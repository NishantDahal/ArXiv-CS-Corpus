Half-quadratic transportation problems

We present a primal--dual memory efficient algorithm for solving a relaxed version of the general transportation problem. Our approach approximates the original cost function with a differentiable one that is solved as a sequence of weighted quadratic transportation problems. The new formulation allows us to solve differentiable, non-- convex transportation problems.
