Self-Dual Cyclic and Quantum Codes Over Z2^α x (Z2 + uZ2)^β

In this paper we introduce self-dual cyclic and quantum codes over Z2^α x (Z2 + uZ2)^β. We determine the conditions for any Z2Z2[u]-cyclic code to be self-dual, that is, C = C^{\perp}. Since the binary image of a self-orthogonal Z2Z2[u]-linear code is also a self-orthogonal binary linear code, we introduce quantum codes over Z2^α x (Z2 + uZ2)^β. Finally, we present some examples of self-dual cyclic and quantum codes that have good parameters.
