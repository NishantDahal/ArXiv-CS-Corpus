Electronic Prescription System for Pediatricians

This paper presents the development of an electronic prescription system for pediatricians that considered the factors that influence a childs prescription. The system implements a knowledge base which contains drug information and formulary. It allows the pediatrician to have access to the electronic health record of patients before prescription writing. The resulting prescription is marked with verifiable randomly generated prescription ID before it is sent to the dispensing pharmacy and this accounts for the security feature of the prescription system. Microsoft Office Visio 2007, PHP and My SQL database server were used to present and develop the system. Implementation results showed the system is capable of reducing common prescription error as the most informed prescription is being generated for the child electronically.
