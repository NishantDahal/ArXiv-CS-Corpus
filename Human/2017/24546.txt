Uncovering Hierarchical Structure in Social Networks using Isospectral Reductions

We employ the recently developed theory of isospectral network reductions to analyze multi-mode social networks. This procedure allows us to uncover the hierarchical structure of the networks we consider as well as the hierarchical structure of each mode of the network. Additionally, by performing a dynamical analysis of these networks we are able to analyze the evolution of their structure allowing us to find a number of other network features. We apply both of these approaches to the Southern Women Data Set, one of the most studied social networks and demonstrate that these techniques provide new information, which complements previous findings.
