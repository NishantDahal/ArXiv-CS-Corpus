A Novel Receiver Design with Joint Coherent and Non-Coherent Processing

In this paper, we propose a novel splitting receiver, which involves joint processing of coherently and non-coherently received signals. Using a passive RF power splitter, the received signal at each receiver antenna is split into two streams which are then processed by a conventional coherent detection (CD) circuit and a power-detection (PD) circuit, respectively. The streams of the signals from all the receiver antennas are then jointly used for information detection. We show that the splitting receiver creates a three-dimensional received signal space, due to the joint coherent and non-coherent processing. We analyze the achievable rate of a splitting receiver, which shows that the splitting receiver provides a rate gain of $3/2$ compared to either the conventional (CD-based) coherent receiver or the PD-based non-coherent receiver in the high SNR regime. We also analyze the symbol error rate (SER) for practical modulation schemes, which shows that the splitting receiver achieves asymptotic SER reduction by a factor of at least $\sqrt{M}-1$ for $M$-QAM compared to either the conventional (CD-based) coherent receiver or the PD-based non-coherent receiver.
