Generalized Bounds on the Capacity of the Binary-Input Channels

For the class of the memoryless binary-input channels which are not necessarily symmetric, we derive tight bounds on the capacity in terms of the Bhattacharyya parameter. As it turns out, the bounds derived under the symmetric channel assumption in [1] are valid for the general case as well.
