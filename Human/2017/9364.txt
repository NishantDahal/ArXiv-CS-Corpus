Communications for Wearable Devices

Wearable devices are transforming computing and the human-computer interaction and they are a primary means for motion recognition of reflexive systems. We review basic wearable deployments and their open wireless communications. An algorithm that uses accelerometer data to provide a control and communication signal is described. Challenges in the further deployment of wearable device in the field of body area network and biometric verification are discussed.
