Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks

Many different classification tasks need to manage structured data, which are usually modeled as graphs. Moreover, these graphs can be dynamic, meaning that the vertices/edges of each graph may change during time. Our goal is to jointly exploit structured data and temporal information through the use of a neural network model. To the best of our knowledge, this task has not been addressed using these kind of architectures. For this reason, we propose two novel approaches, which combine Long Short-Term Memory networks and Graph Convolutional Networks to learn long short-term dependencies together with graph structure. The quality of our methods is confirmed by the promising results achieved.
