Mobility Management as a Service for 5G Networks

Mobility Management (MM) techniques have conventionally been centralized in nature, wherein a single network entity has been responsible for handling the mobility related tasks of the mobile nodes attached to the network. However, an exponential growth in network traffic and the number of users has ushered in the concept of providing Mobility Management as a Service (MMaaS) to the wireless nodes attached to the 5G networks. Allowing for on-demand mobility management solutions will not only provide the network with the flexibility that it needs to accommodate the many different use cases that are to be served by future networks, but it will also provide the network with the scalability that is needed alongside the flexibility to serve future networks. And hence, in this paper, a detailed study of MMaaS has been provided, highlighting its benefits and challenges for 5G networks. Additionally, the very important property of granularity of service which is deeply intertwined with the scalability and flexibility requirements of the future wireless networks, and a consequence of MMaaS, has also been discussed in detail.
