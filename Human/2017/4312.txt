Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer in MISO Full-Duplex Systems

This paper investigates a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) full-duplex (FD) system for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), in which a multi-antenna base station (BS) simultaneously sends wirelessly information and power to a set of single-antenna mobile stations (MSs) using power splitters (PSs) in the downlink and receives information in the uplink in FD mode. In particular, we address the joint design of the receive PS ratio and the transmit power at the MSs, and the beamforming matrix at the BS under signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the harvested power constraints. Using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), we obtain the solution to the problem with imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the self-interfering channels. Furthermore, we propose another suboptimal zero-forcing (ZF) based solution by separating the optimization of the transmit beamforming vector and the PS ratio. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed beamforming designs.
