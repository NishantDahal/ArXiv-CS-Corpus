Medication non adherence: finding solutions through design thinking approach

Medical non-adherence increasingly is recognized as a major medical health problem. Approximately 50% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed and such poor adherence has been shown to result in complications, death, and increased health care costs. This problem becomes even more significant for patients with chronic illness and those who need to take medications lifetime, like transplant patients. Studies show that one-half of rejection episodes and 15% of graft losses happen due to immunosuppression medications non-adherence. This article explores factors that have an impact on non-compliant behavior among transplant patients: patient factors, illness factor, therapeutic regimen factors. Using user-centered design thinking approach a set of hypotheses are defined and discussed strategies to enhance adherence by using mobile technology and gamification techniques.
