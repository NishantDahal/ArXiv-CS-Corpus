Study of Iterative Detection and Decoding for Large-Scale MIMO Systems with 1-Bit ADCs

We present a novel iterative detection and decoding scheme for the uplink of large-scale multiuser multiple-antenna systems. In order to reduce the receiver's energy consumption and computational complexity, 1-bit analog-to-digital converters are used in the front-end. The performance loss due to the 1-bit quantization can be mitigated by using large-scale antenna arrays. We propose a linear low-resolution-aware minimum mean square error detector for soft multiuser interference mitigation. Moreover, short block length low-density parity-check codes are considered for avoiding high latency. In the channel decoder, a quasi-uniform quantizer with scaling factors is devised to lower the error floor of LDPC codes. Simulations show good performance of the system in terms of bit error rate as compared to prior work.
