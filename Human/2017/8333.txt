RFID-based Solutions for Smarter Healthcare

This paper proposes the application of RFID technology in healthcare industry based on its increased functionality, high reliability, easy-to-use capabilities and low cost. After a brief presentation of RFID technologies and their applications, the paper describes an RFID-based system that can provide efficient facilities to allow essential information management for emergency care across hospital boundaries. This system performs RFID-based identification of the patients, querying and retrieving medical data from various existing healthcare information systems, as well as storing and giving the most clinically significant information to the clinicians. Also, the system allows identifying and tracking RFID- tagged objects in order to provide new quality services for the mobility of objects.
