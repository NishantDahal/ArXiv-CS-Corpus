Algorithms for group isomorphism via group extensions and cohomology

The isomorphism problem for finite groups of order n (GpI) has long been known to be solvable in $n^{\log n+O(1)}$ time, but only recently were polynomial-time algorithms designed for several interesting group classes. Inspired by recent progress, we revisit the strategy for GpI via the extension theory of groups.
  The extension theory describes how a normal subgroup N is related to G/N via G, and this naturally leads to a divide-and-conquer strategy that splits GpI into two subproblems: one regarding group actions on other groups, and one regarding group cohomology. When the normal subgroup N is abelian, this strategy is well-known. Our first contribution is to extend this strategy to handle the case when N is not necessarily abelian. This allows us to provide a unified explanation of all recent polynomial-time algorithms for special group classes.
  Guided by this strategy, to make further progress on GpI, we consider central-radical groups, proposed in Babai et al. (SODA 2011): the class of groups such that G mod its center has no abelian normal subgroups. This class is a natural extension of the group class considered by Babai et al. (ICALP 2012), namely those groups with no abelian normal subgroups. Following the above strategy, we solve GpI in $n^{O(\log \log n)}$ time for central-radical groups, and in polynomial time for several prominent subclasses of central-radical groups. We also solve GpI in $n^{O(\log\log n)}$ time for groups whose solvable normal subgroups are elementary abelian but not necessarily central. As far as we are aware, this is the first time there have been worst-case guarantees on a $n^{o(\log n)}$-time algorithm that tackles both aspects of GpI---actions and cohomology---simultaneously.
