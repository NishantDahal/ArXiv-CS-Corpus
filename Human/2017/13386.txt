Beyond Participatory Design: Towards a Model for Teaching Seniors Application Design

Population aging and the ubiquity of technology in everyday life have made designing solutions for older adults a necessity. User-centered and participatory design approaches include elderly users in the software development process to some extent but do not encourage them to take a leading role in designing applications to address their unmet needs. Teaching seniors about software design could help them actively participate in creating much needed solutions for their age group but this cannot be done without first understanding their conceptual models of technology. Past experiences play a significant role in determining the way learners model abstract concepts and so older adults' conceptual models of user interfaces (and human-computer interaction in general) differ from those used in teaching application design to younger students. In this paper we analyze a workshop on user interface design and prototyping for seniors to better understand older adults' learning process and the issues they encounter while learning abstract ideas related to human-computer interaction. We conclude the study by proposing guidelines for teaching older adults abstract technology related concepts.
