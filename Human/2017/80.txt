Properties of Periodic Fibonacci-like Sequences

Generalized Fibonacci-like sequences appear in finite difference approximations of the Partial Differential Equations based upon replacing partial differential equations by finite difference equations. This paper studies properties of the generalized Fibonacci-like sequence F_(n+2)=A+BF_(n+1)+CF_n. It is shown that this sequence is periodic with the period T>2 if C=-1,|B|<2.
