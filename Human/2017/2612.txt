Complexity Classification Of The Six-Vertex Model

We prove a complexity dichotomy theorem for the six-vertex model. For every setting of the parameters of the model, we prove that computing the partition function is either solvable in polynomial time or #P-hard. The dichotomy criterion is explicit.
