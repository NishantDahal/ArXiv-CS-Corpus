A Novel VHR Image Change Detection Algorithm Based on Image Fusion and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering

This thesis describes a study to perform change detection on Very High Resolution satellite images using image fusion based on 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform and Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm. Multiple other methods are also quantitatively and qualitatively compared in this study.
