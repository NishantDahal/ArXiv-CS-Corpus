Energy Efficient Precoding Design for SWIPT in MIMO Two-Way Relay Networks

In this paper, we study the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The network consists of a multiple-antenna amplify-and-forward relay node which provides bidirectional communications between two multiple-antenna transceiver nodes
