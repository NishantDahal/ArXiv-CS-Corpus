Optimal Control for Constrained Coverage Path Planning

The problem of constrained coverage path planning involves a robot trying to cover maximum area of an environment under some constraints that appear as obstacles in the map. Out of the several coverage path planning methods, we consider augmenting the linear sweep-based coverage method to achieve minimum energy/ time optimality along with maximum area coverage. In addition, we also study the effects of variation of different parameters on the performance of the modified method.
