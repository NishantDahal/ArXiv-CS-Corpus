Cooperative Multi-Agent Planning: A Survey

Cooperative multi-agent planning (MAP) is a relatively recent research field that combines technologies, algorithms and techniques developed by the Artificial Intelligence Planning and Multi-Agent Systems communities. While planning has been generally treated as a single-agent task, MAP generalizes this concept by considering multiple intelligent agents that work cooperatively to develop a course of action that satisfies the goals of the group.
  This paper reviews the most relevant approaches to MAP, putting the focus on the solvers that took part in the 2015 Competition of Distributed and Multi-Agent Planning, and classifies them according to their key features and relative performance.
