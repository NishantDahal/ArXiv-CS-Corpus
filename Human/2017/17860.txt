A fundamental frequency estimation method for tonal sounds inspired on bird song studies

A fast implementation of fundamental frequency estimation is presented in this work. The algorithm is based on a frequency-domain approach. It was mainly develop for tonal sounds and used in Canary bird song analysis. The method was implemented but not restricted for this kind of data. It could be easily adapted for other proposes. Python libraries were used to develop a code with a simple algorithm to obtain fundamental frequency. A simple open source code is provided in the local university repository.
