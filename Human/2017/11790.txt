Aiding autobiographic memory by using wearable devices

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two distinct techniques (Special Moment Approach & Spatial Frequency Approach) for reviewing the lifelogs, which were collected by lifeloggers who were willing to use a wearable camera and a bracelet simultaneously for two days. Generally, Special moment approach is a technique for extracting episodic events and Spatial frequency approach is a technique for associating visual with temporal and location information, especially heat map is applied as the spatial data for expressing frequency awareness. Based on that, the participants were asked to fill in two post-study questionnaires for evaluating the effectiveness of those two techniques and their combination. The preliminary result showed the positive potential of exploring individual lifelogs using our approaches.
