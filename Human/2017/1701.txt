Applications of Algorithmic Probability to the Philosophy of Mind

This paper presents formulae that can solve various seemingly hopeless philosophical conundrums. We discuss the simulation argument, teleportation, mind-uploading, the rationality of utilitarianism, and the ethics of exploiting artificial general intelligence. Our approach arises from combining the essential ideas of formalisms such as algorithmic probability, the universal intelligence measure, space-time-embedded intelligence, and Hutter's observer localization. We argue that such universal models can yield the ultimate solutions, but a novel research direction would be required in order to find computationally efficient approximations thereof.
