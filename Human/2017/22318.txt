A Gamut-Mapping Framework for Color-Accurate Reproduction of HDR Images

Few tone mapping operators (TMOs) take color management into consideration, limiting compression to luminance values only. This may lead to changes in image chroma and hues which are typically managed with a post-processing step. However, current post-processing techniques for tone reproduction do not explicitly consider the target display gamut. Gamut mapping on the other hand, deals with mapping images from one color gamut to another, usually smaller, gamut but has traditionally focused on smaller scale, chromatic changes. In this context, we present a novel gamut and tone management framework for color-accurate reproduction of high dynamic range (HDR) images, which is conceptually and computationally simple, parameter-free, and compatible with existing TMOs. In the CIE LCh color space, we compress chroma to fit the gamut of the output color space. This prevents hue and luminance shifts while taking gamut boundaries into consideration. We also propose a compatible lightness compression scheme that minimizes the number of color space conversions. Our results show that our gamut management method effectively compresses the chroma of tone mapped images, respecting the target gamut and without reducing image quality.
