Bounds for Substituting Algebraic Functions into D-finite Functions

It is well known that the composition of a D-finite function with an algebraic function is again D-finite. We give the first estimates for the orders and the degrees of annihilating operators for the compositions. We find that the analysis of removable singularities leads to an order-degree curve which is much more accurate than the order-degree curve obtained from the usual linear algebra reasoning.
