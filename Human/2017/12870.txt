Measurement and Analysis of UDP Traffic over Wi-Fi and GPRS

With the increasing usage of mobile devices to ubiquitously access heterogeneous applications in wireless Internet, the measurement and analysis of Internet traffic has become a key research area. In this paper, we present the results of our measurements for VBR traffic over UDP in 802.11g and GPRS networks. We focus on Inter-Packet Arrival Time (IPRT) and Inter-Packet Transmission Delay (IPTD) and observe that the later has a significant impact on the round trip delay. Numerical parameters for Weibull, Exponential and Normal distribution in order to represent such traffic are also presented.
