A Logic for Non-Deterministic Parallel Abstract State Machines

We develop a logic which enables reasoning about single steps of non-deterministic parallel Abstract State Machines (ASMs). Our logic builds upon the unifying logic introduced by Nanchen and St√§rk for reasoning about hierarchical (parallel) ASMs. Our main contribution to this regard is the handling of non-determinism (both bounded and unbounded) within the logical formalism. Moreover, we do this without sacrificing the completeness of the logic for statements about single steps of non-deterministic parallel ASMs, such as invariants of rules, consistency conditions for rules, or step-by-step equivalence of rules.
