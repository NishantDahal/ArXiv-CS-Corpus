Optimal Rates for Learning with Nyström Stochastic Gradient Methods

In the setting of nonparametric regression, we propose and study a combination of stochastic gradient methods with Nyström subsampling, allowing multiple passes over the data and mini-batches. Generalization error bounds for the studied algorithm are provided. Particularly, optimal learning rates are derived considering different possible choices of the step-size, the mini-batch size, the number of iterations/passes, and the subsampling level. In comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms such as the classic stochastic gradient methods and kernel ridge regression with Nyström, the studied algorithm has advantages on the computational complexity, while achieving the same optimal learning rates. Moreover, our results indicate that using mini-batches can reduce the total computational cost while achieving the same optimal statistical results.
