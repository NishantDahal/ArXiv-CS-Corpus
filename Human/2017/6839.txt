Debugging Behaviour of Embedded-Software Developers: An Exploratory Study

Many researchers have studied the behaviour of successful developers while debugging desktop software. In this paper, we investigate the embedded-software debugging by intermediate programmers through an exploratory study. The bugs are semantic low-level errors, and the participants are students who completed a real-time operating systems course in addition to five other programming courses. We compare between the behaviour involved in successful debugging attempts versus unsuccessful ones. We describe some characteristics of smooth and successful debugging behaviour.
