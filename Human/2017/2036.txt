A Heuristic Process for GUI Widget Matching Across Application Versions

This paper introduces an automated heuristic process able to achieve high accuracy when matching graphical user interface widgets across multiple versions of a target application. The proposed implementation is flexible as it allows full customization of the process and easy integration with existing tools for long term graphical user interface test case maintenance, software visualization and analysis.
