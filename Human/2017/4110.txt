Scatter Radio Receivers for Extended Range Environmental Sensing WSNs

Backscatter communication, relying on the reflection principle, constitutes a promising-enabling technology for lowcost, large-scale, ubiquitous sensor networking. This work makes an overview of the state-of-the-art coherent and noncoherent scatter radio receivers that account for the peculiar signal model consisting of several microwave and communication parameters.
