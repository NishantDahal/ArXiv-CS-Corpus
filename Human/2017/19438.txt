Complex Number Formulation and Convex Relaxations for Aircraft Conflict Resolution

We present a novel complex number formulation along with tight convex relaxations for the aircraft conflict resolution problem. Our approach combines both speed and heading control and provides global optimality guarantees despite non-convexities in the feasible region. As a side result, we present a new characterization of the conflict separation condition in the form of disjunctive linear constraints. Our formulation features one binary variable per pair of aircraft, is free of trigonometric functions, and captures the non-convexity in a set of quadratic concave constraints. Using our approach, we are able to close a number of open instances and reduce computational time by up to two orders of magnitude on standard instances.
