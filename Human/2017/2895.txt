On repetition thresholds of caterpillars and trees of bounded degree

The repetition threshold is the smallest real number $α$ such that there exists an infinite word over a $k$-letter alphabet that avoids repetition of exponent strictly greater than $α$. This notion can be generalized to graph classes. In this paper, we completely determine the repetition thresholds for caterpillars and caterpillars of maximum degree $3$. Additionally, we present bounds for the repetition thresholds of trees with bounded maximum degrees.
