Power and Execution Time Measurement Methodology for SDF Applications on FPGA-based MPSoCs

Timing and power consumption play an important role in the design of embedded systems. Furthermore, both properties are directly related to the safety requirements of many embedded systems. With regard to availability requirements, power considerations are of uttermost importance for battery operated systems. Validation of timing and power requires observability of these properties. In many cases this is difficult, because the observability is either not possible or requires big extra effort in the system validation process. In this paper, we present a measurement-based approach for the joint timing and power analysis of Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) applications running on a shared memory multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoC) architecture. As a proof-of-concept, we implement an MPSoC system with configurable power and timing measurement interfaces inside a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our experiments demonstrate the viability of our approach being able of accurately analyzing different mappings of image processing applications (Sobel filter and JPEG encoder) on an FPGA-based MPSoC implementation.
