Axiomatization of if-then-else over monoids of possibly non-halting programs and tests

In order to study the axiomatization of the if-then-else construct over possibly non-halting programs and tests, the notion of $C$-sets was introduced in the literature by considering the tests from an abstract $C$-algebra. This paper extends the notion of $C$-sets to $C$-monoids which include the composition of programs as well as composition of programs with tests. For the class of $C$-monoids where the $C$-algebras are adas a canonical representation in terms of functional $C$-monoids is obtained.
