Performance Analysis of Dense Small Cell Networks with Generalized Fading

In this paper, we propose a unified framework to analyze the performance of dense small cell networks (SCNs) in terms of the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency (ASE). In our analysis, we consider a practical path loss model that accounts for both non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) transmissions. Furthermore, we adopt a generalized fading model, in which Rayleigh fading, Rician fading and Nakagami-m fading can be treated in a unified framework. The analytical results of the coverage probability and the ASE are derived, using a generalized stochastic geometry analysis. Different from existing work that does not differentiate NLOS and LOS transmissions, our results show that NLOS and LOS transmissions have a significant impact on the coverage probability and the ASE performance, particularly when the SCNs grow dense. Furthermore, our results establish for the first time that the performance of the SCNs can be divided into four regimes, according to the intensity (aka density) of BSs, where in each regime the performance is dominated by different factors.
