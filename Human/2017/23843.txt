A Quasi-isometric Embedding Algorithm

The Whitney embedding theorem gives an upper bound on the smallest embedding dimension of a manifold. If a data set lies on a manifold, a random projection into this reduced dimension will retain the manifold structure. Here we present an algorithm to find a projection that distorts the data as little as possible.
