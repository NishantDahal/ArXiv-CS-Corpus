A Fourier-invariant method for locating point-masses and computing their attributes

Motivated by the interest of observing the growth of cancer cells among normal living cells and exploring how galaxies and stars are truly formed, the objective of this paper is to introduce a rigorous and effective method for counting point-masses, determining their spatial locations, and computing their attributes. Based on computation of Hermite moments that are Fourier-invariant, our approach facilitates the processing of both spatial and Fourier data in any dimension.
