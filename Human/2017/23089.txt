STWalk: Learning Trajectory Representations in Temporal Graphs

Analyzing the temporal behavior of nodes in time-varying graphs is useful for many applications such as targeted advertising, community evolution and outlier detection. In this paper, we present a novel approach, STWalk, for learning trajectory representations of nodes in temporal graphs. The proposed framework makes use of structural properties of graphs at current and previous time-steps to learn effective node trajectory representations. STWalk performs random walks on a graph at a given time step (called space-walk) as well as on graphs from past time-steps (called time-walk) to capture the spatio-temporal behavior of nodes. We propose two variants of STWalk to learn trajectory representations. In one algorithm, we perform space-walk and time-walk as part of a single step. In the other variant, we perform space-walk and time-walk separately and combine the learned representations to get the final trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on three real-world temporal graph datasets validate the effectiveness of the learned representations when compared to three baseline methods. We also show the goodness of the learned trajectory embeddings for change point detection, as well as demonstrate that arithmetic operations on these trajectory representations yield interesting and interpretable results.
