Impact Of Urban Technology Deployments On Local Commercial Activity

While smart city innovations seem to be a common and necessary response to increasing challenges of urbanization, foreseeing their impact on complex urban system is critical for informed decision making. Moreover, often the effect of urban interventions goes beyond the original expectations, including multiple indirect impacts. The present study considers the impact of two urban deployments, Citi Bike (bike sharing system) and LinkNYC kiosks, on the local commercial activity in the affected neighborhoods of New York City. The study uses anonymized and aggregated insights provided through a grant from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth in order to provide initial data-driven evidence towards the hypothesis that proximity of Citi Bike stations incentivizes local sales at eating places, while LinkNYC kiosks help people, especially visitors, to navigate local businesses and thus incentivize commercial activity in different business categories.
