A Field Study of On-Calendar Visualizations

Feedback tools help people to monitor information about themselves to improve their health, sustainability practices, or personal well-being. Yet reasoning about personal data (e.g., pedometer counts, blood pressure readings, or home electricity consumption) to gain a deep understanding of your current practices and how to change can be challenging with the data alone. We integrate quantitative feedback data within a personal digital calendar; this approach aims to make the feedback data readily accessible and more comprehensible. We report on an eight-week field study of an on-calendar visualization tool. Results showed that a personal calendar can provide rich context for people to reason about their feedback data. The on-calendar visualization enabled people to quickly identify and reason about regular patterns and anomalies. Based on our results, we also derived a model of the behavior feedback process that extends existing technology adoption models. With that, we reflected on potential barriers for the ongoing use of feedback tools.
