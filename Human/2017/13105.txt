Deep Learning in Robotics: A Review of Recent Research

Advances in deep learning over the last decade have led to a flurry of research in the application of deep artificial neural networks to robotic systems, with at least thirty papers published on the subject between 2014 and the present. This review discusses the applications, benefits, and limitations of deep learning vis-Ã -vis physical robotic systems, using contemporary research as exemplars. It is intended to communicate recent advances to the wider robotics community and inspire additional interest in and application of deep learning in robotics.
