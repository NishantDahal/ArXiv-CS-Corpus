The Relationship Between Emotion Models and Artificial Intelligence

Emotions play a central role in most forms of natural human interaction so we may expect that computational methods for the processing and expression of emotions will play a growing role in human-computer interaction. The OCC model has established itself as the standard model for emotion synthesis. A large number of studies employed the OCC model to generate emotions for their embodied characters. Many developers of such characters believe that the OCC model will be all they ever need to equip their character with emotions. This study reflects on the limitations of the OCC model specifically, and on the emotion models in general due to their dependency on artificial intelligence.
