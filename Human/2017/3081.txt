MRFI Stream Arbitration: An Efficient Arbitration Scheme for NoC with Emerging Interconnect Technology

An improved version of stream arbitration based on multiband RF interconnect (MRFI) is proposed. Thanks to the simultaneous multiple channel transmitting/receiving feature of MRFI, dynamic bandwidth allocation is achieved in the proposed arbitration algorithm. With dynamic bandwidth allocation, MRFI based arbitration can guarantee 100% channel bandwidth utilization, which is a significant improvement compared with original RF-I based stream arbitration whose channel bandwidth utilization is only around 30%~50%.
