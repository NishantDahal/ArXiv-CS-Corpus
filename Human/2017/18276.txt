Recent Advances in Fog Radio Access Networks: Performance Analysis and Radio Resource Allocation

As a promising paradigm for the fifth generation wireless communication (5G) system, the fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been proposed as an advanced socially-aware mobile networking architecture to provide high spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining high energy efficiency (EE) and low latency. Recent advents are advocated to the performance analysis and radio resource allocation, both of which are fundamental issues to make F-RANs successfully rollout. This article comprehensively summarizes the recent advances of the performance analysis and radio resource allocation in F-RANs. Particularly, the advanced edge cache and adaptive model selection schemes are presented to improve SE and EE under maintaining a low latency level. The radio resource allocation strategies to optimize SE and EE in F-RANs are respectively proposed. A few open issues in terms of the F-RAN based 5G architecture and the social-awareness technique are identified as well.
