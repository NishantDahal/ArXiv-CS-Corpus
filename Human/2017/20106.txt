A Quantitative Analysis of WCAG 2.0 Compliance For Some Indian Web Portals

Web portals have served as an excellent medium to facilitate user centric services for organizations irrespective of the type, size, and domain of operation. The objective of these portals has been to deliver a plethora of services such as information dissemination, transactional services, and customer feedback. Therefore, the design of a web portal is crucial in order that it is accessible to a wide range of user community irrespective of age group, physical abilities, and level of literacy. In this paper, we have studied the compliance of WCAG 2.0 by three different categories of Indian web sites which are most frequently accessed by a large section of user community. We have provided a quantitative evaluation of different aspects of accessibility which we believe can pave the way for better design of web sites by taking care of the deficiencies inherent in the web portals.
