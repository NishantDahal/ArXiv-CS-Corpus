On the modeling of neural cognition for social network applications

In this paper, we study neural cognition in social network. A stochastic model is introduced and shown to incorporate two well-known models in Pavlovian conditioning and social networks as special case, namely Rescorla-Wagner model and Friedkin-Johnsen model. The interpretation and comparison of these model are discussed. We consider two cases when the disturbance is independent identical distributed for all time and when the distribution of the random variable evolves according to a markov chain. We show that the systems for both cases are mean square stable and the expectation of the states converges to consensus.
