Private Broadcasting: an Index Coding Approach

Using a broadcast channel to transmit clients' data requests may impose privacy risks. In this paper, we address such privacy concerns in the index coding framework. We show how a malicious client can infer some information about the requests and side information of other clients by learning the encoding matrix used by the server. We propose an information-theoretic metric to measure the level of privacy and show how encoding matrices can be designed to achieve specific privacy guarantees. We then consider a special scenario for which we design a transmission scheme and derive the achieved levels of privacy in closed-form. We also derive upper bounds and we compare them to the levels of privacy achieved by our scheme, highlighting that an inherent trade-off exists between protecting privacy of the request and of the side information of the clients.
