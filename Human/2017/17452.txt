Efficient and Reliable Topology Control based Opportunistic Routing Algorithm for WSNs

The opportunistic routing has advantages on improving the packet delivery ratio between source node and candidate set (PDRsc). However, considering the frequent topology variation in wireless sensor networks, how to improve and control the PDR has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable topology control based opportunistic routing algorithm (ERTO) which takes PDRsc into account. In ERTO, the interference and transmission power loss are taken into account during the calculation of PDRsc. The PDRsc, the expected energy consumption, and the relationship between transmission power and node degree are considered to calculate the optimal transmission power and relay node degree jointly. For improving the routing effective and reducing the calculation complexity, we introduce the multi-objective optimization into the topology control. During the routing process, nodes calculate the optimal transmission power and relay node degree according to the properties of Pareto optimal solution set, by which the optimal solutions can be selected. Based on these innovations, the energy consumption, the transmission delay, and the throughout have been improved greatly compared with the traditional power control based opportunistic routing algorithms.
