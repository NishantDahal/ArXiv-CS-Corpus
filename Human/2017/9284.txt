MISRA C, for Security's Sake!

A third of United States new cellular subscriptions in Q1 2016 were for cars. There are now more than 112 million vehicles connected around the world. The percentage of new cars shipped with Internet connectivity is expected to rise from 13% in 2015 to 75% in 2020, and 98% of all vehicles will likely be connected by 2025. Moreover, the news continuously report about "white hat" hackers intruding on car software. For these reasons, security concerns in automotive and other industries have skyrocketed. MISRA C, which is widely respected as a safety-related coding standard, is equally applicable as a security-related coding standard. In this presentation, we will show that security-critical and safety-critical software have the same requirements. We will then introduce the new documents MISRA C:2012 Amendment 1 (Additional security guidelines for MISRA C:2012) and MISRA C:2012 Addendum 2 (Coverage of MISRA C:2012 against ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 "C Secure Coding Rules"). We will illustrate the relationship between MISRA C, CERT C and ISO/IEC TS 17961, with a particular focus on the objective of preventing security vulnerabilities (and of course safety hazards) as opposed to trying to eradicate them once they have been inserted in the code.
