ShortScience.org - Reproducing Intuition

We present ShortScience.org, a platform for post-publication discussion of research papers. On ShortScience.org, the research community can read and write summaries of papers in order to increase accessible and reproducibility. Summaries contain the perspective and insight of other readers, why they liked or disliked it, and their attempt to demystify complicated sections. ShortScience.org has over 600 paper summaries, all of which are searchable and organized by paper, conference, and year. Many regular contributors are expert machine learning researchers. We present statistics from the last year of operation, user demographics, and responses from a usage survey. Results indicate that ShortScience benefits students most, by providing short, understandable summaries reflecting expert opinions.
