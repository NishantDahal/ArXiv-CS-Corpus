Post-Prognostics Decision for Optimizing the Commitment of Fuel Cell Systems

In a post-prognostics decision context, this paper addresses the problem of maximizing the useful life of a platform composed of several parallel machines under service constraint. Application on multi-stack fuel cell systems is considered. In order to propose a solution to the insufficient durability of fuel cells, the purpose is to define a commitment strategy by determining at each time the contribution of each fuel cell stack to the global output so as to satisfy the demand as long as possible. A relaxed version of the problem is introduced, which makes it potentially solvable for very large instances. Results based on computational experiments illustrate the efficiency of the new approach, based on the Mirror Prox algorithm, when compared with a simple method of successive projections onto the constraint sets associated with the problem.
