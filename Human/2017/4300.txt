Invertibility of graph translation and support of Laplacian Fiedler vectors

The graph Laplacian operator is widely studied in spectral graph theory largely due to its importance in modern data analysis. Recently, the Fourier transform and other time-frequency operators have been defined on graphs using Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We extend these results and prove that the translation operator to the $i$'th node is invertible if and only if all eigenvectors are nonzero on the $i$'th node. Because of this dependency on the support of eigenvectors we study the characteristic set of Laplacian eigenvectors. We prove that the Fiedler vector of a planar graph cannot vanish on large neighborhoods and then explicitly construct a family of non-planar graphs that do exhibit this property.
