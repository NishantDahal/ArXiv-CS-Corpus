Rich Semantic Models and Knowledgebases for Highly-Structured Scientific Communication

Rather than using text for scientific research reports, we have proposed developing highly-structured reports with rich semantic models. In this paper, we consider detailed structures for the components of research reports using a modeling framework based on a rigorous upper ontology. For instance, we consider the use of structured descriptions of Research Designs to support evaluation of internal and external validity. In addition, collections of highly-structured scientific research reports would be the key component of a set of evolving and interlocking highly-structured scientific knowledgebases.
