Talking Condition Recognition in Stressful and Emotional Talking Environments Based on CSPHMM2s

This work is aimed at exploiting Second-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (CSPHMM2s) as classifiers to enhance talking condition recognition in stressful and emotional talking environments (completely two separate environments). The stressful talking environment that has been used in this work uses Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) database, while the emotional talking environment uses Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts (EPST) database. The achieved results of this work using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) demonstrate that CSPHMM2s outperform each of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Second-Order Circular Hidden Markov Models (CHMM2s), and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) in enhancing talking condition recognition in the stressful and emotional talking environments. The results also show that the performance of talking condition recognition in stressful talking environments leads that in emotional talking environments by 3.67% based on CSPHMM2s. Our results obtained in subjective evaluation by human judges fall within 2.14% and 3.08% of those obtained, respectively, in stressful and emotional talking environments based on CSPHMM2s.
