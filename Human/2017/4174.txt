Proceedings International Workshop on Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures

These are the proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures (FESCA). The workshop was held on April 22, 2017 in Uppsala (Sweden) as a satellite event to the European Joint Conference on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS'17).
  The aim of the FESCA workshop is to bring together junior researchers from formal methods, software engineering, and industry interested in the development and application of formal modelling approaches as well as associated analysis and reasoning techniques with practical benefits for software engineering.
  In recent years, the growing importance of functional correctness and the increased relevance of system quality properties (e.g. performance, reliability, security) have stimulated the emergence of analytical and modelling techniques for the design and development of software systems. With the increasing complexity and utilization of today's software systems, FESCA aims at addressing two research questions: (1) what role is played by the software design phase in the systematic addressing of the analytical and modelling challenges, and (2) how can formal and semi-formal techniques be effectively applied to make the issues easier to address automatically, with lower human intervention.
