A Remote Interface for Live Interaction with OMNeT++ Simulations

Discrete event simulators, such as OMNeT++, provide fast and convenient methods for the assessment of algorithms and protocols, especially in the context of wired and wireless networks. Usually, simulation parameters such as topology and traffic patterns are predefined to observe the behaviour reproducibly. However, for learning about the dynamic behaviour of a system, a live interaction that allows changing parameters on the fly is very helpful. This is especially interesting for providing interactive demonstrations at conferences and fairs. In this paper, we present a remote interface to OMNeT++ simulations that can be used to control the simulations while visualising real-time data merged from multiple OMNeT++ instances. We explain the software architecture behind our framework and how it can be used to build demonstrations on the foundation of OMNeT++.
