Mobile Quantification and Therapy Course Tracking for Gait Rehabilitation

This paper presents a novel autonomous quality metric to quantify the rehabilitations progress of subjects with knee/hip operations. The presented method supports digital analysis of human gait patterns using smartphones. The algorithm related to the autonomous metric utilizes calibrated acceleration, gyroscope and magnetometer signals from seven Inertial Measurement Unit attached on the lower body in order to classify and generate the grading system values. The developed Android application connects the seven Inertial Measurement Units via Bluetooth and performs the data acquisition and processing in real-time. In total nine features per acceleration direction and lower body joint angle are calculated and extracted in real-time to achieve a fast feedback to the user. We compare the classification accuracy and quantification capabilities of Linear Discriminant Analysis, Principal Component Analysis and Naive Bayes algorithms. The presented system is able to classify patients and control subjects with an accuracy of up to 100\%. The outcomes can be saved on the device or transmitted to treating physicians for later control of the subject's improvements and the efficiency of physiotherapy treatments in motor rehabilitation. The proposed autonomous quality metric solution bears great potential to be used and deployed to support digital healthcare and therapy.
