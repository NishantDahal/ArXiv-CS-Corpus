An Invariant Model of the Significance of Different Body Parts in Recognizing Different Actions

In this paper, we show that different body parts do not play equally important roles in recognizing a human action in video data. We investigate to what extent a body part plays a role in recognition of different actions and hence propose a generic method of assigning weights to different body points. The approach is inspired by the strong evidence in the applied perception community that humans perform recognition in a foveated manner, that is they recognize events or objects by only focusing on visually significant aspects. An important contribution of our method is that the computation of the weights assigned to body parts is invariant to viewing directions and camera parameters in the input data. We have performed extensive experiments to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its significance. In particular, results show that considerable improvement in performance is gained by taking into account the relative importance of different body parts as defined by our approach.
