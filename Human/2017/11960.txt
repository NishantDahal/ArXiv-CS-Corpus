Local Large Deviations: McMillian Theorem for multitype Galton-Watson Processes

In this article we prove a local large deviation principle (LLDP) for the critical multitype Galton-Watson process from spectral potential point. We define the so-called a spectral potential $U_{\skrik}(\,\cdot,\,π)$ for the Galton-Watson process, where $π$ is the normalized eigen vector corresponding to the leading \emph{Perron-Frobenius eigen value } $\1$ of the transition matrix $\skria(\cdot,\,\cdot)$ defined from ${\skrik},$ the transition kernel. We show that the Kullback action or the deviation function, $J(π,ρ),$ with respect to an empirical offspring measure, $ρ,$ is the Legendre dual of $U_{\skrik}(\,\cdot,\,π).$ From the LLDP we deduce a conditional large deviation principle and a weak variant of the classical McMillian Theorem for the multitype Galton-Watson process. To be specific, given any empirical offspring measure $\varpi,$ we show that the number of critical multitype Galton-Watson processes on $n$ vertices is approximately $e^{n\langle \skrih_{\varpi},\,π\rangle},$ where $\skrih_{\varpi}$ is a suitably defined entropy.
