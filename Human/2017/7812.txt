Model Checking and Validity in Propositional and Modal Inclusion Logics

Propositional and modal inclusion logic are formalisms that belong to the family of logics based on team semantics. This article investigates the model checking and validity problems of these logics. We identify complexity bounds for both problems, covering both lax and strict team semantics. By doing so, we come close to finalising the programme that ultimately aims to classify the complexities of the central reasoning problems for modal and propositional dependence, independence, and inclusion logics.
