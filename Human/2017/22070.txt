LP-Based Power Grid Enhancement Methodology

In this paper, we explored the opportunity to enhance power grid robustness after routing stage, and propose a linear programming based algorithm that maximizes the improvement of power grid strengthening with given available routing resource. We further discussed some techniques to leverage tradeoffs between runtime and optimality of the solutions. Experimental results show substantial power integrity improvement with "zero cost".
