RubyStar: A Non-Task-Oriented Mixture Model Dialog System

RubyStar is a dialog system designed to create "human-like" conversation by combining different response generation strategies. RubyStar conducts a non-task-oriented conversation on general topics by using an ensemble of rule-based, retrieval-based and generative methods. Topic detection, engagement monitoring, and context tracking are used for managing interaction. Predictable elements of conversation, such as the bot's backstory and simple question answering are handled by separate modules. We describe a rating scheme we developed for evaluating response generation. We find that character-level RNN is an effective generation model for general responses, with proper parameter settings; however other kinds of conversation topics might benefit from using other models.
