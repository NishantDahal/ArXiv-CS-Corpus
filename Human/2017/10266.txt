Stochastic Characteristics of Qubits and Qubit chains on the D-Wave 2X

This document presents a studies of the stochastic behavior of D-Wave qubits, qubit cells, and qubit chains. The purpose of this paper is to address the algorithmic behavior of execution rather than the physical behavior, though they are related. The measurements from an actual D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer are compare with calculated measurements from a theoretical adiabatic quantum computer running with an effective temperature of zero. In this way the paper attempts to shed light on how the D-Wave's behavior effects how well it minimizes its objective function and why the D-Wave performs as it does.
