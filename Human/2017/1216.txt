Linear Learning with Sparse Data

Linear predictors are especially useful when the data is high-dimensional and sparse. One of the standard techniques used to train a linear predictor is the Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) algorithm. We present an efficient implementation of ASGD that avoids dense vector operations. We also describe a translation invariant extension called Centered Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent (CASGD).
