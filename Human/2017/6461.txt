Derivation of the Asymptotic Eigenvalue Distribution for Causal 2D-AR Models under Upscaling

This technical report describes the derivation of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for causal 2D-AR models under an upscaling scenario. Specifically, it tackles the analytical derivation of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the sample autocorrelation matrix corresponding to genuine and upscaled images. It also includes the pseudocode of the derived approaches for resampling detection and resampling factor estimation that are based on this analysis.
