An Enhanced Access Reservation Protocol with a Partial Preamble Transmission Mechanism in NB-IoT Systems

In this letter, we propose an enhanced Access Reservation Protocol (ARP) with a partial preamble transmission (PPT) mechanism for the narrow band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) systems. The proposed ARP can enhance the ARP performance by mitigating the occurrence of preamble collisions, while being compatible with the conventional NB-IoT ARP. We provide an analytical model that captures the performance of the proposed ARP in terms of false alarm, mis-detection and collision probabilities. Moreover, we investigate a trade-off between the mis-detection and the collision probabilities, and optimize the proposed ARP according to the system loads. The results show that the proposed ARP outperforms the conventional NB-IoT ARP, in particular at heavier system loads.
