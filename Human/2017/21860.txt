A Survey of Multithreading Image Analysis

Digital image analysis has made a big advance in many areas of enterprise applications including medicine, industry, and entertainment by assisting the extraction of semantic information from digital images. However, its large computational complexity has been a trouble to most real-time developments. While image analysis in general has been studied for a log period in computer science community, the use of multithreading strategy as the most efficient improving computational capacity technique has been limited so far. In this survey an attempt is made to explain the current knowledge and so far progresses in incorporating image analysis with multithreading approaches. The present work also provides insights and tendencies for the possible future enhancement of multithreading image analysis.
