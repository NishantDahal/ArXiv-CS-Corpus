Mesh Model (MeMo): A Systematic Approach to Agile System Engineering

Innovation and entrepreneurship have a very special role to play in creating sustainable development in the world. Engineering design plays a major role in innovation. These are not new facts. However this added to the fact that in current time knowledge seem to increase at an exponential rate, growing twice every few months. This creates a need to have newer methods to innovate with very little scope to fall short of the expectations from customers. In terms of reliable designing, system design tools and methodologies have been very helpful and have been in use in most engineering industries for decades now. But traditional system design is rigorous and rigid. As we can see, we need an innovation system that should be rigorous and flexible at the same time. We take our inspiration from biosphere, where some of the most rugged yet flexible plants are creepers which grow to create mesh. In this thematic paper we shall explain our approach to system engineering which we call the MeMo (Mesh Model) that fuses the rigor of system engineering with the flexibility of agile methods to create a scheme that can give rise to reliable innovation in the high risk market of today.
