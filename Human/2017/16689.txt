Reliable Beamspace Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems with Lens Antenna Array

Millimeter-wave massive MIMO with lens antenna array can considerably reduce the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains by beam selection. However, beam selection requires the base station to acquire the accurate information of beamspace channel. This is a challenging task, as the size of beamspace channel is large while the number of RF chains is limited. In this paper, we investigate the beamspace channel estimation problem in mmWave massive MIMO systems with lens antenna array. Specifically, we first design an adaptive selecting network for mmWave massive MIMO systems with lens antenna array, and based on this network, we further formulate the beamspace channel estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem. Then, by fully utilizing the structural characteristics of mmWave beamspace channel, we propose a support detection (SD)-based channel estimation scheme with reliable performance and low pilot overhead. Finally, the performance and complexity analyses are provided to prove that the proposed SD-based channel estimation scheme can estimate the support of sparse beamspace channel with comparable or higher accuracy than conventional schemes. Simulation results verify that the proposed SD-based channel estimation scheme outperforms conventional schemes and enjoys satisfying accuracy, even in the low SNR region as the structural characteristics of beamspace channel can be exploited.
