Time and harmonic study of strongly controllable group systems, group shifts, and group codes

In this paper we give a complementary view of some of the results on group systems by Forney and Trott. We find an encoder of a group system which has the form of a time convolution. We consider this to be a time domain encoder while the encoder of Forney and Trott is a spectral domain encoder. We study the outputs of time and spectral domain encoders when the inputs are the same, and also study outputs when the same input is used but time runs forward and backward. In an abelian group system, all four cases give the same output for the same input, but this may not be true for a nonabelian system. Moreover, time symmetry and harmonic symmetry are broken for the same reason. We use a canonic form, a set of tensors, to show how the outputs are related. These results show there is a time and harmonic theory of group systems.
