Megatrend and Intervention Impact Analyser for Jobs: A European Big Data Hackathon Entry

This paper presents results of a European Big Data Hackathon entry to facilitate data analysis and visualization of patterns in provided and external datasets about European jobs and skills mismatch and labour market in general. The main contributions of this work are: the development of a method to represent the complex labour market internal structure from the perspective of occupations sharing skills; developing and presenting the prototype, together with an extended description of constructing a graph and related necessary data processing. Since labour market is not an isolated phenomenon and is constantly impacted with external trends and interventions, the presented tool is designed to enable adding extra layers of external information: what is the impact of a megatrend or an intervention to the labour market? Which parts of labour market of what country is most vulnerable to approaching megatrend or planned intervention? A case of analysing the labour market together with the megatrend of automation and computerization of jobs is presented. The source code of the prototype is released as open source for better repeat-ability.
