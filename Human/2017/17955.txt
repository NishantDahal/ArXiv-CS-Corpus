Miscorrection-free Decoding of Staircase Codes

We propose a novel decoding algorithm for staircase codes which reduces the effect of undetected component code miscorrections. The algorithm significantly improves performance, while retaining a low-complexity implementation suitable for high-speed optical transport networks.
