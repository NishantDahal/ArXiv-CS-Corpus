A Machine Learning Approach to Routing

Can ideas and techniques from machine learning be leveraged to automatically generate "good" routing configurations? We investigate the power of data-driven routing protocols. Our results suggest that applying ideas and techniques from deep reinforcement learning to this context yields high performance, motivating further research along these lines.
