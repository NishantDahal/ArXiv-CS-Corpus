Design and Analysis of Initial Access in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks

Initial access is the process which allows a mobile user to first connect to a cellular network. It consists of two main steps: cell search (CS) on the downlink and random access (RA) on the uplink. Millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems typically must rely on directional beamforming (BF) in order to create a viable connection. The beamforming direction must therefore be learned-as well as used-in the initial access process for mmWave cellular networks. This paper considers four simple but representative initial access protocols that use various combinations of directional beamforming and omnidirectional transmission and reception at the mobile and the BS, during the CS and RA phases. We provide a system-level analysis of the success probability for CS and RA for each one, as well as of the initial access delay and user-perceived downlink throughput (UPT). For a baseline exhaustive search protocol, we find the optimal BS beamwidth and observe that in terms of initial access delay it is decreasing as blockage becomes more severe, but is relatively constant (about $Ï€/12$) for UPT. Of the considered protocols, the best trade-off between initial access delay and UPT is achieved under a fast cell search protocol.
