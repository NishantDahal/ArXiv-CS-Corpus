Inline Co-Evolution between Users and Information Presentation for Data Exploration

This paper presents an intelligent user interface model dedicated to the exploration of complex databases. This model is implemented on a 3D metaphor : a virtual museum. In this metaphor, the database elements are embodied as museum objects. The objects are grouped in rooms according to their semantic properties and relationships and the rooms organization forms the museum. Rooms organization is not predefi-ned but defined incrementally by taking into account not only the relationships between objects, but also the users centers of interest. The latter are evaluated in real-time through user interactions within the virtual museum. This interface allows for a personal reading and favors the discovery of unsuspec-ted links between data. In this paper, we present our model's formalization as well as its application to the context of cultural heritage.
