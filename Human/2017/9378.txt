A Functorial Construction of Quantum Subtheories

We apply the geometric quantization procedure via symplectic groupoids proposed by E. Hawkins to the setting of epistemically restricted toy theories formalized by Spekkens. In the continuous degrees of freedom, this produces the algebraic structure of quadrature quantum subtheories. In the odd-prime finite degrees of freedom, we obtain a functor from the Frobenius algebra in \textbf{Rel} of the toy theories to the Frobenius algebra of stabilizer quantum mechanics.
