Twin Sort Technique

The objective behind the Twin Sort technique is to sort the list of unordered data elements efficiently and to allow efficient and simple arrangement of data elements within the data structure with optimization of comparisons and iterations in the sorting method. This sorting technique effectively terminates the iterations when there is no need of comparison if the elements are all sorted in between the iterations. Unlike Quick sort, Merge sorting technique, this new sorting technique is based on the iterative method of sorting elements within the data structure. So it will be advantageous for optimization of iterations when there is no need for sorting elements. Finally, the Twin Sort technique is more efficient and simple method of arranging elements within a data structure and it is easy to implement when comparing to the other sorting technique. By the introduction of optimization of comparison and iterations, it will never allow the arranging task on the ordered elements.
