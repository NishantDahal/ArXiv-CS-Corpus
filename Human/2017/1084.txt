Single Letter Expression of Capacity for a Class of Channels with Memory

We study finite alphabet channels with Unit Memory on the previous Channel Outputs called UMCO channels. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions, to test whether the capacity achieving channel input distributions with feedback are time-invariant, and whether feedback capacity is characterized by single letter, expressions, similar to that of memoryless channels. The method is based on showing that a certain dynamic programming equation, which in general, is a nested optimization problem over the sequence of channel input distributions, reduces to a non-nested optimization problem. Moreover, for UMCO channels, we give a simple expression for the ML error exponent, and we identify sufficient conditions to test whether feedback does not increase capacity. We derive similar results, when transmission cost constraints are imposed. We apply the results to a special class of the UMCO channels, the Binary State Symmetric Channel (BSSC) with and without transmission cost constraints, to show that the optimization problem of feedback capacity is non-nested, the capacity achieving channel input distribution and the corresponding channel output transition probability distribution are time-invariant, and feedback capacity is characterized by a single letter formulae, precisely as Shannon's single letter characterization of capacity of memoryless channels. Then we derive closed form expressions for the capacity achieving channel input distribution and feedback capacity. We use the closed form expressions to evaluate an error exponent for ML decoding.
