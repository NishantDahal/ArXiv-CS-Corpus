Constant Composition Codes as Subcodes of Linear Codes

In this paper, on one hand, a class of linear codes with one or two weights is obtained. Based on these linear codes, we construct two classes of constant composition codes, which includes optimal constant composition codes depending on LVFC bound. On the other hand, a class of constant composition codes is derived from known linear codes.
