Network Analysis for Explanation

Safety critical systems strongly require the quality aspects of artificial intelligence including explainability. In this paper, we analyzed a trained network to extract features which mainly contribute the inference. Based on the analysis, we developed a simple solution to generate explanations of the inference processes.
