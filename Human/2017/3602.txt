Symbolic integration with respect to the Haar measure on the unitary group

We present IntU package for Mathematica computer algebra system. The presented package performs a symbolic integration of polynomial functions over the unitary group with respect to unique normalized Haar measure. We describe a number of special cases which can be used to optimize the calculation speed for some classes of integrals. We also provide some examples of usage of the presented package.
