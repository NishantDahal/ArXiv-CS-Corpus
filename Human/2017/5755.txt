On extremal double circulant self-dual codes of lengths $90$-$96$

A classification of extremal double circulant self-dual codes of lengths up to $88$ is known. We give a classification of extremal double circulant self-dual codes of lengths $90,92,94$ and $96$. We also classify double circulant self-dual codes with parameters $[90,45,14]$ and $[96,48,16]$. In addition, we demonstrate that no double circulant self-dual $[90,45,14]$ code has an extremal self-dual neighbor, and no double circulant self-dual $[96,45,16]$ code has a self-dual neighbor with minimum weight at least $18$.
