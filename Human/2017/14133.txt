The minimal measurement number problem in phase retrieval: a review of recent developments

Phase retrieval is to recover the signals from phaseless measurements which is raised in many areas. A fundamental problem in phase retrieval is to determine the minimal measurement number $m$ so that one can recover $d$-dimensional signals from $m$ phaseless measurements. This problem attracts much attention of experts from different areas. In this paper, we review the recent development on the minimal measurement number and also raise many interesting open questions.
