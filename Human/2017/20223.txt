Searching for effective and efficient way of knowledge transfer within an organization

In this paper three models of knowledge transfer in organization are considered. In the first model (A) the transfer of chunks of knowledge among agents is possible only when the sender has exactly one more chunks of knowledge than recipient. This is not dissimilar with bounded confidence model of opinion dynamics. In the second model (B) the knowledge transfer take place when sender is "smarter" than recipient. Finally, in the third scenario (model C) we allow for knowledge transfer also when sender posses the same or greater number of chunks of knowledge as recipient. The simulation bases on cellular automata technique. The organization members occupy nodes of square lattice and they interact only with their nearest neighbors. With computer simulations we show, that the efficiency and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer i) for model C is better than for model B ii) and it is worse for model A than for model B.
