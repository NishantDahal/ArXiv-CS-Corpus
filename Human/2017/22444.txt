A Face Fairness Framework for 3D Meshes

In this paper, we present a face fairness framework for 3D meshes that preserves the regular shape of faces and is applicable to a variety of 3D mesh restoration tasks. Specifically, we present a number of desirable properties for any mesh restoration method and show that our framework satisfies them. We then apply our framework to two different tasks --- mesh-denoising and mesh-refinement, and present comparative results for these two tasks showing improvement over other relevant methods in the literature.
