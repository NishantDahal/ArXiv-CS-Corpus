A Shapelet Transform for Multivariate Time Series Classification

Shapelets are phase independent subsequences designed for time series classification. We propose three adaptations to the Shapelet Transform (ST) to capture multivariate features in multivariate time series classification. We create a unified set of data to benchmark our work on, and compare with three other algorithms. We demonstrate that multivariate shapelets are not significantly worse than other state-of-the-art algorithms.
