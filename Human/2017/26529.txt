Low Complexity Receiver for Uplink SCMA System via Expectation Propagation

Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) scheme is considered to be one promising non-orthogonal multiple access technology for the future fifth generation (5G) communications. Due to the sparse nature, message passing algorithm (MPA) has been used as the receiver to achieve close to maximum likelihood (ML) detection performance with much lower complexity. However, the complexity order of MPA is still exponential with the size of codebook and the degree of signal superposition on a given resource element. In this paper, we propose a novel low complexity iterative receiver based on expectation propagation algorithm (EPA), which reduces the complexity order from exponential to linear. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EPA receiver achieves nearly the same block error rate (BLER) performance as the conventional message passing algorithm (MPA) receiver with orders less complexity.
