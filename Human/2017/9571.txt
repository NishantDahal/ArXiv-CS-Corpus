Exact VC-dimension for $L_1$-visibility of points in simple polygons

The VC-dimension plays an important role for the algorithmic problem of guarding art galleries efficiently. We prove that inside a simple polygon at most $5$ points can be shattered by $L_1$-visibility polygons and give an example where 5 points are shattered. The VC-dimension is exactly $5$. The proof idea for the upper bound is different from previous approaches.
