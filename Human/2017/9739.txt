Feature-Sharing in Cascade Detection Systems with Multiple Applications

Traditional distributed detection systems are often designed for a single target application. However, with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, next-generation systems are expected to be a shared infrastructure for multiple applications. To this end, we propose a modular, cascade design for resource-efficient, multi-task detection systems. Two (classes of) applications are considered in the system, a primary and a secondary one. The primary application has universal features that can be shared with other applications, to reduce the overall feature extraction cost, while the secondary application does not. In this setting, the two applications can collaborate via feature sharing. We provide a method to optimize the operation of the multi-application cascade system based on an accurate resource consumption model. In addition, the inherent uncertainties in feature models are articulated and taken into account. For evaluation, the twin-comparison argument is invoked, and it is shown that, with the optimal feature sharing strategy, a system can achieve 9$\times$ resource saving and 1.43$\times$ improvement in detection performance.
