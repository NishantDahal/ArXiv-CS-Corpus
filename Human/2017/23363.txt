Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Scheduling in Multi-channel Cognitive Radio Networks: A broad perspective

Cooperative spectrum sensing has been proven to improve sensing performance of cognitive users in presence of spectral diversity. For multi-channel CRN (MC-CRN), designing a cooperative spectrum sensing scheme becomes quite challenging as it needs an optimal sensing scheduling scheme, which schedules cognitive users to different channels such that a good balance between detection performance and the discovery of spectrum holes is achieved. The main issue associated with cooperative spectrum sensing scheduling (CSSS) scheme is the design of an optimal schedule that could specify which SUs should be assigned to which channels at what time to achieve maximal network throughput with minimal amount of energy and satisfying the desirable sensing accuracy. In this regard, designing an efficient CSSS scheme for MC-CRN is of utmost importance for practical implementation of CRN. In this article, we explore CSSS problem from a broad perspective and present the different objectives and the inherent issues and challenges arise in designing the CSSS scheme. We also discuss the different methods used for modeling of the CSSS scheme for MC-CRN. Further, a few future research directions are listed which need investigation while developing the solution for CSSS problem.
