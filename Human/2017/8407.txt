Optimum Transmission Window for EPONs with Gated-Limited Service

This paper studies the Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) with gated-limited service. The transmission window (TW) is limited in this system to guaranteeing a bounded delay experienced by disciplined users, and to constrain malicious users from monopolizing the transmission channel. Thus, selecting an appropriate TW size is critical to the performance of EPON with gated-limited service discipline. To investigate the impact of TW size on packet delay, we derive a generalized mean waiting time formula for M/G/1 queue with vacation times and gated-limited service discipline. A distinguished feature of this model is that there are two queues in the buffer of each optical network unit (ONU): one queue is inside the gate and the other one is outside the gate. Furthermore, based on the Chernoff bound of queue length, we provide a simple rule to determine an optimum TW size for gated-limited service EPONs. Analytic results reported in this paper are all verified by simulations.
