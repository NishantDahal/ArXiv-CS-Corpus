Advances in Detection and Error Correction for Coherent Optical Communications: Regular, Irregular, and Spatially Coupled LDPC Code Designs

In this chapter, we show how the use of differential coding and the presence of phase slips in the transmission channel affect the total achievable information rates and capacity of a system. By means of the commonly used QPSK modulation, we show that the use of differential coding does not decrease the total amount of reliably conveyable information over the channel. It is a common misconception that the use of differential coding introduces an unavoidable differential loss. This perceived differential loss is rather a consequence of simplified differential detection and decoding at the receiver. Afterwards, we show how capacity-approaching coding schemes based on LDPC and spatially coupled LDPC codes can be constructed by combining iterative demodulation and decoding. For this, we first show how to modify the differential decoder to account for phase slips and then how to use this modified differential decoder to construct good LDPC codes. This construction method can serve as a blueprint to construct good and practical LDPC codes for other applications with iterative detection, such as higher order modulation formats with non-square constellations, multi-dimensional optimized modulation formats, turbo equalization to mitigate ISI (e.g., due to nonlinearities) and many more. Finally, we introduce the class of spatially coupled (SC)-LDPC codes, which are a generalization of LDPC codes with some outstanding properties and which can be decoded with a very simple windowed decoder. We show that the universal behavior of spatially coupled codes makes them an ideal candidate for iterative differential demodulation/detection and decoding.
