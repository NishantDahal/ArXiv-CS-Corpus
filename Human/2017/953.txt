A Review of Localization and Tracking Algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks

In this paper, a comprehensive survey of the pioneer as well as the state of-the-art localization and tracking methods in the wireless sensor networks is presented. Localization is mostly applicable for the static sensor nodes, whereas, tracking for the mobile sensor nodes. The localization algorithms are broadly classified as range-based and range-free methods. The estimated range (distance) between an anchor and an unknown node is highly erroneous in an indoor scenario. This limitation can be handled up to a large extent by employing a large number of existing access points (APs) in the range free localization method. Recent works emphasize on the use multi-sensor data like magnetic, inertial, compass, gyroscope, ultrasound, infrared, visual and/or odometer to improve the localization accuracy further. Additionally, tracking method does the future prediction of location based on the past location history. A smooth trajectory is noted even if some of the received measurements are erroneous. Real experimental set-ups such as National Instruments (NI) wireless sensor nodes, Crossbow motes and hand-held devices for carrying out the localization and tracking are also highlighted herein.
