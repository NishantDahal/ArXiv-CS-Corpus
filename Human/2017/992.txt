Automatic Wikipedia Link Generation Based On Interlanguage Links

This paper presents a new way to increase interconnectivity in small Wikipedias (fewer than a 100,000 articles), by automatically linking articles based on interlanguage links. Many small Wikipedias have many articles with very few links, this is mainly due to the short article length. This makes it difficult to navigate between the articles. In many cases the article does exist for a small Wikipedia, however the article is just missing a link. Due to the fact that Wikipedias are translated in to many languages, it allows us to generate new links for small Wikipedias using the links from a large Wikipedia (more than a 100,000 articles).
