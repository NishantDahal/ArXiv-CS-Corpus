A hybrid CPU-GPU parallelization scheme of variable neighborhood search for inventory optimization problems

In this paper, we study various parallelization schemes for the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic on a CPU-GPU system via OpenMP and OpenACC. A hybrid parallel VNS method is applied to recent benchmark problem instances for the multi-product dynamic lot sizing problem with product returns and recovery, which appears in reverse logistics and is known to be NP-hard. We report our findings regarding these parallelization approaches and present promising computational results.
