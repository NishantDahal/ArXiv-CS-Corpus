Wireless Powered Communications with Finite Battery and Finite Blocklength

We analyze a wireless communication system with finite block length and finite battery energy, under quasi-static Nakagami-m fading. Wireless energy transfer is carried out in the downlink while information transfer occurs in the uplink. Transmission strategies for scenarios with/without energy accumulation between transmission rounds are characterized in terms of error probability and energy consumption. A power control protocol for the energy accumulation scenario is proposed and results show the enormous impact on improving the system performance, in terms of error probability and energy consumption. The numerical results corroborate the existence and uniqueness of an optimum target error probability, while showing that a relatively small battery could be a limiting factor for some setups, specially when using the energy accumulation strategy.
