A Counterexample to the "Majority is Least Stable" Conjecture

We exhibit a linear threshold function in 5 variables with strictly smaller noise stability (for small values of the correlation parameter) than the majority function on 5 variables, thereby providing a counterexample to the "Majority is Least Stable" Conjecture of Benjamini, Kalai, and Schramm.
