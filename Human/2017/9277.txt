A Comment on "A New Degree of Freedom For Energy Efficiency of Digital Communication Systems"

This comment recalls a previously proposed encoding scheme involving two synchronized random number generators (RNGs) to compress the transmission message. It is also claimed that the recently proposed random number modulation (RNM) scheme suffers considerably from the severe error propagation, and that, in general, the overall energy consumption is minimized when all information bits are transmitted as fast as possible with the minimum latency.
