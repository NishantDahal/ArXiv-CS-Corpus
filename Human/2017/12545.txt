Similarity detection of rational space curves

We provide an algorithm to check whether two rational space curves are related by a similarity. The algorithm exploits the relationship between the curvatures and torsions of two similar curves, which is formulated in a computer algebra setting. Helical curves, where curvature and torsion are proportional, need to be distinguished as a special case. The algorithm is easy to implement, as it involves only standard computer algebra techniques, such as greatest common divisors and resultants, and Gr√∂bner basis for the special case of helical curves. Details on the implementation and experimentation carried out using the computer algebra system Maple 18 are provided.
