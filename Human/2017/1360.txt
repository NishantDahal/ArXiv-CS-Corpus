Sparse Methods for Direction-of-Arrival Estimation

Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation refers to the process of retrieving the direction information of several electromagnetic waves/sources from the outputs of a number of receiving antennas that form a sensor array. DOA estimation is a major problem in array signal processing and has wide applications in radar, sonar, wireless communications, etc. With the development of sparse representation and compressed sensing, the last decade has witnessed a tremendous advance in this research topic. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of these sparse methods for DOA estimation, with a particular highlight on the recently developed gridless sparse methods, e.g., those based on covariance fitting and the atomic norm. Several future research directions are also discussed.
