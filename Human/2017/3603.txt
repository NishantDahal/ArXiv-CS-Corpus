Splitting method for spatio-temporal search efforts planning

This article deals with the spatio-temporal sensors deployment in order to maximize detection probability of an intelligent and randomly moving target in an area under surveillance. Our work is based on the rare events simulation framework. More precisely, we derive a novel stochastic optimization algorithm based on the generalized splitting method. This new approach offers promising results without any state-space discretization and can handle various types of constraints.
