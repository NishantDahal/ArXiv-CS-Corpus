Construction of q-ary Constant Weight Sequences using a Knuth-like Approach

We present an encoding and decoding scheme for constant weight sequences, that is, given an information sequence, the construction results in a sequence of specific weight within a certain range. The scheme uses a prefix design that is based on Gray codes. Furthermore, by adding redundant symbols we extend the range of weight values for output sequences, which is useful for some applications.
