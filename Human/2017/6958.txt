Robust Connectivity with Multiple Nonisotropic Antennas for Vehicular Communications

For critical services, such as traffic safety and traffic efficiency, it is advisable to design systems with robustness as the main criteria, possibly at the price of reduced peak performance and efficiency. Ensuring robust communications in case of embedded or hidden antennas is a challenging task due to nonisotropic radiation patterns of these antennas. The challenges due to the nonisotropic radiation patterns can be overcome with the use of multiple antennas. In this paper, we describe a simple, low-cost method for combining the output of multiple nonisotropic antennas to guarantee robustness, i.e., support reliable communications in worst-case scenarios. The combining method is designed to minimize the burst error probability, i.e., the probability of consecutive decoding errors of status messages arriving periodically at a receiver from an arbitrary angle of arrival. The proposed method does not require the knowledge of instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios or the complex-valued channel gains at the antenna outputs. The proposed method is applied to measured and theoretical antenna radiation patterns, and it is shown that the method supports robust communications from an arbitrary angle of arrival.
