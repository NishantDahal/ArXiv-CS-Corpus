Joint Large Deviation principle for empirical measures of the d-regular random graphs

For a $d-$regular random model, we assign to vertices $q-$state spins. From this model, we define the \emph{empirical co-operate measure}, which enumerates the number of co-operation between a given couple of spins, and \emph{ empirical spin measure}, which enumerates the number of sites having a given spin on the $d-$regular random graph model. For these empirical measures we obtain large deviation principle(LDP) in the weak topology.
