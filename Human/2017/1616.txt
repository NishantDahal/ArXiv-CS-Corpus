Geometric stability via information theory

The Loomis-Whitney inequality, and the more general Uniform Cover inequality, bound the volume of a body in terms of a product of the volumes of lower-dimensional projections of the body. In this paper, we prove stability versions of these inequalities, showing that when they are close to being tight, the body in question is close in symmetric difference to a 'box'. Our results are best possible up to a constant factor depending upon the dimension alone. Our approach is information theoretic.
  We use our stability result for the Loomis-Whitney inequality to obtain a stability result for the edge-isoperimetric inequality in the infinite $d$-dimensional lattice. Namely, we prove that a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with small edge-boundary must be close in symmetric difference to a $d$-dimensional cube. Our bound is, again, best possible up to a constant factor depending upon $d$ alone.
