Downlink Power Control in User-Centric and Cell-Free Massive MIMO Wireless Networks

Recently, the so-called cell-free Massive MIMO architecture has been introduced, wherein a very large number of distributed access points (APs) simultaneously and jointly serve a much smaller number of mobile stations (MSs). A variant of the cell-free technique is the user-centric approach, wherein each AP just decodes the MSs that it receives with the largest power. This paper considers both the cell-free and user-centric approaches, and, using an interplay of sequential optimization and alternating optimization, derives downlink power-control algorithms aimed at maximizing either the minimum users' SINR (to ensure fairness), or the system sum-rate. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, as well as that the user-centric approach generally outperforms the CF one.
