Refounding legitimacy towards Aethogenesis

The fusion of humans and technology takes us into an unknown world described by some authors as populated by quasi living species that would relegate us - ordinary humans - to the rank of alienated agents emptied of our identity and consciousness. I argue instead that our world is woven of simple though invisible perspectives which - if we become aware of them - may renew our ability for making judgments and enhance our autonomy. I became aware of these invisible perspectives by observing and practicing a real time collective net art experiment called the Poietic Generator. As the perspectives unveiled by this experiment are invisible I have called them anoptical perspectives i.e. non-optical by analogy with the optical perspective of the Renaissance. Later I have come to realize that these perspectives obtain their cognitive structure from the political origins of our language. Accordingly it is possible to define certain cognitive criteria for assessing the legitimacy of the anoptical perspectives just like some artists and architects of the Renaissance defined the geometrical criteria that established the legitimacy of the optical one.
