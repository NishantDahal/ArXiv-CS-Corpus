A New Combination of Message Passing Techniques for Receiver Design in MIMO-OFDM Systems

In this paper, we propose a new combined message passing algorithm which allows belief propagation (BP) and mean filed (MF) applied on a same factor node, so that MF can be applied to hard constraint factors. Based on the proposed message passing algorithm, a iterative receiver is designed for MIMO-OFDM systems. Both BP and MF are exploited to deal with the hard constraint factor nodes involving the multiplication of channel coefficients and data symbols to reduce the complexity of the only BP used. The numerical results show that the BER performance of the proposed low complexity receiver closely approach that of the state-of-the-art receiver, where only BP is used to handled the hard constraint factors, in the high SNRs.
