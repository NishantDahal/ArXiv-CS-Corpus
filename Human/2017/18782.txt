MK-fuzzy Automata and MSO Logics

We introduce MK-fuzzy automata over a bimonoid K which is related to the fuzzification of the McCarthy-Kleene logic. Our automata are inspired by, and intend to contribute to, practical applications being in development  in a project on runtime network monitoring based on predicate logic. We investigate closure properties of the class of recognizable MK-fuzzy languages accepted by MK-fuzzy automata as well as of deterministically recognizable MK-fuzzy languages accepted by their deterministic counterparts. Moreover, we establish a Nivat-like result for recognizable MK-fuzzy languages. We introduce an MK-fuzzy MSO logic and show the expressive equivalence of a fragment of this logic with MK-fuzzy automata, i.e., a BÃ¼chi type theorem.
