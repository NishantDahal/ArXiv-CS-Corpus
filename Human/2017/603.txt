A Survey of XML Tree Patterns

With XML becoming an ubiquitous language for data interoperability purposes in various domains, efficiently querying XML data is a critical issue. This has lead to the design of algebraic frameworks based on tree-shaped patterns akin to the tree-structured data model of XML. Tree patterns are graphic representations of queries over data trees. They are actually matched against an input data tree to answer a query. Since the turn of the twenty-first century, an astounding research effort has been focusing on tree pattern models and matching optimization (a primordial issue). This paper is a comprehensive survey of these topics, in which we outline and compare the various features of tree patterns. We also review and discuss the two main families of approaches for optimizing tree pattern matching, namely pattern tree minimization and holistic matching. We finally present actual tree pattern-based developments, to provide a global overview of this significant research topic.
