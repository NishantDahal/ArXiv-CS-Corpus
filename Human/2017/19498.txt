The exponentiated Hencky energy: Anisotropic extension and case studies

In this paper we propose an anisotropic extension of the isotropic exponentiated Hencky energy, based on logarithmic strain invariants. Unlike other elastic formulations, the isotropic exponentiated Hencky elastic energy has been derived solely on differential geometric grounds, involving the geodesic distance of the deformation gradient F to the group of rotations. We formally extend this approach towards anisotropy by defining additional anisotropic logarithmic strain invariants with the help of suitable structural tensors and consider our findings for selected case studies.
