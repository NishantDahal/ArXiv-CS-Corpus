Optimization of the Waiting Time for H-R Coordination

An analytical model of Human-Robot (H-R) coordination is presented for a Human-Robot system executing a collaborative task in which a high level of synchronization among the agents is desired. The influencing parameters and decision variables that affect the waiting time of the collaborating agents were analyzed. The performance of the model was evaluated based on the costs of the waiting times of each of the agents at the pre-defined spatial point of handover. The model was tested for two cases of dynamic H-R coordination scenarios. Results indicate that this analytical model can be used as a tool for designing an H-R system that optimizes the agent waiting time thereby increasing the joint-efficiency of the system and making coordination fluent and natural.
