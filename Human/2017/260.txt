On the Error Probability of Short Concatenated Polar and Cyclic Codes with Interleaving

In this paper, the analysis of the performance of the concatenation of a short polar code with an outer binary linear block code is addressed from a distance spectrum viewpoint. The analysis targets the case where an outer cyclic code is employed together with an inner systematic polar code. A concatenated code ensemble is introduced placing an interleaver at the input of the polar encoder. The introduced ensemble allows deriving bounds on the achievable error rates under maximum likelihood decoding, by applying the union bound to the (expurgated) average weight enumerators. The analysis suggests the need of careful optimization of the outer code, to attain low error floors.
