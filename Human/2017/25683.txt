Real-time Video Processing in Web Applications

The OpenGL ES standard is implemented in modern desktop and mobile browsers through the WebGL API. This paper explores the potential for using OpenGL ES hardware acceleration for real time video processing in standard HTML5 applications. It analyses the WebGL performance across device types and compares it with the standard JavaScript and canvas performance.
