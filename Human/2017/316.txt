Computations with p-adic numbers

This document contains the notes of a lecture I gave at the "Journ√©es Nationales du Calcul Formel" (JNCF) on January 2017. The aim of the lecture was to discuss low-level algorithmics for p-adic numbers. It is divided into two main parts: first, we present various implementations of p-adic numbers and compare them and second, we introduce a general framework for studying precision issues and apply it in several concrete situations.
