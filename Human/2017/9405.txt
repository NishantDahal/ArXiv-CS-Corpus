Dimension-Dependent Upper Bounds for Grobner Bases

We improve certain degree bounds for Grobner bases of polynomial ideals in generic position. We work exclusively in deterministically verifiable and achievable generic positions of a combinatorial nature, namely either strongly stable position or quasi stable position. Furthermore, we exhibit new dimension- (and depth-)dependent upper bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the degrees of the elements of the reduced Grobner basis (w.r.t. the degree reverse lexicographical ordering) of a homogeneous ideal in these positions.
