Observing IoT Resources over ICN

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an HTTP-like protocol for RESTful applications intended to run on constrained devices, typically part of the Internet of Things. CoAP observe is an extension to the CoAP specification that allows CoAP clients to observe a resource through a simple publish/subscribe mechanism. In this paper we leverage Information-Centric Networking (ICN), transparently deployed within the domain of a network provider, to provide enhanced CoAP services. We present the design and the implementation of CoAP observe over ICN and we discuss how ICN can provide benefits to both network providers and CoAP applications, even though the latter are not aware of the existence of ICN. In particular, the use of ICN results in smaller state management and simpler implementation at CoAP endpoints, and less communication overhead in the network.
