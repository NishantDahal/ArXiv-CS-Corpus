Convex polygons in geometric triangulations

We show that the maximum number of convex polygons in a triangulation of $n$ points in the plane is $O(1.5029^n)$. This improves an earlier bound of $O(1.6181^n)$ established by van Kreveld, Löffler, and Pach (2012) and almost matches the current best lower bound of $Ω(1.5028^n)$ due to the same authors. Given a planar straight-line graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we show how to compute efficiently the number of convex polygons in $G$.
