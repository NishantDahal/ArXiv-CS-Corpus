Reverse Engineering of Communications Networks: Evolution and Challenges

Reverse engineering of a communications network is the process of identifying the communications protocol used in the network. This problem arises in various situations such as eavesdropping, intelligent jamming, cognitive radio, and adaptive coding and modulation (ACM). According to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, the first step in reverse engineering of communications networks is recognition of physical layer which consists of recognition of digital modulations and identification of physical layer transmission techniques. The next step is recognition of data link layer (consisting of frame synchronization, recognition of channel codes, reconstruction of interleavers, reconstruction of scramblers, etc.) and also recognition of network and transport layers. The final step in reverse engineering of communications networks is recognition of upper layers which essentially can be seen as identification of source encoders. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on the current methods for reverse engineering of communications networks. Furthermore, challenges and open research issues in this field are introduced.
