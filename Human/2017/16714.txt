AI Challenges in Human-Robot Cognitive Teaming

Among the many anticipated roles for robots in the future is that of being a human teammate. Aside from all the technological hurdles that have to be overcome with respect to hardware and control to make robots fit to work with humans, the added complication here is that humans have many conscious and subconscious expectations of their teammates - indeed, we argue that teaming is mostly a cognitive rather than physical coordination activity. This introduces new challenges for the AI and robotics community and requires fundamental changes to the traditional approach to the design of autonomy. With this in mind, we propose an update to the classical view of the intelligent agent architecture, highlighting the requirements for mental modeling of the human in the deliberative process of the autonomous agent. In this article, we outline briefly the recent efforts of ours, and others in the community, towards developing cognitive teammates along these guidelines.
