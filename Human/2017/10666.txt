An optimization technique on pseudorandom generators based on chaotic iterations

Internet communication systems involving cryptography and data hiding often require billions of random numbers. In addition to the speed of the algorithm, the quality of the pseudo-random number generator and the ease of its implementation are common practical aspects. In this work we will discuss how to improve the quality of random numbers independently from their generation algorithm. We propose an additional implementation technique in order to take advantage of some chaotic properties. The statistical quality of our solution stems from some well-defined discrete chaotic iterations that satisfy the reputed Devaney's definition of chaos, namely the chaotic iterations technique. Pursuing recent researches published in the previous International Conference on Evolving Internet (Internet 09, 10, and 11), three methods to build pseudorandom generators by using chaotic iterations are recalled. Using standard criteria named NIST and DieHARD (some famous batteries of tests), we will show that the proposed technique can improve the statistical properties of a large variety of defective pseudorandom generators, and that the issues raised by statistical tests decrease when the power of chaotic iterations increase.
