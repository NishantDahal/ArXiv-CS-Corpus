Artificial Generation of Big Data for Improving Image Classification: A Generative Adversarial Network Approach on SAR Data

Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) large-scale SAR image databases are still an unresolved issue in the Remote Sensing field. In this work, we propose such a dataset and use it to explore patch-based classification in urban and periurban areas, considering 7 distinct semantic classes. In this context, we investigate the accuracy of large CNN classification models and pre-trained networks for SAR imaging systems. Furthermore, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for SAR image generation and test, whether the synthetic data can actually improve classification accuracy.
