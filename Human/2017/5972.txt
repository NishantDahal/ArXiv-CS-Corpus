Kanban + X: Leveraging Kanban for Focused Improvements

Agile Development is used for many problems, often with different priorities and challenges. However, generalized engineering methodologies often overlook the particularities of a project. To solve this problem, we have looked at ways engineers have modified development methodologies for a particular focus, and created a generalized framework for leveraging Kanban towards focused improvements. The result is a parallel iterative board that tracks and visualizes progress towards a focus, which we have applied to security, sustainability, and high performance as examples. Through use of this system, software projects can be more focused and directed towards their goals.
