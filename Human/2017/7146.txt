Distributed Hypothesis Testing Over Noisy Channels

A distributed binary hypothesis testing problem, in which multiple observers transmit their observations to a detector over noisy channels, is studied. Given its own side information, the goal of the detector is to decide between two hypotheses for the joint distribution of the data. Single-letter upper and lower bounds on the optimal type 2 error exponent (T2-EE), when the type 1 error probability vanishes with the block-length are obtained. These bounds coincide and characterize the optimal T2-EE when only a single helper is involved. Our result shows that the optimal T2-EE depends on the marginal distributions of the data and the channels rather than their joint distribution. However, an operational separation between HT and channel coding does not hold, and the optimal T2-EE is achieved by generating channel inputs correlated with observed data.
