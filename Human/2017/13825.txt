An Opportunistic AODV Routing Scheme : A Cognitive Mobile Agents Approach

In Manets Dynamics and Robustness are the key features of the nodes and are governed by several routing protocols such as AODV, DSR and so on. However in the network the growing resource demand leads to resource scarcity. The Node Mobility often leads to the link breakages and high routing overhead decreasing the stability and reliability of the network connectivity. In this context, the paper proposes a novel opportunistic AODV routing scheme which implements a cognitive agent based intelligent technique to set up a stable connectivity over the Manet. The Scheme computes the routing metric (rf) based on the collaboration sensitivity levels of the nodes obtained based through the knowledge based decision. This Routing Metric is subsequently used to set up the stable path for network connectivity. Thus minimizes the route overhead and increases the stability of the path. The Performance evaluation is conducted in comparison with the AODV and sleep AODV routing protocol and validated.
