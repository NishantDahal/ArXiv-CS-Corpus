A Joint Resource Allocation Scheme for Multi-User Full-Duplex OFDMA Systems

Full-duplex is a promising technology and great system performance enhancement can be achieved especially when we apply it to base stations. In this paper, we consider a Multi-User OFDMA network consisting of one Full-duplex base station, several uplink users, and a number of downlink users. A joint subcarrier, downlink user and uplink user mapping and power allocation optimization problem is investigated. In detail, we first decompose the 3-dimensional mapping problem into three 2-dimensional sub-problems and solve them by iteratively using classical Hungarian Method. Then, based on the dual method, we sequentially solve the power allocation and 3-dimensional mapping problem at each dual point. And the optimal solution to the dual problem is derived by using sub-gradient method. Unlike existing methods that only solve one sub-problem but with a high computation complexity, we tackle both of them and successfully reducing computation complexity from exponential to polynomial order. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed system.
