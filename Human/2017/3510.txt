A correction on Shiloach's algorithm for minimum linear arrangement of trees

More than 30 years ago, Shiloach published an algorithm to solve the minimum linear arrangement problem for undirected trees. Here we fix a small error in the original version of the algorithm and discuss its effect on subsequent literature. We also improve some aspects of the notation.
