Multi Agent Driven Data Mining For Knowledge Discovery in Cloud Computing

This paper depicts the use of data mining process, OLAP with the combination of multi agent system to find the knowledge from data in cloud computing. For this, I am also trying to explain one case study of online shopping of one Bakery Shop. May be we can increase the sale of items by using the model, which I am trying to represent.
