Spike sorting using non-volatile metal-oxide memristors

Electrophysiological techniques have improved substantially over the past years to the point that neuroprosthetics applications are becoming viable. This evolution has been fuelled by the advancement of implantable microelectrode technologies that have followed their own version of Moore's scaling law. Similarly to electronics, however, excessive data-rates and strained power budgets require the development of more efficient computation paradigms for handling neural data in-situ, in particular the computationally heavy task of events classification. Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsic analogue programmability of memristive devices can be exploited to perform spike-sorting. We then show how combining memristors with standard logic enables efficient in-silico template matching. Leveraging the physical properties of nanoscale memristors allows us to implement ultra-compact analogue circuits for neural signal processing at the power cost of digital.
