Complex Event Processing of Health Data in Real-time to Predict Heart Failure Risk and Stress

In this paper, we develop a scalable system which can do real-time analytics for different health applications. The occurrence of different health conditions can be regarded as the complex events and thus this concept can be extended to other use cases easily. Large number of users should be able to send the data in real-time, and should be able to receive the feedback and result. Keeping the requirements in mind we used Kafka and Spark to develop our system. In this setting, multiple users are running Kafka producer clients, which are sending data in real-time. Spark streaming is used to process data from Kafka of different window sizes to analyze the health conditions. We have developed and tested the heart attack risk and stress prediction as our sample complex events detection use cases. We have simulated and tested our system with multiple health datasets.
