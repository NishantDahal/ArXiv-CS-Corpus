A Refutation of Guinea's "Understanding SAT is in P"

In this work, we summarize and critique the paper "Understanding SAT is in P" by Alejandro SÃ¡nchez Guinea [arXiv:1504.00337]. The paper claims to present a polynomial-time solution for the NP-complete language 3-SAT. We show that Guinea's algorithm is flawed and does not prove 3-SAT is in P.
