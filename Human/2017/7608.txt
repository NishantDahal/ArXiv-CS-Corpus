Microstructure Representation and Reconstruction of Heterogeneous Materials via Deep Belief Network for Computational Material Design

Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) aims to accelerate optimal design of complex material systems by integrating material science and design automation. For tractable ICME, it is required that (1) a structural feature space be identified to allow reconstruction of new designs, and (2) the reconstruction process be property-preserving. The majority of existing structural presentation schemes rely on the designer's understanding of specific material systems to identify geometric and statistical features, which could be biased and insufficient for reconstructing physically meaningful microstructures of complex material systems. In this paper, we develop a feature learning mechanism based on convolutional deep belief network to automate a two-way conversion between microstructures and their lower-dimensional feature representations, and to achieves a 1000-fold dimension reduction from the microstructure space. The proposed model is applied to a wide spectrum of heterogeneous material systems with distinct microstructural features including Ti-6Al-4V alloy, Pb63-Sn37 alloy, Fontainebleau sandstone, and Spherical colloids, to produce material reconstructions that are close to the original samples with respect to 2-point correlation functions and mean critical fracture strength. This capability is not achieved by existing synthesis methods that rely on the Markovian assumption of material microstructures.
