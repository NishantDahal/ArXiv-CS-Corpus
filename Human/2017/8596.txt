Ambiguity set and learning via Bregman and Wasserstein

Construction of ambiguity set in robust optimization relies on the choice of divergences between probability distributions. In distribution learning, choosing appropriate probability distributions based on observed data is critical for approximating the true distribution. To improve the performance of machine learning models, there has recently been interest in designing objective functions based on Lp-Wasserstein distance rather than the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we derive concentration and asymptotic results using Bregman divergence. We propose a novel asymmetric statistical divergence called Wasserstein-Bregman divergence as a generalization of L2-Wasserstein distance. We discuss how these results can be applied to the construction of ambiguity set in robust optimization.
