Enhancing Path-Oriented Test Data Generation Using Adaptive Random Testing Techniques

In this paper, we have developed an approach to generate test data for path coverage based testing. The main challenge of this kind testing lies in its ability to build efficiently such a test suite in order to minimize the number of rejects. We address this problem with a novel divide-and-conquer approach based on adaptive random testing strategy. Our approach takes as input the constraints of an executable path and computes a tight over-approximation of their associated sub-domain by using a dynamic domain partitioning approach. We implemented this approach and got experimental results that show the practical benefits compared to existing approaches. Our method generates less invalid inputs and is capable of obtaining the sub-domain of many complex constraints.
