Machine Learning as Statistical Data Assimilation

We identify a strong equivalence between neural network based machine learning (ML) methods and the formulation of statistical data assimilation (DA), known to be a problem in statistical physics. DA, as used widely in physical and biological sciences, systematically transfers information in observations to a model of the processes producing the observations. The correspondence is that layer label in the ML setting is the analog of time in the data assimilation setting. Utilizing aspects of this equivalence we discuss how to establish the global minimum of the cost functions in the ML context, using a variational annealing method from DA. This provides a design method for optimal networks for ML applications and may serve as the basis for understanding the success of "deep learning". Results from an ML example are presented.
  When the layer label is taken to be continuous, the Euler-Lagrange equation for the ML optimization problem is an ordinary differential equation, and we see that the problem being solved is a two point boundary value problem. The use of continuous layers is denoted "deepest learning". The Hamiltonian version provides a direct rationale for back propagation as a solution method for the canonical momentum; however, it suggests other solution methods are to be preferred.
