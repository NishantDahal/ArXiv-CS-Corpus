Homogeneous Wavelets and Framelets with the Refinable Structure

Homogeneous wavelets and framelets have been extensively investigated in the classical theory of wavelets and they are often constructed from refinable functions via the multiresolution analysis. On the other hand, nonhomogeneous wavelets and framelets enjoy many desirable theoretical properties and are often intrinsically linked to the refinable structure and multiresolution analysis. In this paper we shall provide a comprehensive study on connecting homogeneous wavelets and framelets to nonhomogeneous ones with the refinable structure. This allows us to understand better the structure of homogeneous wavelets and framelets as well as their connections to the refinable structure and multiresolution analysis.
