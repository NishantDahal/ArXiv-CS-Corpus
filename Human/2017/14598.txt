AG codes and AG quantum codes from the GGS curve

In this paper, algebraic-geometric (AG) codes associated with the GGS maximal curve are investigated. The Weierstrass semigroup at all $\mathbb F_{q^2}$-rational points of the curve is determined; the Feng-Rao designed minimum distance is computed for infinite families of such codes, as well as the automorphism group. As a result, some linear codes with better relative parameters with respect to one-point Hermitian codes are discovered. Classes of quantum and convolutional codes are provided relying on the constructed AG codes.
