Diffusive Molecular Communication with Nanomachine Mobility

This work presents a performance analysis for diffusive molecular communication with mobile transmit and receive nanomachines. To begin with, the optimal test is obtained for symbol detection at the receiver nanomachine. Subsequently, closed-form expressions are derived for the probabilities of detection and false alarm, probability of error, and capacity considering also aberrations such as multi-source interference, inter-symbol interference, and counting errors. Simulation results are presented to corroborate the theoretical results derived and also, to yield various insights into the performance of the system. Interestingly, it is shown that the performance of the mobile diffusive molecular communication can be significantly enhanced by allocating large fraction of total available molecules for transmission as the slot interval increases.
