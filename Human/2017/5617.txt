Random Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave NOMA Networks

This paper investigates the coexistence between two key enabling technologies for the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Particularly, the application of random beamforming to the addressed mmWave-NOMA scenario is considered in this paper, in order to avoid the requirement that the base station knows all the users' channel state information. Stochastic geometry is used to characterize the performance of the proposed mmWave-NOMA transmission scheme, by using the key features of mmWave systems, e.g., mmWave transmission is highly directional and potential blockages will thin the user distribution. Two random beamforming approaches which can further reduce the system overhead are also proposed to the addressed mmWave-NOMA communication scenario, where their performance is studied by developing analytical results about sum rates and outage probabilities. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mmWave-NOMA transmission schemes and verify the accuracy of the developed analytical results.
