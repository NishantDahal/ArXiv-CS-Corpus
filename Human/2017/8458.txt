On the Privacy of the Opal Data Release: A Response

This document is a response to a report from the University of Melbourne on the privacy of the Opal dataset release. The Opal dataset was released by Data61 (CSIRO) in conjunction with the Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW). The data consists of two separate weeks of "tap-on/tap-off" data of individuals who used any of the four different modes of public transport from TfNSW: buses, light rail, train and ferries. These taps are recorded through the smart ticketing system, known as Opal, available in the state of New South Wales, Australia.
