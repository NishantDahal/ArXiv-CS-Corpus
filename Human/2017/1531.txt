RAdNet-VE: An Interest-Centric Mobile Ad Hoc Network for Vehicular Environments

In this study, we propose a variation of the RAdNet for vehicular environments (RAdNet-VE). The proposed scheme extends the message header, mechanism for registering interest, and message forwarding mechanism of RAdNet. To obtain results, we performed simulation experiments involving two use scenarios and communication protocols developed from the Veins framework. Based on results obtained from these experiments, we compare the performance of RAdNet-VE against that of RAdNet, a basic content-centric network (CCN) using reactive data routing, (CCN$_R$), and a basic CCN using proactive data routing, CCN$_P$. These CCNs provide non-cacheable data services. Moreover, the communication radio standards adopted in the scenarios 1 and 2 were respectively IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11p. The results shown that the performance of the RAdNet-VE was superior to than those of RAdNet, CCN$_R$ and CCN$_P$. In this sense, RAdNet-VE protocol (RVEP) presented low communication latencies among nodes of just 20.4ms (scenario 1) and 2.87 ms (scenario 2). Our protocol also presented high data delivery rates, i.e, 83.05\% (scenario 1) and 88.05\% (scenario 2). Based on these and other results presented in this study, we argue that RAdNet-VE is a feasible alternative to CCNs as information-centric network (ICN) model for VANET, because the RVEP satisfies all of the necessary communication requirements.
