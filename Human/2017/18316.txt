The Arbitrarily Varying Broadcast Channel with Degraded Message Sets with Causal Side Information at the Encoder

In this work, we study the arbitrarily varying broadcast channel (AVBC), when state information is available at the transmitter in a causal manner. We establish inner and outer bounds on both the random code capacity region and the deterministic code capacity region with degraded message sets. The capacity region is then determined for a class of channels satisfying a condition on the mutual informations between the strategy variables and the channel outputs. As an example, we consider the arbitrarily varying binary symmetric broadcast channel with correlated noises. We show cases where the condition holds, hence the capacity region is determined, and other cases where there is a gap between the bounds.
