Measurement of amplitude of the moiré patterns in digital autostereoscopic 3D display

The article presents the experimental measurements of the amplitude of the moiré patterns in a digital autostereoscopic barrier-type 3D display across a wide angular range with a small increment. The period and orientation of the moiré patterns were also measured as functions of the angle. Simultaneous branches are observed and analyzed. The theoretical interpretation is also given. The results can help preventing or minimizing the moiré effect in displays.
