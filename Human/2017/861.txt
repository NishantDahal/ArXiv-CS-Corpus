A note on dual demodulator continuous transmission frequency modulation technique

The range resolution in conventional continuous time frequency modulation (CTFM) is inversely proportional to the signal bandwidth. The dual-demodulator continuous time frequency modulation (DD-CTFM) processing technique was proposed by Gough et al [1] as a method to increase the range resolution by making the output of DD-CTFM truly continuous. However, it has been found that in practice the range resolution is still limited by the signal bandwidth. The limitation of DD-CTFM has been explained using simulations and mathematically in this paper.
