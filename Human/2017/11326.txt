Network Simplex Algorithm associated with the Maximum Flow Problem

In the present paper, we apply the network simplex algorithm for solving the minimum cost flow problem, to the maximum flow problem. Then we prove that the cycling phenomenon which causes the infinite loop in the algorithm, does not occur in the network simplex algorithm associated with the maximum flow problem.
