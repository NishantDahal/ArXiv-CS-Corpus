Realizing Half-Diminished Reality from Video Stream of Manipulating Objects

When we watch a video, in which human hands manipulate objects, these hands may obscure some parts of those objects. We are willing to make clear how the objects are manipulated by making the image of hands semi-transparent, and showing the complete images of the hands and the object. By carefully choosing a Half-Diminished Reality method, this paper proposes a method that can process the video in real time and verifies that the proposed method works well.
