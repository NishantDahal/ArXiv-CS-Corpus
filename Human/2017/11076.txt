Aztec: A Platform to Render Biomedical Software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable

Precision medicine and health requires the characterization and phenotyping of biological systems and patient datasets using a variety of data formats. This scenario mandates the centralization of various tools and resources in a unified platform to render them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR Principles). Leveraging these principles, Aztec provides the scientific community with a new platform that promotes a long-term, sustainable ecosystem of biomedical research software. Aztec is available at https://aztec.bio and its source code is hosted at https://github.com/BD2K-Aztec.
