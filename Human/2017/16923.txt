A Converse Bound on Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner Network via Gray-Wyner Network

We show a reduction method to construct a code for the Gray-Wyner (GW) network from a given code for the Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner (WAK) network. By combining this reduction with a converse bound on the GW network, we derive a converse bound on the WAK network. The derived bound gives an alternative proof of the strong converse theorem for the WAK network.
