Elementary-base cirquent calculus I: Parallel and choice connectives

Cirquent calculus is a proof system manipulating circuit-style constructs rather than formulas. Using it, this article constructs a sound and complete axiomatization CL16 of the propositional fragment of computability logic (the game-semantically conceived logic of computational problems - see http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~japaridz/CL/ ) whose logical vocabulary consists of negation and parallel and choice connectives, and whose atoms represent elementary, i.e. moveless, games.
