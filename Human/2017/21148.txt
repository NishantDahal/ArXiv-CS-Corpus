Facial Key Points Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Network - NaimishNet

Facial Key Points (FKPs) Detection is an important and challenging problem in the fields of computer vision and machine learning. It involves predicting the co-ordinates of the FKPs, e.g. nose tip, center of eyes, etc, for a given face. In this paper, we propose a LeNet adapted Deep CNN model - NaimishNet, to operate on facial key points data and compare our model's performance against existing state of the art approaches.
