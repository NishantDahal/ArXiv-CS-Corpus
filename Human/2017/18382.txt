Linguistic Features of Genre and Method Variation in Translation: A Computational Perspective

In this paper we describe the use of text classification methods to investigate genre and method variation in an English - German translation corpus. For this purpose we use linguistically motivated features representing texts using a combination of part-of-speech tags arranged in bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams. The classification method used in this paper is a Bayesian classifier with Laplace smoothing. We use the output of the classifiers to carry out an extensive feature analysis on the main difference between genres and methods of translation.
