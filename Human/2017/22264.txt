A-Evac: the evacuation simulator for stochastic environment

We introduce an open-source software Aamks for fire risk assessment. This article focuses on a component of Aamks - an evacuation simulator named a-evac. A-evac models evacuation of humans in the fire environment produced by CFAST fire simulator. In the article we discuss the probabilistic evacuation approach, automatic planning of exit routes, the interactions amongst the moving evacuees and the impact of smoke on the humans. The results consist of risk values based on FED, F-N curves and evacuation animations.
