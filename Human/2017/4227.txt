Application of Information Centric Networking to NoSQL Databases: the Spatio-Temporal use case

This paper explores methodologies, advantages and challenges related to the use of the Information Centric Network technology for developing NoSQL distributed databases, which are expected to play a central role in the forthcoming IoT and BigData era. ICN services make possible to simplify the development of the database software, improve performance, and provide data-level access control. We use our findings for devising a NoSQL spatio-temporal database, named OpenGeoBase, and evaluate its performance with a real data set related to Intelligent Transport System applications.
