PAPR Reduction of OFDM Through Pilot Shifting

Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a long-standing problem which has been hindering its performance for decades. In this paper, we propose a new PAPR reduction scheme based on shifting pilot locations among the data symbols. Since no side information is sent to the receiver about the pilot locations, a novel pilot detection algorithm is devised here exploiting the pilot power and the relative constant distance property of pilots. The proposed scheme attains around 1.5 dB PAPR reduction. The pilot detection accuracy is shown to be very excellent ranging from 80% to 99% at 0 dB of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in different parameters. This scheme is very spectrally efficient with reduced complexity without degrading BER performance significantly
