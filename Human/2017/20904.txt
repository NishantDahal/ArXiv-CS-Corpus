Supermajority Sentiment Detection with External Influence in Large Social Networks

In a large social network whose members harbor binary sentiments towards an issue, we investigate the asymptotic accuracy of sentiment detection. We model the user sentiments by an Ising Markov random field model and allow the user sentiments to be biased by an external influence. We consider a general supermajority sentiment detection problem and show that the detection accuracy is affected by the network structure, its parameters, as well as the external influence level.
