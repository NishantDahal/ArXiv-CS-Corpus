Combinatorial Auctions Do Need Modest Interaction

We study the necessity of interaction for obtaining efficient allocations in subadditive combinatorial auctions. This problem was originally introduced by Dobzinski, Nisan, and Oren (STOC'14) as the following simple market scenario: $m$ items are to be allocated among $n$ bidders in a distributed setting where bidders valuations are private and hence communication is needed to obtain an efficient allocation. The communication happens in rounds: in each round, each bidder, simultaneously with others, broadcasts a message to all parties involved and the central planner computes an allocation solely based on the communicated messages. Dobzinski et.al. showed that no non-interactive ($1$-round) protocol with polynomial communication (in the number of items and bidders) can achieve approximation ratio better than $Ω(m^{{1}/{4}})$, while for any $r \geq 1$, there exists $r$-round protocols that achieve $\widetilde{O}(r \cdot m^{{1}/{r+1}})$ approximation with polynomial communication; in particular, $O(\log{m})$ rounds of interaction suffice to obtain an (almost) efficient allocation.
  A natural question at this point is to identify the "right" level of interaction (i.e., number of rounds) necessary to obtain an efficient allocation. In this paper, we resolve this question by providing an almost tight round-approximation tradeoff for this problem: we show that for any $r \geq 1$, any $r$-round protocol that uses polynomial communication can only approximate the social welfare up to a factor of $Ω(\frac{1}{r} \cdot m^{{1}/{2r+1}})$. This in particular implies that $Ω(\frac{\log{m}}{\log\log{m}})$ rounds of interaction are necessary for obtaining any efficient allocation in these markets. Our work builds on the recent multi-party round-elimination technique of Alon, Nisan, Raz, and Weinstein (FOCS'15) and settles an open question posed by Dobzinski et.al. and Alon et. al.
