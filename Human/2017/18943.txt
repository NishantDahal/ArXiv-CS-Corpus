A Nonparametric Model for Multimodal Collaborative Activities Summarization

Ego-centric data streams provide a unique opportunity to reason about joint behavior by pooling data across individuals. This is especially evident in urban environments teeming with human activities, but which suffer from incomplete and noisy data. Collaborative human activities exhibit common spatial, temporal, and visual characteristics facilitating inference across individuals from multiple sensory modalities as we explore in this paper from the perspective of meetings. We propose a new Bayesian nonparametric model that enables us to efficiently pool video and GPS data towards collaborative activities analysis from multiple individuals. We demonstrate the utility of this model for inference tasks such as activity detection, classification, and summarization. We further demonstrate how spatio-temporal structure embedded in our model enables better understanding of partial and noisy observations such as localization and face detections based on social interactions. We show results on both synthetic experiments and a new dataset of egocentric video and noisy GPS data from multiple individuals.
