Preserving Confidentiality in The Gaussian Broadcast Channel Using Compute-and-Forward

We study the transmission of confidential messages across a wireless broadcast channel with K>2 receivers and K helpers. The goal is to transmit all messages reliably to their intended receivers while keeping them confidential from the unintended receivers. We design a codebook based on nested lattice structure, cooperative jamming, lattice alignment, and i.i.d. coding. Moreover, we exploit the asymmetric compute-and-forward decoding strategy to handle finite SNR regimes. Unlike previous alignment schemes, our achievable rates are attainable at any finite SNR value. Also, we show that our scheme achieves the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom of 1 for the K-receiver Gaussian broadcast channel with K confidential messages and K helpers.
