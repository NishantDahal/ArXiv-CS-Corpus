Energy Efficient Beamforming for Massive MIMO Public Channel

For massive MIMO public channel with any sector size in either microwave or millimeter wave (mmwave) band, this paper studies the beamforming design to minimize the transmit power while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) for randomly deployed users. First the ideal beampattern is derived via Parseval Identity, based on which a beamforming design problem is formulated to minimize the gap with the idea beampattern. The problem is transformable to a multiconvex one and an iterative optimization algorithm is used to obtain the full-digital beamformer. In addition, with the help of same beampattern theorem, the power amplifier (PA) efficiency of the beamformer is improved with unchanged beampattern. Finally, the practical hybrid implementation is obtained that achieves the full-digital beamformer solution. Simulations verify the advantages of the proposed scheme over existing ones.
