Time Stretch Inspired Computational Imaging

We show that dispersive propagation of light followed by phase detection has properties that can be exploited for extracting features from the waveforms. This discovery is spearheading development of a new class of physics-inspired algorithms for feature extraction from digital images with unique properties and superior dynamic range compared to conventional algorithms. In certain cases, these algorithms have the potential to be an energy efficient and scalable substitute to synthetically fashioned computational techniques in practice today.
