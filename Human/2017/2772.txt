Multiuser Communication Based on the DFT Eigenstructure

The eigenstructure of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is examined and new systematic procedures to generate eigenvectors of the unitary DFT are proposed. DFT eigenvectors are suggested as user signatures for data communication over the real adder channel (RAC). The proposed multiuser communication system over the 2-user RAC is detailed.
