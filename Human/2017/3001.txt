Short-Message Communication and FIR System Identification using Huffman Sequences

Providing short-message communication and simultaneous channel estimation for sporadic and fast fading scenarios is a challenge for future wireless networks. In this work we propose a novel blind communication and deconvolution scheme by using Huffman sequences, which allows to solve three important tasks in one step: (i) determination of the transmit power (ii) identification of the discrete-time FIR channel by providing a maximum delay of less than $L/2$ and (iii) simultaneously communicating $L-1$ bits of information. Our signal reconstruction uses a recent semi-definite program that can recover two unknown signals from their auto-correlations and cross-correlations. This convex algorithm is stable and operates fully deterministic without any further channel assumptions.
