LibOPT: An Open-Source Platform for Fast Prototyping Soft Optimization Techniques

Optimization techniques play an important role in several scientific and real-world applications, thus becoming of great interest for the community. As a consequence, a number of open-source libraries are available in the literature, which ends up fostering the research and development of new techniques and applications. In this work, we present a new library for the implementation and fast prototyping of nature-inspired techniques called LibOPT. Currently, the library implements 15 techniques and 112 benchmarking functions, as well as it also supports 11 hypercomplex-based optimization approaches, which makes it one of the first of its kind. We showed how one can easily use and also implement new techniques in LibOPT under the C paradigm. Examples are provided with samples of source-code using benchmarking functions.
