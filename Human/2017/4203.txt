Image denoising by median filter in wavelet domain

The details of an image with noise may be restored by removing noise through a suitable image de-noising method. In this research, a new method of image de-noising based on using median filter (MF) in the wavelet domain is proposed and tested. Various types of wavelet transform filters are used in conjunction with median filter in experimenting with the proposed approach in order to obtain better results for image de-noising process, and, consequently to select the best suited filter. Wavelet transform working on the frequencies of sub-bands split from an image is a powerful method for analysis of images. According to this experimental work, the proposed method presents better results than using only wavelet transform or median filter alone. The MSE and PSNR values are used for measuring the improvement in de-noised images.
