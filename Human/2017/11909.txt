F-index of graphs based on four operations related to the lexicographic product

The forgotten topological index or F-index of a graph is defined as the sum of cubes of the degree of all the vertices of the graph. In this paper we study the F-index of four operations related to the lexicographic product on graphs which were introduced by Sarala et al. [D. Sarala, H. Deng, S.K. Ayyaswamya and S. Balachandrana, The Zagreb indices of graphs based on four new operations related to the lexicographic product, \textit{Applied Mathematics and Computation}, 309 (2017) 156--169.].
