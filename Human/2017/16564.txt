Optical Target Tracking by Scheduled Range Measurements

In this paper, optical target tracking, by regular target bearing measurements and target range in a lower and scheduled measurement rate is considered. Variance of the target range estimation error is used as scheduling criterion. For this purpose, target dynamic state vector in modified spherical coordinates is stated in such a way that all target states be decoupled from range-related target state. Target state dynamic equations in modified spherical coordinates for nearly constant velocity, nearly constant acceleration and coordinated turn rate kinematic models, are analytically derived. For resulted state dynamic equations, a UKF-IMM filter with range measurement scheduling is utilized as a tracking filter. It is shown that target states are estimated properly and applied filter has high performance in maneuvering target tracking.
