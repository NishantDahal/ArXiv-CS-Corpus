Large-scale JPEG steganalysis using hybrid deep-learning framework

Adoption of deep learning in image steganalysis is still in its initial stage. In this paper we propose a generic hybrid deep-learning framework for JPEG steganalysis incorporating the domain knowledge behind rich steganalytic models. Our proposed framework involves two main stages. The first stage is hand-crafted, corresponding to the convolution phase and the quantization & truncation phase of the rich models. The second stage is a compound deep neural network containing multiple deep subnets in which the model parameters are learned in the training procedure. We provided experimental evidences and theoretical reflections to argue that the introduction of threshold quantizers, though disable the gradient-descent-based learning of the bottom convolution phase, is indeed cost-effective. We have conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset extracted from ImageNet. The primary dataset used in our experiments contains 500,000 cover images, while our largest dataset contains five million cover images. Our experiments show that the integration of quantization and truncation into deep-learning steganalyzers do boost the detection performance by a clear margin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework is insensitive to JPEG blocking artifact alterations, and the learned model can be easily transferred to a different attacking target and even a different dataset. These properties are of critical importance in practical applications.
