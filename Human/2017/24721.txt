Pattern-Driven Data Cleaning

Data is inherently dirty and there has been a sustained effort to come up with different approaches to clean it. A large class of data repair algorithms rely on data-quality rules and integrity constraints to detect and repair the data. A well-studied class of integrity constraints is Functional Dependencies (FDs, for short) that specify dependencies among attributes in a relation. In this paper, we address three major challenges in data repairing: (1) Accuracy: Most existing techniques strive to produce repairs that minimize changes to the data. However, this process may produce incorrect combinations of attribute values (or patterns). In this work, we formalize the interaction of FD-induced patterns and select repairs that result in preserving frequent patterns found in the original data. This has the potential to yield a better repair quality both in terms of precision and recall. (2) Interpretability of repairs: Current data repair algorithms produce repairs in the form of data updates that are not necessarily understandable. This makes it hard to debug repair decisions and trace the chain of steps that produced them. To this end, we define a new formalism to declaratively express repairs that are easy for users to reason about. (3) Scalability: We propose a linear-time algorithm to compute repairs that outperforms state-of-the-art FD repairing algorithms by orders of magnitude in repair time. Our experiments using both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that our new repair approach consistently outperforms existing techniques both in terms of repair quality and scalability.
