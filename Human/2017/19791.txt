Optimal Resource Allocation in Distributed Broadband Wireless Communication Systems

This paper is concerned with optimization of distributed broadband wireless communication (BWC) systems. BWC systems contain a distributed antenna system (DAS) connected to a base station with optical fiber. Distributed BWC systems have been proposed as a solution to the power constraint problem in traditional cellular networks. So far, the research on BWC systems have advanced on two separate tracks, the design of the system to meet the quality of service requirements (QoS) and optimization of the location of the DAS. In this paper, we consider a combined optimization of BWC systems. We consider uplink communications in distributed BWC systems with multiple levels of priority traffic with arrivals and departures forming renewal processes. We develop an analysis that determines packet delay violation probability for each priority level as a function of the outage probability of the DAS through the application of results from renewal theory. Then, we determine the optimal locations of the antennas that minimize the antenna outage probability. We also study the tradeoff between the packet delay violation probability and packet loss probability. This work will be helpful in the designing of the distributed BWC systems.
