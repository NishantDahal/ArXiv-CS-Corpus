Simulating Cellular Communications in Vehicular Networks: Making SimuLTE Interoperable with Veins

The evolution of cellular technologies toward 5G progressively enables efficient and ubiquitous communications in an increasing number of fields. Among these, vehicular networks are being considered as one of the most promising and challenging applications, requiring support for communications in high-speed mobility and delay-constrained information exchange in proximity. In this context, simulation frameworks under the OMNeT++ umbrella are already available: SimuLTE and Veins for cellular and vehicular systems, respectively. In this paper, we describe the modifications that make SimuLTE interoperable with Veins and INET, which leverage the OMNeT++ paradigm, and allow us to achieve our goal without any modification to either of the latter two. We discuss the limitations of the previous solution, namely VeinsLTE, which integrates all three in a single framework, thus preventing independent evolution and upgrades of each building block.
