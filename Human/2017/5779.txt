A New Matching Algorithm for Multidimensional Persistence

An algorithm is presented that constructs an acyclic partial matching on the cells of a given simplicial complex from a vector-valued function defined on the vertices and extended to each simplex by taking the least common upper bound of the values on its vertices. The resulting acyclic partial matching may be used to construct a reduced filtered complex with the same multidimensional persistent homology as the original simplicial complex filtered by the sublevel sets of the function. Numerical tests show that in practical cases the rate of reduction in the number of cells achieved by the algorithm is substantial. This promises to be useful for the computation of multidimensional persistent homology of simplicial complexes filtered by sublevel sets of vector-valued functions.
