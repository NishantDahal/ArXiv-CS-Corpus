A feasibility study on SSVEP-based interaction with motivating and immersive virtual and augmented reality

Non-invasive steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems offer high bandwidth compared to other BCI types and require only minimal calibration and training. Virtual reality (VR) has been already validated as effective, safe, affordable and motivating feedback modality for BCI experiments. Augmented reality (AR) enhances the physical world by superimposing informative, context sensitive, computer generated content. In the context of BCI, AR can be used as a friendlier and more intuitive real-world user interface, thereby facilitating a more seamless and goal directed interaction. This can improve practicality and usability of BCI systems and may help to compensate for their low bandwidth. In this feasibility study, three healthy participants had to finish a complex navigation task in immersive VR and AR conditions using an online SSVEP BCI. Two out of three subjects were successful in all conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first work to present an SSVEP BCI that operates using target stimuli integrated in immersive VR and AR (head-mounted display and camera). This research direction can benefit patients by introducing more intuitive and effective real-world interaction (e.g. smart home control). It may also be relevant for user groups that require or benefit from hands free operation (e.g. due to temporary situational disability).
