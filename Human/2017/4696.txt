Performance Optimization of Network Coding Based Communication and Reliable Storage in Internet of Things

Internet or things (IoT) is changing our daily life rapidly. Although new technologies are emerging everyday and expanding their influence in this rapidly growing area, many classic theories can still find their places. In this paper, we study the important applications of the classic network coding theory in two important components of Internet of things, including the IoT core network, where data is sensed and transmitted, and the distributed cloud storage, where the data generated by the IoT core network is stored. First we propose an adaptive network coding (ANC) scheme in the IoT core network to improve the transmission efficiency. We demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme and the performance advantage over existing schemes through simulations. %Next we study the application of network coding in the distributed cloud storage. Next we introduce the optimal storage allocation problem in the network coding based distributed cloud storage, which aims at searching for the most reliable allocation that distributes the $n$ data components into $N$ data centers, given the failure probability $p$ of each data center. Then we propose a polynomial-time optimal storage allocation (OSA) scheme to solve the problem. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the storage reliability could be greatly improved by the OSA scheme.
