XML Warehousing and OLAP

The aim of this article is to present an overview of the major XML warehousing approaches from the literature, as well as the existing approaches for performing OLAP analyses over XML data (which is termed XML-OLAP or XOLAP; Wang et al., 2005). We also discuss the issues and future trends in this area and illustrate this topic by presenting the design of a unified, XML data warehouse architecture and a set of XOLAP operators expressed in an XML algebra.
