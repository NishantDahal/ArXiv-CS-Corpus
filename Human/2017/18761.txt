Observations on OMNeT++ Real-Time Behaviour

OMNeT++ is a widely used platform for all types of network simulations. The open source simulation framework Artery can be used to perform Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) simulations. This paper presents an approach for connecting this simulation and real-world VANET hardware to extend the test range and investigates the real-time behaviour of the simulation. As a Device Under Test (DUT) depends on real-time data to perform properly, different simulation scenarios running different hardware setups are presented. Additionally, the paper deals with the impacts of real-time losses on the test run outcomes. Most time dependant algorithms like the duplicate packet detection do not need very accurate real-time data and thus could be verified using the presented approach. Otherwise, in some cases such as testing of multi-hop communication, accurate real time is crucial.
