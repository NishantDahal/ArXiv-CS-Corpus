Fast Algorithms for the Computation of the Minimum Distance of a Random Linear Code

The minimum distance of a code is an important concept in information theory. Hence, computing the minimum distance of a code with a minimum computational cost is a crucial process to many problems in this area. In this paper, we present and evaluate a family of algorithms and implementations to compute the minimum distance of a random linear code over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ that are faster than different current implementations. In addition to the basic sequential implementations, we present parallel and vectorized implementations that render high performances on modern architectures. The attained performance results show the benefits of the developed optimized algorithms, which obtain remarkable performance improvements compared with state-of-the-art implementations widely used nowadays.
