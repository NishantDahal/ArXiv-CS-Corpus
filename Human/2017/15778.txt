Bufferless transmission in complex networks

Complex bufferless networks such as on-chip networks and optical burst switching networks haven't been paid enough attention in network science. In complex bufferless networks, the store and forward mechanism is not applicable, since the network nodes are not allowed to buffer data packets. In this paper, we study the data transmission process in complex bufferless networks from the perspective of network science. Specifically, we use the Price model to generate the underlying network topological structures. We propose a delivery queue based deflection mechanism, which accompanies the efficient routing protocol, to transmit data packets in bufferless networks. We investigate the average deflection times, packets loss rate, average arrival time, and how the network topological structure and some other factors affect these transmission performances. Our work provides some clues for the architecture and routing design of bufferless networks.
