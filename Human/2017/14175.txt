XBadges. Identifying and training soft skills with commercial video games

XBadges is a research project based on the hypothesis that commercial video games (nonserious games) can train soft skills. We measure persistence, spatial reasoning and risk taking before and after subjects participate in controlled game playing sessions. In addition, we have developed an automatic facial expression recognition system capable of inferring their emotions while playing, allowing us to study the role of emotions in soft skills acquisition. We have used Flappy Bird, Pacman and Tetris for assessing changes in persistence, risk taking and spatial reasoning respectively. Results show how playing Tetris significantly improves spatial reasoning and how playing Pacman significantly improves prudence in certain areas of behavior. As for emotions, they reveal that being concentrated helps to improve performance and skills acquisition. Frustration is also shown as a key element. With the results obtained we are able to glimpse multiple applications in areas which need soft skills development.
