The Augustin Center and The Sphere Packing Bound For Memoryless Channels

For any channel with a convex constraint set and finite Augustin capacity, existence of a unique Augustin center and associated Erven-Harremoes bound are established. Augustin-Legendre capacity, center, and radius are introduced and proved to be equal to the corresponding Renyi-Gallager entities. Sphere packing bounds with polynomial prefactors are derived for codes on two families of channels: (possibly non-stationary) memoryless channels with multiple additive cost constraints and stationary memoryless channels with convex constraints on the empirical distribution of the input codewords.
