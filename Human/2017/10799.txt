Sparsity-Based STAP Design Based on Alternating Direction Method with Gain/Phase Errors

We present a novel sparsity-based space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique based on the alternating direction method to overcome the severe performance degradation caused by array gain/phase (GP) errors. The proposed algorithm reformulates the STAP problem as a joint optimization problem of the spatio-Doppler profile and GP errors in both single and multiple snapshots, and introduces a target detector using the reconstructed spatio-Doppler profiles. Simulations are conducted to illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.
