Quantum Bit Commitment Protocol Based on Counterfactual Quantum Cryptography

We present a new quantum bit commitment (QBC) protocol based on counterfactual quantum cryptography. We analyze the security of this protocol, find that it can resist the attack presented by QBC's no-go theorem. Our protocol is simple, and probably give a new way of constructing QBC protocol.
