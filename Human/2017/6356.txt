Nonlinear Precoders for Massive MIMO Systems with General Constraints

We introduce a class of nonlinear least square error precoders with a general penalty function for multiuser massive MIMO systems. The generality of the penalty function allows us to consider several hardware limitations including transmitters with a predefined constellation and restricted number of active antennas. The large-system performance is then investigated via the replica method under the assumption of replica symmetry. It is shown that the least square precoders exhibit the "marginal decoupling property" meaning that the marginal distributions of all precoded symbols converge to a deterministic distribution. As a result, the asymptotic performance of the precoders is described by an equivalent single-user system. To address some applications of the results, we further study the asymptotic performance of the precoders when both the peak-to-average power ratio and number of active transmit antennas are constrained. Our numerical investigations show that for a desired distortion at the receiver side, proposed forms of the least square precoders need to employ around %35\%$ fewer number of active antennas compared to cases with random transmit antenna selection.
