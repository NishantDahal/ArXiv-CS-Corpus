Differential Generative Adversarial Networks: Synthesizing Non-linear Facial Variations with Limited Number of Training Data

In face-related applications with a public available dataset, synthesizing non-linear facial variations (e.g., facial expression, head-pose, illumination, etc.) through a generative model is helpful in addressing the lack of training data. In reality, however, there is insufficient data to even train the generative model for face synthesis. In this paper, we propose Differential Generative Adversarial Networks (D-GAN) that can perform photo-realistic face synthesis even when training data is small. Two discriminators are devised to ensure the generator to approximate a face manifold, which can express face changes as it wants. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to the amount of training data and synthesized images are useful to improve the performance of a face expression classifier.
