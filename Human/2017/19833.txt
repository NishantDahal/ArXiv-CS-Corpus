An FPTAS of Minimizing Total Weighted Completion Time on Single Machine with Position Constraint

In this paper we study the classical scheduling problem of minimizing the total weighted completion time on a single machine with the constraint that one specific job must be scheduled at a specified position. We give dynamic programs with pseudo-polynomial running time, and a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS).
