Aerial Rock Fragmentation Analysis in Low-Light Condition Using UAV Technology

In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has been introduced into the mining industry to conduct terrain surveying. This work investigates the application of UAVs with artificial lighting for measurement of rock fragmentation under poor lighting conditions, representing night shifts in surface mines or working conditions in underground mines. The study relies on indoor and outdoor experiments for rock fragmentation analysis using a quadrotor UAV. Comparison of the rock size distributions in both cases show that adequate artificial lighting enables similar accuracy to ideal lighting conditions.
