Distributed Decoding of Convolutional Network Error Correction Codes

A Viterbi-like decoding algorithm is proposed in this paper for generalized convolutional network error correction coding. Different from classical Viterbi algorithm, our decoding algorithm is based on minimum error weight rather than the shortest Hamming distance between received and sent sequences. Network errors may disperse or neutralize due to network transmission and convolutional network coding. Therefore, classical decoding algorithm cannot be employed any more. Source decoding was proposed by multiplying the inverse of network transmission matrix, where the inverse is hard to compute. Starting from the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) decoding criterion, we find that it is equivalent to the minimum error weight under our model. Inspired by Viterbi algorithm, we propose a Viterbi-like decoding algorithm based on minimum error weight of combined error vectors, which can be carried out directly at sink nodes and can correct any network errors within the capability of convolutional network error correction codes (CNECC). Under certain situations, the proposed algorithm can realize the distributed decoding of CNECC.
