Understanding the Spatial and Temporal Activity Patterns of Subway Mobility Flows

In urban transportation systems, mobility flows in the subway system reflect the spatial and temporal dynamics of working days. To investigate the variability of mobility flows, we analyse the spatial community through a series of snapshots of subway stations over sequential periods. Using Shanghai as a case study, we find that the spatial community snapshots reveal dynamic passenger activities. Adopting a dual-perspective, we apply spatial and temporal models separately to explore where and when individuals travel for entertainment. In the two models, microblog topics and spatial facilities such as food venues and entertainment businesses are used to characterise the spatial popularity of each station and people's travelling perceptions. In the studied case, the city centre is characterised by greater social influence, and it is better described by the spatial model. In the temporal model, shorter travel distances motivate individuals to start their trips earlier. Interestingly, as the number of food-related facilities near the starting station increases, until it exceeds 1563, the speed of people's journeys slows down. This study provides a method for modelling the effects of social features on mobility flows and for predicting the spatial-temporal mobility flows of newly built subway stations.
