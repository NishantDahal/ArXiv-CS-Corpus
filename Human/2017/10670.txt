A Cryptographic Approach for Steganography

In this research work, security concepts are formalized in steganography, and the common paradigms based on information theory are replaced by another ones inspired from cryptography, more practicable are closer than what is usually done in other cryptographic domains. These preliminaries lead to a first proof of a cryptographically secure information hiding scheme.
