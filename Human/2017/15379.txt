Unified Host and Network Data Set

The lack of data sets derived from operational enterprise networks continues to be a critical deficiency in the cyber security research community. Unfortunately, releasing viable data sets to the larger com- munity is challenging for a number of reasons, primarily the difficulty of balancing security and privacy concerns against the fidelity and utility of the data. This chapter discusses the importance of cyber secu- rity research data sets and introduces a large data set derived from the operational network environment at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The hope is that this data set and associated discussion will act as a catalyst for both new research in cyber security as well as motivation for other organizations to release similar data sets to the community.
