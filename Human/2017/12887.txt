Reduction of Overfitting in Diabetes Prediction Using Deep Learning Neural Network

Augmented accuracy in prediction of diabetes will open up new frontiers in health prognostics. Data overfitting is a performance-degrading issue in diabetes prognosis. In this study, a prediction system for the disease of diabetes is pre-sented where the issue of overfitting is minimized by using the dropout method. Deep learning neural network is used where both fully connected layers are fol-lowed by dropout layers. The output performance of the proposed neural network is shown to have outperformed other state-of-art methods and it is recorded as by far the best performance for the Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set.
