Reliable Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm for Vehicle-Assisted Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks

We investigate the design of the optimal routing path in a moving vehicles involved the internet of things (IoT). In our model, jammers exist that may interfere with the information exchange between wireless nodes, leading to worsened quality of service (QoS) in communications. In addition, the transmit power of each battery-equipped node is constrained to save energy. We propose a three-step optimal routing path algorithm for reliable and energy-efficient communications. Moreover, results show that with the assistance of moving vehicles, the total energy consumed can be reduced to a large extend. We also study the impact on the optimal routing path design and energy consumption which is caused by path loss, maximum transmit power constrain, QoS requirement, etc.
