Pyndri: a Python Interface to the Indri Search Engine

We introduce pyndri, a Python interface to the Indri search engine. Pyndri allows to access Indri indexes from Python at two levels: (1) dictionary and tokenized document collection, (2) evaluating queries on the index. We hope that with the release of pyndri, we will stimulate reproducible, open and fast-paced IR research.
