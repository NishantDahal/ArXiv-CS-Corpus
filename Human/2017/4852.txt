Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Bird Audio Detection

Bird sounds possess distinctive spectral structure which may exhibit small shifts in spectrum depending on the bird species and environmental conditions. In this paper, we propose using convolutional recurrent neural networks on the task of automated bird audio detection in real-life environments. In the proposed method, convolutional layers extract high dimensional, local frequency shift invariant features, while recurrent layers capture longer term dependencies between the features extracted from short time frames. This method achieves 88.5% Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) score on the unseen evaluation data and obtains the second place in the Bird Audio Detection challenge.
