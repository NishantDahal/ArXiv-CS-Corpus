Creation of an Annotated Corpus of Spanish Radiology Reports

This paper presents a new annotated corpus of 513 anonymized radiology reports written in Spanish. Reports were manually annotated with entities, negation and uncertainty terms and relations. The corpus was conceived as an evaluation resource for named entity recognition and relation extraction algorithms, and as input for the use of supervised methods. Biomedical annotated resources are scarce due to confidentiality issues and associated costs. This work provides some guidelines that could help other researchers to undertake similar tasks.
