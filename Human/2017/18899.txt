Photometric stereo for strong specular highlights

Photometric stereo (PS) is a fundamental technique in computer vision known to produce 3-D shape with high accuracy. The setting of PS is defined by using several input images of a static scene taken from one and the same camera position but under varying illumination. The vast majority of studies in this 3-D reconstruction method assume orthographic projection for the camera model. In addition, they mainly consider the Lambertian reflectance model as the way that light scatters at surfaces. So, providing reliable PS results from real world objects still remains a challenging task. We address 3-D reconstruction by PS using a more realistic set of assumptions combining for the first time the complete Blinn-Phong reflectance model and perspective projection. To this end, we will compare two different methods of incorporating the perspective projection into our model. Experiments are performed on both synthetic and real world images. Note that our real-world experiments do not benefit from laboratory conditions. The results show the high potential of our method even for complex real world applications such as medical endoscopy images which may include high amounts of specular highlights.
