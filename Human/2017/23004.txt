Person Recognition using Smartphones' Accelerometer Data

Smartphones have become quite pervasive in various aspects of our daily lives. They have become important links to a host of important data and applications, which if compromised, can lead to disastrous results. Due to this, today's smartphones are equipped with multiple layers of authentication modules. However, there still lies the need for a viable and unobtrusive layer of security which can perform the task of user authentication using resources which are cost-efficient and widely available on smartphones. In this work, we propose a method to recognize users using data from a phone's embedded accelerometer sensors. Features encapsulating information from both time and frequency domains are extracted from walking data samples, and are used to build a Random Forest ensemble classification model. Based on the experimental results, the resultant model delivers an accuracy of 0.9679 and Area under Curve (AUC) of 0.9822.
