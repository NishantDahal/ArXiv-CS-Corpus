Long-Term Evolution of Genetic Programming Populations

We evolve binary mux-6 trees for up to 100000 generations evolving some programs with more than a hundred million nodes. Our unbounded Long-Term Evolution Experiment LTEE GP appears not to evolve building blocks but does suggests a limit to bloat. We do see periods of tens even hundreds of generations where the population is 100 percent functionally converged. The distribution of tree sizes is not as predicted by theory.
