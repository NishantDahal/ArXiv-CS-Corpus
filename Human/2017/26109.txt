Identifying Recent Behavioral Data Length in Mobile Phone Log

Mobile phone log data (e.g., phone call log) is not static as it is progressively added to day-by-day according to individ- ual's diverse behaviors with mobile phones. Since human behavior changes over time, the most recent pattern is more interesting and significant than older ones for predicting in- dividual's behavior. The goal of this poster paper is to iden- tify the recent behavioral data length dynamically from the entire phone log for recency-based behavior modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dynamic recent log-based study that takes into account individual's recent behavioral patterns for modeling their phone call behaviors.
