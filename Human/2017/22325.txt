On Code Rates of Fractional Repetition Codes

In \textit{Distributed Storage Systems} (DSSs), usually, data is stored using replicated packets on different chunk servers. Recently a new paradigm of \textit{Fractional Repetition} (FR) codes have been introduced, in which, data is replicated in a smart way on distributed servers using a \textit{Maximum Distance Separable} (MDS) code. In this work, for a non-uniform FR code, bounds on the FR code rate and DSS code rate are studied. Using matrix representation of an FR code, some universally good FR codes have been obtained.
