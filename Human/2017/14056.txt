Securing Information-Centric Networking without negating Middleboxes

Information-Centric Networking is a promising networking paradigm that overcomes many of the limitations of current networking architectures. Various research efforts investigate solutions for securing ICN. Nevertheless, most of these solutions relax security requirements in favor of network performance. In particular, they weaken end-user privacy and the architecture's tolerance to security breaches in order to support middleboxes that offer services such as caching and content replication. In this paper, we adapt TLS, a widely used security standard, to an ICN context. We design solutions that allow session reuse and migration among multiple stakeholders and we propose an extension that allows authorized middleboxes to lawfully and transparently intercept secured communications.
