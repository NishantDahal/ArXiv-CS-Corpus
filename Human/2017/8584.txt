Multilevel Monte Carlo Simulation of the Eddy Current Problem With Random Parameters

The multilevel Monte Carlo method is applied to an academic example in the field of electromagnetism. The method exhibits a reduced variance by assigning the samples to multiple models with a varying spatial resolution. For the given example it is found that the main costs of the method are spent on the coarsest level.
