Transportation in Social Media: an automatic classifier for travel-related tweets

In the last years researchers in the field of intelligent transportation systems have made several efforts to extract valuable information from social media streams. However, collecting domain-specific data from any social media is a challenging task demanding appropriate and robust classification methods. In this work we focus on exploring geo-located tweets in order to create a travel-related tweet classifier using a combination of bag-of-words and word embeddings. The resulting classification makes possible the identification of interesting spatio-temporal relations in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
