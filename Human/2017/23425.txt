Information capacity of direct detection optical transmission systems

We show that the spectral efficiency of a direct detection transmission system is at most 1 bit/s/Hz less than the spectral efficiency of a system employing coherent detection with the same modulation format. Correspondingly, the capacity per complex degree of freedom in systems using direct detection is lower by at most 1 bit.
