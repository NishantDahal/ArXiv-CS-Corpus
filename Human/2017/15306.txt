A Model for Donation Verification

In this paper, we introduce a model for donation verification. A randomized algorithm is developed to check if the money claimed being received by the collector is $(1-Îµ)$-approximation to the total amount money contributed by the donors. We also derive some negative results that show it is impossible to verify the donations under some circumstances.
