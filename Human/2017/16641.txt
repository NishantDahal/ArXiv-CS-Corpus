Some Results on [1, k]-sets of Lexicographic Products of Graphs

A subset $S \subseteq V$ in a graph $G = (V,E)$ is called a $[1, k]$-set, if for every vertex $v \in V \setminus S$, $1 \leq | N_G(v) \cap S | \leq k$. The $[1,k]$-domination number of $G$, denoted by $γ_{[1, k]}(G)$ is the size of the smallest $[1,k]$-sets of $G$. A set $S'\subseteq V(G)$ is called a total $[1,k]$-set, if for every vertex $v \in V$, $1 \leq | N_G(v) \cap S | \leq k$. If a graph $G$ has at least one total $[1, k]$-set then the cardinality of the smallest such set is denoted by $γ_{t[1, k]}(G)$. We consider $[1, k]$-sets that are also independent. Note that not every graph has an independent $[1, k]$-set. For graphs having an independent $[1, k]$-set, we define $[1, k]$-independence numbers which is denoted by $γ_{i[1, k]}(G)$. In this paper, we investigate the existence of $[1,k]$-sets in lexicographic products $G\circ H$. Furthermore, we completely characterize graphs which their lexicographic product has at least one total $[1,k]$-set. Also, we determine $γ_{[1, k]}(G\circ H)$, $γ_{t[1, k]}(G\circ H)$ and $γ_{i[1, k]}(G\circ H)$. Finally, we show that finding smallest total $[1, k]$-set is $NP$-complete.
