DFE/THP duality for FBMC with highly frequency selective channels

Filter bank based multicarrier with Offset-QAM systems (FBMC/OQAM) are strong candidates for the waveform of future 5-th generation (5G) wireless standards. These systems can achieve maximum spectral efficiency compared to other multicarrier schemes, particularly in highly frequency selective propagation conditions. In this case a multi-tap, fractionally spaced equalizer or precoder needs to be inserted in each subcarrier at the receiver or transmitter side to compensate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). In this paper we propose a new Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (THP) design for FBMC/OQAM based on the mean squared error (MSE) duality from a minimum MSE (MMSE) designed decision feedback equalizer (DFE).
