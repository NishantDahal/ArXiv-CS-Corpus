On Equivalence of Known Families of APN Functions in Small Dimensions

In this extended abstract, we computationally check and list the CCZ-inequivalent APN functions from infinite families on $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ for n from 6 to 11. These functions are selected with simplest coefficients from CCZ-inequivalent classes. This work can simplify checking CCZ-equivalence between any APN function and infinite APN families.
