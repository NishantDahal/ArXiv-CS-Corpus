Highlighting objects of interest in an image by integrating saliency and depth

Stereo images have been captured primarily for 3D reconstruction in the past. However, the depth information acquired from stereo can also be used along with saliency to highlight certain objects in a scene. This approach can be used to make still images more interesting to look at, and highlight objects of interest in the scene. We introduce this novel direction in this paper, and discuss the theoretical framework behind the approach. Even though we use depth from stereo in this work, our approach is applicable to depth data acquired from any sensor modality. Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate the benefits of our algorithm.
