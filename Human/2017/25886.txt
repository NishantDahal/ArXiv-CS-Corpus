SOT for MOT

In this paper we present a robust tracker to solve the multiple object tracking (MOT) problem, under the framework of tracking-by-detection. As the first contribution, we innovatively combine single object tracking (SOT) algorithms with multiple object tracking algorithms, and our results show that SOT is a general way to strongly reduce the number of false negatives, regardless of the quality of detection. Another contribution is that we show with a deep learning based appearance model, it is easy to associate detections of the same object efficiently and also with high accuracy. This appearance model plays an important role in our MOT algorithm to correctly associate detections into long trajectories, and also in our SOT algorithm to discover new detections mistakenly missed by the detector. The deep neural network based model ensures the robustness of our tracking algorithm, which can perform data association in a wide variety of scenes. We ran comprehensive experiments on a large-scale and challenging dataset, the MOT16 benchmark, and results showed that our tracker achieved state-of-the-art performance based on both public and private detections.
