Green Base Station Placement for Microwave Backhaul Links

Wireless mobile backhaul networks have been proposed as a substitute in cases in which wired alternatives are not available due to economical or geographical reasons. In this work, we study the location problem of base stations in a given region where mobile terminals are distributed according to a certain probability density function and the base stations communicate through microwave backhaul links. Using results of optimal transport theory, we provide the optimal asymptotic distribution of base stations in the considered setting by minimizing the total power over the whole network.
