Matroid Theory and Storage Codes: Bounds and Constructions

Recent research on distributed storage systems (DSSs) has revealed interesting connections between matroid theory and locally repairable codes (LRCs). The goal of this chapter is to introduce the reader to matroids and polymatroids, and illustrate their relation to distribute storage systems. While many of the results are rather technical in nature, effort is made to increase accessibility via simple examples. The chapter embeds all the essential features of LRCs, namely locality, availability, and hierarchy alongside with related generalised Singleton bounds.
