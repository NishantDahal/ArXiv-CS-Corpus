Use of Commutativity for Cryptology in Secret Communication

Commutativity of subsystems in cascade connected forms to form larger systems gets worthy to improve noise disturbance properties, stability, robustness and many other properties in system design. In this paper, another benefit of commutativity property is indicated, as far as the author knowledge for the first time, and illustrated by examples. This benefit is the gain of a new and original method for transmission of secret signals when travelling in a transmission channel. Hence, the paper presents an original and alternative method in cryptology. Their results are all validated by illustrative examples and Matlab simulation toolbox Simulink.
