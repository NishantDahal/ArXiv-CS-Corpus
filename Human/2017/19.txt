Towards the 5th Generation of Wireless Communication Systems

In this article, one first introduces the general landscape of the next generation of wireless communication systems (5G), including its drivers and requirements, and the candidate technologies that might help achieve its intended goals. The following areas, which the author considers to be of particular relevance for 5G, are then introduced: detection and access of free spectrum over bands of an heterogeneous nature, extreme densification of networks (massive base station deployments), extreme increase in the number of antennas in transmitter arrays and their interaction with a novel waveform, integration of both wireless and optical sides of telecom networks, and study of wireless networks using the magnifying glass provided by complex systems science. In particular, recent results from the author's research team are shortly discussed for each of these research areas.
