Beyond Polyhedral Homotopies

We present a new algorithmic framework which utilizes tropical geometry and homotopy continuation for solving systems of polynomial equations where some of the polynomials are generic elements in linear subspaces of the polynomial ring. This approach generalizes the polyhedral homotopies by Huber and Sturmfels.
