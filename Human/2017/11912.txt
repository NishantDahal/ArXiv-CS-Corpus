Localizacao 3D em sistemas RFID com leitor movel

RFID has been widely used in applications for indoor objects location. This article proposes a 3D location algorithm based on a system that uses a mobile reader and a reference matrix of real (passive) and virtual tags. The proposed algorithm compares the RSSI of the target tag with the RSSI of the tags of the reference matrix and defines the estimated position. Preliminary results show that the location scheme may be promising for indoor location of tags.
