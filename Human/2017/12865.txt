Proceedings of Workshop AEW10: Concepts in Information Theory and Communications

The 10th Asia-Europe workshop in "Concepts in Information Theory and Communications" AEW10 was held in Boppard, Germany on June 21-23, 2017. It is based on a longstanding cooperation between Asian and European scientists. The first workshop was held in Eindhoven, the Netherlands in 1989. The idea of the workshop is threefold: 1) to improve the communication between the scientist in the different parts of the world; 2) to exchange knowledge and ideas; and 3) to pay a tribute to a well respected and special scientist.
