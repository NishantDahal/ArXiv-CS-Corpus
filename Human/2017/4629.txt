Survey on Essential and Accidental Real-Time Issues in Software Engineering

Software product lines have recently been presented as one of the best promising improvements for the efficient software development. Different research works contribute supportive parameters and negotiations regarding the problems of producing a perfect software scheme. Traditional approaches or recycling software are not effective to solve the problems concerning software competence. Since fast developments with software engineering in the past few years, studies show that some approaches are getting extensive attention in both industries and universities. This method is categorized as the software product line improvement; that supports reusing of software in big organizations. Different industries are adopting product lines to enhance efficiency and reduce operational expenses by way of emerging product developments. This research paper is formed to offer in-depth study regarding the software engineering issues such as complexity, conformity, changeability, invisibility, time constraints, budget constraints, and security. We have conducted various research surveys by visiting different professional software development organizations and took feedback from the professional software engineers to analyze the real-time problems that they are facing during the development process of software systems. Survey results proved that complexity is a most occurring issue that most software developers face while developing software applications. Moreover, invisibility is the problem that rarely happens according to the survey.
