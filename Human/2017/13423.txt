Control of an Internet-based Robot System Using the Real-time Transport Protocol

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach in controlling robot systems over the Internet. The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used as the communication protocol instead of traditionally using TCP and UDP. The theoretic analyses, the simulation studies and the experimental implementation have been performed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for practical uses.
