A Framework for Optimizing Multi-cell NOMA: Delivering Demand with Less Resource

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows multiple users to simultaneously access the same time-frequency resource by using superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC). Thus far, most papers on NOMA have focused on performance gain for one or sometimes two base stations. In this paper, we study multi-cell NOMA and provide a general framework for user clustering and power allocation, taking into account inter-cell interference, for optimizing resource allocation of NOMA in multi-cell networks of arbitrary topology. We provide a series of theoretical analysis, to algorithmically enable optimization approaches. The resulting algorithmic notion is very general. Namely, we prove that for any performance metric that monotonically increases in the cells' resource consumption, we have convergence guarantee for global optimum. We apply the framework with its algorithmic concept to a multi-cell scenario to demonstrate the gain of NOMA in achieving significantly higher efficiency.
