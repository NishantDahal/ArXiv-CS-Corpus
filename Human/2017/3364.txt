Vulnerability of Fixed-Time Control of Signalized Intersections to Cyber-Tampering

Recent experimental studies have shown that traffic management systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks on sensor data. This paper studies the vulnerability of fixed-time control of signalized intersections when sensors measuring traffic flow information are compromised and perturbed by an adversary. The problems are formulated by considering three malicious objectives: 1) worst-case network accumulation, which aims to destabilize the overall network as much as possible; 2) worst-case lane accumulation, which aims to cause worst-case accumulation on some target lanes; and 3) risk-averse target accumulation, which aims to reach a target accumulation by making the minimum perturbation to sensor data. The problems are solved using bilevel programming optimization methods. Finally, a case study of a real network is used to illustrate the results.
