Identification of image source using serialnumber-based watermarking under Compressive Sensing conditions

Although the protection of ownership and the prevention of unauthorized manipulation of digital images becomes an important concern, there is also a big issue of image source origin authentication. This paper proposes a procedure for the identification of the image source and content by using the Public Key Cryptography Signature (PKCS). The procedure is based on the PKCS watermarking of the images captured with numerous automatic observing cameras in the Trap View cloud system. Watermark is created based on 32-bit PKCS serial number and embedded into the captured image. Watermark detection on the receiver side extracts the serial number and indicates the camera which captured the image by comparing the original and the extracted serial numbers. The watermarking procedure is designed to provide robustness to image optimization based on the Compressive Sensing approach. Also, the procedure is tested under various attacks and shows successful identification of ownership.
