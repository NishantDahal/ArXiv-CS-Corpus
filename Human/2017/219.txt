Lattice coding for Rician fading channels from Hadamard rotations

In this paper, we study lattice coding for Rician fading wireless channels. This is motivated in particular by preliminary studies suggesting the Rician fading model for millimeter-wavelength wireless communications. We restrict to lattice codes arising from rotations of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, and to a single-input single-output (SISO) channel. We observe that several lattice design criteria suggest the optimality of Hadamard rotations. For instance, we prove that Hadamard rotations maximize the diamond-packing density among all rotated $\mathbb{Z}^n$ lattices. Finally, we provide simulations to show that Hadamard rotations outperform optimal algebraic rotations and cross-packing lattices in the Rician channel.
