A new image compression by gradient Haar wavelet

With the development of human communications the usage of Visual Communications has also increased. The advancement of image compression methods is one of the main reasons for the enhancement. This paper first presents main modes of image compression methods such as JPEG and JPEG2000 without mathematical details. Also, the paper describes gradient Haar wavelet transforms in order to construct a preliminary image compression algorithm. Then, a new image compression method is proposed based on the preliminary image compression algorithm that can improve standards of image compression. The new method is compared with original modes of JPEG and JPEG2000 (based on Haar wavelet) by image quality measures such as MAE, PSNAR, and SSIM. The image quality and statistical results confirm that can boost image compression standards. It is suggested that the new method is used in a part or all of an image compression standard.
