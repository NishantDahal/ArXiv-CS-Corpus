Real-Time Dispersion Code Multiple Access (DCMA) for High-Speed Wireless Communications

We model, demonstrate and characterize Dispersion Code Multiple Access (DCMA) and hence show the applicability of this purely analog and real-time multiple access scheme to high-speed wireless communications. We first mathematically describe DCMA and show the appropriateness of Chebyshev dispersion coding in this technology. We next provide an experimental proof-of-concept in a 2 X 2 DCMA system. Finally,we statistically characterize DCMA in terms of bandwidth, dispersive group delay swing, system dimension and signal-to-noise ratio.
