Rapid, User-Transparent, and Trustworthy Device Pairing for D2D-Enabled Mobile Crowdsourcing

Mobile Crowdsourcing is a promising service paradigm utilizing ubiquitous mobile devices to facilitate largescale crowdsourcing tasks (e.g. urban sensing and collaborative computing). Many applications in this domain require Device-to-Device (D2D) communications between participating devices for interactive operations such as task collaborations and file transmissions. Considering the private participating devices and their opportunistic encountering behaviors, it is highly desired to establish secure and trustworthy D2D connections in a fast and autonomous way, which is vital for implementing practical Mobile Crowdsourcing Systems (MCSs). In this paper, we develop an efficient scheme, Trustworthy Device Pairing (TDP), which achieves user-transparent secure D2D connections and reliable peer device selections for trustworthy D2D communications. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security intensity of TDP in theory. The performance of TDP is evaluated based on both real-world prototype experiments and extensive trace-driven simulations. Evaluation results verify our theoretical analysis and show that TDP significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of pairing speed, stability, and security.
