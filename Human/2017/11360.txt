Interactive Shape Perturbation

We present a web application for the procedural generation of perturbations of 3D models. We generate the perturbations by generating vertex shaders that change the positions of vertices that make up the 3D model. The vertex shaders are created with an interactive genetic algorithm, which displays to the user the visual effect caused by each vertex shader, allows the user to select the visual effect the user likes best, and produces a new generation of vertex shaders using the user feedback as the fitness measure of the genetic algorithm. We use genetic programming to represent each vertex shader as a computer program. This paper presents details of requirements specification, software architecture, high and low-level design, and prototype user interface. We discuss the project's current status and development challenges.
