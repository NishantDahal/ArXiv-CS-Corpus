A Survey of Advances in Botnet Technologies

Botnets have come a long way since their inception a few decades ago. Originally toy programs written by network hobbyists, modern-day botnets can be used by cyber criminals to steal billions of dollars from users, corporations, and governments. This paper will look at cutting-edge botnet features and detection strategies from over a dozen research papers, supplemented by a few additional sources. With this data, I will then hypothesize what the future of botnets might hold.
