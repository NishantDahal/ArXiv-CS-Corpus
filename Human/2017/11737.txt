Binary extremal self-dual codes of length $60$ and related codes

We give a classification of four-circulant singly even self-dual $[60,30,d]$ codes for $d=10$ and $12$. These codes are used to construct extremal singly even self-dual $[60,30,12]$ codes with weight enumerator for which no extremal singly even self-dual code was previously known to exist. From extremal singly even self-dual $[60,30,12]$ codes, we also construct extremal singly even self-dual $[58,29,10]$ codes with weight enumerator for which no extremal singly even self-dual code was previously known to exist. Finally, we give some restriction on the possible weight enumerators of certain singly even self-dual codes with shadow of minimum weight $1$.
