Resource Allocation for Secure Full-Duplex OFDMA Radio Systems

In this paper, we study the resource allocation for an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) radio system employing a full-duplex base station for serving multiple half-duplex downlink and uplink users simultaneously. The resource allocation design objective is the maximization of the weighted system throughput while limiting the information leakage to guarantee secure simultaneous downlink and uplink transmission in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. The algorithm design leads to a mixed combinatorial non-convex optimization problem and obtaining the globally optimal solution entails a prohibitively high computational complexity. Therefore, an efficient successive convex approximation based suboptimal iterative algorithm is proposed. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed suboptimal algorithm achieves a significant performance gain compared to two baseline schemes.
