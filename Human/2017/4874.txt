Finite Model Reasoning in Expressive Fragments of First-Order Logic

Over the past two decades several fragments of first-order logic have been identified and shown to have good computational and algorithmic properties, to a great extent as a result of appropriately describing the image of the standard translation of modal logic to first-order logic.  This applies most notably to the guarded fragment, where quantifiers are appropriately relativized by atoms, and the fragment  defined by restricting the number of variables to two. The aim of this talk is to review recent work concerning these fragments and  their popular extensions. When presenting the material special attention is given to decision procedures for  the finite satisfiability problems, as many of the fragments discussed contain infinity axioms. We highlight most effective techniques used in this context, their advantages and limitations. We also mention a few open directions of study.
