5G Converged Cell-less Communications in Smart Cities

Ubiquitous information service converged by different types of heterogeneous networks is one of fundamental functions for smart cities. Considering the deployment of 5G ultra-dense wireless networks, the 5G converged cell-less communication networks are proposed to support mobile terminals in smart cities. To break obstacles of heterogeneous wireless networks, the 5G converged cell-less communication network is vertically converged in different tiers of heterogeneous wireless networks and horizontally converged in celled architectures of base stations/access points. Moreover, the software defined network controllers are configured to manage the traffic scheduling and resource allocation in 5G converged cell-less communication networks. Simulation results indicate the coverage probability and the energy saving at both base stations and mobile terminals are improved by the cooperative grouping scheme in 5G converged cell-less communication networks.
