Efficient Cryptographic Substitution Box Design Using Travelling Salesman Problem and Chaos

Symmetric encryption has been a standout amongst the most reliable option by which security is accomplished. In modern block symmetric ciphers, the substitution-boxes have been playing a critical role of nonlinear components that drives the actual security of ciphers. In this paper, the travelling salesman problem and piecewise linear chaotic map are explored to synthesize an efficient configuration of 8x8 substitution-box. The proposed anticipated design has the consistency which is justified by the standard performance indexes. The statistical results manifest that the prospective substitution-box is cryptographically more impressive as compared to some recent investigations.
