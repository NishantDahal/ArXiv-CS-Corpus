Combinatorial metrics: MacWilliams-type identities, isometries and extension property

In this work we characterize the combinatorial metrics admitting a MacWilliams-type identity and describe the group of linear isometries of such metrics. Considering coverings that are not connected, we classify the metrics satisfying the MacWilliams extension property.
