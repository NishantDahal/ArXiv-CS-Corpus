Biologically inspired protection of deep networks from adversarial attacks

Inspired by biophysical principles underlying nonlinear dendritic computation in neural circuits, we develop a scheme to train deep neural networks to make them robust to adversarial attacks. Our scheme generates highly nonlinear, saturated neural networks that achieve state of the art performance on gradient based adversarial examples on MNIST, despite never being exposed to adversarially chosen examples during training. Moreover, these networks exhibit unprecedented robustness to targeted, iterative schemes for generating adversarial examples, including second-order methods. We further identify principles governing how these networks achieve their robustness, drawing on methods from information geometry. We find these networks progressively create highly flat and compressed internal representations that are sensitive to very few input dimensions, while still solving the task. Moreover, they employ highly kurtotic weight distributions, also found in the brain, and we demonstrate how such kurtosis can protect even linear classifiers from adversarial attack.
