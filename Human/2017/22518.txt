Solving Poisson's Equation on the Microsoft HoloLens

We present a mixed reality application (HoloFEM) for the Microsoft HoloLens. The application lets a user define and solve a physical problem governed by Poisson's equation with the surrounding real world geometry as input data. Holograms are used to visualise both the problem and the solution. The finite element method is used to solve Poisson's equation. Solving and visualising partial differential equations in mixed reality could have potential usage in areas such as building planning and safety engineering.
