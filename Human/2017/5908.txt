Improved Human Emotion Recognition Using Symmetry of Facial Key Points with Dihedral Group

This article describes how to deploy dihedral group theory to detect Facial Key Points (FKP) symmetry to recognize emotions. The method can be applied in many other areas which those have the same data texture.
