Multi-Pair Two Way AF Full-Duplex Massive MIMO Relaying with ZFR/ZFT Processing

We consider two-way amplify and forward relaying, where multiple full-duplex user pairs exchange information via a shared full-duplex massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay. We derive closed-form lower bound for the spectral efficiency with zero-forcing processing at the relay, by using minimum mean squared error channel estimation. The zero-forcing lower bound for the system model considered herein, which is valid for arbitrary number of antennas, is not yet derived in the massive MIMO relaying literature. We numerically demonstrate the accuracy of the derived lower bound and the performance improvement achieved using zero-forcing processing. We also numerically demonstrate the spectral gains achieved by a full-duplex system over a half-duplex one for various antenna regimes.
