User-guided free-form asset modelling

In this paper a new system for piecewise primitive surface recovery on point clouds is presented, which allows a novice user to sketch areas of interest in order to guide the fitting process. The algorithm is demonstrated against a benchmark technique for autonomous surface fitting, and, contrasted against existing literature in user guided surface recovery, with empirical evidence. It is concluded that the system is an improvement to the current documented literature for its visual quality when modelling objects which are composed of piecewise primitive shapes, and, in its ability to fill large holes on occluded surfaces using free-form input.
