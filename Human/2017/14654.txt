Spin Transfer Torque Driven Coupled Oscillators for Self-Oscillating RF Mixers

Spin transfer torque oscillators (STOs) based on magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices are emerging as a possible replacement for complementary metal-oxide semiconductors for radio-frequency (RF) signal generation. Advantages include low power consumption, small device area, and large frequency tunability. But such a single device cannot achieve the necessary noise performance for RF applications. It has been reported lately that a network of globally coupled STOs achieves significant improvement in phase noise. The study here is to propose use of such coupled STOs as self-oscillating RF mixers. Critical mixer performance parameters, including conversion gain, output power, and linearity, are discussed.
