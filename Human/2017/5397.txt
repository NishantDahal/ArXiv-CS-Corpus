Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Mobile Edge Computing-Based Augmented Reality Applications

Mobile edge computing is a provisioning solution to enable Augmented Reality (AR) applications on mobile devices. AR mobile applications have inherent collaborative properties in terms of data collection in the uplink, computing at the edge, and data delivery in the downlink. In this letter, these features are leveraged to propose a novel resource allocation approach over both communication and computation resources. The approach, implemented via Successive Convex Approximation (SCA), is seen to yield considerable gains in mobile energy consumption as compared to conventional independent offloading across users.
