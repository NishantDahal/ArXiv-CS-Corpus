Hybrid LISA Precoding for Multiuser Millimeter-Wave Communications

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications plays an important role for future cellular networks because of the vast amount of spectrum available in the underutilized mmWave frequency bands. To overcome the huge free space omnidirectional path loss in those frequency bands, the deployment of a very large number of antenna elements at the base station is crucial. The complexity, power consumption and costs resulting from the large number of antenna elements can be reduced by limiting the number of RF chains. This leads to hybrid precoding and combining, which, in contrast to the traditional fully digital precoding and combining, moves a part of the signal processing from the digital to the analog domain. This paper proposes new algorithms for the design of hybrid precoders and combiners in a multiuser scenario. The algorithms are based on the previously proposed Linear Successive Allocation method developed for the traditional fully digital version. It successively allocates data streams to users and suppresses the respective interstream interference in two stages, which perfectly matches the hybrid architecture. Furthermore, a low-complexity version is developed by exploiting the typical structure of mmWave channels. The good performance of the proposed method and its low-complexity version is demonstrated by simulation results.
