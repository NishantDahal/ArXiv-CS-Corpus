Software metadata: How much is enough?

Broad efforts are underway to capture metadata about research software and retain it across services; notable in this regard is the CodeMeta project. What metadata are important to have about (research) software? What metadata are useful for searching for codes? What would you like to learn about astronomy software? This BoF sought to gather information on metadata most desired by researchers and users of astro software and others interested in registering, indexing, capturing, and doing research on this software. Information from this BoF could conceivably result in changes to the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) or other resources for the benefit of the community or provide input into other projects concerned with software metadata.
