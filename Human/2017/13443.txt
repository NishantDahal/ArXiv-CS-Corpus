Make Your Bone Great Again : A study on Osteoporosis Classification

Osteoporosis can be identified by looking at 2D x-ray images of the bone. The high degree of similarity between images of a healthy bone and a diseased one makes classification a challenge. A good bone texture characterization technique is essential for identifying osteoporosis cases. Standard texture feature extraction techniques like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) have been used for this purpose. In this paper, we draw a comparison between deep features extracted from convolution neural network against these traditional features. Our results show that deep features have more discriminative power as classifiers trained on them always outperform the ones trained on traditional features.
