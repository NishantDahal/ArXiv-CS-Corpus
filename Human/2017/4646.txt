XamForumDB: a dataset for studying Q&A about cross-platform mobile applications development

Android and iSO are the two mobile platforms present in almost all smartphones build during last years. Developing an application that targets both platforms is a challenge. A traditional way is to build two different apps, one in Java for Android, the other in Objective-C for iOS. Xamarin is a framework for developing Android and iOS apps which allows developers to share most of the application code across multiple implementations of the app, each for a specific platform. In this paper, we present XamForumDB, a database that stores discussions, questions and answers extracted from the Xamarin forum. We envision research community could use it for studying, for instance, the problematic of developing such kind of applications.
