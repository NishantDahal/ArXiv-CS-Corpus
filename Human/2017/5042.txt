Deep artifact learning for compressed sensing and parallel MRI

Purpose: Compressed sensing MRI (CS-MRI) from single and parallel coils is one of the powerful ways to reduce the scan time of MR imaging with performance guarantee. However, the computational costs are usually expensive. This paper aims to propose a computationally fast and accurate deep learning algorithm for the reconstruction of MR images from highly down-sampled k-space data.
  Theory: Based on the topological analysis, we show that the data manifold of the aliasing artifact is easier to learn from a uniform subsampling pattern with additional low-frequency k-space data. Thus, we develop deep aliasing artifact learning networks for the magnitude and phase images to estimate and remove the aliasing artifacts from highly accelerated MR acquisition.
  Methods: The aliasing artifacts are directly estimated from the distorted magnitude and phase images reconstructed from subsampled k-space data so that we can get an aliasing-free images by subtracting the estimated aliasing artifact from corrupted inputs. Moreover, to deal with the globally distributed aliasing artifact, we develop a multi-scale deep neural network with a large receptive field.
  Results: The experimental results confirm that the proposed deep artifact learning network effectively estimates and removes the aliasing artifacts. Compared to existing CS methods from single and multi-coli data, the proposed network shows minimal errors by removing the coherent aliasing artifacts. Furthermore, the computational time is by order of magnitude faster.
  Conclusion: As the proposed deep artifact learning network immediately generates accurate reconstruction, it has great potential for clinical applications.
