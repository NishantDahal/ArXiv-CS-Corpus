Network Coding Algorithms for Multi-Layered Video Broadcast

In this paper we give network coding algorithms for multi-layered video streaming. The problem is motivated by video broadcasting in a communication network to users with varying demands. We give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding feasibility for the case of two layers, and show that the problem becomes NP-hard if the task is to maximize the number of satisfied demands. For the case of three layers we also show NP-hardness of the problem. Finally, we propose a heuristic for three layers and give experimental comparison with previous approaches.
