Asymptotic bounds for the sizes of constant dimension codes and an improved lower bound

We study asymptotic lower and upper bounds for the sizes of constant dimension codes with respect to the subspace or injection distance, which is used in random linear network coding. In this context we review known upper bounds and show relations between them. A slightly improved version of the so-called linkage construction is presented which is e.g. used to construct constant dimension codes with subspace distance $d=4$, dimension $k=3$ of the codewords for all field sizes $q$, and sufficiently large dimensions $v$ of the ambient space, that exceed the MRD bound, for codes containing a lifted MRD code, by Etzion and Silberstein.
