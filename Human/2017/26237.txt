Neural Network Based Nonlinear Weighted Finite Automata

Weighted finite automata (WFA) can expressively model functions defined over strings but are inherently linear models. Given the recent successes of nonlinear models in machine learning, it is natural to wonder whether ex-tending WFA to the nonlinear setting would be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a novel model of neural network based nonlinearWFA model (NL-WFA) along with a learning algorithm. Our learning algorithm is inspired by the spectral learning algorithm for WFAand relies on a nonlinear decomposition of the so-called Hankel matrix, by means of an auto-encoder network. The expressive power of NL-WFA and the proposed learning algorithm are assessed on both synthetic and real-world data, showing that NL-WFA can lead to smaller model sizes and infer complex grammatical structures from data.
