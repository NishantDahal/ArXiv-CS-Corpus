Software Implementation And Evaluation Of Lightweight Symmetric Block Ciphers Of The Energy Perspectives And Memory

Lightweight ciphers are the form of encryption that strictly limited to devices such as tags, RFID, wireless sensor networks applications. Low-resource devices has many limitations in power, energy and memory. In this work, the lightweight block ciphers is implemented on the Atmega128 microprocessor and the results of the energy perspectives and memory were assessed. The results of the evaluation show that the SPECK(64,96) cipher has been the best value of the perspective of energy and is appropriate for wireless sensor networks with the main requirement of energy. If the measure is memory usage, the TWINE-80 is the most appropriate implemented lightweight ciphers on the Atmega128 microprocessor. The SPECK(64,96) cipher is in third place of the perspective of consumer memory. In other side, TWINE-80 cipher is In the second place of the perspective of energy. SPECK(64,96) and TWINE-80 ciphers are the most appropriate for wireless sensor networks.
