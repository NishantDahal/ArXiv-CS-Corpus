Stochastic Geometric Coverage Analysis in mmWave Cellular Networks with a Realistic Channel Model

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands have been attracting growing attention as a possible candidate for next-generation cellular networks, since the available spectrum is orders of magnitude larger than in current cellular allocations. To precisely design mmWave systems, it is important to examine mmWave interference and SIR coverage under large-scale deployments. For this purpose, we apply an accurate mmWave channel model, derived from experiments, into an analytical framework based on stochastic geometry. In this way we obtain a closed-form SIR coverage probability in large-scale mmWave cellular networks.
