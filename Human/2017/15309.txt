Faster Clustering via Non-Backtracking Random Walks

This paper presents VEC-NBT, a variation on the unsupervised graph clustering technique VEC, which improves upon the performance of the original algorithm significantly for sparse graphs. VEC employs a novel application of the state-of-the-art word2vec model to embed a graph in Euclidean space via random walks on the nodes of the graph. In VEC-NBT, we modify the original algorithm to use a non-backtracking random walk instead of the normal backtracking random walk used in VEC. We introduce a modification to a non-backtracking random walk, which we call a begrudgingly-backtracking random walk, and show empirically that using this model of random walks for VEC-NBT requires shorter walks on the graph to obtain results with comparable or greater accuracy than VEC, especially for sparser graphs.
