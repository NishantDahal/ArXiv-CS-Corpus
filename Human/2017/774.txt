Multiple Illumination Phaseless Super-Resolution (MIPS) with Applications To Phaseless DOA Estimation and Diffraction Imaging

Phaseless super-resolution is the problem of recovering an unknown signal from measurements of the magnitudes of the low frequency Fourier transform of the signal. This problem arises in applications where measuring the phase, and making high-frequency measurements, are either too costly or altogether infeasible. The problem is especially challenging because it combines the difficult problems of phase retrieval and classical super-resolution
