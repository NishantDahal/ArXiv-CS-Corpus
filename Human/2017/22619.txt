Integrating Privacy-Enhancing Technologies into the Internet Infrastructure

The AN.ON-Next project aims to integrate privacy-enhancing technologies into the internet's infrastructure and establish them in the consumer mass market.
  The technologies in focus include a basis protection at internet service provider level, an improved overlay network-based protection and a concept for privacy protection in the emerging 5G mobile network. A crucial success factor will be the viable adjustment and development of standards, business models and pricing strategies for those new technologies.
