Query Complexity of Mastermind Variants

We study variants of Mastermind, a popular board game in which the objective is sequence reconstruction. In this two-player game, the so-called \textit{codemaker} constructs a hidden sequence $H = (h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n)$ of colors selected from an alphabet $\mathcal{A} = \{1,2,\ldots, k\}$ (\textit{i.e.,} $h_i\in\mathcal{A}$ for all $i\in\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$). The game then proceeds in turns, each of which consists of two parts: in turn $t$, the second player (the \textit{codebreaker}) first submits a query sequence $Q_t = (q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)$ with $q_i\in \mathcal{A}$ for all $i$, and second receives feedback $Δ(Q_t, H)$, where $Δ$ is some agreed-upon function of distance between two sequences with $n$ components. The game terminates when $Q_t = H$, and the codebreaker seeks to end the game in as few turns as possible. Throughout we let $f(n,k)$ denote the smallest integer such that the codebreaker can determine any $H$ in $f(n,k)$ turns. We prove three main results: First, when $H$ is known to be a permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, we prove that $f(n, n)\ge n - \log\log n$ for all sufficiently large $n$. Second, we show that Knuth's Minimax algorithm identifies any $H$ in at most $nk$ queries. Third, when feedback is not received until all queries have been submitted, we show that $f(n,k)=Ω(n\log k)$.
