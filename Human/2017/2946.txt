The temporalized Massey's method

We propose and throughly investigate a temporalized version of the popular Massey's technique for rating actors in sport competitions. The method can be described as a dynamic temporal process in which team ratings are updated at every match according to their performance during the match and the strength of the opponent team. Using the Italian soccer dataset, we empirically show that the method has a good foresight prediction accuracy.
