Parking Sensing and Information System: Sensors, Deployment, and Evaluation

This paper describes a smart parking sensing and information system that disseminates the parking availability information for public users in a cost-effective and efficient manner. The hardware framework of the system is built on advanced wireless sensor networks and cloud service over the Internet, and the system is highly scalable. The parking information provided to the users is set in the form of occupancy rates and expected cruising time. Both are obtained from our analytical algorithm processing both historical and real-time data, and are thereafter visualized in a color theme. The entire parking system is deployed and extensively evaluated at Stanford University Parking Structure-1.
