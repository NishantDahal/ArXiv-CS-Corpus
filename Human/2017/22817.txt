Social Computing Based Analysis on Monogamous Marriage Puzzle of Human

Most of the mammal species hold polygynous mating systems. The majority of the marriage systems of mankind were also polygynous over civilized history, however, socially imposed monogamy gradually prevails throughout the world. This is difficult to understand because those mostly influential in society are themselves benefitted from polygyny. Actually, the puzzle of monogamous marriage could be explained by a simple mechanism, which lies in the sexual selection dynamics of civilized human societies, driven by wealth redistribution. The discussions in this paper are mainly based on the approach of social computing, with a combination of both experimental and analytical analysis.
