Intelligent Perioperative System: Towards Real-time Big Data Analytics in Surgery Risk Assessment

Surgery risk assessment is an effective tool for physicians to manage the treatment of patients, but most current research projects fall short in providing a comprehensive platform to evaluate the patients' surgery risk in terms of different complications. The recent evolution of big data analysis techniques makes it possible to develop a real-time platform to dynamically analyze the surgery risk from large-scale patients information. In this paper, we propose the Intelligent Perioperative System (IPS), a real-time system that assesses the risk of postoperative complications (PC) and dynamically interacts with physicians to improve the predictive results. In order to process large volume patients data in real-time, we design the system by integrating several big data computing and storage frameworks with the high through-output streaming data processing components. We also implement a system prototype along with the visualization results to show the feasibility of system design.
