Stampery Blockchain Timestamping Architecture (BTA) - Version 6

A method for timestamping, anchoring and certification of a virtually unlimited amount of data in one or more blockchains, focusing on scalability and cost-effectiveness while ensuring existence, integrity and ownership by using cryptographic proofs that are independently verifiable by anyone in the world without disclosure of the original data and without the intervention of the certifying party.
