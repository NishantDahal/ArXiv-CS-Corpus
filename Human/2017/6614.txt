CT Image Reconstruction in a Low Dimensional Manifold

Regularization methods are commonly used in X-ray CT image reconstruction. Different regularization methods reflect the characterization of different prior knowledge of images. In a recent work, a new regularization method called a low-dimensional manifold model (LDMM) is investigated to characterize the low-dimensional patch manifold structure of natural images, where the manifold dimensionality characterizes structural information of an image. In this paper, we propose a CT image reconstruction method based on the prior knowledge of the low-dimensional manifold of CT image. Using the clinical raw projection data from GE clinic, we conduct comparisons for the CT image reconstruction among the proposed method, the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) with the total variation (TV) regularization, and the filtered back projection (FBP) method. Results show that the proposed method can successfully recover structural details of an imaging object, and achieve higher spatial and contrast resolution of the reconstructed image than counterparts of FBP and SART with TV.
