How Does Knowledge Come By?

Although the amount of knowledge that the humans possess has been gradually increasing, we still do not know the procedure and conditions that lead to the creation of new knowledge. An understanding of the modus operandi for the creation of knowledge may help in accelerating the existing pace of building knowledge. Our state of ignorance regarding various aspects of the process of knowledge building is highlighted by the existing literature in the domain. The reason behind it has been our inability to acquire the underlying data of this complex process. However, current time shows great promise of improvements in the knowledge building domain due to the availability of several online knowledge building portals. In this report, we emphasise that these portals act as prototypes for universal knowledge building process. The analysis of big data availed from these portals may equip the knowledge building researchers with the much needed meta-knowledge.
