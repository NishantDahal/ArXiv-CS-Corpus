Towards Interrogating Discriminative Machine Learning Models

It is oftentimes impossible to understand how machine learning models reach a decision. While recent research has proposed various technical approaches to provide some clues as to how a learning model makes individual decisions, they cannot provide users with ability to inspect a learning model as a complete entity. In this work, we propose a new technical approach that augments a Bayesian regression mixture model with multiple elastic nets. Using the enhanced mixture model, we extract explanations for a target model through global approximation. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we evaluate it on different learning models covering the tasks of text mining and image recognition. Our results indicate that the proposed approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in explaining individual decisions but also provides users with an ability to discover the vulnerabilities of a learning model.
