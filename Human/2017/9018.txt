Joint Transmission with Limited Backhaul Connectivity

Downlink beamforming techniques with low signaling overhead are proposed for joint processing coordinated (JP) multi-point transmission. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum rate within joint transmission clusters. As the considered weighted sum rate maximization is a non-convex problem, successive convex approximation techniques, based on weighted mean-squared error minimization, are applied to devise algorithms with tractable computational complexity. Decentralized algorithms are proposed to enable JP even with limited backhaul connectivity. These algorithms rely provide a variety of alternatives for signaling overhead, computational complexity and convergence behavior. Time division duplexing is exploited to design transceiver training techniques for two scenarios: stream specific estimation and direct estimation. In the stream specific estimation, the base station and user equipment estimate all of the stream specific precoded pilots individually and construct the transmit/receive covariance matrices based on these pilot estimates. With the direct estimation, only the intended transmission is separately estimated and the covariance matrices constructed directly from the aggregate system-wide pilots. The impact of feedback/backhaul signaling quantization is considered, in order to further reduce the signaling overhead. Also, user admission is being considered for time-correlated channels. The enhanced transceiver convergence rate enables periodic beamformer reinitialization, which greatly improves the achieved system performance in dense networks.
