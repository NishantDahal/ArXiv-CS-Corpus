Multi-Block Interleaved Codes for Local and Global Read Access

We define multi-block interleaved codes as codes that allow reading information from either a small sub-block or from a larger full block. The former offers faster access, while the latter provides better reliability. We specify the correction capability of the sub-block code through its gap $t$ from optimal minimum distance, and look to have full-block minimum distance that grows with the parameter $t$. We construct two families of such codes when the number of sub-blocks is $3$. The codes match the distance properties of known integrated-interleaving codes, but with the added feature of mapping the same number of information symbols to each sub-block. As such, they are the first codes that provide read access in multiple size granularities and correction capabilities.
