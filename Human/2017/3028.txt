Floor Scale Modulo Lifting for QC-LDPC codes

In the given paper we present a novel approach for constructing a QC-LDPC code of smaller length by lifting a given QC-LDPC code. The proposed method can be considered as a generalization of floor lifting. Also we prove several probabilistic statements concerning a theoretical improvement of the method with respect to the number of small cycles. Making some offline calculation of scale parameter it is possible to construct a sequence of QC-LDPC codes with different circulant sizes generated from a single exponent matrix using only floor and scale operations. The only parameter we store in memory is a constant needed for scaling.
