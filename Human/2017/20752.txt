A Simple Yet Efficient Rank One Update for Covariance Matrix Adaptation

In this paper, we propose an efficient approximated rank one update for covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). It makes use of two evolution paths as simple as that of CMA-ES, while avoiding the computational matrix decomposition. We analyze the algorithms' properties and behaviors. We experimentally study the proposed algorithm's performances. It generally outperforms or performs competitively to the Cholesky CMA-ES.
