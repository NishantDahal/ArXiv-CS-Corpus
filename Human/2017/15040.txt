An efficient genetic algorithm for large-scale planning of robust industrial wireless networks

An industrial indoor environment is harsh for wireless communications compared to an office environment, because the prevalent metal easily causes shadowing effects and affects the availability of an industrial wireless local area network (IWLAN). On the one hand, it is costly, time-consuming, and ineffective to perform trial-and-error manual deployment of wireless nodes. On the other hand, the existing wireless planning tools only focus on office environments such that it is hard to plan IWLANs due to the larger problem size and the deployed IWLANs are vulnerable to prevalent shadowing effects in harsh industrial indoor environments. To fill this gap, this paper proposes an overdimensioning model and a genetic algorithm based over-dimensioning (GAOD) algorithm for deploying large-scale robust IWLANs. As a progress beyond the state-of-the-art wireless planning, two full coverage layers are created. The second coverage layer serves as redundancy in case of shadowing. Meanwhile, the deployment cost is reduced by minimizing the number of access points (APs); the hard constraint of minimal inter-AP spatial paration avoids multiple APs covering the same area to be simultaneously shadowed by the same obstacle. The computation time and occupied memory are dedicatedly considered in the design of GAOD for large-scale optimization. A greedy heuristic based over-dimensioning (GHOD) algorithm and a random OD algorithm are taken as benchmarks. In two vehicle manufacturers with a small and large indoor environment, GAOD outperformed GHOD with up to 20% less APs, while GHOD outputted up to 25% less APs than a random OD algorithm. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this model and GAOD was experimentally validated with a real deployment system.
