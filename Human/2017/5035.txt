A note on minimum linear arrangement for BC graphs

A linear arrangement is a labeling or a numbering or a linear ordering of the vertices of a graph. In this paper we solve the minimum linear arrangement problem for bijective connection graphs (for short BC graphs) which include hypercubes, MÃ¶bius cubes, crossed cubes, twisted cubes, locally twisted cube, spined cube, $Z$-cubes, etc. as the subfamilies.
