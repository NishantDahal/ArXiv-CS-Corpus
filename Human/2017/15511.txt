AACT: Application-Aware Cooperative Time Allocation for Internet of Things

As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices keeps increasing, data is required to be communicated and processed by these devices at unprecedented rates. Cooperation among wireless devices by exploiting Device-to-Device (D2D) connections is promising, where aggregated resources in a cooperative setup can be utilized by all devices, which would increase the total utility of the setup. In this paper, we focus on the resource allocation problem for cooperating IoT devices with multiple heterogeneous applications. In particular, we develop Application-Aware Cooperative Time allocation (AACT) framework, which optimizes the time that each application utilizes the aggregated system resources by taking into account heterogeneous device constraints and application requirements. AACT is grounded on the concept of Rolling Horizon Control (RHC) where decisions are made by iteratively solving a convex optimization problem over a moving control window of estimated system parameters. The simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains.
