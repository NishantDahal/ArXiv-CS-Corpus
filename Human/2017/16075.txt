Fundamental Limits of PhaseMax for Phase Retrieval: A Replica Analysis

We consider a recently proposed convex formulation, known as the PhaseMax method, for solving the phase retrieval problem. Using the replica method from statistical mechanics, we analyze the performance of PhaseMax in the high-dimensional limit. Our analysis predicts the \emph{exact} asymptotic performance of PhaseMax. In particular, we show that a sharp phase transition phenomenon takes place, with a simple analytical formula characterizing the phase transition boundary. This result shows that the oversampling ratio required by existing performance bounds in the literature can be significantly reduced. Numerical results confirm the validity of our replica analysis, showing that the theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the actual performance of the algorithm, even for moderate signal dimensions.
