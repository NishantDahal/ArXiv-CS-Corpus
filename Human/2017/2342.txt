Chord Angle Deviation using Tangent (CADT), an Efficient and Robust Contour-based Corner Detector

Detection of corner is the most essential process in a large number of computer vision and image processing applications. We have mentioned a number of popular contour-based corner detectors in our paper. Among all these detectors chord to triangular arm angle (CTAA) has been demonstrated as the most dominant corner detector in terms of average repeatability. We introduce a new effective method to calculate the value of curvature in this paper. By demonstrating experimental results, our proposed technique outperforms CTAA and other detectors mentioned in this paper. The results exhibit that our proposed method is simple yet efficient at finding out corners more accurately and reliably.
