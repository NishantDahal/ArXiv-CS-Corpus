Nonlinear Interference Mitigation via Deep Neural Networks

A neural-network-based approach is presented to efficiently implement digital backpropagation (DBP). For a 32x100 km fiber-optic link, the resulting "learned" DBP significantly reduces the complexity compared to conventional DBP implementations.
