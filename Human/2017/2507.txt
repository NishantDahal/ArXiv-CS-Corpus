An association between information and communication technology and agriculture knowledge management process in Indian milk co-operatives and non-profit organizations: an empirical analysis

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between information and communication technology (ICT) and knowledge management processes (KM process) in Indian milk co-operatives and non-government organizations. Both qualitative and quantitative methods have been adopted in this study. Data were collected using questionnaires from 275 members working in both milk co-operatives and non-profit organizations (NGOs). The analysis and hypotheses testing were implemented using structural equation modeling technique (SEM). The results showed that ICT has significant (at p = 0.001) and positive effect on KM processes. The results obtained would help managers to better understand the linkage between ICT and KM processes. They could use the results to improve their ICT (tools and infrastructure) for improving the efficiency of KM process in their organizations. The proposed set of metrics could be used as common tools to measure the performance of ICT in KM process in agriculture organizations and for future research.
