On Computationally Tractable Selection of Experiments in Measurement-Constrained Regression Models

We derive computationally tractable methods to select a small subset of experiment settings from a large pool of given design points. The primary focus is on linear regression models, while the technique extends to generalized linear models and Delta's method (estimating functions of linear regression models) as well. The algorithms are based on a continuous relaxation of an otherwise intractable combinatorial optimization problem, with sampling or greedy procedures as post-processing steps. Formal approximation guarantees are established for both algorithms, and numerical results on both synthetic and real-world data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
