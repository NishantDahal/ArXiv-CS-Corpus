Massive MIMO for Communications with Drone Swarms

We illustrate the potential of massive MIMO for communication with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We consider a scenario where multiple single-antenna UAVs simultaneously communicate with a ground station (GS) equipped with a large number of antennas. Specifically, we discuss the achievable uplink (UAV to GS) capacity performance in the case of line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. We develop a realistic geometric model which incorporates an arbitrary orientation of the GS and UAV antenna elements to characterize the polarization mismatch loss which occurs due to the movement and orientation of the UAVs. A closed-form expression for a lower bound on the ergodic rate for a maximum-ratio combining receiver with estimated channel state information is derived. The optimal antenna spacing that maximizes the ergodic rate achieved by an UAV is also determined for uniform linear and rectangular arrays. It is shown that when the UAVs are spherically uniformly distributed around the GS, the ergodic rate per UAV is maximized for an antenna spacing equal to an integer multiple of one-half wavelength.
