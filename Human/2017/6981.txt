MLC Toolbox: A MATLAB/OCTAVE Library for Multi-Label Classification

Multi-Label Classification toolbox is a MATLAB/OCTAVE library for Multi-Label Classification (MLC). There exists a few Java libraries for MLC, but no MATLAB/OCTAVE library that covers various methods. This toolbox offers an environment for evaluation, comparison and visualization of the MLC results. One attraction of this toolbox is that it enables us to try many combinations of feature space dimension reduction, sample clustering, label space dimension reduction and ensemble, etc.
