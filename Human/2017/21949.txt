Towards Data Quality Assessment in Online Advertising

In online advertising, our aim is to match the advertisers with the most relevant users to optimize the campaign performance. In the pursuit of achieving this goal, multiple data sources provided by the advertisers or third-party data providers are utilized to choose the set of users according to the advertisers' targeting criteria. In this paper, we present a framework that can be applied to assess the quality of such data sources in large scale. This framework efficiently evaluates the similarity of a specific data source categorization to that of the ground truth, especially for those cases when the ground truth is accessible only in aggregate, and the user-level information is anonymized or unavailable due to privacy reasons. We propose multiple methodologies within this framework, present some preliminary assessment results, and evaluate how the methodologies compare to each other. We also present two use cases where we can utilize the data quality assessment results: the first use case is targeting specific user categories, and the second one is forecasting the desirable audiences we can reach for an online advertising campaign with pre-set targeting criteria.
