Intrinsic Point of Interest Discovery from Trajectory Data

This paper presents a framework for intrinsic point of interest discovery from trajectory databases. Intrinsic points of interest are regions of a geospatial area innately defined by the spatial and temporal aspects of trajectory data, and can be of varying size, shape, and resolution. Any trajectory database exhibits such points of interest, and hence are intrinsic, as compared to most other point of interest definitions which are said to be extrinsic, as they require trajectory metadata, external knowledge about the region the trajectories are observed, or other application-specific information. Spatial and temporal aspects are qualities of any trajectory database, making the framework applicable to data from any domain and of any resolution. The framework is developed under recent developments on the consistency of nonparametric hierarchical density estimators and enables the possibility of formal statistical inference and evaluation over such intrinsic points of interest. Comparisons of the POIs uncovered by the framework in synthetic truth data to thousands of parameter settings for common POI discovery methods show a marked improvement in fidelity without the need to tune any parameters by hand.
