Outcrop fracture characterization on suppositional planes cutting through digital outcrop models (DOMs)

Conventional fracture data collection methods are usually implemented on planar surfaces or assuming they are planar; these methods may introduce sampling errors on uneven outcrop surfaces. Consequently, data collected on limited types of outcrop surfaces (mainly bedding surfaces) may not be a sufficient representation of fracture network characteristic in outcrops. Recent development of techniques that obtain DOMs from outcrops and extract the full extent of individual fractures offers the opportunity to address the problem of performing the conventional sampling methods on uneven outcrop surfaces. In this study, we propose a new method that performs outcrop fracture characterization on suppositional planes cutting through DOMs. The suppositional plane is the best fit plane of the outcrop surface, and the fracture trace map is extracted on the suppositional plane so that the fracture network can be further characterized. The amount of sampling errors introduced by the conventional methods and avoided by the new method on 16 uneven outcrop surfaces with different roughnesses are estimated. The results show that the conventional sampling methods don't apply to outcrops other than bedding surfaces or outcrops whose roughness > 0.04 m, and that the proposed method can greatly extend the types of outcrop surfaces for outcrop fracture characterization with the suppositional plane cutting through DOMs.
