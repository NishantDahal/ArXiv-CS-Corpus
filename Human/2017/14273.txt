A Survey on Cloud Video Multicasting Over Mobile Networks

Since multimedia streaming has become very popular research topic in the recent years, this paper surveys the state of art techniques introduced for multimedia multicasting over mobile networks. In this paper, we give an overview of multimedia multicasting mechanisms in respect to cloud mobile communications, and we present some proposed solutions in perspective. We focus on the algorithms designed specifically for the video-on-demand applications. Our study on video-on-demand applications will eventually cover a wide range of applications such as cloud gaming without violating the limited scope of this survey.
