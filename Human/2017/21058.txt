CELIO: An application development framework for interactive spaces

Developing applications for interactive space is different from developing cross-platform applications for personal computing. Input, output, and architectural variations in each interactive space introduce big overhead in terms of cost and time for developing, deploying and maintaining applications for interactive spaces. Often, these applications become on-off experience tied to the deployed spaces. To alleviate this problem and enable rapid responsive space design applications similar to responsive web design, we present CELIO application development framework for interactive spaces. The framework is micro services based and neatly decouples application and design specifications from hardware and architecture specifications of an interactive space. In this paper, we describe this framework and its implementation details. Also, we briefly discuss the use cases developed using this framework.
