Reconstruction of Word Embeddings from Sub-Word Parameters

Pre-trained word embeddings improve the performance of a neural model at the cost of increasing the model size. We propose to benefit from this resource without paying the cost by operating strictly at the sub-lexical level. Our approach is quite simple: before task-specific training, we first optimize sub-word parameters to reconstruct pre-trained word embeddings using various distance measures. We report interesting results on a variety of tasks: word similarity, word analogy, and part-of-speech tagging.
