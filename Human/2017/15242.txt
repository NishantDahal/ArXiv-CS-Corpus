How the notion of ACCESS guides the organization of a European research infrastructure: the example of DARIAH

This contribution will show how Access play a strong role in the creation and structuring of DARIAH, a European Digital Research Infrastructure in Arts and Humanities.To achieve this goal, this contribution will develop the concept of Access from five examples: Interdisciplinarity point of view, Manage contradiction between national and international perspectives, Involve different communities (not only researchers stakeholders), Manage tools and services, Develop and use new collaboration tools. We would like to demonstrate that speaking about Access always implies a selection, a choice, even in the perspective of "Open Access".
