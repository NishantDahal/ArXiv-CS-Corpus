Energy Harvesting Enabled MIMO Relaying through Time Switching

This letter considers simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay system. The relay is powered by harvesting energy from the source via time switching (TS) and utilizes the harvested energy to forward the information signal. Our aim is to maximize the rate of the system subject to the power constraints at both the source and relay nodes. In the first scenario in which the source covariance matrix is an identity matrix, we present the joint-optimal solution for relaying and the TS ratio in closed form. An iterative scheme is then proposed for jointly optimizing the source and relaying matrices and the TS ratio.
