Towards Software Development For Social Robotics Systems

In this paper we introduce the core results of the project on software development for social robotics systems. The usability of maintenance and control features is crucial for many kinds of systems, but in the case of social robotics we also have to take into account that (1) the humanoid robot physically interacts with humans, (2) the conversation with children might have different requirements in comparison to the conversation with adults. The results of our work were implement for the humanoid PAL REEM robot, but their core ideas can be applied for other types of humanoid robots. We developed a web-based solution that supports the management of robot-guided tours, provides recommendations for the users as well as allows for a visual analysis of the data on previous tours.
