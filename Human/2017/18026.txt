F-index of graphs based on new operations related to the join of graphs

The forgotten topological index or F-index of a graph is defined as the sum of degree cube of all the vertices of the graph. This index was introduced by Gutman and TrinajestiÄ‡ more than 40 years ago. In this paper, we derive F-index of new operations of subdivision graphs related to the graphs join.
