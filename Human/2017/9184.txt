Improving Resilience of Autonomous Moving Platforms by Real Time Analysis of Their Cooperation

Environmental changes, failures, collisions or even terrorist attacks can cause serious malfunctions of the delivery systems. We have presented a novel approach improving resilience of Autonomous Moving Platforms AMPs. The approach is based on multi-level state diagrams describing environmental trigger specifications, movement actions and synchronization primitives. The upper level diagrams allowed us to model advanced interactions between autonomous AMPs and detect irregularities such as deadlocks live-locks etc. The techniques were presented to verify and analyze combined AMPs' behaviors using model checking technique. The described system, Dedan verifier, is still under development. In the near future, a graphical form of verified system representation is planned.
