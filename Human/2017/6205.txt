Geometry-Based Optimization of One-Way Quantum Computation Measurement Patterns

In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, an initial highly entangled state called a graph state is used to perform universal quantum computations by a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements and post-measurement Pauli-X and Pauli-Z corrections. The needed computations are organized as measurement patterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in a pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and output qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum computation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally nondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to guarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow) is a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a dependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve determinism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to simplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and Pauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement calculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these rules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation. Moreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing many ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a new scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow or gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules. Furthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for geometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed approach is improved over the previous ones.
