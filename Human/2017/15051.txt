Blended e-Learning Training (BeLT): Enhancing Railway Station Controller Knowledge

With the growing economy, e-learning consequently gained increasing attention as it conveys knowledge globally with improved interactivity, assistance, and reduced costs. For the past few years, accidental challenges have become the severe problem with railway units due to irresponsibility, lack of knowledge and improper guidance of station controllers (learners). While focusing on e-learning technologies railway units failed to admit learner's need, cultural diversity and background skills by creating ethnically impartial e-learning environments, which resulted in inadequate training and degraded performance. The purpose of this study is to understand the vision of a global diverse group of station traffic controllers about e-learning courses developed by their individual railway units. The opinions of these officials have been verified by questionnaires on the basis of course organization, course accuracy, course effectiveness, course relevance, course productivity and course interactivity. The results obtained show that the developed e-learning course was highly helpful, interactive, creative, and user-friendly for learners. This lead to making e-learning conquered among independent learners.
