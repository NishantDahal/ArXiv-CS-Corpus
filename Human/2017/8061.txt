Fourier Analysis of MAC Polarization

One problem with MAC polar codes that are based on MAC polarization is that they may not achieve the entire capacity region. The reason behind this problem is that MAC polarization sometimes induces a loss in the capacity region. This paper provides a single letter necessary and sufficient condition which characterizes all the MACs that do not lose any part of their capacity region by polarization.
