A Comparative Study of Different Source Code Metrics and Machine Learning Algorithms for Predicting Change Proneness of Object Oriented Systems

Change-prone classes or modules are defined as software components in the source code which are likely to change in the future. Change-proneness prediction is useful to the maintenance team as they can optimize and focus their testing resources on the modules which have a higher likelihood of change. Change-proneness prediction model can be built by using source code metrics as predictors or features within a machine learning classification framework. In this paper, twenty one source code metrics are computed to develop a statistical model for predicting change-proneness modules. Since the performance of the change-proneness model depends on the source code metrics, they are used as independent variables or predictors for the change-proneness model. Eleven different feature selection techniques (including the usage of all the $21$ proposed source code metrics described in the paper) are used to remove irrelevant features and select the best set of features. The effectiveness of the set of source code metrics are evaluated using eighteen different classiffication techniques and three ensemble techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the model based on selected set of source code metrics after applying feature selection techniques achieves better results as compared to the model using all source code metrics as predictors. Our experimental results reveal that the predictive model developed using LSSVM-RBF yields better result as compared to other classification techniques
