Power Control in Massive MIMO with Dynamic User Population

This paper considers the problem of power control in Massive MIMO systems taking into account the pilot contamination issue and the arrivals and departures of users in the network. Contrary to most of existing work in MIMO systems that focuses on the physical layer with fixed number of users, we consider in this work that the users arrive dynamically and leave the network once they are served. We provide a power control strategy, having a polynomial complexity, and prove that this policy stabilizes the network whenever possible. We then provide a distributed implementation of the power control policy requiring low information exchange between the BSs and show that it achieves the same stability region as the centralized policy.
