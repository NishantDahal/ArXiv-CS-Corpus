On Some Properties of Quadratic APN Functions of a Special Form

In a recent paper, it is shown that functions of the form $L_1(x^3)+L_2(x^9)$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are linear, are a good source for construction of new infinite families of APN functions. In the present work we study necessary and sufficient conditions for such functions to be APN.
