A Distance Between Filtered Spaces Via Tripods

We present a simplified treatment of stability of filtrations on finite spaces. Interestingly, we can lift the stability result for combinatorial filtrations from [CSEM06] to the case when two filtrations live on different spaces without directly invoking the concept of interleaving. We then prove that this distance is intrinsic by constructing explicit geodesics between any pair of filtered spaces. Finally we use this construction to obtain a strengthening of the stability result.
