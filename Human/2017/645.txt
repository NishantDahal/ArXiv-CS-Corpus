On Bezout Inequalities for non-homogeneous Polynomial Ideals

We introduce a "workable" notion of degree for non-homogeneous polynomial ideals and formulate and prove ideal theoretic BÃ©zout Inequalities for the sum of two ideals in terms of this notion of degree and the degree of generators. We compute probabilistically the degree of an equidimensional ideal.
