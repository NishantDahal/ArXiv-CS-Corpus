Multi-agent systems and decentralized artificial superintelligence

Multi-agents systems communication is a technology, which provides a way for multiple interacting intelligent agents to communicate with each other and with environment. Multiple-agent systems are used to solve problems that are difficult for solving by individual agent. Multiple-agent communication technologies can be used for management and organization of computing fog and act as a global, distributed operating system. In present publication we suggest technology, which combines decentralized P2P BOINC general-purpose computing tasks distribution, multiple-agents communication protocol and smart-contract based rewards, powered by Ethereum blockchain. Such system can be used as distributed P2P computing power market, protected from any central authority. Such decentralized market can further be updated to system, which learns the most efficient way for software-hardware combinations usage and optimization. Once system learns to optimize software-hardware efficiency it can be updated to general-purpose distributed intelligence, which acts as combination of single-purpose AI.
