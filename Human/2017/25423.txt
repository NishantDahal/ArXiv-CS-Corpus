A Low Cost ZigBee Sensor Network Architecture for Indoor Air Quality Monitoring

This paper presents a low-cost system architecture that has been proposed for automatically monitoring air quality indoors and continuously in real-time. The designed system is in pilot phase where 4 sensor nodes are deployed in indoor environment, and data over 4 weeks has been collected and performance analysis and assessment are performed. Environmental data from sensor nodes are sent through ZigBee communication protocol. The proposed system is low in cost, and achieves low power consumption. Hardware and network architecture are presented in addition to real-world deployment.
