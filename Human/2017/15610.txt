Efficient algorithms for scheduling equal-length jobs with processing set restrictions on uniform parallel batch machines

We consider the problem of scheduling jobs with equal lengths on uniform parallel batch machines with non-identical capacities where each job can only be processed on a specified subset of machines called its processing set. For the case of equal release times, we give efficient exact algorithms for various objective functions. For the case of unequal release times, we give efficient exact algorithms for minimizing makespan.
