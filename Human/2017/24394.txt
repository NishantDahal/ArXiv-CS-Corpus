Two-Time-Slot Bidirectional Relaying in Molecular Communication

In this paper, we study the bidirectional/two-way relaying of molecular communication and propose a relaying scheme with two time slots. Compared to the four-time-slot and three-time-slot schemes, the proposed two-time-slot scheme improves the throughput by a significant extent by allowing the end nodes to transmit simultaneously at the very first time slot. In contrast to the existing techniques, the proposed scheme employs a homogeneous molecular communication for bidirectional relaying where all the nodes (i.e., end nodes and relay node) are allowed to operate on the same type of molecule instead of utilizing different types of molecule for different nodes. As a result, this proposal of homogeneous molecular relaying remarkably improves the resource reuse capability. This paper generically characterizes the transmission and detection strategies of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we derive the analytical bit error probabilities for the multiple access and broadcast phases and present the end-to-end bit error probability of the proposed scheme. It's noteworthy that we take it into account the effect of molecular interference in the theoretical derivations. Extensive simulation is carried out, and it is shown that simulation results match very well with the derived theoretical analysis.
