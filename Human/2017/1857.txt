Spatially Aware Melanoma Segmentation Using Hybrid Deep Learning Techniques

In this paper, we proposed using a hybrid method that utilises deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks for accurate delineation of skin lesion of images supplied with ISBI 2017 lesion segmentation challenge. The proposed method was trained using 1800 images and tested on 150 images from ISBI 2017 challenge.
