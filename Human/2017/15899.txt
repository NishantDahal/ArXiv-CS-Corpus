Convex Approximated Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Multicell Multiuser OFDM

This letter considers the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRMax) problem in downlink multicell multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system. The WSRMax problem under per base station transmit power constraint is known to be NP-hard, and the optimal solution is computationally very expensive. We propose two less-complex suboptimal convex approximated solutions which are based on sequential parametric convex approximation approach. We derive provably faster convergent iterative convex approximation techniques that locally optimize the weighted sum-rate function. Both the iterative solutions are found to converge to the local optimal solution within a few iterations compared to other well-known techniques. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches.
