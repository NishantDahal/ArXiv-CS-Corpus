Novel CMOS RFIC Layout Generation with Concurrent Device Placement and Fixed-Length Microstrip Routing

With advancing process technologies and booming IoT markets, millimeter-wave CMOS RFICs have been widely developed in re- cent years. Since the performance of CMOS RFICs is very sensi- tive to the precision of the layout, precise placement of devices and precisely matched microstrip lengths to given values have been a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, and thus become a major bottleneck for time to market. This paper introduces a progressive integer-linear-programming-based method to gener- ate high-quality RFIC layouts satisfying very stringent routing requirements of microstrip lines, including spacing/non-crossing rules, precise length, and bend number minimization, within a given layout area. The resulting RFIC layouts excel in both per- formance and area with much fewer bends compared with the simulation-tuning based manual layout, while the layout gener- ation time is significantly reduced from weeks to half an hour.
