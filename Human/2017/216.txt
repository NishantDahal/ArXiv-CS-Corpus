Non-Uniformly Coupled LDPC Codes: Better Thresholds, Smaller Rate-loss, and Less Complexity

We consider spatially coupled low-density parity-check codes with finite smoothing parameters. A finite smoothing parameter is important for designing practical codes that are decoded using low-complexity windowed decoders. By optimizing the amount of coupling between spatial positions, we show that we can construct codes with excellent thresholds and small rate loss, even with the lowest possible smoothing parameter and large variable node degrees, which are required for low error floors. We also establish that the decoding convergence speed is faster with non-uniformly coupled codes, which we verify by density evolution of windowed decoding with a finite number of iterations. We also show that by only slightly increasing the smoothing parameter, practical codes with potentially low error floors and thresholds close to capacity can be constructed. Finally, we give some indications on protograph designs.
