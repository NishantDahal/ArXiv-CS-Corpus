UCT: Learning Unified Convolutional Networks for Real-time Visual Tracking

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) based tracking approaches have shown favorable performance in recent benchmarks. Nonetheless, the chosen CNN features are always pre-trained in different task and individual components in tracking systems are learned separately, thus the achieved tracking performance may be suboptimal. Besides, most of these trackers are not designed towards real-time applications because of their time-consuming feature extraction and complex optimization details.In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to learn the convolutional features and perform the tracking process simultaneously, namely, a unified convolutional tracker (UCT). Specifically, The UCT treats feature extractor and tracking process both as convolution operation and trains them jointly, enabling learned CNN features are tightly coupled to tracking process. In online tracking, an efficient updating method is proposed by introducing peak-versus-noise ratio (PNR) criterion, and scale changes are handled efficiently by incorporating a scale branch into network. The proposed approach results in superior tracking performance, while maintaining real-time speed. The standard UCT and UCT-Lite can track generic objects at 41 FPS and 154 FPS without further optimization, respectively. Experiments are performed on four challenging benchmark tracking datasets: OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2014 and VOT2015, and our method achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks compared with other real-time trackers.
