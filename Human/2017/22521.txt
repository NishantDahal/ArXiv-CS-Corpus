Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) using Interface Diversity

An important ingredient of the future 5G systems will be Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC). A way to offer URLLC without intervention in the baseband/PHY layer design is to use interface diversity and integrate multiple communication interfaces, each interface based on a different technology. In this work, we propose to use coding to seamlessly distribute coded payload and redundancy data across multiple available communication interfaces. We formulate an optimization problem to find the payload allocation weights that maximize the reliability at specific target latency values. In order to estimate the performance in terms of latency and reliability of such an integrated communication system, we propose an analysis framework that combines traditional reliability models with technology-specific latency probability distributions. Our model is capable to account for failure correlation among interfaces/technologies. By considering different scenarios, we find that optimized strategies can in some cases significantly outperform strategies based on $k$-out-of-$n$ erasure codes, where the latter do not account for the characteristics of the different interfaces. The model has been validated through simulation and is supported by experimental results.
