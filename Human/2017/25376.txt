Fingerprint Spoof Buster

The primary purpose of a fingerprint recognition system is to ensure a reliable and accurate user authentication, but the security of the recognition system itself can be jeopardized by spoof attacks. This study addresses the problem of developing accurate, generalizable, and efficient algorithms for detecting fingerprint spoof attacks. Specifically, we propose a deep convolutional neural network based approach utilizing local patches centered and aligned using fingerprint minutiae. Experimental results on three public-domain LivDet datasets (2011, 2013, and 2015) show that the proposed approach provides state-of-the-art accuracies in fingerprint spoof detection for intra-sensor, cross-material, cross-sensor, as well as cross-dataset testing scenarios. For example, in LivDet 2015, the proposed approach achieves 99.03% average accuracy over all sensors compared to 95.51% achieved by the LivDet 2015 competition winners. Additionally, two new fingerprint presentation attack datasets containing more than 20,000 images, using two different fingerprint readers, and over 12 different spoof fabrication materials are collected. We also present a graphical user interface, called Fingerprint Spoof Buster, that allows the operator to visually examine the local regions of the fingerprint highlighted as live or spoof, instead of relying on only a single score as output by the traditional approaches.
