Characterizing Polytopes Contained in the $0/1$-Cube with Bounded Chvátal-Gomory Rank

Let $S \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ and $R$ be any polytope contained in $[0,1]^n$ with $R \cap \{0,1\}^n = S$. We prove that $R$ has bounded Chvátal-Gomory rank (CG-rank) provided that $S$ has bounded notch and bounded gap, where the notch is the minimum integer $p$ such that all $p$-dimensional faces of the $0/1$-cube have a nonempty intersection with $S$, and the gap is a measure of the size of the facet coefficients of $\mathsf{conv}(S)$.
  Let $H[\bar{S}]$ denote the subgraph of the $n$-cube induced by the vertices not in $S$. We prove that if $H[\bar{S}]$ does not contain a subdivision of a large complete graph, then both the notch and the gap are bounded. By our main result, this implies that the CG-rank of $R$ is bounded as a function of the treewidth of $H[\bar{S}]$. We also prove that if $S$ has notch $3$, then the CG-rank of $R$ is always bounded. Both results generalize a recent theorem of Cornuéjols and Lee, who proved that the CG-rank is bounded by a constant if the treewidth of $H[\bar{S}]$ is at most $2$.
