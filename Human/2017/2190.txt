Multiplicities of Character Values of Binary Sidel'nikov-Lempel-Cohn-Eastman Sequences

Binary Sidel'nikov-Lempel-Cohn-Eastman sequences (or SLCE sequences) over F 2 have even period and almost perfect autocorrelation. However, the evaluation of the linear complexity of these sequences is really difficult. In this paper, we continue the study of [1]. We first express the multiple roots of character polynomials of SLCE sequences into certain kinds of Jacobi sums. Then by making use of Gauss sums and Jacobi sums in the "semiprimitive" case, we derive new divisibility results for SLCE sequences.
