Fine Grained Citation Span for References in Wikipedia

\emph{Verifiability} is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, editors being encouraged to provide citations for the added content. For a Wikipedia article, determining the \emph{citation span} of a citation, i.e. what content is covered by a citation, is important as it helps decide for which content citations are still missing.
  We are the first to address the problem of determining the \emph{citation span} in Wikipedia articles. We approach this problem by classifying which textual fragments in an article are covered by a citation. We propose a sequence classification approach where for a paragraph and a citation, we determine the citation span at a fine-grained level.
  We provide a thorough experimental evaluation and compare our approach against baselines adopted from the scientific domain, where we show improvement for all evaluation metrics.
