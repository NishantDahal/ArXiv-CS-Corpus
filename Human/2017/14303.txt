On the Cryptanalysis via Approximation of Cryptographic Primitives Relying on the Planted Clique Conjecture

While the reliable use of some NP-complete problem in tandem with the assumption that P is not equal to NP has eluded cryptographers due to lack of results showing average-case hardness, one alternative which has been explored is reliance on assumptions that solving certain NP-hard optimization problems within some degree of accuracy is computationally difficult in specific instance classes. In this work, we explore one such example of this effort which attempts to provide cryptographic primitives by relying on the planted clique conjecture. More specifically, we (1) present this construction in summary, (2) propose a simple cryptanalytic method using only approximation algorithms, and (3) consider the feasibility of such cryptanalysis in the context of existing approximation algorithms for the maximum clique problem. We ultimately find that recent advances in the area of combinatoric approximation algorithms fatally hinders the prospect of any serious application of existing candidate constructions based upon the planted clique conjecture.
