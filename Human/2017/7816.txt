Idology and Its Applications in Public Security and Network Security

Fraud (swindling money, property, or authority by fictionizing, counterfeiting, forging, or imitating things, or by feigning other persons privately) forms its threats against public security and network security. Anti-fraud is essentially the identification of a person or thing. In this paper, the authors first propose the concept of idology - a systematic and scientific study of identifications of persons and things, and give the definitions of a symmetric identity and an asymmetric identity. Discuss the converting symmetric identities (e.g., fingerprints) to asymmetric identities. Make a comparison between a symmetric identity and an asymmetric identity, and emphasize that symmetric identities cannot guard against inside jobs. Compare asymmetric RFIDs with BFIDs, and point out that a BFID is lightweight, economical, convenient, and environmentalistic, and more suitable for the anti-counterfeiting and source tracing of consumable merchandise such as foods, drugs, and cosmetics. The authors design the structure of a united verification platform for BFIDs and the composition of an identification system, and discuss the wide applications of BFIDs in public security and network security - antiterrorism and dynamic passwords for example.
