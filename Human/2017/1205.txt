Proceedings Third International Workshop on Rewriting Techniques for Program Transformations and Evaluation

This volume contains the formal proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Rewriting Techniques for Program Transformations and Evaluation (WPTE 2016), held on 23rd June 2016 in Porto, Portugal, as a satellite event of the First International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction (FSCD 2016). The workshop brought together researchers working on program transformations, evaluation, and operationally based programming language semantics, using rewriting methods, in order to share the techniques and recent developments and to exchange ideas to encourage further activation of research in this area.
