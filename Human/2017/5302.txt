Power-saving transportation mode identification for large-scale applications

Transportation mode detection with personal devices has been investigated for over ten years due to its importance in monitoring ones' activities, understanding human mobility, and assisting traffic management. However, two main limitations are still preventing it from large-scale deployments: high power consumption, and the lack of high-volume and diverse labeled data. In order to reduce power consumption, existing approaches are sampling using fewer sensors and with lower frequency, which however lead to a lower accuracy. A common way to obtain labeled data is recording the ground truth while collecting data, but such method cannot apply to large-scale deployment due to its inefficiency. To address these issues, we adopt a new low-frequency sampling manner with a hierarchical transportation mode identification algorithm and propose an offline data labeling approach with its manual and automatic implementations. Through a real-world large-scale experiment and comparison with related works, our sampling manner and algorithm are proved to consume much less energy while achieving a competitive accuracy around 85%. The new offline data labeling approach is also validated to be efficient and effective in providing ground truth for model training and testing.
