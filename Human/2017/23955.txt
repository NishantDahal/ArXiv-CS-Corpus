Armstrong's Axioms and Navigation Strategies

The paper investigates navigability with imperfect information. It shows that the properties of navigability with perfect recall are exactly those captured by Armstrong's axioms from the database theory. If the assumption of perfect recall is omitted, then Armstrong's transitivity axiom is not valid, but it can be replaced by two new weaker principles. The main technical results are soundness and completeness theorems for the logical systems describing properties of navigability with and without perfect recall.
