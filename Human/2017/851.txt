Termination of Nondeterministic Recursive Probabilistic Programs

We study the termination problem for nondeterministic recursive probabilistic programs. First, we show that a ranking-supermartingales-based approach is both sound and complete for bounded terminiation (i.e., bounded expected termination time over all schedulers). Our result also clarifies previous results which claimed that ranking supermartingales are not a complete approach even for nondeterministic probabilistic programs without recursion. Second, we show that conditionally difference-bounded ranking supermartingales provide a sound approach for lower bounds of expected termination time. Finally, we show that supermartingales with lower bounds on conditional absolute difference provide a sound approach for almost-sure termination, along with explicit bounds on tail probabilities of nontermination within a given number of steps. We also present several illuminating counterexamples that establish the necessity of certain prerequisites (such as conditionally difference-bounded condition).
