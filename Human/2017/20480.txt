Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Classification on Business Reviews

Recently Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models have proven remarkable results for text classification and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we present our approach on the task of classifying business reviews using word embeddings on a large-scale dataset provided by Yelp: Yelp 2017 challenge dataset. We compare word-based CNN using several pre-trained word embeddings and end-to-end vector representations for text reviews classification. We conduct several experiments to capture the semantic relationship between business reviews and we use deep learning techniques that prove that the obtained results are competitive with traditional methods.
