Internet of Things: Survey on Security and Privacy

The Internet of Things (IoT) is intended for ubiquitous connectivity among different entities or "things". While its purpose is to provide effective and efficient solutions, security of the devices and network is a challenging issue. The number of devices connected along with the ad-hoc nature of the system further exacerbates the situation. Therefore, security and privacy has emerged as a significant challenge for the IoT. In this paper,we aim to provide a thorough survey related to the privacy and security challenges of the IoT. This document addresses these challenges from the perspective of technologies and architecture used. This work focuses also in IoT intrinsic vulnerabilities as well as the security challenges of various layers based on the security principles of data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This survey analyzes articles published for the IoT at the time and relates it to the security conjuncture of the field and its projection to the future.
