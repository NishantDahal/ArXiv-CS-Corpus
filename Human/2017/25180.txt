Priority Rules on ATN (PRT) Intersections

In Autonomous Transit Networks some basic elements influence the throughput: network structure, maximum velocity, number of vehicles etc. Other parameters like station structure, dynamic routing or vehicle behavior on intersections play minor role. Yet in highly congested nets, when vehicles interfere in the traffic, some subtle decisions may influence overall system ridership. We tested the impact of intersection priority rules on passenger waiting time, which measures the throughput. The dependence occurred its relevance in a crowded network.
