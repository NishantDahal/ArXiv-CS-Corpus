Software Engineering Solutions To Support Vertical Transportation

In this paper we introduce the core results of the project on visualisation and analysis of data collected from the vertical transport facilities. The aim of the project was to provide better user experience as well as to help building maintenance staff to increase productivity of their work. We elaborated a web-based system for vertical transportation, to cover the needs of (1) staff working on building maintenance, (2) people who are regularly using the facilities in the corresponding buildings.
