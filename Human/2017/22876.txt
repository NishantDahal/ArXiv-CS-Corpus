MAMoC: Multisite Adaptive Offloading Framework for Mobile Cloud Applications

This paper presents MAMoC, a framework which brings together a diverse range of infrastructure types including mobile devices, cloudlets, and remote cloud resources under one unified API. MAMoC allows mobile applications to leverage the power of multiple offloading destinations. MAMoC's intelligent offloading decision engine adapts to the contextual changes in this heterogeneous environment, in order to reduce the overall runtime for both single-site and multi-site offloading scenarios. MAMoC is evaluated through a set of offloading experiments, which evaluate the performance of our offloading decision engine. The results show that offloading computation using our framework can reduce the overall task completion time for both single-site and multi-site offloading scenarios.
