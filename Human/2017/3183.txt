Resource Management in Non-orthogonal Multiple Access Networks for 5G and Beyond

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes have been proposed for the next generation of mobile communication systems to improve the access efficiency by allowing multiple users to share the same spectrum in a non-orthogonal way. Due to the strong co-channel interference among mobile users introduced by NOMA, it poses significant challenges for system design and resource management. This article reviews resource management issues in NOMA systems. The main taxonomy of NOMA is presented by focusing on the following two categories: power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA. Then a novel radio resource management framework is presented based on game-theoretic models for uplink and downlink transmissions. Finally, potential applications and open research directions in the area of resource management for NOMA are provided.
