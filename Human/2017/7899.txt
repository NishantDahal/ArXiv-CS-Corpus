Edge complexity of geometric graphs on convex independent point sets

In this paper, we focus on a generalised version of Gabriel graphs known as Locally Gabriel graphs ($LGGs$) and Unit distance graphs ($UDGs$) on convexly independent point sets. $UDGs$ are sub graphs of $LGGs$. We give a simpler proof for the claim that $LGGs$ on convex independent point sets have $2n \log n + O(n)$ edges. Then we prove that unit distance graphs on convex independent point sets have $O(n)$ edges improving the previous known bound of $O(n \log n)$.
