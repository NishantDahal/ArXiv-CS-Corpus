Exploiting Data Longevity for Enhancing the Lifetime of Flash-based Storage Class Memory

Storage-class memory (SCM) combines the benefits of a solid-state memory, such as high-performance and robustness, with the archival capabilities and low cost of conventional hard-disk magnetic storage. Among candidate solid-state nonvolatile memory technologies that could potentially be used to construct SCM, flash memory is a well-established technology and have been widely used in commercially available SCM incarnations. Flash-based SCM enables much better tradeoffs between performance, space and power than disk-based systems. However, write endurance is a significant challenge for a flash-based SCM (each act of writing a bit may slightly damage a cell, so one flash cell can be written 10^4--10^5 times, depending on the flash technology, before it becomes unusable). This is a well-documented problem and has received a lot of attention by manufactures that are using some combination of write reduction and wear-leveling techniques for achieving longer lifetime. In an effort to improve flash lifetime, first, by quantifying data longevity in an SCM, we show that a majority of the data stored in a solid-state SCM do not require long retention times provided by flash memory (i.e., up to 10 years in modern devices); second, by exploiting retention time relaxation, we propose a novel mechanism, called Dense-SLC (D-SLC), which enables us perform multiple writes into a cell during each erase cycle for lifetime extension; and finally, we discuss the required changes in the flash management software (FTL) in order to use this characteristic for extending the lifetime of the solid-state part of an SCM. Using an extensive simulation-based analysis of a flash-based SCM, we demonstrate that D-SLC is able to significantly improve device lifetime (between 5.1X and 8.6X) with no performance overhead and also very small changes at the FTL software.
