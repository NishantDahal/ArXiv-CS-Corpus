Power Modelling for Heterogeneous Cloud-Edge Data Centers

Existing power modelling research focuses not on the method used for developing models but rather on the model itself. This paper aims to develop a method for deploying power models on emerging processors that will be used, for example, in cloud-edge data centers. Our research first develops a hardware counter selection method that appropriately selects counters most correlated to power on ARM and Intel processors. Then, we propose a two stage power model that works across multiple architectures. The key results are: (i) the automated hardware performance counter selection method achieves comparable selection to the manual selection methods reported in literature, and (ii) the two stage power model can predict dynamic power more accurately on both ARM and Intel processors when compared to classic power models.
