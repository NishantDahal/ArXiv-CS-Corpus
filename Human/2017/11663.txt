Bounds and approximation results for scheduling coupled-tasks with compatibility constraints

This article is devoted to propose some lower and upper bounds for the coupled-tasks scheduling problem in presence of compatibility constraints  according to classical complexity hypothesis  ($\mathcal{P} \neq \mathcal{NP}$, $\mathcal{ETH}$). Moreover, we develop  an efficient polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the specific case for which the topology describing the compatibility constraints is a quasi split-graph.
