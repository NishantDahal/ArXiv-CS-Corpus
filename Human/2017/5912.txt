Technical Report - MillimeterWave Communication in Vehicular Networks: Coverage and Connectivity Analysis

In this technical report (TR), we describe the mathematical model we developed to carry out a preliminary coverage and connectivity analysis in an automotive communication scenario based on mmWave links. The purpose is to exemplify some of the complex and interesting tradeoffs that have to be considered when designing solutions for mmWave automotive scenarios.
