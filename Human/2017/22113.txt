An Efficient Fog-Assisted Unstable Sensor Detection Scheme with Privacy Preserved

The Internet of Thing (IoT) has been a hot topic in both research community and industry. It is anticipated that in future IoT, an enormous number of sensors will collect the physical information every moment to enable the control center making better decisions to improve the quality of service (QoS). However, the sensors maybe faulty and thus generate inaccurate data which would compromise the decision making. To guarantee the QoS, the system should be able to detect faulty sensors so as to eliminate the damages of inaccurate data. Various faulty sensor detection mechanisms have been developed in the context of wireless sensor network (WSN). Some of them are only fit for WSN while the others would bring a communication burden to control center. To detect the faulty sensors for general IoT applications and save the communication resource at the same time, an efficient faulty sensor detection scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme takes advantage of fog computing to save the computation and communication resource of control center. To preserve the privacy of sensor data, the Paillier Cryptosystem is adopted in the fog computing. The batch verification technique is applied to achieve efficient authentication. The performance analyses are presented to demonstrate that the proposed detection scheme is able to conserve the communication resource of control center and achieve a high true positive ratio while maintaining an acceptable false positive ratio. The scheme could also withstand various security attacks and preserve data privacy.
