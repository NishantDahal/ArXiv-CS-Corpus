Coverage and Rate Analysis of Super Wi-Fi Networks Using Stochastic Geometry

Recent regulatory changes proposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitting unlicensed use of television white space (TVWS) channels present new opportunities for designing wireless networks that make efficient use of this spectrum. The favorable propagation characteristics of these channels and their widespread availability, especially in rural areas, make them well-suited for providing broadband services in sparsely populated regions where economic factors hinder deployment of such services on licensed spectrum. In this context, this paper explores the deployment of an outdoor Wi-Fi-like network operating in TVWS channels, referred to commonly as a Super Wi-Fi network. Since regulations governing unlicensed use of these channels allow (a) mounting fixed devices up to a height of 30 m and operation at transmit powers of up to 4 W EIRP, and (b) operation at transmit powers of up to 100 mW EIRP for portable devices, such networks can provide extended coverage and higher rates than traditional Wi-Fi networks. However, these gains are subject to the viability of the uplink from the portable devices (clients) to the fixed devices (access points (AP)) because of tighter restrictions on transmit power of clients compared to APs. This paper leverages concepts from stochastic geometry to study the performance of such networks with specific focus on the effect of (a) transmit power asymmetry between APs and clients and its impact on uplink viability and coverage, and (b) the interplay between height and transmit power of APs in determining the network throughput. Such an analysis reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is prioritized over coverage.
