Sound event detection using weakly labeled dataset with stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network

This paper proposes a neural network architecture and training scheme to learn the start and end time of sound events (strong labels) in an audio recording given just the list of sound events existing in the audio without time information (weak labels). We achieve this by using a stacked convolutional and recurrent neural network with two prediction layers in sequence one for the strong followed by the weak label. The network is trained using frame-wise log mel-band energy as the input audio feature, and weak labels provided in the dataset as labels for the weak label prediction layer. Strong labels are generated by replicating the weak labels as many number of times as the frames in the input audio feature, and used for strong label layer during training. We propose to control what the network learns from the weak and strong labels by different weighting for the loss computed in the two prediction layers. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available dataset of 155 hours with 17 sound event classes. The method achieves the best error rate of 0.84 for strong labels and F-score of 43.3% for weak labels on the unseen test split.
