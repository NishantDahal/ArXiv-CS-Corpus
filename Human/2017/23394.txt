ICN-aware Network Slicing Framework for Mobile Data Distribution

Network slicing offers an opportunity to realize ICN as a slice in 5G deployment. We demonstrate this through a generic service orchestration framework operating on commodity compute, storage and bandwidth resource pool to realize multiple ICN service slices. Specifically, we show the dynamic creation of real-time audio/video conferencing slices, over which multi-participant communication is enabled. These slices leverage ICN features of name-based routing, integrated security, inherent support for multicasting and mobility, and in-network caching-and-computing to scale and deliver services efficiently, while dynamically adapting to varying service demands. Proposed framework also enables mobility-on-demand feature as a service over an ICN slice to more effectively support producer mobility over multi-access links, such as LTE, Wifi and Ethernet, as will be demonstrated with our demo.
