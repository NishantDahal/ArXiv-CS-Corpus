CD Grammar Systems with Two Propagating Scattered Context Components Characterize the Family of Context Sensitive Languages

The L(PSCG)=L(CS) problem asks whether propagating scattered context grammars and context sensitive grammars are equivalent. The presented paper reformulates and answers this problem in terms of CD grammar systems. More specifically, it characterizes the family of context sensitive languages by two-component CD grammar systems with propagating scattered context rules.
