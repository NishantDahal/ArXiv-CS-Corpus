Consideration on Example 2 of "An Algorithm of General Fuzzy InferenceWith The Reductive Property"

In this paper, we will show that (1) the results about the fuzzy reasoning algoritm obtained in the paper "Computer Sciences Vol. 34, No.4, pp.145-148, 2007" according to the paper "IEEE Transactions On systems, Man and cybernetics, 18, pp.1049-1056, 1988" are correct; (2) example 2 in the paper "An Algorithm of General Fuzzy Inference With The Reductive Property" presented by He Ying-Si, Quan Hai-Jin and Deng Hui-Wen according to the paper "An approximate analogical reasoning approach based on similarity measures" presented by Tursken I.B. and Zhong zhao is incorrect; (3) the mistakes in their paper are modified and then a calculation example of FMT is supplemented.
