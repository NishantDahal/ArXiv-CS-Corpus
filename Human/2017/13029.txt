Technical Report: Artificial DNA - a Concept for Self-Building Embedded Systems

This technical report deals with the concept of an artificial DNA which contains a blueprint of the structure and organization of an embedded system. This blueprint can be used to build up the embedded system in a self-organizing manner at run-time. The report describes in detail the basic principles of the the artificial DNA and its relationship to standard design methods for embedded systems. A prototypic implementation is presented and evaluated. Additionally, future work is described and a conclusion is given.
