A Dual Sparse Decomposition Method for Image Denoising

This article addresses the image denoising problem in the situations of strong noise. We propose a dual sparse decomposition method. This method makes a sub-dictionary decomposition on the over-complete dictionary in the sparse decomposition. The sub-dictionary decomposition makes use of a novel criterion based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the over-complete dictionary over the data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the dual-sparse-decomposition method surpasses state-of-art denoising performance in terms of both peak-signal-to-noise ratio and structural-similarity-index-metric, and also at subjective visual quality.
