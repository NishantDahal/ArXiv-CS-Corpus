On affine variety codes from the Klein quartic

We study a family of primary affine variety codes defined from the Klein quartic. The duals of these codes have previously been treated in [12, Ex. 3.2]. Among the codes that we construct almost all have parameters as good as the best known codes according to [9] and in the remaining few cases the parameters are almost as good. To establish the code parameters we apply the footprint bound [10, 7] from Gr√∂bner basis theory and for this purpose we develop a new method where we inspired by Buchberger's algorithm perform a series of symbolic computations. 1
