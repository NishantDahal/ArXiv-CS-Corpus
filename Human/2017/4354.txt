Detecting the Hate Code on Social Media

Social media has become an indispensable part of the everyday lives of millions of people around the world. It provides a platform for expressing opinions and beliefs, communicated to a massive audience. However, this ease with which people can express themselves has also allowed for the large scale spread of propaganda and hate speech. To prevent violating the abuse policies of social media platforms and also to avoid detection by automatic systems like Google's Conversation AI, racists have begun to use a code (a movement termed Operation Google). This involves substituting references to communities by benign words that seem out of context, in hate filled posts or Tweets. For example, users have used the words Googles and Bings to represent the African-American and Asian communities, respectively. By generating the list of users who post such content, we move a step forward from classifying tweets by allowing us to study the usage pattern of these concentrated set of users.
