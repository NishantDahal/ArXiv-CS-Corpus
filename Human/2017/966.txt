On eccentricity version of Laplacian energy of a graph

The energy of a graph G is equal to the sum of absolute values of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G, whereas the Laplacian energy of a graph G is equal to the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of G and average degree of the vertices of G. Motivated by the work from Sharafdini et al. [R. Sharafdini, H. Panahbar, Vertex weighted Laplacian graph energy and other topological indices. J. Math. Nanosci. 2016, 6, 49-57.], in this paper we investigate the eccentricity version of Laplacian energy of a graph G.
