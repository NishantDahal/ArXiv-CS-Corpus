On Artificial-Noise Aided Transmit Design for Multi-User MISO Systems with Integrated Services

This paper considers artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit designs for multi-user MISO systems in the eyes of service integration. Specifically, we combine two sorts of services, and serve them simultaneously: one multicast message intended for all receivers and one confidential message intended for only one receiver. The confidential message is kept perfectly secure from all the unauthorized receivers. Our goal is to jointly design the optimal input covariances for the multicast message, confidential message and AN, such that the achievable secrecy rate region is maximized subject to the sum power constraint. This secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem is a nonconvex vector maximization problem. To handle it, we reformulate the SRRM problem into a provably equivalent scalar optimization problem and propose a searching method to find all of its Pareto optimal points. The equivalent scalar optimization problem is identified as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem with the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Further, we show that this equivalent QoMS-constrained SRM problem, albeit nonconvex, can be efficiently handled based on a two-stage optimization approach, including solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Moreover, we also extend the SRRM problem to an imperfect channel state information (CSI) case where a worst-case robust formulation is considered. In particular, while transmit beamforming is generally a suboptimal technique to the SRRM problem, we prove that it is optimal for the confidential message transmission whether in the perfect CSI scenario or in the imperfect CSI scenario. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the AN-aided transmit designs are effective in expanding the achievable secrecy rate regions.
