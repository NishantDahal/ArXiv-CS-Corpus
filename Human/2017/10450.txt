Introducing the truly chaotic finite state machines and their applications in security field

The truly chaotic finite machines introduced by authors in previous research papers are presented here. A state of the art in this discipline, encompassing all previous mathematical investigations, is provided, explaining how finite state machines can behave chaotically regarding the slight alteration of their inputs. This behavior is explained using Turing machines and formalized thanks to a special family of discrete dynamical systems called chaotic iterations. An illustrative example is finally given in the field of hash functions.
