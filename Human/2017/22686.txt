Machine Learning Approaches for Traffic Volume Forecasting: A Case Study of the Moroccan Highway Network

In this paper, we aim to illustrate different approaches we followed while developing a forecasting tool for highway traffic in Morocco. Two main approaches were adopted: Statistical Analysis as a step of data exploration and data wrangling. Therefore, a beta model is carried out for a better understanding of traffic behavior. Next, we moved to Machine Learning where we worked with a bunch of algorithms such as Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, Extra Trees, etc. yet, we were convinced that this field of study is still considered under state of the art models, so, we were also covering an application of Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks.
