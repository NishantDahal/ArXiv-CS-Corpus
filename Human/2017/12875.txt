A New Framework for Synthetic Aperture Sonar Micronavigation

Synthetic aperture imaging systems achieve constant azimuth resolution by coherently summating the observations acquired along the aperture path. At this aim, their locations have to be known with subwavelength accuracy. In underwater Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS), the nature of propagation and navigation in water makes the retrieval of this information challenging. Inertial sensors have to be employed in combination with signal processing techniques, which are usually referred to as micronavigation. In this paper we propose a novel micronavigation approach based on the minimization of an error function between two contiguous pings having some mutual information. This error is obtained by comparing the vector space intersections between the pings orthogonal projectors. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach is demonstrated by means of simulations and by means of an experiment performed in a controlled environment.
