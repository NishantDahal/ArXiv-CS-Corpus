Modeling Transmission and Radiation Effects when Exploiting Power Line Networks for Communication

Power distribution grids are exploited by Power Line Communication (PLC) technology to convey high frequency data signals. The natural conformation of such power line networks causes a relevant part of the high frequency signals traveling through them to be radiated instead of being conducted. This causes not only electromagnetic interference (EMI) with devices positioned next to power line cables, but also a consistent deterioration of the signal integrity. Since existing PLC channel models do not take into account losses due to radiation phenomena, this paper responds to the need of developing accurate network simulators. A thorough analysis is herein presented about the conducted and radiated effects on the signal integrity, digging into differential mode to common mode signal conversion due to network imbalances. The outcome of this work allows each network element to be described by a mixed-mode transmission matrix. Furthermore, the classical per-unit-length equivalent circuit of transmission lines is extended to incorporate radiation resistances. The results of this paper lay the foundations for future developments of comprehensive power line network models that incorporate conducted and radiated phenomena.
