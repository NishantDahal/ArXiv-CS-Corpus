Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point: Reward based Intelligent Vehicle Communication using Blockchain

The Intelligent vehicle (IV) is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from many security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable to provide secure IV communication. The major issues in IV communication, are trust, data accuracy and reliability of communication data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV Communication. In this paper, we are proposing, Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point (IV-TP) mechanism for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. The IVs communicated data provides security and reliability using our proposed IV-TP. Our IV-TP mechanism provides trustworthiness for vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal presents a reward based system, an exchange of some IV-TP among IVs, during successful communication. For the data management of the IV-TP, we are using blockchain technology in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), which stores all IV-TP details of every vehicle and is accessed ubiquitously by IVs. In this paper, we evaluate our proposal with the help of intersection use case scenario for intelligent vehicles communication.
