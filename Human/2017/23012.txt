Bypass Fraud Detection: Artificial Intelligence Approach

Telecom companies are severely damaged by bypass fraud or SIM boxing. However, there is a shortage of published research to tackle this problem. The traditional method of Test Call Generating is easily overcome by fraudsters and the need for more sophisticated ways is inevitable. In this work, we are developing intelligent algorithms that mine a huge amount of mobile operator's data and detect the SIMs that are used to bypass international calls. This method will make it hard for fraudsters to generate revenue and hinder their work. Also by reducing fraudulent activities, quality of service can be increased as well as customer satisfaction. Our technique has been evaluated and tested on real world mobile operator data, and proved to be very efficient.
