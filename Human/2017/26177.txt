Skew constacyclic codes over Fq+uFq+vFq

In this paper skew constacyclic codes over finite non-chain ring R = F_q+uF_q+vF_q, where q= p^m, p is an odd prime and u^{2}=u, v^{2}=v, uv = vu = 0 are studied. We show that Gray image of a skew alpha-constacyclic cyclic code of length n over R is a skew alpha-quasi-cyclic code of length $3n$ over F_{q} of index 3. It is also shown that skew alpha-constacyclic codes are either equivalent to alpha-constacyclic codes or alpha-quasi-twisted codes over R. Further, the structural properties of skew constacyclic over R are obtained by decomposition method.
