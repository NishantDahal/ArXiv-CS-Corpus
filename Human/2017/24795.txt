How Intelligent is your Intelligent Robot?

How intelligent is robot A compared with robot B? And how intelligent are robots A and B compared with animals (or plants) X and Y? These are both interesting and deeply challenging questions. In this paper we address the question "how intelligent is your intelligent robot?" by proposing that embodied intelligence emerges from the interaction and integration of four different and distinct kinds of intelligence. We then suggest a simple diagrammatic representation on which these kinds of intelligence are shown as four axes in a star diagram. A crude qualitative comparison of the intelligence graphs of animals and robots both exposes and helps to explain the chronic intelligence deficit of intelligent robots. Finally we examine the options for determining numerical values for the four kinds of intelligence in an effort to move toward a quantifiable intelligence vector.
