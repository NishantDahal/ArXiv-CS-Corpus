Bilinear cryptography using finite $p$-groups of nilpotency class 2

In this short note, we develop a novel idea of a bilinear cryptosystem using the discrete logarithm problem in matrices. These matrices come from a linear representation of a finite $p$-group of class 2. We discuss an example at the end.
