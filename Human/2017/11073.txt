Performance Analysis of Inband FD-D2D Communications with Imperfect SI Cancellation for Wireless Video Distribution

Tremendous growing demand for high data rate services is the main driver for increasing traffic in wireless cellular networks. Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have recently been proposed to offload data via direct communications by bypassing cellular base stations (BSs). Such an offloading schemes increase capacity and reduce end-to-end delay in cellular networks and help to serve the dramatically increasing demand for high data rate. In this paper, we aim to analyze inband fullduplex (FD) D2D performance for the wireless video distribution by considering imperfect self-interference (SI) cancellation. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we analyze outage probability and spectral efficiency. Analytic and simulation results are used to demonstrate achievable gain against its half-duplex (HD) counterpart.
