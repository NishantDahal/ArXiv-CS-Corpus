Language Independent Single Document Image Super-Resolution using CNN for improved recognition

Recognition of document images have important applications in restoring old and classical texts. The problem involves quality improvement before passing it to a properly trained OCR to get accurate recognition of the text. The image enhancement and quality improvement constitute important steps as subsequent recognition depends upon the quality of the input image. There are scenarios when high resolution images are not available and our experiments show that the OCR accuracy reduces significantly with decrease in the spatial resolution of document images. Thus the only option is to improve the resolution of such document images. The goal is to construct a high resolution image, given a single low resolution binary image, which constitutes the problem of single image super-resolution. Most of the previous work in super-resolution deal with natural images which have more information-content than the document images. Here, we use Convolution Neural Network to learn the mapping between low and the corresponding high resolution images. We experiment with different number of layers, parameter settings and non-linear functions to build a fast end-to-end framework for document image super-resolution. Our proposed model shows a very good PSNR improvement of about 4 dB on 75 dpi Tamil images, resulting in a 3 % improvement of word level accuracy by the OCR. It takes less time than the recent sparse based natural image super-resolution technique, making it useful for real-time document recognition applications.
