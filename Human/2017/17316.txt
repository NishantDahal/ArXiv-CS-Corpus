A Study of the Management of Electronic Medical Records in Fijian Hospitals

Despite having a number of benefits for healthcare settings, the successful implementation of health information systems (HIS) continues to be a challenge in many developing countries. This paper examines the current state of health information systems in government hospitals in Fiji. It also investigates if the general public as well as medical practitioners in Fiji have interest in having web based electronic medical records systems that allow patients to access their medical reports and make online bookings for their appointments. Nausori Health Centre was used as a case study to examine the information systems in a government hospital in Fiji.
