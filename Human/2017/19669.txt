Zero-Error Capacity of $P$-ary Shift Channels and FIFO Queues

The objects of study of this paper are communication channels in which the dominant type of noise are symbol shifts, the main motivating examples being timing and bit-shift channels. Two channel models are introduced and their zero-error capacities and zero-error-detection capacities determined by explicit constructions of optimal codes. Model A can be informally described as follows: 1) The information is stored in an $ n $-cell register, where each cell is either empty or contains a particle of one of $ P $ possible types, and 2) due to the imperfections of the device each of the particles may be shifted several cells away from its original position over time. Model B is an abstraction of a single-server queue: 1) The transmitter sends packets from a $ P $-ary alphabet through a queuing system with an infinite buffer and a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) service procedure, and 2) each packet is being processed by the server for a random number of time slots. More general models including additional types of noise that the particles/packets can experience are also studied, as are the continuous-time versions of these problems.
