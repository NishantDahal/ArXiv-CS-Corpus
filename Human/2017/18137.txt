Indistinguishability and Energy Sensitivity of Asymptotically Gaussian Compressed Encryption

The principle of compressed sensing (CS) can be applied in a cryptosystem by providing the notion of security. In information-theoretic sense, it is known that a CS-based cryptosystem can be perfectly secure if it employs a random Gaussian sensing matrix updated at each encryption and its plaintext has constant energy. In this paper, we propose a new CS-based cryptosystem that employs a secret bipolar keystream and a public unitary matrix, which can be suitable for practical implementation by generating and renewing the keystream in a fast and efficient manner. We demonstrate that the sensing matrix is asymptotically Gaussian for a sufficiently large plaintext length, which guarantees a reliable CS decryption for a legitimate recipient. By means of probability metrics, we also show that the new CS-based cryptosystem can have the indistinguishability against an adversary, as long as the keystream is updated at each encryption and each plaintext has constant energy. Finally, we investigate how much the security of the new CS-based cryptosystem is sensitive to energy variation of plaintexts.
