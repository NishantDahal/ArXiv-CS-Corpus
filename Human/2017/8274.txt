Control and Energy Management System in Microgrids

As a cutting-edge technology, microgrids feature intelligent EMSs and sophisticated control, which will dramatically change our energy infrastructure. The modern microgrids are a relatively recent development with high potential to bring distributed generation, DES devices, controllable loads, communication infrastructure, and many new technologies into the mainstream. As a more controllable and intelligent entity, a microgrid has more growth potential than ever before. However, there are still many open questions, such as the future business models and economics. What is the cost-benefit to the end-user? How should we systematically evaluate the potential benefits and costs of control and energy management in a microgrid?
