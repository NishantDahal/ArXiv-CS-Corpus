A Slow Read attack Using Cloud

Cloud computing relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications. Nowadays, cloud computing has become one of the fastest growing fields in information technology. However, several new security issues of cloud computing have emerged due to its service delivery models. In this paper, we discuss the case of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using Cloud resources. First, we show how such attack using a cloud platform could not be detected by previous techniques. Then we present a tricky solution based on the cloud as well.
