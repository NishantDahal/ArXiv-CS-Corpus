Mastering Heterogeneous Behavioural Models

Heterogeneity is one important feature of complex systems, leading to the complexity of their construction and analysis. Moving the heterogeneity at model level helps in mastering the difficulty of composing heterogeneous models which constitute a large system. We propose a method made of an algebra and structure morphisms to deal with the interaction of behavioural models, provided that they are compatible. We prove that heterogeneous models can interact in a safe way, and therefore complex heterogeneous systems can be built and analysed incrementally. The Uppaal tool is targeted for experimentations.
