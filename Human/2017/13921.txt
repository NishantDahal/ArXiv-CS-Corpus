Validation of Collaborative Business Processes using Goals Model

Validating process model against corresponding requirements is one of the most important problems in domain of collaborative processes. In this paper collaborative processes are modeled using the interaction view of BPMN 2.0 standard. Then, requirements are extracted with a goal modeling technique. Different scenarios of each requirement show possible paths for the system. These paths are modeled by sequence diagram and collaborative processes are validated according to the corresponding requirements using Savara tool.
