Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization is Possible using Ruzsa-Szeméredi Graphs

Coded caching is a problem where encoded broadcasts are used to satisfy users requesting popular files and having caching capabilities. Recent work by Maddah-Ali and Niesen showed that it is possible to satisfy a scaling number of users with only a constant number of broadcast transmissions by exploiting coding and caching. Unfortunately, all previous schemes required the splitting of files into an exponential number of packets before the significant coding gains of caching appeared. The question of what can be achieved with polynomial subpacketization (in the number of users) has been a central open problem in this area. We resolve this problem and present the first coded caching scheme with polynomial (in fact, linear) subpacketization. We obtain a number of transmissions that is not constant, but can be any polynomial in the number of users with an exponent arbitrarily close to zero. Our central technical tool is a novel connection between Ruzsa-Szeméredi graphs and coded caching.
