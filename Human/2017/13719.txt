Computational complexity and 3-manifolds and zombies

We show the problem of counting homomorphisms from the fundamental group of a homology $3$-sphere $M$ to a finite, non-abelian simple group $G$ is #P-complete, in the case that $G$ is fixed and $M$ is the computational input. Similarly, deciding if there is a non-trivial homomorphism is NP-complete. In both reductions, we can guarantee that every non-trivial homomorphism is a surjection. As a corollary, for any fixed integer $m \ge 5$, it is NP-complete to decide whether $M$ admits a connected $m$-sheeted covering.
  Our construction is inspired by universality results in topological quantum computation. Given a classical reversible circuit $C$, we construct $M$ so that evaluations of $C$ with certain initialization and finalization conditions correspond to homomorphisms $π_1(M) \to G$. An intermediate state of $C$ likewise corresponds to a homomorphism $π_1(Σ_g) \to G$, where $Σ_g$ is a pointed Heegaard surface of $M$ of genus $g$. We analyze the action on these homomorphisms by the pointed mapping class group $\text{MCG}_*(Σ_g)$ and its Torelli subgroup $\text{Tor}_*(Σ_g)$. By results of Dunfield-Thurston, the action of $\text{MCG}_*(Σ_g)$ is as large as possible when $g$ is sufficiently large; we can pass to the Torelli group using the congruence subgroup property of $\text{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})$. Our results can be interpreted as a sharp classical universality property of an associated combinatorial $(2+1)$-dimensional TQFT.
