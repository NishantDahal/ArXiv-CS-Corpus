Z2Z4Z8-Cyclic Codes

In this paper we study Z2Z4Z8-additive codes, which are the extension of recently introduced Z2Z4-additive codes. We determine the standard forms of the generator and parity-check matrices of Z2Z4Z8-additive codes. Moreover, we investigate Z2Z4Z8-cyclic codes giving their generator polynomials and spanning sets. We also give some illustrative examples of both Z2Z4Z8-additive codes and Z2Z4Z8-cyclic codes.
