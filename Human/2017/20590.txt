Netrunner Mate-in-1 or -2 is Weakly NP-Hard

We prove that deciding whether the Runner can win this turn (mate-in-1) in the Netrunner card game generalized to allow decks to contain an arbitrary number of copies of a card is weakly NP-hard. We also prove that deciding whether the Corp can win within two turns (mate-in-2) in this generalized Netrunner is weakly NP-hard.
