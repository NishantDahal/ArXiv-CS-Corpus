Applications of potential theoretic mother bodies in Electrostatics

Any polyhedron accommodates a type of potential theoretic skeleton called a mother body. The study of such mother bodies was originally from Mathematical Physics, initiated by Zidarov and developed by Bj√∂rn Gustafson and Makoto Sakai. In this paper, we attempt to apply the brilliant idea of mother body to Electrostatics to compute the potentials of electric fields.
