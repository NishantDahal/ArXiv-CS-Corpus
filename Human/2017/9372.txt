Developing All-Skyrmion Spiking Neural Network

In this work, we have proposed a revolutionary neuromorphic computing methodology to implement All-Skyrmion Spiking Neural Network (AS-SNN). Such proposed methodology is based on our finding that skyrmion is a topological stable spin texture and its spatiotemporal motion along the magnetic nano-track intuitively interprets the pulse signal transmission between two interconnected neurons. In such design, spike train in SNN could be encoded as particle-like skyrmion train and further processed by the proposed skyrmion-synapse and skyrmion-neuron within the same magnetic nano-track to generate output skyrmion as post-spike. Then, both pre-neuron spikes and post-neuron spikes are encoded as particle-like skyrmions without conversion between charge and spin signals, which fundamentally differentiates our proposed design from other hybrid Spin-CMOS designs. The system level simulation shows 87.1% inference accuracy for handwritten digit recognition task, while the energy dissipation is ~1 fJ/per spike which is 3 orders smaller in comparison with CMOS based IBM TrueNorth system.
