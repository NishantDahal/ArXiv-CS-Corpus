Dependency-Aware Software Release Planning through Mining User Preferences

Considering user preferences is a determining factor in optimizing the value of a software release. This is due to the fact that user preferences for software features specify the values of those features and consequently determine the value of the release. Certain features of a software however, may encourage or discourage users to prefer (select or use) other features. As such, value of a software feature could be positively or negatively influenced by other features. Such influences are known as Value-related Feature (Requirement) Dependencies. Value-related dependencies need to be considered in software release planning as they influence the value of the optimal subset of the features selected by the release planning models. Hence, we have proposed considering value-related feature dependencies in software release planning through mining user preferences for software features. We have demonstrated the validity and practicality of the proposed approach by studying a real world software project.
