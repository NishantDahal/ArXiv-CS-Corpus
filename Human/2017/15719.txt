The Storage vs Repair Bandwidth Trade-off for Multiple Failures in Clustered Storage Networks

We study the trade-off between storage overhead and inter-cluster repair bandwidth in clustered storage systems, while recovering from multiple node failures within a cluster. A cluster is a collection of $m$ nodes, and there are $n$ clusters. For data collection, we download the entire content from any $k$ clusters. For repair of $t \geq 2$ nodes within a cluster, we take help from $\ell$ local nodes, as well as $d$ helper clusters. We characterize the optimal trade-off under functional repair, and also under exact repair for the minimum storage and minimum inter-cluster bandwidth (MBR) operating points. Our bounds show the following interesting facts: $1)$ When $t|(m-\ell)$ the trade-off is the same as that under $t=1$, and thus there is no advantage in jointly repairing multiple nodes, $2)$ When $t \nmid (m-\ell)$, the optimal file-size at the MBR point under exact repair can be strictly less than that under functional repair. $3)$ Unlike the case of $t=1$, increasing the number of local helper nodes does not necessarily increase the system capacity under functional repair.
