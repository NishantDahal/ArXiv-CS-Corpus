The OSCOSS project (Opening Scholarly Communication in Social Sciences), which will be outlined, aims at providing integrated support for all steps of the scholarly communication process. Incl. collaborative writing of a scientific paper, collecting data related to existing publications, interpreting and including data in a paper, submitting the paper for peer review, reviewing the paper, publishing an article, and, finally, facilitating its consumption by readers. The OSCOSS project will support this process considering in particular the perspective of three main actors detailed in the use case descriptions below: readers, authors and reviewers.
