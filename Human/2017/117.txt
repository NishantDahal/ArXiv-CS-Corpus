An Exploratory Study on the Implementation and Adoption of ERP Solutions for Businesses

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have been covered in both mainstream Information Technology (IT) periodicals, and in academic literature, as a result of extensive adoption by organisations in the last two decades. Some of the past studies have reported operational efficiency and other gains, while other studies have pointed out the challenges. ERP systems continue to evolve, moving into the cloud hosted sphere, and being implemented by relatively smaller and regional companies. This project has carried out an exploratory study into the use of ERP systems, within Hawke's Bay New Zealand. ERP systems make up a major investment and undertaking by those companies. Therefore, research and lessons learned in this area are very important. In addition to a significant initial literature review, this project has conducted a survey on the local users' experience with Microsoft Dynamics NAV (a popular ERP brand). As a result, this study will contribute new and relevant information to the literature on business information systems and to ERP systems, in particular.
