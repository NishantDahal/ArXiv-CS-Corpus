Asynchronous Early Output Section-Carry Based Carry Lookahead Adder with Alias Carry Logic

A new asynchronous early output section-carry based carry lookahead adder (SCBCLA) with alias carry output logic is presented in this paper. To evaluate the proposed SCBCLA with alias carry logic and to make a comparison with other CLAs, a 32-bit addition operation is considered. Compared to the weak-indication SCBCLA with alias logic, the proposed early output SCBCLA with alias logic reports a 13% reduction in area without any increases in latency and power dissipation. On the other hand, in comparison with the early output recursive CLA (RCLA), the proposed early output SCBCLA with alias logic reports a 16% reduction in latency while occupying almost the same area and dissipating almost the same average power. All the asynchronous CLAs are quasi-delay-insensitive designs which incorporate the delay-insensitive dual-rail data encoding and adhere to the 4-phase return-to-zero handshaking. The adders were realized and the simulations were performed based on a 32/28nm CMOS process.
