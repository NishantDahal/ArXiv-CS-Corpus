Proceedings Fourth International Workshop on Linearity

This volume contains the papers presented at LINEARITY 2016, the Fourth International Workshop on Linearity, held on June 26, 2016 in Porto, Portugal. The workshop was a one-day satellite event of FSCD 2016, the first International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction.
  The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers who are developing theory and applications of linear calculi, to foster their interaction and provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Of interest were new results that made a central use of linearity, ranging from foundational work to applications in any field. This included: sub-linear logics, linear term calculi, linear type systems, linear proof-theory, linear programming languages, applications to concurrency, interaction-based systems, verification of linear systems, and biological and chemical models of computation.
