PRT (Personal Rapid Transit) network simulation

Transportation problems of large urban conurbations inspire search for new transportation systems, that meet high environmental standards, are relatively cheap and user friendly. The latter element also includes the needs of disabled and elderly people. This article concerns a new transportation system PRT - Personal Rapid Transit. In this article the attention is focused on the analysis of the efficiency of the PRT transport network. The simulator of vehicle movement in PRT network as well as algorithms for traffic management and control will be presented. The proposal of its physical implementation will be also included.
