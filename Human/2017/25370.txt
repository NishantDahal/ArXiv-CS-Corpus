Encoding DNA sequences by integer chaos game representation

DNA sequences are fundamental for encoding genetic information. The genetic information may not only be understood by symbolic sequences but also from the hidden signals inside the sequences. The symbolic sequences need to be transformed into numerical sequences so the hidden signals can be revealed by signal processing techniques. All current transformation methods encode DNA sequences into numerical values of the same length. These representations have limitations in the applications of genomic signal compression, encryption, and steganography. We propose an integer chaos game representation (iCGR) of DNA sequences and a lossless encoding method DNA sequences by the iCGR. In the iCGR method, a DNA sequence is represented by the iterated function of the nucleotides and their positions in the sequence. Then the DNA sequence can be uniquely encoded and recovered using three integers from iCGR. One integer is the sequence length and the other two integers represent the accumulated distributions of nucleotides in the sequence. The integer encoding scheme can compress a DNA sequence by 2 bits per nucleotide. The integer representation of DNA sequences provides a prospective tool for sequence compression, encryption, and steganography.
