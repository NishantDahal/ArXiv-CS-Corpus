Adversarial training and dilated convolutions for brain MRI segmentation

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to various automatic image segmentation tasks in medical image analysis, including brain MRI segmentation. Generative adversarial networks have recently gained popularity because of their power in generating images that are difficult to distinguish from real images.
  In this study we use an adversarial training approach to improve CNN-based brain MRI segmentation. To this end, we include an additional loss function that motivates the network to generate segmentations that are difficult to distinguish from manual segmentations. During training, this loss function is optimised together with the conventional average per-voxel cross entropy loss.
  The results show improved segmentation performance using this adversarial training procedure for segmentation of two different sets of images and using two different network architectures, both visually and in terms of Dice coefficients.
