Algorithms for zero-dimensional ideals using linear recurrent sequences

Inspired by Faug√®re and Mou's sparse FGLM algorithm, we show how using linear recurrent multi-dimensional sequences can allow one to perform operations such as the primary decomposition of an ideal, by computing the annihilator of one or several such sequences.
