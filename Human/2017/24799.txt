Biological Systems as Heterogeneous Information Networks: A Mini-review and Perspectives

In the real world, most objects and data have multiple types of attributes and inter-connections. Such data structures are named "Heterogeneous Information Networks" (HIN) and have been widely researched. Biological systems are also considered to be highly complicated HIN. In this work, we review various applications of HIN methods to biological and chemical data, discuss some advanced topics, and describe some future research directions.
