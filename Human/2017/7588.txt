Online characterization of planetary surfaces: PlanetServer, an open-source analysis and visualization tool

The lack of open-source tools for hyperspectral data visualization and analysiscreates a demand for new tools. In this paper we present the new PlanetServer,a set of tools comprising a web Geographic Information System (GIS) and arecently developed Python Application Programming Interface (API) capableof visualizing and analyzing a wide variety of hyperspectral data from differentplanetary bodies. Current WebGIS open-source tools are evaluated in orderto give an overview and contextualize how PlanetServer can help in this mat-ters. The web client is thoroughly described as well as the datasets availablein PlanetServer. Also, the Python API is described and exposed the reason ofits development. Two different examples of mineral characterization of differenthydrosilicates such as chlorites, prehnites and kaolinites in the Nili Fossae areaon Mars are presented. As the obtained results show positive outcome in hyper-spectral analysis and visualization compared to previous literature, we suggestusing the PlanetServer approach for such investigations.
