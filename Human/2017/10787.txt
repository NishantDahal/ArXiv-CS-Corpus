Cloud Storage Forensics: Analysis of Data Remnants on SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud

STorage as a Service (STaaS) cloud platforms benefits such as getting access to data anywhere, anytime, on a wide range of devices made them very popular among businesses and individuals. As such forensics investigators are increasingly facing cases that involve investigation of STaaS platforms. Therefore, it is essential for cyber investigators to know how to collect, preserve, and analyse evidences of these platforms. In this paper, we describe investigation of three STaaS platforms namely SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud on Windows 8.1 and iOS 8.1.1 devices. Moreover, possible changes on uploaded and downloaded files metadata on these platforms would be tracked and their forensics value would be investigated.
