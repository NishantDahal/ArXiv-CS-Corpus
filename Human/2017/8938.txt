A General Scheme Implicit Force Control for a Flexible-Link Manipulator

In this paper we propose an implicit force control scheme for a one-link flexible manipulator that interact with a compliant environment. The controller was based in the mathematical model of the manipulator, considering the dynamics of the beam flexible and the gravitational force. With this method, the controller parameters are obtained from the structural parameters of the beam (link) of the manipulator. This controller ensure the stability based in the Lyapunov Theory. The controller proposed has two closed loops: the inner loop is a tracking control with gravitational force and vibration frequencies compensation and the outer loop is a implicit force control. To evaluate the performance of the controller, we have considered to three different manipulators (the length, the diameter were modified) and three environments with compliance modified. The results obtained from simulations verify the asymptotic tracking and regulated in position and force respectively and the vibrations suppression of the beam in a finite time.
