Design Space of Programming Tools on Mobile Touchscreen Devices

While mobile touchscreen devices are ubiquitous and present opportunities for novel applications, they have seen little adoption as tools for computer programming. In this literature survey, we bring together the diverse research work on programming-related tasks supported by mobile touchscreen devices to explore the design space for applying them to programming situations. We used the Grounded theory approach to identify themes and classify previous work. We present these themes and how each paper contributes to the theme, and we outline the remaining challenges in and opportunities for using mobile touchscreen devices in programming applications.
