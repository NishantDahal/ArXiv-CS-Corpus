An Applied Knowledge Framework to Study Complex Systems

The complexity of knowledge production on complex systems is well-known, but there still lacks knowledge framework that would both account for a certain structure of knowledge production at an epistemological level and be directly applicable to the study and management of complex systems. We set a basis for such a framework, by first analyzing in detail a case study of the construction of a geographical theory of complex territorial systems, through mixed methods, namely qualitative interview analysis and quantitative citation network analysis. We can therethrough inductively build a framework that considers knowledge entreprises as perspectives, with co-evolving components within complementary knowledge domains. We finally discuss potential applications and developments.
