Linear-time approximation schemes for planar minimum three-edge connected and three-vertex connected spanning subgraphs

We present the first polynomial-time approximation schemes, i.e., (1 + ε)-approximation algorithm for any constant ε > 0, for the minimum three-edge connected spanning subgraph problem and the minimum three-vertex connected spanning subgraph problem in undirected planar graphs. Both the approximation schemes run in linear time.
