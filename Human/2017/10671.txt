Beamforming and Scheduling for mmWave Downlink Sparse Virtual Channels With Non-Orthogonal and Orthogonal Multiple Access

We consider the problem of scheduling and power allocation for the downlink of a 5G cellular system operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band and serving two sets of users: fix-rate (FR) users typically seen in device-to-device (D2D) communications, and variable-rate (VR) users, or high data rate services. The scheduling objective is the weighted sum-rate of both FR and VR users, and the constraints ensure that active FR users get the required rate. The weights of the objective function provide a trade-off between the number of served FR users and the resources allocated to VR users. For mmWave channels the virtual channel matrix obtained by applying fixed discrete-Fourier transform (DFT) beamformers at both the transmitter and the receiver is sparse. This results into a sparsity of the resulting multiple access channel, which is exploited to simplify scheduling, first establishing an interference graph among users and then grouping users according to their orthogonality. The original scheduling problem is solved using a graph-coloring algorithm on the interference graph in order to select sub-sets of orthogonal VR users. Two options are considered for FR users: either they are chosen orthogonal to VR users or non-orthogonal. A waterfilling algorithm is then used to allocate power to the FR users.
