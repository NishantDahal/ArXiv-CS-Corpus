Massive BLAST: An Architecture for Realizing Ultra-High Data Rates for Large-Scale MIMO

A detection scheme for uplink massive MIMO, dubbed massive-BLAST or M-BLAST, is proposed. The derived algorithm is an enhancement of the well-known soft parallel interference cancellation. Using computer simulations in massive MIMO application scenarios, M-BLAST is shown to yield a substantially better error performance with reduced complexity, compared to the benchmark alternative of a one-shot linear detector, as well as the original sequential V-BLAST. Hence, M-BLAST may serve as a computationally efficient means to exploit the large number of antennas in massive MIMO.
