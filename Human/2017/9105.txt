Towards an augmented reality fourth generation social networks

A concept of fourth generation social network is described as one that, built on the features of augmented reality (AR), is able to implement an enriched layer of digital information that displays in People Augmented Reality (PAR) devices data shared by users in social networks. This PAR layer is accessed by the users in their devices through camera effects when targeting with a mobile phone to a user holding a mobile device with AGPS and with a profile in social media. The social network of fourth generation will be a combination between Facebook and Pokemon Go.
