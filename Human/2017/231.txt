Monitoring and Intervention: Concepts and Formal Models

Our machines, products, utilities, and environments have long been monitored by embedded software systems. Our professional, commercial, social and personal lives are also subject to monitoring as they are mediated by software systems. Data on nearly everything now exists, waiting to be collected and analysed for all sorts of reasons. Given the rising tide of data we pose the questions: What is monitoring? Do diverse and disparate monitoring systems have anything in common? We attempt answer these questions by proposing an abstract conceptual framework for studying monitoring. We argue that it captures a structure common to many different monitoring practices, and that from it detailed formal models can be derived, customised to applications. The framework formalises the idea that monitoring is a process that observes the behaviour of people and objects in a context. The entities and their behaviours are represented by abstract data types and the observable attributes by logics. Since monitoring usually has a specific purpose, we extend the framework with protocols for detecting attributes or events that require interventions and, possibly, a change in behaviour. Our theory is illustrated by a case study from criminal justice, that of electronic tagging.
