A Two-Stage Allocation Scheme for Delay-Sensitive Services in Dense Vehicular Networks

Driven by the rapid development of wireless communication system, more and more vehicular services can be efficiently supported via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. In order to allocate radio resource with the reasonable implementation complexity in dense urban intersection, a two-stage allocation algorithm is proposed in this paper, whose main objective is to minimize delay and ensure reliability. In particular, as for the first stage, the allocation policy is based on traffic density information (TDI), which is different from utilizing channel state information (CSI) and queue state information (QSI) in the second stage. Moreover, in order to reflect the influence of TDI on delay, a macroscopic vehicular mobility model is employed in this paper. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can acquire an asymptotically optimal performance with the acceptable complexity.
