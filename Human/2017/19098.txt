Towards combinatorial modeling of wireless technology generations

The paper addresses the following problems: (1) a brief survey on wireless mobile communication technologies including evolution, history evolution (e.g., chain of system generations 0G, 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, 6G, 7G); (2) using a hierarchical structural modular approach to the generations of the wireless communication systems (i.e., hierarchical combinatorial modeling of the communication technologies), (3) illustrative usage of two-stage combinatorial approach to improvement/forecasting of the communication technology (a version of 5G) (on the basis of multiple choice problem). Numerical examples illustrate the suggested combinatorial approach.
