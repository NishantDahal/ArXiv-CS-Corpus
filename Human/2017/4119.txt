Full-duplex Amplify-and-Forward Relaying: Power and Location Optimization

In this paper, we consider a full-duplex (FD) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system and optimize its power allocation and relay location to minimize the system symbol error rate (SER). We first derive the asymptotic expressions of the outage probability and SER performance by taking into account the residual self interference (RSI) in FD systems. We then formulate the optimization problem based on the minimal SER criterion. Analytical and numerical results show that optimized relay location and power allocation can greatly improve system SER performance, and the performance floor caused by the RSI can be significantly reduced via optimizing relay location or power allocation.
