Preparing HPC Applications for the Exascale Era: A Decoupling Strategy

Production-quality parallel applications are often a mixture of diverse operations, such as computation- and communication-intensive, regular and irregular, tightly coupled and loosely linked operations. In conventional construction of parallel applications, each process performs all the operations, which might result inefficient and seriously limit scalability, especially at large scale. We propose a decoupling strategy to improve the scalability of applications running on large-scale systems.
  Our strategy separates application operations onto groups of processes and enables a dataflow processing paradigm among the groups. This mechanism is effective in reducing the impact of load imbalance and increases the parallel efficiency by pipelining multiple operations. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation using MPI, the de-facto programming system on current supercomputers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy by decoupling the reduce, particle communication, halo exchange and I/O operations in a set of scientific and data-analytics applications. A performance evaluation on 8,192 processes of a Cray XC40 supercomputer shows that the proposed approach can achieve up to 4x performance improvement.
