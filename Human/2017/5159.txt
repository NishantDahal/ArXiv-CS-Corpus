Human Eye Visual Hyperacuity: A New Paradigm for Sensing?

The human eye appears to be using a low number of sensors for image capturing. Furthermore, regarding the physical dimensions of cones-photoreceptors responsible for the sharp central vision-, we may realize that these sensors are of a relatively small size and area. Nonetheless, the eye is capable to obtain high resolution images due to visual hyperacuity and presents an impressive sensitivity and dynamic range when set against conventional digital cameras of similar characteristics. This article is based on the hypothesis that the human eye may be benefiting from diffraction to improve both image resolution and acquisition process. The developed method intends to explain and simulate using MATLAB software the visual hyperacuity: the introduction of a controlled diffraction pattern at an initial stage, enables the use of a reduced number of sensors for capturing the image and makes possible a subsequent processing to improve the final image resolution. The results have been compared with the outcome of an equivalent system but in absence of diffraction, achieving promising results. The main conclusion of this work is that diffraction could be helpful for capturing images or signals when a small number of sensors available, which is far from being a resolution-limiting factor.
