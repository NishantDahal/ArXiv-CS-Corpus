Applying Software Patterns to Address Interoperability in Blockchain-based Healthcare Apps

Since the inception of the Bitcoin technology, its underlying data structure--the blockchain--has garnered much attention due to properties such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These properties make blockchains suitable for apps that require disintermediation through trustless exchange, consistent and incorruptible transaction records, and operational models beyond cryptocurrency. In particular, blockchain and its smart contract capabilities have the potential to address healthcare interoperability issues, such as enabling effective interactions between users and medical applications, delivering patient data securely to a variety of organizations and devices, and improving the overall efficiency of medical practice workflow. Despite the interest in using blockchain for healthcare interoperability, however, little information is available on the concrete architectural styles and patterns for applying blockchain to healthcare apps. This paper provides an initial step in filling this gap by showing: (1) the features and implementation challenges in healthcare interoperability, (2) an end-to-end case study of a blockchain-based healthcare app we are developing, and (3) how applying foundational software patterns can help address common interoperability challenges faced by blockchain-based healthcare apps.
