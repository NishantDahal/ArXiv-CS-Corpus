A Comparative Analysis of Social Network Pages by Interests of Their Followers

Being a matter of cognition, user interests should be apt to classification independent of the language of users, social network and content of interest itself. To prove it, we analyze a collection of English and Russian Twitter and Vkontakte community pages by interests of their followers. First, we create a model of Major Interests (MaIs) with the help of expert analysis and then classify a set of pages using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and some other). We take three interest domains that are typical of both English and Russian-speaking communities: football, rock music, vegetarianism. The results of classification show a greater correlation between Russian-Vkontakte and Russian-Twitter pages while English-Twitterpages appear to provide the highest score.
