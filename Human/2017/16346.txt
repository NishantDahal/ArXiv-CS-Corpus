A combination chaotic system and application in color image encryption

In this paper, by using Logistic, Sine and Tent systems we define a combination chaotic system. Some properties of the chaotic system are studied by using figures and numerical results. A color image encryption algorithm is introduced based on new chaotic system. Also this encryption algorithm can be used for gray scale or binary images.
  The experimental results of the encryption algorithm show that the encryption algorithm is secure and practical.
