Validation of Internal Meters of Mobile Android Devices

In this paper we outline our results for validating the precision of the internal power meters of smart-phones under different workloads. We compare its results with an external power meter. This is the first step towards creating customized energy models on the fly and towards optimizing battery efficiency using genetic program improvements. Our experimental results indicate that the internal meters are sufficiently precise when large enough time windows are considered.
  This is part of our work on the "dreaming smart-phone". For a technical demonstration please watch our videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeeFz2GLFdU and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7WHoLW1KYw.
