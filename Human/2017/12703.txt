Generation of concept-representative symbols

The visual representation of concepts or ideas through the use of simple shapes has always been explored in the history of Humanity, and it is believed to be the origin of writing. We focus on computational generation of visual symbols to represent concepts. We aim to develop a system that uses background knowledge about the world to find connections among concepts, with the goal of generating symbols for a given concept. We are also interested in exploring the system as an approach to visual dissociation and visual conceptual blending. This has a great potential in the area of Graphic Design as a tool to both stimulate creativity and aid in brainstorming in projects such as logo, pictogram or signage design.
