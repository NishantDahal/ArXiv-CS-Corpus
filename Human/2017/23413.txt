Fine-tuning Tree-LSTM for phrase-level sentiment classification on a Polish dependency treebank. Submission to PolEval task 2

We describe a variant of Child-Sum Tree-LSTM deep neural network (Tai et al, 2015) fine-tuned for working with dependency trees and morphologically rich languages using the example of Polish. Fine-tuning included applying a custom regularization technique (zoneout, described by (Krueger et al., 2016), and further adapted for Tree-LSTMs) as well as using pre-trained word embeddings enhanced with sub-word information (Bojanowski et al., 2016). The system was implemented in PyTorch and evaluated on phrase-level sentiment labeling task as part of the PolEval competition.
