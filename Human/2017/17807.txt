The study, based on the Web of Science, analyses 758 articles published from 2000 to 2014. Our analysis includes the publications' output, authorship, institutional and country patterns of production, citations and collaboration. A Social Network Analysis was conducted to identify primary groups of researchers and institutions and the collaboration between countries. The study reveals that 1097 authors and 453 Institutions have contributed to the journal. The collaboration index has increased progressively, and the average degree of collaboration during the study period was 1.98. The majority of the papers were contributed by professionals affiliated with a university. Highly cited papers address online and digital environments, e-learning systems, mobile services, web 2.0 and citation analyses.
