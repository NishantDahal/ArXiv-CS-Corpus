On the Sum Capacity of Many-to-one and One-to-many Gaussian Interference Channels

We obtain new sum capacity results for the Gaussian many-to-one and one-to-many interference channels in channel parameter regimes where the sum capacity was known only up to a constant gap. Simple Han-Kobayashi (HK) schemes, i.e., HK schemes with Gaussian signaling, no time-sharing, and no common-private power splitting, achieve sum capacity under the channel conditions for which the new results are obtained. To obtain sum capacity results, we show that genie-aided upper bounds match the achievable sum rate of simple HK schemes under certain channel conditions.
