Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Normalized SNR-Based Scheduling in Downlink Cellular Networks

The coverage probability and average data rate of normalized SNR-based scheduling in a downlink cellular network are derived by modeling the locations of the base stations and users as two independent Poison point processes. The scheduler selects the user with the largest instantaneous SNR normalized by the short-term average SNR. In normalized SNR scheduling, the coverage probability when the desired signal experiences Rayleigh fading is shown to be given by a series of Laplace transforms of the probability density function of interference. Also, a closed-form expression for the coverage probability is approximately achieved. The results confirm that normalized SNR scheduling increases the coverage probability due to the multi-user diversity gain.
