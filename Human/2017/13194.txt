Subcarrier-Chunk Assignment With Power Allocation and Multiple-Rate Constraints for Downlink OFDMA

We consider downlink OFDMA in which users are imposed with different proportional-rate constraints, and a base station would like to maximise user rate over subcarrier assignment (SA) and power allocation (PA). To attain the objective, we propose a chunk-based SA and low-complexity PA algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed SA and PA can provide higher average minimum achievable rate than the existing schemes while keeping the deviation from the rate constraint small for both single-cell and multi-cell systems with fractional frequency reuse.
