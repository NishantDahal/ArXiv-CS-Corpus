A Distance Between Populations for n-Points Crossover in Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms (GAs) are an optimization technique that has been successfully used on many real-world problems. There exist different approaches to their theoretical study. In this paper we complete a recently presented approach to model one-point crossover using pretopologies (or Cech topologies) in two ways. First, we extend it to the case of n-points crossover. Then, we experimentally study how the distance distribution changes when the number of crossover points increases.
