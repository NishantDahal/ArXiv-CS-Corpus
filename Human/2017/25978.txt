A global feature extraction model for the effective computer aided diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment using structural MRI images

Multiple modalities of biomarkers have been proved to be very sensitive in assessing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and using these modalities and machine learning algorithms, several approaches have been proposed to assist in the early diagnosis of AD. Among the recent investigated state-of-the-art approaches, Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA)-based approaches have been demonstrated to be more effective and accurate in the classification of AD, especially for delineating its prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, among those binary classification investigations, the local feature extraction methods were mostly used, which made them hardly be applied to a practical computer aided diagnosis system. Therefore, this study presents a novel global feature extraction model taking advantage of the recent proposed GDA-based dual high-dimensional decision spaces, which can significantly improve the early diagnosis performance comparing to those local feature extraction methods. In the true test using 20% held-out data, for discriminating the most challenging MCI group from the cognitively normal control (CN) group, an F1 score of 91.06%, an accuracy of 88.78%, a sensitivity of 91.80%, and a specificity of 83.78% were achieved that can be considered as the best performance obtained so far.
