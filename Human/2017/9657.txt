Recovery of structure of looped jointed objects from multiframes

A method to recover structural parameters of looped jointed objects from multiframes is being developed. Each rigid part of the jointed body needs only to be traced at two (that is at junction) points.
  This method has been linearized for 4-part loops, with recovery from at least 19 frames.
