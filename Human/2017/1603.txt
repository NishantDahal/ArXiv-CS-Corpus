A bi-criteria path planning algorithm for robotics applications

Realistic path planning applications often require optimizing with respect to several criteria simultaneously. Here we introduce an efficient algorithm for bi-criteria path planning on graphs. Our approach is based on augmenting the state space to keep track of the "budget" remaining to satisfy the constraints on secondary cost. The resulting augmented graph is acyclic and the primary cost can be then minimized by a simple upward sweep through budget levels. The efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm is tested on Probabilistic Roadmap graphs to minimize the distance of travel subject to a constraint on the overall threat exposure of the robot. We also present the results from field experiments illustrating the use of this approach on realistic robotic systems.
