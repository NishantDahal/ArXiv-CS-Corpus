Understanding the visual speech signal

For machines to lipread, or understand speech from lip movement, they decode lip-motions (known as visemes) into the spoken sounds. We investigate the visual speech channel to further our understanding of visemes. This has applications beyond machine lipreading; speech therapists, animators, and psychologists can benefit from this work. We explain the influence of speaker individuality, and demonstrate how one can use visemes to boost lipreading.
