Polar Coding for Parallel Gaussian Channel

In this paper, we propose a Polar coding scheme for parallel Gaussian channels. The encoder knows the sum rate of the parallel channels but does not know the rate of any channel. By using the nesting property of Polar code, we design a coding/decoding scheme to achieve the sum rates.
