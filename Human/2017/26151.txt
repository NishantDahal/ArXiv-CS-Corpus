Semi-Robust Communications over a Broadcast Channel

We establish the deterministic-code capacity region of a network with one transmitter and two receivers: an "ordinary receiver" and a "robust receiver." The channel to the ordinary receiver is a given (known) discrete memoryless channel (DMC), whereas the channel to the robust receiver is an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC). Both receivers are required to decode the "common message," whereas only the ordinary receiver is required to decode the "private message."
