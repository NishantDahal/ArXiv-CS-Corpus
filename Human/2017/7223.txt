Design and Analysis of a Task-based Parallelization over a Runtime System of an Explicit Finite-Volume CFD Code with Adaptive Time Stepping

FLUSEPA (Registered trademark in France No. 134009261) is an advanced simulation tool which performs a large panel of aerodynamic studies. It is the unstructured finite-volume solver developed by Airbus Safran Launchers company to calculate compressible, multidimensional, unsteady, viscous and reactive flows around bodies in relative motion. The time integration in FLUSEPA is done using an explicit temporal adaptive method. The current production version of the code is based on MPI and OpenMP. This implementation leads to important synchronizations that must be reduced. To tackle this problem, we present the study of a task-based parallelization of the aerodynamic solver of FLUSEPA using the runtime system StarPU and combining up to three levels of parallelism. We validate our solution by the simulation (using a finite-volume mesh with 80 million cells) of a take-off blast wave propagation for Ariane 5 launcher.
