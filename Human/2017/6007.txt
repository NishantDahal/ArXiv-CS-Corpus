Genealogical Distance as a Diversity Estimate in Evolutionary Algorithms

The evolutionary edit distance between two individuals in a population, i.e., the amount of applications of any genetic operator it would take the evolutionary process to generate one individual starting from the other, seems like a promising estimate for the diversity between said individuals. We introduce genealogical diversity, i.e., estimating two individuals' degree of relatedness by analyzing large, unused parts of their genome, as a computationally efficient method to approximate that measure for diversity.
