End-to-end semantic face segmentation with conditional random fields as convolutional, recurrent and adversarial networks

Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the number of related yet distinct advances in semantic segmentation. Here, we tackle this problem by leveraging the respective strengths of these advances. That is, we formulate a conditional random field over a four-connected graph as end-to-end trainable convolutional and recurrent networks, and estimate them via an adversarial process. Importantly, our model learns not only unary potentials but also pairwise potentials, while aggregating multi-scale contexts and controlling higher-order inconsistencies. We evaluate our model on two standard benchmark datasets for semantic face segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on both of them.
