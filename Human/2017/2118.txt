Mimicking Ensemble Learning with Deep Branched Networks

This paper proposes a branched residual network for image classification. It is known that high-level features of deep neural network are more representative than lower-level features. By sharing the low-level features, the network can allocate more memory to high-level features. The upper layers of our proposed network are branched, so that it mimics the ensemble learning. By mimicking ensemble learning with single network, we have achieved better performance on ImageNet classification task.
