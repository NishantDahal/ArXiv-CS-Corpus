Profinite Techniques for Probabilistic Automata and the Markov Monoid Algorithm

We consider the value 1 problem for probabilistic automata over finite words: it asks whether a given probabilistic automaton accepts words with probability arbitrarily close to 1. This problem is known to be undecidable. However, different algorithms have been proposed to partially solve it; it has been recently shown that the Markov Monoid algorithm, based on algebra, is the most correct algorithm so far. The first contribution of this paper is to give a characterisation of the Markov Monoid algorithm. The second contribution is to develop a profinite theory for probabilistic automata, called the prostochastic theory. This new framework gives a topological account of the value 1 problem, which in this context is cast as an emptiness problem. The above characterisation is reformulated using the prostochastic theory, allowing us to give a simple and modular proof.
