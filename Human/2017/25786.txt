Use Cases, Requirements, and Design Considerations for 5G V2X

Ultimate goal of next generation Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems is enabling accident-free cooperative automated driving that uses the available roadway efficiently. To achieve this goal, the communication system will need to enable a diverse set of use cases, each with a specific set of requirements. We discuss the main use case categories, analyze their requirements, and compare them against the capabilities of currently available communication technologies. Based on the analysis, we identify a gap and point out towards possible system design for 5G V2X that could close the gap. Furthermore, we discuss an architecture of the 5G V2X radio access network that incorporates diverse communication technologies, including current and cellular systems in centimeter wave and millimeter wave, IEEE 802.11p and vehicular visible light communications. Finally, we discuss the role of future 5G V2X systems in enabling more efficient vehicular transportation: from improved traffic flow through reduced inter-vehicle spacing on highways and coordinated intersections in cities (the cheapest way to increasing the road capacity), to automated smart parking (no more visits to the parking!), ultimately enabling seamless end-to-end personal mobility.
