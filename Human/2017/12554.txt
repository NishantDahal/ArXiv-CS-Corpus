Petri Nets and its Polynomials

For every finite Petri net, we construct a commutative polynomial in two variables and with coefficients from the semiring of natural numbers. We also present an inverse construction and show that multiplication of polynomials correspondence to the product of the corresponding Petri nets in the category of Petri nets with Winskel's morphisms. We endow the set of all Petri nets with Zariski topology.
