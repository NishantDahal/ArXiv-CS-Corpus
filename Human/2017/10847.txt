A $(2 + ε)$-approximation for precedence constrained single machine scheduling with release dates and total weighted completion time objective

We give a $(2 + ε)$-approximation algorithm for minimizing total weighted completion time on a single machine under release time and precedence constraints. This settles a recent conjecture made in [18]
