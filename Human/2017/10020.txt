Finite-Length Bounds for Joint Source-Channel Coding with Markovian Source and Additive Channel Noise to Achieve Large and Moderate Deviation Bounds

We derive novel upper and lower finite-length bounds of the error probability in joint source-channel coding when the source obeys an ergodic Markov process and the channel is a Markovian additive channel or a Markovian conditional additive channel. These bounds are tight in the large and moderate deviation regimes.
