Pattern Division Multiple Access with Large-scale Antenna Array

In this paper, pattern division multiple access with large-scale antenna array (LSA-PDMA) is proposed as a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. In the proposed scheme, pattern is designed in both beam domain and power domain in a joint manner. At the transmitter, pattern mapping utilizes power allocation to improve the system sum rate and beam allocation to enhance the access connectivity and realize the integration of LSA into multiple access spontaneously. At the receiver, hybrid detection of spatial filter (SF) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed to separate the superposed multiple-domain signals. Furthermore, we formulate the sum rate maximization problem to obtain the optimal pattern mapping policy, and the optimization problem is proved to be convex through proper mathematical manipulations. Simulation results show that the proposed LSA-PDMA scheme achieves significant performance gain on system sum rate compared to both the orthogonal multiple access scheme and the power-domain NOMA scheme.
