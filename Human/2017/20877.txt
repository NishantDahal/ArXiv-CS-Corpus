On the Foundation of NOMA and its Application to 5G Cellular Networks

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is recognized today as a most promising technology for future 5G cellular networks and a large number of papers have been published on the subject over the past few years. Interestingly, none of these authors seems to be aware that the foundation of NOMA actually dates back to the year 2000, when a series of papers introduced and investigated multiple access schemes using two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms and iterative interference cancellation at the receiver. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on that early literature and to describe a practical scheme based on that concept, which is particularly attractive for Machine-Type Communications (MTC) in future 5G cellular networks. Using this approach, NOMA appears as a convenient extension of orthogonal multiple access rather than a strictly competing technology, and most important of all, the power imbalance between the transmitted user signals that is required to make the receiver work in other NOMA schemes is not required here.
