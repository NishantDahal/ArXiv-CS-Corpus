Detecting the Moment of Completion: Temporal Models for Localising Action Completion

Action completion detection is the problem of modelling the action's progression towards localising the moment of completion - when the action's goal is confidently considered achieved. In this work, we assess the ability of two temporal models, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to localise completion for six object interactions: switch, plug, open, pull, pick and drink. We use a supervised approach, where annotations of pre-completion and post-completion frames are available per action, and fine-tuned CNN features are used to train temporal models. Tested on the Action-Completion-2016 dataset, we detect completion within 10 frames of annotations for ~75% of completed action sequences using both temporal models. Results show that fine-tuned CNN features outperform hand-crafted features for localisation, and that observing incomplete instances is necessary when incomplete sequences are also present in the test set.
