Secure Private Information Retrieval from Colluding Databases with Eavesdroppers

The problem of private information retrieval (PIR) is to retrieve one message out of $K$ messages replicated at $N$ databases, without revealing the identity of the desired message to the databases. We consider the problem of PIR with colluding servers and eavesdroppers, named T-EPIR. Specifically, any $T$ out of $N$ databases may collude, i.e. they may communicate their interactions with the user to guess the identity of the requested message. An eavesdropper is curious to know the database and can tap in on the incoming and outgoing transmissions of any $E$ databases. The databases share some common randomness unknown to the eavesdropper and the user, and use the common randomness to generate the answers, such that the eavesdropper can learn no information about the $K$ messages. Define $R^*$ as the optimal ratio of the number of the desired message information bits to the number of total downloaded bits, and $ρ^*$ to be the optimal ratio of the information bits of the shared common randomness to the information bits of the desired file. In our previous work, we found that when $E \geq T$, the optimal ratio that can be achieved equals $1-\frac{E}{N}$. In this work, we focus on the case when $E \leq T$. We derive an outer bound $R^* \leq (1-\frac{T}{N}) \frac{1-\frac{E}{N} \cdot (\frac{T}{N})^{K-1}}{1-(\frac{T}{N})^K}$. We also obtain a lower bound of $ρ^* \geq \frac{\frac{E}{N}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}{(1-\frac{T}{N})(1-\frac{E}{N} \cdot (\frac{T}{N})^{K-1})}$. For the achievability, we propose a scheme which achieves the rate (inner bound) $R=\frac{1-\frac{T}{N}}{1-(\frac{T}{N})^K}-\frac{E}{KN}$. The amount of shared common randomness used in the achievable scheme is $\frac{\frac{E}{N}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}{1-\frac{T}{N}-\frac{E}{KN}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}$ times the file size. The gap between the derived inner and outer bounds vanishes as the number of messages $K$ tends to infinity.
