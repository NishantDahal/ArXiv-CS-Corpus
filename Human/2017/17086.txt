A revised completeness result for the simply typed $λμ$-calculus using realizability semantics

In this paper, we define a new realizability semantics for the simply typed lambda-mu-calculus. We show that if a term is typable, then it inhabits the interpretation of its type. We also prove a completeness result of our realizability semantics using a particular term model. This paper corrects some errors in [21] by the first author and Saber.
