Development of a Swarm UAV Simulator Integrating Realistic Motion Control Models For Disaster Operations

Simulation environments for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be very useful for prototyping user interfaces and training personnel that will operate UAVs in the real world. The realistic operation of such simulations will only enhance the value of such training. In this paper, we present the integration of a model-based waypoint navigation controller into the Reno Rescue Simulator for the purposes of providing a more realistic user interface in simulated environments. We also present potential uses for such simulations, even for real-world operation of UAVs.
