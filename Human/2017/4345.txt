A modification to Hirsch index allowing comparisons across different scientific fields

The aim of this paper is to propose a simple modification to the original measure, the relative Hirsch index, which assigns each researcher a value between 0 (the bottom) and 1 (the top), expressing his/her distance to the top in a given field. By this normalization scholars from different scientific disciplines can be compared.
