Strong Completeness and the Finite Model Property for Bi-Intuitionistic Stable Tense Logics

Bi-Intuitionistic Stable Tense Logics (BIST Logics) are tense logics with a Kripke semantics where worlds in a frame are equipped with a pre-order as well as with an accessibility relation which is 'stable' with respect  to this pre-order. BIST logics are extensions of a logic, BiSKt, which  arose in the semantic context of hypergraphs, since a special case of the  pre-order can represent the incidence structure of a hypergraph. In this  paper we provide, for the first time, a Hilbert-style axiomatisation of  BISKt and prove the strong completeness of BiSKt. We go on to prove strong  completeness of a class of BIST logics obtained by extending BiSKt by  formulas of a certain form. Moreover we show that the finite model property and the decidability hold for a class of BIST logics.
