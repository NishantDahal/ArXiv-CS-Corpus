Benchmarking the computing resources at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias

The aim of this study is the characterization of the computing resources used by researchers at the "Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias" (IAC). Since there is a huge demand of computing time and we use tools such as HTCondor to implement High Throughput Computing (HTC) across all available PCs, it is essential for us to assess in a quantitative way, using objective parameters, the performances of our computing nodes. In order to achieve that, we have run a set of benchmark tests on a number of different desktop and laptop PC models among those used in our institution. In particular, we run the "Polyhedron Fortran Benchmarks" suite, using three different compilers: GNU Fortran Compiler, Intel Fortran Compiler and the PGI Fortran Compiler; execution times are then normalized to the reference values published by Polyhedron. The same tests were run multiple times on a same PCs, and on 3 to 5 PCs of the same model (whenever possible) to check for repeatability and consistency of the results. We found that in general execution times, for a given PC model, are consistent within an uncertainty of about 10%, and show a gain in CPU speed of a factor of about 3 between the oldest PCs used at the IAC (7-8 years old) and the newest ones.
