Barrier Coverage with Non-uniform Lengths to Minimize Aggregate Movements

Given a line segment $I=[0,L]$, the so-called barrier, and a set of $n$ sensors with varying ranges positioned on the line containing $I$, the barrier coverage problem is to move the sensors so that they cover $I$, while minimising the total movement. In the case when all the sensors have the same radius the problem can be solved in $O(n \log n)$ time (Andrews and Wang, Algorithmica 2017). If the sensors have different radii the problem is known to be NP-hard to approximate within a constant factor (Czyzowicz et al., ADHOC-NOW 2009). We strengthen this result and prove that no polynomial time $ρ^{1-\varepsilon}$-approximation algorithm exists unless $P=NP$, where $ρ$ is the ratio between the largest radius and the smallest radius. Even when we restrict the number of sensors that are allowed to move by a parameter $k$, the problem turns out to be W[1]-hard. On the positive side we show that a $((2+\varepsilon)ρ+2/\varepsilon)$-approximation can be computed in $O(n^3/\varepsilon^2)$ time and we prove fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the total movement assuming all numbers in the input are integers.
