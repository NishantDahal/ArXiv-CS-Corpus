How can one sample images with sampling rates close to the theoretical minimum?

A problem is addressed of minimization of the number of measurements needed for digital image acquisition and reconstruction with a given accuracy. A sampling theory based method of image sampling and reconstruction is suggested that allows to draw near the minimal rate of image sampling defined by the sampling theory. Presented and discussed are also results of experimental verification of the method and its possible applicability extensions.
