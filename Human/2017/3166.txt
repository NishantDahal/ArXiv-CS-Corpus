Epistemic extensions of combined classical and intuitionistic propositional logic

Logic $L$ was introduced by Lewitzka [7] as a modal system that combines intuitionistic and classical logic: $L$ is a conservative extension of CPC and it contains a copy of IPC via the embedding $\varphi\mapsto\square\varphi$. In this article, we consider $L3$, i.e. $L$ augmented with S3 modal axioms, define basic epistemic extensions and prove completeness w.r.t. algebraic semantics. The resulting logics combine classical knowledge and belief with intuitionistic truth. Some epistemic laws of Intuitionistic Epistemic Logic studied by Artemov and Protopopescu [1] are reflected by classical modal principles. In particular, the implications "intuitionistic truth $\Rightarrow$ knowledge $\Rightarrow$ classical truth" are represented by the theorems $\square\varphi\rightarrow K\varphi$ and $K\varphi\rightarrow\varphi$ of our logic $EL3$, where we are dealing with classical instead of intuitionistic knowledge. Finally, we show that a modification of our semantics yields algebraic models for the systems of Intuitionistic Epistemic Logic introduced in [1].
