Enhancing speaker identification performance under the shouted talking condition using second-order circular hidden Markov models

It is known that the performance of speaker identification systems is high under the neutral talking condition; however, the performance deteriorates under the shouted talking condition. In this paper, second-order circular hidden Markov models (CHMM2s) have been proposed and implemented to enhance the performance of isolated-word text-dependent speaker identification systems under the shouted talking condition. Our results show that CHMM2s significantly improve speaker identification performance under such a condition compared to the first-order left-to-right hidden Markov models (LTRHMM1s), second-order left-to-right hidden Markov models (LTRHMM2s), and the first-order circular hidden Markov models (CHMM1s). Under the shouted talking condition, our results show that the average speaker identification performance is 23% based on LTRHMM1s, 59% based on LTRHMM2s, and 60% based on CHMM1s. On the other hand, the average speaker identification performance under the same talking condition based on CHMM2s is 72%.
