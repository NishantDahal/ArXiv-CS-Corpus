Computing representation matrices for the action of Frobenius to cohomology groups

This paper is concerned with the computation of representation matrices for the action of Frobenius to the cohomology groups of algebraic varieties. Specifically we shall give an algorithm to compute the matrices for arbitrary algebraic varieties with defining equations over perfect fields of positive characteristic, and estimate its complexity. Moreover, we propose a specific efficient method, which works for complete intersections.
