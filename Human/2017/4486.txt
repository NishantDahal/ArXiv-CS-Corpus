Verification in Staged Tile Self-Assembly

We prove the unique assembly and unique shape verification problems, benchmark measures of self-assembly model power, are $\mathrm{coNP}^{\mathrm{NP}}$-hard and contained in $\mathrm{PSPACE}$ (and in $\mathrmÎ ^\mathrm{P}_{2s}$ for staged systems with $s$ stages). En route, we prove that unique shape verification problem in the 2HAM is $\mathrm{coNP}^{\mathrm{NP}}$-complete.
