Repair Duality with Locally Repairable and Locally Regenerating Codes

We construct an explicit family of locally repairable and locally regenerating codes whose existence was proven in a recent work by Kamath et al. about codes with local regeneration but no explicit construction was given. This explicit family of codes is based on HashTag codes. HashTag codes are recently defined vector codes with different vector length $Î±$ (also called a sub-packetization level) that achieve the optimal repair bandwidth of MSR codes or near-optimal repair bandwidth depending on the sub-packetization level. We applied the technique of parity-splitting code construction. We show that the lower bound on the size of the finite field for the presented explicit code constructions can be lower than the one given in the work of Kamath et al. Finally, we discuss the importance of having two ways for node repair with locally regenerating HashTag codes: repair only with local parity nodes or repair with both local and global parity nodes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work where this duality in repair process is discussed. We give a practical example and experimental results in Hadoop where we show the benefits of having this repair duality.
