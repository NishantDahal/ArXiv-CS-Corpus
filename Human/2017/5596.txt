Evaluating Spintronic Devices Using The Modular Approach

Over the past decade a large family of spintronic devices have been proposed as candidates for replacing CMOS for future digital logic circuits. Using the recently developed Modular Approach framework, we investigate and identify the physical bottlenecks and engineering challenges facing current spintronic devices. We then evaluate how systematic advancements in material properties and device design innovations impact the performance of spintronic devices, as a possible continuation of Moore's Law, even though some of these projections are speculative and may require technological breakthroughs. Lastly, we illustrate the use of the Modular Approach as an exploratory tool for probabilistic networks, using superparamagnetic magnets as building blocks for such networks. These building blocks leverage the inherent physics of stochastic spin-torque switching and could provide ultra-compact and efficient hardware for beyond-Boolean computational paradigms.
