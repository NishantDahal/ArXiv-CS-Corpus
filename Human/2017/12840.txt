Algebraic Relations and Triangulation of Unlabeled Image Points

In multiview geometry when correspondences among multiple views are unknown the image points can be understood as being unlabeled. This is a common problem in computer vision. We give a novel approach to handle such a situation by regarding unlabeled point configurations as points on the Chow variety $\text{Sym}_m(\mathbb{P}^2)$. For two unlabeled points we design an algorithm that solves the triangulation problem with unknown correspondences. Further the unlabeled multiview variety $\text{Sym}_m(V_A)$ is studied.
