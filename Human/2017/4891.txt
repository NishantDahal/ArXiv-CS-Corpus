Leveling the playing field for Visually Impaired using Transport Assistant

Visually impaired people face numerous challenges when it comes to transportation. Not only must they circumvent obstacles while navigating, but they also need access to essential information related to available public transport, up-to-date weather forecast, and convenient method for booking private taxis. In this paper we introduce Transport Assistant - a voice based assistive technology prototype, built with a goal of leveling the playing field for the visually impaired to solve these problems that they face in their day to day life. Being voice enabled makes it seamlessly integrate into the environment, and can be invoked by saying a hotword - hello assistant. The paper explores this research question, followed by investigating existing technologies, explains the methodology and design, then concludes by presenting the prototype and results.
