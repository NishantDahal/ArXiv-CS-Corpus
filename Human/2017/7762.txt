Direct-dynamical entanglement-discord relations

In this article, by considering Bell-diagonal two-qubit initial states submitted to local dynamics generated by the phase damping, bit flip, phase flip, bit-phase flip, and depolarizing channels, we report some elegant direct-dynamical relations between geometric measures of entanglement and discord. The complex scenario appearing already in this simplified case study indicates that similarly simple relation shall hardly be found in more general situations.
