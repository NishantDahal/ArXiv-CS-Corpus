A Complete Classification of Partial-MDS (Maximally Recoverable) Codes with One Global Parity

Partial-MDS (PMDS) codes are a family of locally repairable codes, mainly used for distributed storage. They are defined to be able to correct any pattern of $s$ additional erasures, after a given number of erasures per locality group have occurred. This makes them also maximally recoverable (MR) codes, another class of locally repairable codes. It is known that MR codes in general, and PMDS codes in particular, exist for any set of parameters, if the field size is large enough. Moreover, some explicit constructions of PMDS codes are known, mostly (but not always) with a strong restriction on the number of erasures that can be corrected per locality group. In this paper we generalize the notion of PMDS codes to allow locality groups of different sizes. We give a general construction of such PMDS codes with $s=1$ global parity, i.e., one additional erasure can be corrected. Furthermore, we show that all PMDS codes for the given parameters are of this form, i.e., we give a classification of these codes. This implies a necessary and sufficient condition on the underlying field size for the existence of these codes (assuming that the MDS conjecture is true). For some parameter sets our generalized construction gives rise to PMDS codes with a smaller field size than any other known construction.
