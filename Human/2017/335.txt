Algorithmic complexity of proper labeling problems

A proper labeling of a graph is an assignment of integers to some elements of a graph, which may be the vertices, the edges, or both of them, such that we obtain a proper vertex coloring via the labeling subject to some conditions. The problem of proper labeling offers many variants and received a great interest during recent years. We consider the algorithmic complexity of some variants of the proper labeling problems, we present some polynomial time algorithms and $ \mathbf{NP} $-completeness results for them.
