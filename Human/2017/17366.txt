Graham's Tree Reconstruction Conjecture and a Waring-Type Problem on Partitions

Suppose $G$ is a tree. Graham's "Tree Reconstruction Conjecture" states that $G$ is uniquely determined by the integer sequence $|G|$, $|L(G)|$, $|L(L(G))|$, $|L(L(L(G)))|$, $\ldots$, where $L(H)$ denotes the line graph of the graph $H$. Little is known about this question apart from a few simple observations. We show that the number of trees on $n$ vertices which can be distinguished by their associated integer sequences is $e^{Ω((\log n)^{3/2})}$. The proof strategy involves constructing a large collection of caterpillar graphs using partitions arising from the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem.
