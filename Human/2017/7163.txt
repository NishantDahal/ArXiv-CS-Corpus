The UMCD Dataset

In recent years, the technological improvements of low-cost small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are promoting an ever-increasing use of them in different tasks. In particular, the use of small-scale UAVs is useful in all these low-altitude tasks in which common UAVs cannot be adopted, such as recurrent comprehensive view of wide environments, frequent monitoring of military areas, real-time classification of static and moving entities (e.g., people, cars, etc.). These tasks can be supported by mosaicking and change detection algorithms achieved at low-altitude. Currently, public datasets for testing these algorithms are not available. This paper presents the UMCD dataset, the first collection of geo-referenced video sequences acquired at low-altitude for mosaicking and change detection purposes. Five reference scenarios are also reported.
