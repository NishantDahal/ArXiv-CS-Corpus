Building Interoperable and Cross-Domain Semantic Web of Things Applications

The Web of Things (WoT) is rapidly growing in popularity getting the interest of not only technologist and scientific communities but industrial, system integrators and solution providers. The key aspect of the WoT to succeed is the relatively, easy-to-build ecosystems nature inherited from the web and the capacity for building end-to-end solutions. At the WoT connecting physical devices such as sensors, RFID tags or any devices that can send data through the Internet using the Web is almost automatic. The WoT shared data can be used to build smarter solutions that offer business services in the form of IoT applications. In this chapter, we review the main WoT challenges, with particular interest on highlighting those that rely on combining heterogeneous IoT data for the design of smarter services and applications and that benefit from data interoperability. Semantic web technologies help for overcoming with such challenges by addressing, among other ones the following objectives: 1) semantically annotating and unifying heterogeneous data, 2) enriching semantic WoT datasets with external knowledge graphs, and 3) providing an analysis of data by means of reasoning mechanisms to infer meaningful information. To overcome the challenge of building interoperable semantics-based IoT applications, the Machine-to-Machine Measurement (M3) semantic engine has been designed to semantically annotate WoT data, build the logic of smarter services and deduce meaningful knowledge by linking it to the external knowledge graphs available on the web. M3 assists application and business developers in designing interoperable Semantic Web of Things applications. Contributions in the context of European semantic-based WoT projects are discussed and a particular use case within FIESTA-IoT project is presented.
