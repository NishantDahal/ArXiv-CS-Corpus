Tensor network language model

We propose a new statistical model suitable for machine learning of systems with long distance correlations such as natural languages. The model is based on directed acyclic graph decorated by multi-linear tensor maps in the vertices and vector spaces in the edges, called tensor network. Such tensor networks have been previously employed for effective numerical computation of the renormalization group flow on the space of effective quantum field theories and lattice models of statistical mechanics. We provide explicit algebro-geometric analysis of the parameter moduli space for tree graphs, discuss model properties and applications such as statistical translation.
