A mathematical bridge between discretized gauge theories in quantum physics and approximate reasoning in pairwise comparisons

We describe a mathematical link between aspects of information theory, called pairwise comparisons, and discretized gauge theories. The link is made by the notion of holonomy along the edges of a simplex. This correspondance leads to open questions in both field.
