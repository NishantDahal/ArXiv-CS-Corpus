On the Asymptotic Behavior of Ultra-Densification under a Bounded Dual-Slope Path Loss Model

In this paper, we investigate the impact of network densification on the performance in terms of downlink signal-to-interference (SIR) coverage probability and network area spectral efficiency (ASE). A sophisticated bounded dual-slope path loss model and practical user equipment (UE) densities are incorporated in the analysis, which have never been jointly considered before. By using stochastic geometry, we derive an integral expression along with closed-form bounds of the coverage probability and ASE, validated by simulation results. Through these, we provide the asymptotic behavior of ultra-densification. The coverage probability and ASE have non-zero convergence in asymptotic regions unless UE density goes to infinity (full load). Meanwhile, the effect of UE density on the coverage probability is analyzed. The coverage probability will reveal an U-shape for large UE densities due to interference fall into the near-field, but it will keep increasing for low UE densites. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance is overestimated without applying the bounded dual-slope path loss model. The derived expressions and results in this work pave the way for future network provisioning.
