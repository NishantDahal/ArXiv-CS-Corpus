Cache-Enabled Physical Layer Security for Video Streaming in Backhaul-Limited Cellular Networks

In this paper, we propose a novel wireless caching scheme to enhance the physical layer security of video streaming in cellular networks with limited backhaul capacity. By proactively sharing video data across a subset of base stations (BSs) through both caching and backhaul loading, secure cooperative joint transmission of several BSs can be dynamically enabled in accordance with the cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul capacity. Assuming imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, we formulate a two-stage non-convex mixed-integer robust optimization problem for minimizing the total transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) and guaranteeing communication secrecy during video delivery, where the caching and the cooperative transmission policy are optimized in an offline video caching stage and an online video delivery stage, respectively. Although the formulated optimization problem turns out to be NP-hard, low-complexity polynomial-time algorithms, whose solutions are globally optimal under certain conditions, are proposed for cache training and video delivery control. Caching is shown to be beneficial as it reduces the data sharing overhead imposed on the capacity-constrained backhaul links, introduces additional secure degrees of freedom, and enables a power-efficient communication system design. Simulation results confirm that the proposed caching scheme achieves simultaneously a low secrecy outage probability and a high power efficiency. Furthermore, due to the proposed robust optimization, the performance loss caused by imperfect CSI knowledge can be significantly reduced when the cache capacity becomes large.
