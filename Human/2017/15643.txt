A novel agent-based simulation framework for sensing in complex adaptive environments

In this paper we present a novel Formal Agent-Based Simulation framework (FABS). FABS uses formal specification as a means of clear description of wireless sensor networks (WSN) sensing a Complex Adaptive Environment. This specification model is then used to develop an agent-based model of both the wireless sensor network as well as the environment. As proof of concept, we demonstrate the application of FABS to a boids model of self-organized flocking of animals monitored by a random deployment of proximity sensors.
