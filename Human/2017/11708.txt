Understanding Cognitive Depletion in Novice NMR Analysts

We present the results of a user study with novice NMR analysts (N=19) involving a gamified simulation of the NMR analysis process. Participants solved randomly generated spectrum puzzles for up to three hours. We used eye tracking, event logging, and observations to record symptoms of cognitive depletion while participants worked. Analysis of results indicate that we can detect both signs of learning and signs of cognitive depletion in participants over the course of the three hours. Participants' break strategies did not predict or reflect game scores, but certain symptoms appear predictive of breaks.
