From Type Spaces to Probability Frames and Back, via Language

We investigate the connection between the two major mathematical frameworks for modeling interactive beliefs: Harsanyi type spaces and possible-worlds style probability frames. While translating the former into the latter is straightforward, we demonstrate that the reverse translation relies implicitly on a background logical language. Once this "language parameter" is made explicit, it reveals a close relationship between universal type spaces and canonical models: namely, that they are essentially the same construct. As the nature of a canonical model depends heavily on the background logic used to generate it, this work suggests a new view into a corresponding landscape of universal type spaces.
