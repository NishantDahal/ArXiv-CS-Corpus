Optimal Design of Energy-Efficient Millimeter Wave Hybrid Transceivers for Wireless Backhaul

This work analyzes a mmWave single-cell network, which comprises a macro base station (BS) and an overlaid tier of small-cell BSs using a wireless backhaul for data traffic. We look for the optimal number of antennas at both BS and small-cell BSs that maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system when a hybrid transceiver architecture is employed. Closed-form expressions for the EE-optimal values of the number of antennas are derived that provide valuable insights into the interplay between the optimization variables and hardware characteristics. Numerical and analytical results show that the maximal EE is achieved by a 'close-to' fully-digital system wherein the number of BS antennas is approximately equal to the number of served small cells.
