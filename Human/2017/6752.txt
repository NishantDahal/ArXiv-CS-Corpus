Dempster-Shafer Belief Function - A New Interpretation

We develop our interpretation of the joint belief distribution and of evidential updating that matches the following basic requirements:
  * there must exist an efficient method for reasoning within this framework
  * there must exist a clear correspondence between the contents of the knowledge base and the real world
  * there must be a clear correspondence between the reasoning method and some real world process
  * there must exist a clear correspondence between the results of the reasoning process and the results of the real world process corresponding to the reasoning process.
