Reduced Order Modelling for the Simulation of Quenches in Superconducting Magnets

This contributions discusses the simulation of magnetothermal effects in superconducting magnets as used in particle accelerators. An iterative coupling scheme using reduced order models between a magnetothermal partial differential model and an electrical lumped-element circuit is demonstrated. The multiphysics, multirate and multiscale problem requires a consistent formulation and framework to tackle the challenging transient effects occurring at both system and device level.
