Multi-Erasure Locally Recoverable Codes Over Small Fields

Erasure codes play an important role in storage systems to prevent data loss. In this work, we study a class of erasure codes called Multi-Erasure Locally Recoverable Codes (ME-LRCs) for storage arrays. Compared to previous related works, we focus on the construction of ME-LRCs over small fields. We first develop upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of ME-LRCs. Our main contribution is to propose a general construction of ME-LRCs based on generalized tensor product codes, and study their erasure-correcting properties. A decoding algorithm tailored for erasure recovery is given, and correctable erasure patterns are identified. We then prove that our construction yields optimal ME-LRCs with a wide range of code parameters, and present some explicit ME-LRCs over small fields. Finally, we show that generalized integrated interleaving (GII) codes can be treated as a subclass of generalized tensor product codes, thus defining the exact relation between these codes.
