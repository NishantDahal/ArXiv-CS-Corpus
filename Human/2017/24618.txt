On Asymptotic Analysis of Zero-Delay Energy-Distortion Tradeoff Under Additive White Gaussian Noise

Asymptotic energy-distortion performance of zero-delay communication scenarios under additive white Gaussian noise is investigated. Using high-resolution analysis for quantizer design, the higher-order term in the logarithm of the distortion (termed the {\em energy-distortion dispersion}) is optimized while keeping the leading term (i.e., {\em energy-distortion exponent}) at its optimal value. For uniform and Gaussian sources, significant gains are observed compared to na√Øvely performed quantization, i.e., aimed at optimizing the source coding performance instead of the end-to-end distortion in joint source-channel coding.
