Inferring hierarchical structure of spatial and generic complex networks through a modeling framework

Our recent paper [Grauwin et al. Sci. Rep. 7 (2017)] demonstrates that community and hierarchical structure of the networks of human interactions largely determines the least and should be taken into account while modeling them. In the present proof-of-concept pre-print the opposite question is considered: could the hierarchical structure itself be inferred to be best aligned with the network model? The inference mechanism is provided for both - spatial networks as well as complex networks in general - through a model based on hierarchical and (if defined) geographical distances. The mechanism allows to discover hierarchical and community structure at any desired resolution in complex networks and in particular - the space-independent structure of the spatial networks. The approach is illustrated on the example of the interstate people migration network in USA.
