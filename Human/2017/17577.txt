Human Detection for Night Surveillance using Adaptive Background Subtracted Image

Surveillance based on Computer Vision has become a major necessity in current era. Most of the surveillance systems operate on visible light imaging, but performance based on visible light imaging is limited due to some factors like variation in light intensity during the daytime. The matter of concern lies in the need for processing images in low light, such as in the need of nighttime surveillance. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for human detection using FLIR(Forward Looking Infrared) camera. As the principle involves sensing based on thermal radiation in the Near IR Region, it is possible to detect Humans from an image captured using a FLIR camera even in low light. The proposed method for human detection involves processing of Thermal images by using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature extraction technique along with some enhancements. The principle of the proposed technique lies in an adaptive background subtraction algorithm, which works in association with the HOG technique. By means of this method, we are able to reduce execution time, precision and some other parameters, which result in improvement of overall accuracy of the human detection system.
