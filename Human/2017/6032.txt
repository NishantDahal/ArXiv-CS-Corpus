Dissecting Robotics - historical overview and future perspectives

Robotics is called to be the next technological revolution and estimations indicate that it will trigger the fourth industrial revolution. This article presents a review of some of the most relevant milestones that occurred in robotics over the last few decades and future perspectives. Despite the fact that, nowadays, robotics is an emerging field, the challenges in many technological aspects and more importantly bringing innovative solutions to the market still remain open. The need of reducing the integration time, costs and a common hardware infrastructure are discussed and further analysed in this work. We conclude with a discussion of the future perspectives of robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.
