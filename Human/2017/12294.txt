Secure Polar Coding for the Two-Way Wiretap Channel

We consider the problem of polar coding for secure communications over the two-way wiretap channel, where two legitimate users communicate with each other simultaneously while a passive eavesdropper overhears a combination of their exchanged signals. The legitimate users wish to design a cooperative jamming code such that the interference between their codewords can jam the eavesdropper. In this paper, we design a polar coded cooperative jamming scheme that achieves the whole secrecy rate region of the general two-way wiretap channel under the strong secrecy criterion. The chaining method is used to make proper alignment of polar indices. The randomness required to be shared between two legitimate users is treated as a limited resource and we show that its rate can be made negligible by increasing the blocklength and the number of chained blocks. For the special case when the eavesdropper channel is degraded with respect to the legitimate ones, a simplified scheme is proposed which can simultaneously ensure reliability and weak secrecy within a single transmission block. An example of the binary erasure channel case is given to demonstrate the performance of our scheme.
