Resistive communications based on neuristors

Memristors are passive elements that allow us to store information using a single element per bit. However, this is not the only utility of the memristor. Considering the physical chemical structure of the element used, the memristor can function at the same time as memory and as a communication unit. This paper presents a new approach to the use of the memristor and develops the concept of resistive communication.
