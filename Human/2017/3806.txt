Index coding with erroneous side information

In this paper, new index coding problems are studied, where each receiver has erroneous side information. Although side information is a crucial part of index coding, the existence of erroneous side information has not yet been considered. We study an index code with receivers that have erroneous side information symbols in the error-free broadcast channel, which is called an index code with side information errors (ICSIE). The encoding and decoding procedures of the ICSIE are proposed, based on the syndrome decoding. Then, we derive the bounds on the optimal codelength of the proposed index code with erroneous side information. Furthermore, we introduce a special graph for the proposed index coding problem, called a $δ_s$-cycle whose properties are similar to those of the cycle in the conventional index coding problem. Properties of the ICSIE are also discussed in the $δ_s$-cycle and clique. Finally, the proposed ICSIE is generalized to an index code for the scenario having both additive channel errors and side information errors, called a generalized error correcting index code (GECIC).
