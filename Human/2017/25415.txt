Coordinator Location Effects in AODV Routing Protocol in ZigBee Mesh Network

ZigBee mesh network is very important research field in computer networks. However, the location of ZigBee coordinator plays a significant role in design and routing performance. In this paper, an extensive study on the factors that influence the performance of AODV routing protocol had been performed through the study of battery voltage decaying of nodes, neighboring tables, time delay and network topology structure. Simulation results reveal that the location of the coordinator within approximate equal distances to all nodes is more appropriate for lifelong batteries and AODV routing performance.
