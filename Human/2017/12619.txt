The PCI Ontology

In this paper, an ontology for the description and indexing of the contents of audiovisual resources will be presented. The concerned domain of reference (or: knowledge domain) is the cultural heritage of minorities and indigenous people, hence the name or title of this ontology, PCI ontology (standing for the French "Patrimoine Culturel de Minorités et Peuples Indigènes").
