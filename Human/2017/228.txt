On rescheduling due to machine disruption while to minimize the total weighted completion time

We investigate a single machine rescheduling problem that arises from an unexpected machine unavailability, after the given set of jobs has already been scheduled to minimize the total weighted completion time. Such a disruption is represented as an unavailable time interval and is revealed to the production planner before any job is processed; the production planner wishes to reschedule the jobs to minimize the alteration to the originally planned schedule, which is measured as the maximum time deviation between the original and the new schedules for all the jobs. The objective function in this rescheduling problem is to minimize the sum of the total weighted completion time and the weighted maximum time deviation, under the constraint that the maximum time deviation is bounded above by a given value. That is, the maximum time deviation is taken both as a constraint and as part of the objective function. We present a pseudo-polynomial time exact algorithm and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme, the latter of which is the best possible given that the general problem is NP-hard.
