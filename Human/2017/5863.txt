An Efficient Heuristic for Betweenness-Ordering

Centrality measures, erstwhile popular amongst the sociologists and psychologists, have seen broad and increasing applications across several disciplines of late. Amongst a plethora of application specific definitions available in the literature to rank the vertices, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality (page-rank) have been the most important and widely applied ones. Networks where information, signal or commodities are flowing on the edges, surrounds us. Betweenness centrality comes as a handy tool to analyze such systems, but betweenness computation is a daunting task in large size networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient heuristic to determine the betweenness-ordering of $k$ vertices (where $k$ is very less than the total number of vertices) without computing their exact betweenness indices. The algorithm is based on a non-uniform node sampling model which is developed based on the analysis of Erdos-Renyi graphs. We apply our approach to find the betweenness-ordering of vertices in several synthetic and real-world graphs. The proposed heuristic results very efficient ordering even when runs for a linear time in the terms of the number of edges. We compare our method with the available techniques in the literature and show that our method produces more efficient ordering than the currently known methods.
