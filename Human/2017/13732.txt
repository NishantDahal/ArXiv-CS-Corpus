Conflict Analysis for Pythagorean Fuzzy Information Systems with Group Decision Making

Pythagorean fuzzy sets provide stronger ability than intuitionistic fuzzy sets to model uncertainty information and knowledge, but little effort has been paid to conflict analysis of Pythagorean fuzzy information systems. In this paper, we present three types of positive, central, and negative alliances with different thresholds, and employ examples to illustrate how to construct the positive, central, and negative alliances. Then we study conflict analysis of Pythagorean fuzzy information systems based on Bayesian minimum risk theory. Finally, we investigate group conflict analysis of Pythagorean fuzzy information systems based on Bayesian minimum risk theory.
