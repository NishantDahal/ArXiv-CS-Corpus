Analysis of challenges faced by WebRTC videoconferencing and a remedial architecture

Lately, World Wide Web came up with an evolution in the niche of videoconference applications. Latest technologies give browsers a capacity to initiate real-time communications. WebRTC is one of the free and open source projects that aim at providing the users freedom to enjoy real-time communications, and it does so by following and redefining the standards. However, WebRTC is still a new project and it lacks some high-end videoconferencing features such as media mixing, recording of a session and different network conditions adaptation. This paper is an attempt at analyzing the shortcomings and challenges faced by WebRTC and proposing a Multipoint Control Unit or traditional communications entity based architecture as a solution.
