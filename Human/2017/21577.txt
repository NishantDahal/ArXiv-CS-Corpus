An Achievable Rate for an Optical Channel with Finite Memory

A fiber optic channel is modeled in a variety of ways; from the simple additive white complex Gaussian noise model, to models that incorporate memory in the channel. Because of Kerr nonlinearity, a simple model is not a good approximation to an optical fiber. Hence we study a fiber optic channel with finite memory and provide an achievable bound on channel capacity that improves upon a previously known bound.
