On (Commercial) Benefits of Automatic Text Summarization Systems in the News Domain: A Case of Media Monitoring and Media Response Analysis

In this work, we present the results of a systematic study to investigate the (commercial) benefits of automatic text summarization systems in a real world scenario. More specifically, we define a use case in the context of media monitoring and media response analysis and claim that even using a simple query-based extractive approach can dramatically save the processing time of the employees without significantly reducing the quality of their work.
