Formal Analysis of an Authentication Protocol Against External Cloud-Based Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack

The Denial-of-service (DoS) attack is considered one of the largest threats to the availability of cloud-computing services. Due to the unique architecture of cloud-computing systems, the methods for detecting and preventing DoS attacks are quite different from those used in traditional network systems. A main target for DoS attackers is the authentication protocol because it is considered a gateway to accessing cloud resources. In this work, we propose a cloud-based authentication protocol - one that securely authenticates the cloud user and effectively prevents DoS attack on the cloud-computing system-by involving the user in a high computation process. Then, we analyze the protocol via Syverson and Van Oorschot (SVO) logic to verify the authentication process of the protocol in a cloud-computing system.
