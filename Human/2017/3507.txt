A Location-Based Privacy Preserving Framework for M-Learning Adoption to Enhance Distance Education in Kenya: Literature Review

The aim of this paper is to study m-learning literature in order to propose and develop a privacy-preserving framework which can be used to foster sustainable deployment of mobile learning within open and distance education in Kenya. Location-based privacy in mobile learning is essential to retain users trust, key to influencing usage intention. Any risk on privacy can negatively affect users perceptions of a systems reliability and trustworthiness. While extant studies have proposed frameworks for mobile technologies adoption into learning, few have integrated privacy aspects and their influence on m-learning implementation. The framework would provide University management with informed approach to consider privacy preserving aspects in m-learning implementation. Also, it could provide enlightened guidance to mobile learning application developers on the need to cater for learners privacy aspects.
