Evaluation of Semantic Web Technologies for Storing Computable Definitions of Electronic Health Records Phenotyping Algorithms

Electronic Health Records are electronic data generated during or as a byproduct of routine patient care. Structured, semi-structured and unstructured EHR offer researchers unprecedented phenotypic breadth and depth and have the potential to accelerate the development of precision medicine approaches at scale. A main EHR use-case is defining phenotyping algorithms that identify disease status, onset and severity. Phenotyping algorithms utilize diagnoses, prescriptions, laboratory tests, symptoms and other elements in order to identify patients with or without a specific trait. No common standardized, structured, computable format exists for storing phenotyping algorithms. The majority of algorithms are stored as human-readable descriptive text documents making their translation to code challenging due to their inherent complexity and hinders their sharing and re-use across the community. In this paper, we evaluate the two key Semantic Web Technologies, the Web Ontology Language and the Resource Description Framework, for enabling computable representations of EHR-driven phenotyping algorithms.
