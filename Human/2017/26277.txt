Product Matrix Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes with Flexible Number of Helpers

In coding for distributed storage systems, efficient data reconstruction and repair through accessing a predefined number of arbitrarily chosen storage nodes is guaranteed by regenerating codes. Traditionally, code parameters, specially the number of helper nodes participating in a repair process, are predetermined. However, depending on the state of the system and network traffic, it is desirable to adapt such parameters accordingly in order to minimize the cost of repair. In this work a class of regenerating codes with minimum storage is introduced that can simultaneously operate at the optimal repair bandwidth, for a wide range of exact repair mechanisms, based on different number of helper nodes.
