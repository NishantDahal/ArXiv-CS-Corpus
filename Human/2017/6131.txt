Adaptive Cost Function for Pointcloud Registration

In this paper we introduce an adaptive cost function for pointcloud registration. The algorithm automatically estimates the sensor noise, which is important for generalization across different sensors and environments. Through experiments on real and synthetic data, we show significant improvements in accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art solutions.
