Island Loss for Learning Discriminative Features in Facial Expression Recognition

Over the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise on facial expression recognition. However, the performance degrades dramatically under real-world settings due to variations introduced by subtle facial appearance changes, head pose variations, illumination changes, and occlusions.
  In this paper, a novel island loss is proposed to enhance the discriminative power of the deeply learned features. Specifically, the IL is designed to reduce the intra-class variations while enlarging the inter-class differences simultaneously. Experimental results on four benchmark expression databases have demonstrated that the CNN with the proposed island loss (IL-CNN) outperforms the baseline CNN models with either traditional softmax loss or the center loss and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition.
