Control Capacity

Feedback control actively dissipates uncertainty from a dynamical system by means of actuation. We develop a notion of "control capacity" that gives a fundamental limit (in bits) on the rate at which a controller can dissipate the uncertainty from a system, i.e. stabilize to a known fixed point. We give a computable single-letter characterization of control capacity for memoryless stationary scalar multiplicative actuation channels. Control capacity allows us to answer questions of stabilizability for scalar linear systems: a system with actuation uncertainty is stabilizable if and only if the control capacity is larger than the log of the unstable open-loop eigenvalue.
  For second-moment senses of stability, we recover the classic uncertainty threshold principle result. However, our definition of control capacity can quantify the stabilizability limits for any moment of stability. Our formulation parallels the notion of Shannon's communication capacity, and thus yields both a strong converse and a way to compute the value of side-information in control. The results in our paper are motivated by bit-level models for control that build on the deterministic models that are widely used to understand information flows in wireless network information theory.
