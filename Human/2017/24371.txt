Autonomous Racing using Learning Model Predictive Control

A novel learning Model Predictive Control technique is applied to the autonomous racing problem. The goal of the controller is to minimize the time to complete a lap. The proposed control strategy uses the data from previous laps to improve its performance while satisfying safety requirements. Moreover, a system identification technique is proposed to estimate the vehicle dynamics. Simulation results with the high fidelity simulator software CarSim show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
