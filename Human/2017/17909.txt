Semi-Automated Nasal PAP Mask Sizing using Facial Photographs

We present a semi-automated system for sizing nasal Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) masks based upon a neural network model that was trained with facial photographs of both PAP mask users and non-users. It demonstrated an accuracy of 72% in correctly sizing a mask and 96% accuracy sizing to within 1 mask size group. The semi-automated system performed comparably to sizing from manual measurements taken from the same images which produced 89% and 100% accuracy respectively.
