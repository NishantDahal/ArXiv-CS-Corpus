Maintaining The Humanity of Our Models

Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been major research interests in computer science for the better part of the last few decades. However, all too recently, both AI and ML have rapidly grown to be media frenzies, pressuring companies and researchers to claim they use these technologies. As ML continues to percolate into daily life, we, as computer scientists and machine learning researchers, are responsible for ensuring we clearly convey the extent of our work and the humanity of our models. Regularizing ML for mass adoption requires a rigorous standard for model interpretability, a deep consideration for human bias in data, and a transparent understanding of a model's societal effects.
