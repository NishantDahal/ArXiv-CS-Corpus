Frequent Query Matching in Dynamic Data Warehousing

With the need for flexible and on-demand decision support, Dynamic Data Warehouses (DDW) provide benefits over traditional data warehouses due to their dynamic characteristics in structuring and access mechanism. A DDW is a data framework that accommodates data source changes easily to allow seamless querying to users. Materialized Views (MV) are proven to be an effective methodology to enhance the process of retrieving data from a DDW as results are pre-computed and stored in it. However, due to the static nature of materialized views, the level of dynamicity that can be provided at the MV access layer is restricted. As a result, the collection of materialized views is not compatible with ever-changing reporting requirements. It is important that the MV collection is consistent with current and upcoming queries. The solution to the above problem must consider the following aspects: (a) MV must be matched against an OLAP query in order to recognize whether the MV can answer the query, (b) enable scalability in the MV collection, an intuitive mechanism to prune it and retrieve closely matching MVs must be incorporated, (c) MV collection must be able to evolve in correspondence to the regularly changing user query patterns. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to explore these aspects and provide a well-rounded solution for the MV access layer to remove the mismatch between the MV collection and reporting requirements. Our contribution to solve the problem includes a Query Matching Technique, a Domain Matching Technique and Maintenance of the MV collection. We developed an experimental platform using real data-sets to evaluate the effectiveness in terms of performance and precision of the proposed techniques.
