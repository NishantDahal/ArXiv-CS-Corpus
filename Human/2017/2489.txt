Traditional PageRank versus Network Capacity Bound

In a former paper we simplified the proof of a theorem on personalized random walk that is fundamental to graph nodes clustering and generalized it to bipartite graphs for a specific case where the proobability of random jump was proprtional to the number of links of "personally prefereed" nodes. In this paper we turn to the more complex issue of graphs in which the random jump follows uniform distribution.
