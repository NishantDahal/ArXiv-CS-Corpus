Mixed one-bit compressive sensing with applications to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction

When a measurement falls outside the quantization or measurable range, it becomes saturated and cannot be used in classical reconstruction methods. For example, in C-arm angiography systems, which provide projection radiography, fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and are widely used for medical diagnoses and interventions, the limited dynamic range of C-arm flat detectors leads to overexposure in some projections during an acquisition, such as imaging relatively thin body parts (e.g., the knee). Aiming at overexposure correction for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, we in this paper propose a mixed one-bit compressive sensing (M1bit-CS) to acquire information from both regular and saturated measurements. This method is inspired by the recent progress on one-bit compressive sensing, which deals with only sign observations. Its successful applications imply that information carried by saturated measurements is useful to improve recovery quality. For the proposed M1bit-CS model, alternating direction methods of multipliers is developed and an iterative saturation detection scheme is established. Then we evaluate M1bit-CS on one-dimensional signal recovery tasks. In some experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithms on mixed measurements is almost the same as recovery on unsaturated ones with the same amount of measurements. Finally, we apply the proposed method to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction on a phantom and a simulated clinical image. The results are promising, as the typical streaking artifacts and capping artifacts introduced by saturated projection data are effectively reduced, yielding significant error reduction compared with existing algorithms based on extrapolation.
