Covert Communication in Fading Channels under Channel Uncertainty

A covert communication system under block fading channels is considered where users experience uncertainty about their channel knowledge. The transmitter seeks to hide the covert communication to a private user by exploiting a legitimate public communication link while the warden tries to detect this covert communication by using a radiometer. We derive the exact expression for the radiometers optimal threshold which determines the performance limit of the wardens detector. Furthermore for given transmission outage constraints the achievable rates for legitimate and covert users are analyzed while maintaining a specific level of covertness. Our numerical results illustrate how the achievable performance is affected by the channel uncertainty and required level of covertness.
