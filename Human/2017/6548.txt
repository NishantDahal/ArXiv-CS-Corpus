A Tractable Approach to Dynamic Network Dimensioning Based on the Best-cell Configuration

Spatial distributions of other cell interference (OCIF) and interference to own-cell power ratio (IOPR) with reference to the distance between a mobile and its serving base station (BS) are modeled for the down-link reception of cellular systems based on the best-cell configuration instead of the nearest-cell configuration. This enables a more realistic evaluation of two competing objectives in network dimensioning: coverage and rate capacity. More outcomes useful for dynamic network dimensioning are also derived, including maximum BS transmission power per cell size and the cell density required for an adequate coverage of a given traffic density.
