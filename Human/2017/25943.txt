Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Graph Coloring

The goal of this Random Walks project is to code and experiment the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for the problem of graph coloring. In this report, we present the plots of cost function \(\mathbf{H}\) by varying the parameters like \(\mathbf{q}\) (Number of colors that can be used in coloring) and \(\mathbf{c}\) (Average node degree). The results are obtained by using simulated annealing scheme, where the temperature (inverse of \(\mathbfÎ²\)) parameter in the MCMC is lowered progressively.
