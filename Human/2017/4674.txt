Temporal evolution of notoriety of Wikipedia pages with origin in social networks

The Wikipedia is a web portal created by users and its simplicity, references and also the inclusion as insets introductory paragraphs for their pages in Google search results have made it the go-to place to find out about current events or people featured in them. Besides, its open application programming interface (API) allows any user to know about the number of visits some particular page has. In this paper, after certain events that made Copernicus a viral meme in Spain, we study the intensity and duration of the increment of visits to his page and other pages related to the event. Using pages related to other persons as a comparison, we try to establish a typical duration of notoriety achieved through social networks, mainly comparing with visits in previous years in the same dates. We conclude that a 7 day duration is the statistical mode and that this duration is relatively independent of the initial increase in the number of visits.
