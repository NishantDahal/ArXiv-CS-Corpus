Addressing Graph Products and Distance-Regular Graphs

Graham and Pollak showed that the vertices of any connected graph $G$ can be assigned $t$-tuples with entries in $\{0, a, b\}$, called addresses, such that the distance in $G$ between any two vertices equals the number of positions in their addresses where one of the addresses equals $a$ and the other equals $b$. In this paper, we are interested in determining the minimum value of such $t$ for various families of graphs. We develop two ways to obtain this value for the Hamming graphs and present a lower bound for the triangular graphs.
