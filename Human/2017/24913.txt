Long-Term Mobile Traffic Forecasting Using Deep Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks

Forecasting with high accuracy the volume of data traffic that mobile users will consume is becoming increasingly important for precision traffic engineering, demand-aware network resource allocation, as well as public transportation. Measurements collection in dense urban deployments is however complex and expensive, and the post-processing required to make predictions is highly non-trivial, given the intricate spatio-temporal variability of mobile traffic due to user mobility. To overcome these challenges, in this paper we harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning and propose a Spatio-Temporal neural Network (STN) architecture purposely designed for precise network-wide mobile traffic forecasting. We present a mechanism that fine tunes the STN and enables its operation with only limited ground truth observations. We then introduce a Double STN technique (D-STN), which uniquely combines the STN predictions with historical statistics, thereby making faithful long-term mobile traffic projections. Experiments we conduct with real-world mobile traffic data sets, collected over 60 days in both urban and rural areas, demonstrate that the proposed (D-)STN schemes perform up to 10-hour long predictions with remarkable accuracy, irrespective of the time of day when they are triggered. Specifically, our solutions achieve up to 61% smaller prediction errors as compared to widely used forecasting approaches, while operating with up to 600 times shorter measurement intervals.
