Stance detection in online discussions

This paper describes our system created to detect stance in online discussions. The goal is to identify whether the author of a comment is in favor of the given target or against. Our approach is based on a maximum entropy classifier, which uses surface-level, sentiment and domain-specific features. The system was originally developed to detect stance in English tweets. We adapted it to process Czech news commentaries.
