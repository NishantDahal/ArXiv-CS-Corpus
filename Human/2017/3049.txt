Age-Optimal Information Updates in Multihop Networks

The problem of reducing the age-of-information has been extensively studied in the single-hop networks. In this paper, we minimize the age-of-information in general multihop networks. If the packet transmission times over the network links are exponentially distributed, we prove that a preemptive Last Generated First Served (LGFS) policy results in smaller age processes at all nodes of the network (in a stochastic ordering sense) than any other causal policy. In addition, for arbitrary general distributions of packet transmission times, the non-preemptive LGFS policy is shown to minimize the age processes at all nodes of the network among all non-preemptive work-conserving policies (again in a stochastic ordering sense). It is surprising that such simple policies can achieve optimality of the joint distribution of the age processes at all nodes even under arbitrary network topologies, as well as arbitrary packet generation and arrival times. These optimality results not only hold for the age processes, but also for any non-decreasing functional of the age processes.
