Dyck Words, Lattice Paths, and Abelian Borders

We use results on Dyck words and lattice paths to derive a formula for the exact number of binary words of a given length with a given minimal abelian border length, tightening a bound on that number from Christodoulakis et al. (Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2014). We also extend to any number of distinct abelian borders a result of Rampersad et al. (Developments in Language Theory, 2013) on the exact number of binary words of a given length with no abelian borders. Furthermore, we generalize these results to partial words.
