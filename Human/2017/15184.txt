Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis

This report describes my research activities in the Hasso Plattner Institute and summarizes my Ph.D. plan and several novels, end-to-end trainable approaches for analyzing medical images using deep learning algorithm. In this report, as an example, we explore different novel methods based on deep learning for brain abnormality detection, recognition, and segmentation. This report prepared for the doctoral consortium in the AIME-2017 conference.
