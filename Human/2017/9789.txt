Beam Based Stochastic Model of the Coverage Probability in 5G Millimeter Wave Systems

Communications using frequency bands in the millimeter-wave range can play a key role in future generations of mobile networks. By allowing large bandwidth allocations, high carrier frequencies will provide high data rates to support the ever-growing capacity demand. The prevailing challenge at high frequencies is the mitigation of large path loss and link blockage effects. Highly directional beams are expected to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model for characterizing beam coverage probability. The model takes into account both line-of-sight and first-order non-line-of-sight reflections. We model the scattering environment as a stochastic process and we derive an analytical expression of the coverage probability for any given beam. The results derived are validated numerically and compared with simulations to assess the accuracy of the model.
