Colorimetric Calibration of a Digital Camera

In this paper, we introduce a novel - physico-chemical - approach for calibration of a digital camera chip. This approach utilizes results of measurement of incident light spectra of calibration films of different levels of gray for construction of calibration curve (number of incident photons vs. image pixel intensity) for each camera pixel. We show spectral characteristics of such corrected digital raw image files (a primary camera signal) and demonstrate their suitability for next image processing and analysis.
