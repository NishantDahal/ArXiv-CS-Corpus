Rate $\frac{1}{3}$ Index Coding: Forbidden and Feasible Configurations

Linear index coding can be formulated as an interference alignment problem, in which precoding vectors of the minimum possible length are to be assigned to the messages in such a way that the precoding vector of a demand (at some receiver) is independent of the space of the interference (non side-information) precoding vectors. An index code has rate $\frac{1}{l}$ if the assigned vectors are of length $l$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of strictly rate $\frac{1}{L}$ message subsets which must necessarily be allocated precoding vectors from a strictly $L$-dimensional space ($L=1,2,3$) in any rate $\frac{1}{3}$ code. We develop a general necessary condition for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasibility using intersections of strictly rate $\frac{1}{L}$ message subsets. We apply the necessary condition to show that the presence of certain interference configurations makes the index coding problem rate $\frac{1}{3}$ infeasible. We also obtain a class of index coding problems, containing certain interference configurations, which are rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasible based on the idea of \textit{contractions} of an index coding problem. Our necessary conditions for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasibility and the class of rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasible problems obtained subsume all such known results for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ index coding.
