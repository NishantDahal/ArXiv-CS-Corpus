Evaluation Process for an Introductory Programming Course Using Blended Learning

For an offer of the same course for thousands of students, for face-to-face or distance learning, some uniformities must be adopted to allow a comparison of performance in the teaching-learning processes. The Evaluation Unified Process (EUP) was designed and used in an introductory programming course called the Information Process (IP) for students of the Bachelor of Science and Technology of the Federal University of ABC. Initially, the face-to-face scenario (IP-Class) is presented, pointing out the problems identified, describing the EUP designed and applied in mixed learning environments (IP-BL), including the use of software tools developed for this purpose. The two scenarios (IP-Class and IP-BL) are compared with the use of data from all classes of the last 9 years of course application.
