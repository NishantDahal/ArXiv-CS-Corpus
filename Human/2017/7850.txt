We Can "See" You via Wi-Fi - WiFi Action Recognition via Vision-based Methods

Recently, Wi-Fi has caught tremendous attention for its ubiquity, and, motivated by Wi-Fi's low cost and privacy preservation, researchers have been putting lots of investigation into its potential on action recognition and even person identification. In this paper, we offer an comprehensive overview on these two topics in Wi-Fi. Also, through looking at these two topics from an unprecedented perspective, we could achieve generality instead of designing specific ad-hoc features for each scenario. Observing the great resemblance of Channel State Information (CSI, a fine-grained information captured from the received Wi-Fi signal) to texture, we proposed a brand-new framework based on computer vision methods. To minimize the effect of location dependency embedded in CSI, we propose a novel de-noising method based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to eliminate the background energy and effectively extract the channel information of signals reflected by human bodies. From the experiments conducted, we demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed methods. Also, we conclude factors that would affect the performance and highlight a few promising issues that require further deliberation.
