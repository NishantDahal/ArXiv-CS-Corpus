A Parallel Simulator for Massive Reservoir Models Utilizing Distributed-Memory Parallel Systems

This paper presents our work on developing parallel computational methods for two-phase flow on modern parallel computers, where techniques for linear solvers and nonlinear methods are studied and the standard and inexact Newton methods are investigated. A multi-stage preconditioner for two-phase flow is applied and advanced matrix processing strategies are studied. A local reordering method is developed to speed the solution of linear systems. Numerical experiments show that these computational methods are effective and scalable, and are capable of computing large-scale reservoir simulation problems using thousands of CPU cores on parallel computers. The nonlinear techniques, preconditioner and matrix processing strategies can also be applied to three-phase black oil, compositional and thermal models.
