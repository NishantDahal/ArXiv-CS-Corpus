Systems, Actors and Agents: Operation in a multicomponent environment

Multi-agent approach has become popular in computer science and technology. However, the conventional models of multi-agent and multicomponent systems implicitly or explicitly assume existence of absolute time or even do not include time in the set of defining parameters. At the same time, it is proved theoretically and validated experimentally that there are different times and time scales in a variety of real systems - physical, chemical, biological, social, informational, etc. Thus, the goal of this work is construction of a multi-agent multicomponent system models with concurrency of processes and diversity of actions. To achieve this goal, a mathematical system actor model is elaborated and its properties are studied.
