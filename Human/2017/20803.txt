Fast and Strong Convergence of Online Learning Algorithms

In this paper, we study the online learning algorithm without explicit regularization terms. This algorithm is essentially a stochastic gradient descent scheme in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The polynomially decaying step size in each iteration can play a role of regularization to ensure the generalization ability of online learning algorithm. We develop a novel capacity dependent analysis on the performance of the last iterate of online learning algorithm. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, our nice analysis can lead to the convergence rate in the standard mean square distance which is the best so far. Second, we establish, for the first time, the strong convergence of the last iterate with polynomially decaying step sizes in the RKHS norm. We demonstrate that the theoretical analysis established in this paper fully exploits the fine structure of the underlying RKHS, and thus can lead to sharp error estimates of online learning algorithm.
