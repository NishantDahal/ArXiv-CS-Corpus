Deterministic Distributed Construction of $T$-Dominating Sets in Time $T$

A $k$-dominating set is a set $D$ of nodes of a graph such that, for each node $v$, there exists a node $w \in D$ at distance at most $k$ from $v$. Our aim is the deterministic distributed construction of small $T$-dominating sets in time $T$ in networks modeled as undirected $n$-node graphs and under the $\cal{LOCAL}$ communication model.
  For any positive integer $T$, if $b$ is the size of a pairwise disjoint collection of balls of radii at least $T$ in a graph, then $b$ is an obvious lower bound on the size of a $T$-dominating set. Our first result shows that, even on rings, it is impossible to construct a $T$-dominating set of size $s$ asymptotically $b$ (i.e., such that $s/b \rightarrow 1$) in time $T$.
  In the range of time $T \in Θ(\log^* n)$, the size of a $T$-dominating set turns out to be very sensitive to multiplicative constants in running time. Indeed, it follows from \cite{KP}, that for time $T=γ\log^* n$ with large constant $γ$, it is possible to construct a $T$-dominating set whose size is a small fraction of $n$. By contrast, we show that, for time $T=α\log^* n $ for small constant $α$, the size of a $T$-dominating set must be a large fraction of $n$.
  Finally, when $T \in o (\log^* n)$, the above lower bound implies that, for any constant $x<1$, it is impossible to construct a $T$-dominating set of size smaller than $xn$, even on rings. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that constructs a $T$-dominating set of size $n- Θ(T)$ on all graphs.
