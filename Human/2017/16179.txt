Multi-dimensional Gated Recurrent Units for Automated Anatomical Landmark Localization

We present an automated method for localizing an anatomical landmark in three-dimensional medical images. The method combines two recurrent neural networks in a coarse-to-fine approach: The first network determines a candidate neighborhood by analyzing the complete given image volume. The second network localizes the actual landmark precisely and accurately in the candidate neighborhood. Both networks take advantage of multi-dimensional gated recurrent units in their main layers, which allow for high model complexity with a comparatively small set of parameters. We localize the medullopontine sulcus in 3D magnetic resonance images of the head and neck. We show that the proposed approach outperforms similar localization techniques both in terms of mean distance in millimeters and voxels w.r.t. manual labelings of the data. With a mean localization error of 1.7 mm, the proposed approach performs on par with neurological experts, as we demonstrate in an interrater comparison.
