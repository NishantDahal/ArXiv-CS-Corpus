On Continuity Properties for Infinite Rectangle Packing

By rectangle packing we mean putting a set of rectangles into an enclosing rectangle, without any overlapping. We begin with perfect rectangle packing problems, then prove two continuity properties for parallel rectangle packing problems, and discuss how they might be used to obtain negative results for perfect rectangle packing problems.
