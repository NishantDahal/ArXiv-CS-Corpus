A storm is Coming: A Modern Probabilistic Model Checker

We launch the new probabilistic model checker storm. It features the analysis of discrete- and continuous-time variants of both Markov chains and MDPs. It supports the PRISM and JANI modeling languages, probabilistic programs, dynamic fault trees and generalized stochastic Petri nets. It has a modular set-up in which solvers and symbolic engines can easily be exchanged. It offers a Python API for rapid prototyping by encapsulating storm's fast and scalable algorithms. Experiments on a variety of benchmarks show its competitive performance.
