Algorithms for Nash and Pareto Equilibria for Resource Allocation in Multiple Femtocells

We consider a cellular system with multiple Femtocells operating in a Macrocell. They are sharing a set of communication channels. Each Femtocell has multiple users requiring certain minimum rate guarantees. Each channel has a peak power constraint to limit interference to the Macro Base Station (BS). We formulate the problem of channel allocation and power control at the Femtocells as a noncooperative Game. We develop decentralized algorithms to obtain a Coarse Correlated equilibrium that satisfies the QoS of each user. If the QoS of all the users cannot be satisfied, then we obtain a fair equilibrium. Finally we also provide a decentralized algorithm to reach a Pareto and a Nash Bargaining solution which has a much lower complexity than the algorithm to compute the NE.
