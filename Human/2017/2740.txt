Solving the Brachistochrone Problem by an Influence Diagram

Influence diagrams are a decision-theoretic extension of probabilistic graphical models. In this paper we show how they can be used to solve the Brachistochrone problem. We present results of numerical experiments on this problem, compare the solution provided by the influence diagram with the optimal solution. The R code used for the experiments is presented in the Appendix.
