Lyapunov Exponent Evaluation of the CBC Mode of Operation

The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of encryption was invented in 1976, and it is currently one of the most commonly used mode. In our previous research works, we have proven that the CBC mode of operation exhibits, under some conditions, a chaotic behavior. The dynamics of this mode has been deeply investigated later, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using the rigorous mathematical topology field of research. In this article, which is an extension of our previous work, we intend to compute a new important quantitative property concerning our chaotic CBC mode of operation, which is the Lyapunov exponent.
