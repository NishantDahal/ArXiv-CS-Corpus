Efficient Construction of Probabilistic Tree Embeddings

In this paper we describe an algorithm that embeds a graph metric $(V,d_G)$ on an undirected weighted graph $G=(V,E)$ into a distribution of tree metrics $(T,D_T)$ such that for every pair $u,v\in V$, $d_G(u,v)\leq d_T(u,v)$ and ${\bf{E}}_{T}[d_T(u,v)]\leq O(\log n)\cdot d_G(u,v)$. Such embeddings have proved highly useful in designing fast approximation algorithms, as many hard problems on graphs are easy to solve on tree instances. For a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, our algorithm runs in $O(m\log n)$ time with high probability, which improves the previous upper bound of $O(m\log^3 n)$ shown by Mendel et al.\,in 2009.
  The key component of our algorithm is a new approximate single-source shortest-path algorithm, which implements the priority queue with a new data structure, the "bucket-tree structure". The algorithm has three properties: it only requires linear time in the number of edges in the input graph; the computed distances have a distance preserving property; and when computing the shortest-paths to the $k$-nearest vertices from the source, it only requires to visit these vertices and their edge lists. These properties are essential to guarantee the correctness and the stated time bound.
  Using this shortest-path algorithm, we show how to generate an intermediate structure, the approximate dominance sequences of the input graph, in $O(m \log n)$ time, and further propose a simple yet efficient algorithm to converted this sequence to a tree embedding in $O(n\log n)$ time, both with high probability. Combining the three subroutines gives the stated time bound of the algorithm.
  Then we show that this efficient construction can facilitate some applications. We proved that FRT trees (the generated tree embedding) are Ramsey partitions with asymptotically tight bound, so the construction of a series of distance oracles can be accelerated.
