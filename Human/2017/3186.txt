Anchor Free IP Mobility

Efficient mobility management techniques are critical in providing seamless connectivity and session continuity between a mobile node and the network during its movement. Current mobility management solutions generally require a central entity in the network core, tracking IP address movement and anchoring traffic from source to destination through point-to-point tunnels. Intuitively, this approach suffers from scalability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in the network, due to sub-optimal routing via the anchor point. Meanwhile, alternative anchorless, solutions are not feasible due to the current limitations of the IP semantics, which strongly ties addressing information to location. In contrast, novel path-based forwarding solutions may be exploited for feasible anchorless solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel network-based mobility management solution that facilitates IP mobility over such a path-based forwarding substrate. Our solution exploits the advantages of such substrates in decoupling path calculation from data transfer to eliminate the need for anchoring traffic through the network core; thereby, allowing flexible path calculation and service provisioning. Furthermore, by eliminating the limitation of routing via the anchor point, our approach reduces the network cost compared to anchored solution through bandwidth saving while maintaining comparable handover delay. We evaluate our solution through analytical and simulation models and compare it with the IETF standardized solution, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). Evaluation results illustrate a significant saving in the total network cost when using our proposed solution, compared to its counterpart.
