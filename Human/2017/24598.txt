Multichannel Robot Speech Recognition Database: MChRSR

In real human robot interaction (HRI) scenarios, speech recognition represents a major challenge due to robot noise, background noise and time-varying acoustic channel. This document describes the procedure used to obtain the Multichannel Robot Speech Recognition Database (MChRSR). It is composed of 12 hours of multichannel evaluation data recorded in a real mobile HRI scenario. This database was recorded with a PR2 robot performing different translational and azimuthal movements. Accordingly, 16 evaluation sets were obtained re-recording the clean set of the Aurora 4 database in different movement conditions.
