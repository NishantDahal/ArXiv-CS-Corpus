Ultra-Reliable Short-Packet Communications with Wireless Energy Transfer

We analyze and optimize a wireless system with energy transfer in the downlink and information transfer in the uplink, under quasi-static Nakagami-m fading. We consider ultra-reliable communication scenarios representative of the fifth-generation of wireless systems, with strict error and latency requirements. The error probability and delay are investigated, and an approximation for the former is given and validated through simulations. The numerical results demonstrate that there are optimum numbers of channels uses for both energy and information transfer for a given message length.
