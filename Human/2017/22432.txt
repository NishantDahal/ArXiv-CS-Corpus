Micro and Macro Pedestrian Dynamics in Counterflow: the Impact of Social Groups

Although it is widely recognised that the presence of groups influences microscopic and aggregated pedestrian dynamics, a precise characterisation of the phenomenon still calls for evidences and insights. The present paper describes micro and macro level original analyses on data characterising pedestrian behaviour in presence of counter-flows and grouping, in particular dyads, acquired through controlled experiments. Results suggest that the presence of dyads and their tendency to walk in a line-abreast formation influences the formation of lanes and, in turn, aggregated observables, such as overall specific flow.
