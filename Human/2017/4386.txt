Texture segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks

In the last decade, deep learning has contributed to advances in a wide range computer vision tasks including texture analysis. This paper explores a new approach for texture segmentation using deep convolutional neural networks, sharing important ideas with classic filter bank based texture segmentation methods. Several methods are developed to train Fully Convolutional Networks to segment textures in various applications. We show in particular that these networks can learn to recognize and segment a type of texture, e.g. wood and grass from texture recognition datasets (no training segmentation). We demonstrate that Fully Convolutional Networks can learn from repetitive patterns to segment a particular texture from a single image or even a part of an image. We take advantage of these findings to develop a method that is evaluated on a series of supervised and unsupervised experiments and improve the state of the art on the Prague texture segmentation datasets.
