Building machines that adapt and compute like brains

Building machines that learn and think like humans is essential not only for cognitive science, but also for computational neuroscience, whose ultimate goal is to understand how cognition is implemented in biological brains. A new cognitive computational neuroscience should build cognitive-level and neural- level models, understand their relationships, and test both types of models with both brain and behavioral data.
