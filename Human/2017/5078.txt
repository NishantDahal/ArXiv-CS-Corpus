Wireless Node Cooperation with Resource Availability Constraints

Base station cooperation is a promising scheme to improve network performance for next generation cellular networks. Up to this point research has focused on station grouping criteria based solely on geographic proximity. However, for the cooperation to be meaningful, each station participating in a group should have sufficient available resources to share with others. In this work we consider an alternative grouping criterion based on a distance that considers both geographic proximity and available resources of the stations. When the network is modelled by a Poisson Point Process, we derive analytical formulas on the proportion of cooperative pairs or single stations, and the expected sum interference from each of the groups. The results illustrate that cooperation gains strongly depend on the distribution of available resources over the network.
