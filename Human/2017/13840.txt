Choosing Requirements for Experimentation with User Interfaces of Requirements Modeling Tools

When designing a new presentation front-end called FlexiView for requirements modeling tools, we encountered a general problem: designing such an interface requires a lot of experimentation which is costly when the code of the tool needs to be adapted for every experiment. On the other hand, when using simplified user interface (UI) tools, the results are difficult to generalize. To improve this situation, we are developing a UI experimentation tool which is based on so-called ImitGraphs. ImitGraphs can act as a simple, but an accurate substitute for a modeling tool. In this paper, we define requirements for such a UI experimentation tool based on an analysis of the features of existing requirements modeling tools.
