Mobile Academy: A Ubiquitous Mobile Learning (mLearning) Platform

The paper reports on an ongoing research project into the development of "Mobile Academy", an Android-based mobile learning (mLearning) application (app). The project comprises three major phases: requirement analysis, application development and testing and evaluation. To satisfy the user requirement analysis, a detailed ethnographic study was conducted to investigate how people from different background use mobile devices for learning purposes. The initial analysis and evaluation of the first version of the projected app demonstrates very promising results. Making use of the app seemed to have, in general, a positive dimension in facilitating educational use of mobile devices.
