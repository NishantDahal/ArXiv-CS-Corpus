A Simulation System for Energy Harvesting Networked Tags (EnHANTs)

This project is about EnHANTs networks. These networks have self-sustainable energy devices and the communication is performed over wireless links between neighboring devices. Since the devices are very limited in terms of energy, sending the data in these networks has to be as effective as possible and must take into consideration the available amount of energy. Therefore, it is necessary to use algorithms that are specifically designed for this type of networks. In this book we propose strategies for a specific case of these networks. The main part of this project is a MATLAB simulation built in order to examine the behavior of such networks. In the last section of this book, we describe a set of runs of different topologies, in order to test the influence of certain strategy parameters on the behavior of the system.
