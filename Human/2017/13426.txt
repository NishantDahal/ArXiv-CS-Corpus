Packing Plane Spanning Trees and Paths in Complete Geometric Graphs

We consider the following question: How many edge-disjoint plane spanning trees are contained in a complete geometric graph $GK_n$ on any set $S$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane? We show that this number is in $Î©(\sqrt{n})$. Further, we consider variants of this problem by bounding the diameter and the degree of the trees (in particular considering spanning paths).
