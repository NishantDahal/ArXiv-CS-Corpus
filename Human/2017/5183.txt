Collision Resolution and Interference Elimination in Multiaccess Communication Networks

We define a multiaccess communication scheme that effectively eliminates interference and resolves collisions in many-to-one and many-to-many communication scenarios. Each transmitter is uniquely identified by a steering vector. All signals issued from a specific transmitter will be steered into the same single-dimensional or double-dimensional subspace at all receivers hearing this transmission. This subspace is orthogonal to the noise subspace at a receiver and the signals within the subspace can be extracted using the root-MUSIC method. At high SNR, local channel knowledge and strict synchronization, the algorithm asymptotically achieves full network capacity on condition that a channel remains constant within a single time slot. Without synchronization, the worst case asymptotic performance is still greater than the $50\%$ throughput achieved by collision resolution algorithms and interference management techniques like interference alignment.
