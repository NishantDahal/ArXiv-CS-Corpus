Energy Efficient User Association and Power Allocation in Millimeter Wave Based Ultra Dense Networks with Energy Harvesting Base Stations

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication technologies have recently emerged as an attractive solution to meet the exponentially increasing demand on mobile data traffic. Moreover, ultra dense networks (UDNs) combined with mmWave technology are expected to increase both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. In this paper, user association and power allocation in mmWave based UDNs is considered with attention to load balance constraints, energy harvesting by base stations, user quality of service requirements, energy efficiency, and cross-tier interference limits. The joint user association and power optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer programming problem, which is then transformed into a convex optimization problem by relaxing the user association indicator and solved by Lagrangian dual decomposition. An iterative gradient user association and power allocation algorithm is proposed and shown to converge rapidly to an optimal point. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared with existing methods is verified by simulations.
