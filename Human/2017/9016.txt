A Novel Transmission Scheme for the $K$-user Broadcast Channel with Delayed CSIT

The state-dependent $K$-user memoryless Broadcast Channel~(BC) with state feedback is investigated. We propose a novel transmission scheme and derive its corresponding achievable rate region, which, compared to some general schemes that deal with feedback, has the advantage of being relatively simple and thus is easy to evaluate. In particular, it is shown that the capacity region of the symmetric erasure BC with an arbitrary input alphabet size is achievable with the proposed scheme. For the fading Gaussian BC, we derive a symmetric achievable rate as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio~(SNR) and a small set of parameters. Besides achieving the optimal degrees of freedom at high SNR, the proposed scheme is shown, through numerical results, to outperform existing schemes from the literature in the finite SNR regime.
