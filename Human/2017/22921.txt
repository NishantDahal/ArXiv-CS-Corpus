War and Peace: The Peculiarities of Ukrainian-Russian Scientific Cooperation Dynamics Against the Background of Russian Military Aggression in Ukraine, in 2014-2016

The paper presents the results of bibliometric analysis of publications that were co-written by authors affiliated with Ukrainian and Russian institutions in 2007-2016 according to Scopus. Results of the study show that Ukrainian and Russian scientists have not refused to carry out joint research in major international projects, but a decrease in the number of works, written by Ukrainian and Russian scientific institutions staff members in 2016, provides evidence on the threat and negative impact the Russian military intervention brings to cooperation in science. The findings are important for generating the science development programs in Ukraine.
