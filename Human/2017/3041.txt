The Reliability Function for the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel at Rates above the Capacity

We consider the additive white Gaussian noise channels. We prove that the error probability of decoding tends to one exponentially for rates above the capacity and derive the optimal exponent function. We shall demonstrate that the information spectrum approach is quite useful for investigating this problem.
