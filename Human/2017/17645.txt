Polysemy Detection in Distributed Representation of Word Sense

In this paper, we propose a statistical test to determine whether a given word is used as a polysemic word or not. The statistic of the word in this test roughly corresponds to the fluctuation in the senses of the neighboring words a nd the word itself. Even though the sense of a word corresponds to a single vector, we discuss how polysemy of the words affects the position of vectors. Finally, we also explain the method to detect this effect.
