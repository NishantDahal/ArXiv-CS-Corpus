Class-specific Poisson denoising by patch-based importance sampling

In this paper, we address the problem of recovering images degraded by Poisson noise, where the image is known to belong to a specific class. In the proposed method, a dataset of clean patches from images of the class of interest is clustered using multivariate Gaussian distributions. In order to recover the noisy image, each noisy patch is assigned to one of these distributions, and the corresponding minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate is obtained. We propose to use a self-normalized importance sampling approach, which is a method of the Monte-Carlo family, for the both determining the most likely distribution and approximating the MMSE estimate of the clean patch. Experimental results shows that our proposed method outperforms other methods for Poisson denoising at a low SNR regime.
