Robust Video Watermarking against H.264 and H.265 Compression Attacks

This paper proposes a robust watermarking method for uncompressed video data against H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC compression standards. We embed the watermark data in the mid-range transform coefficients of a block that is less similar to its corresponding block in the previous and next frames. This idea makes the watermark robust against the compression standards that use the inter prediction technique. The last two video compression standards also use inter prediction for motion compensation like previous video compression standards. Therefore, the proposed method is also well suited with these standards. Simulation results show the adequate robustness and transparency of our watermarking scheme.
