Bounded Degree Cosystolic Expanders of Every Dimension

In this work we present a new local to global criterion for proving a form of high dimensional expansion, which we term cosystolic expansion. Applying this criterion on Ramanujan complexes, yields for every dimension, an infinite family of bounded degree complexes with the topological overlapping property. This answer affirmatively an open question raised by Gromov.
