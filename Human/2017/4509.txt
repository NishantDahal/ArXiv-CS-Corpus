Smart Contract SLAs for Dense Small-Cell-as-a-Service

The disruptive power of blockchain technologies represents a great opportunity to re-imagine standard practices of telecommunication networks and to identify critical areas that can benefit from brand new approaches. As a starting point for this debate, we look at the current limits of infrastructure sharing, and specifically at the Small-Cell-as-a-Service trend, asking ourselves how we could push it to its natural extreme: a scenario in which any individual home or business user can become a service provider for mobile network operators, freed from all the scalability and legal constraints that are inherent to the current modus operandi. We propose the adoption of smart contracts to implement simple but effective Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between small cell providers and mobile operators, and present an example contract template based on the Ethereum blockchain.
