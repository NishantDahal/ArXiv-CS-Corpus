Security and Privacy of performing Data Analytics in the cloud - A three-way handshake of Technology, Policy, and Management

Cloud platform came into existence primarily to accelerate IT delivery and to promote innovation. To this point, it has performed largely well to the expectations of technologists, businesses and customers. The service aspect of this technology has paved the road for a faster set up of infrastructure and related goals for both startups and established organizations. This has further led to quicker delivery of many user-friendly applications to the market while proving to be a commercially viable option to companies with limited resources. On the technology front, the creation and adoption of this ecosystem has allowed easy collection of massive data from various sources at one place, where the place is sometimes referred as just the cloud. Efficient data mining can be performed on raw data to extract potentially useful information, which was not possible at this scale before. Targeted advertising is a common example that can help businesses. Despite these promising offerings, concerns around security and privacy of user information suppressed wider acceptance and an all-encompassing deployment of the cloud platform. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy concerns that occur due to data exchanging hands between a cloud servicer provider (CSP) and the primary cloud user - the data collector, from the content generator. We offer solutions that encompass technology, policy and sound management of the cloud service asserting that this approach has the potential to provide a holistic solution.
