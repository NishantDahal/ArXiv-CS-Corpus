Feasibility of Corneal Imaging for Handheld Augmented Reality

Smartphones are a popular device class for mobile Augmented Reality but suffer from a limited input space. Around-device interaction techniques aim at extending this input space using various sensing modalities. In this paper we present our work towards extending the input area of mobile devices using front-facing device-centered cameras that capture reflections in the cornea. As current generation mobile devices lack high resolution front-facing cameras, we study the feasibility of around-device interaction using corneal reflective imaging based on a high resolution camera. We present a workflow, a technical prototype and a feasibility evaluation.
