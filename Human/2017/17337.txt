A Portfolio Approach to Algorithm Selection for Discrete Time-Cost Trade-off Problem

It is a known fact that the performance of optimization algorithms for NP-Hard problems vary from instance to instance. We observed the same trend when we comprehensively studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on a six benchmark instances of discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP) in a construction project. In this paper, instead of using a single algorithm to solve DTCTP, we use a portfolio approach that takes multiple algorithms as its constituent. We proposed portfolio comprising of four MOEAs, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), the strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II), Pareto archive evolutionary strategy (PAES) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm II (NPGA-II) to solve DTCTP. The result shows that the portfolio approach is computationally fast and qualitatively superior to its constituent algorithms for all benchmark instances. Moreover, portfolio approach provides an insight in selecting the best algorithm for all benchmark instances of DTCTP.
