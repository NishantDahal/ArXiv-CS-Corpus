The linear nature of pseudowords

Given a pseudoword over suitable pseudovarieties, we associate to it a labeled linear order determined by the factorizations of the pseudoword. We show that, in the case of the pseudovariety of aperiodic finite semigroups, the pseudoword can be recovered from the labeled linear order.
