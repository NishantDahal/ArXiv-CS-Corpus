Surface Proofs for Nonsymmetric Linear Logic (Extended Abstract)

We show that a proof in multiplicative linear logic can be represented as a decorated surface, such that two proofs are logically equivalent just when their surfaces are geometrically equivalent. This is an extended abstract for arXiv:1601.05372.
