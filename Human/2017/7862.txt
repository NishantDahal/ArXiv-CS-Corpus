Coverage in Heterogeneous Downlink Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks

In this paper, we provide an analytical framework to analyze heterogeneous downlink mmWave cellular networks consisting of K tiers of randomly located base stations (BSs) where each tier operates in a mmWave frequency band. Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability is derived for the entire network using tools from stochastic geometry. The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated into the coverage analysis by assuming averaged biased received power association and Nakagami-m fading. By using the noise-limited assumption for mmWave networks, a simpler expression requiring the computation of only one numerical integral for coverage probability is obtained. Also, effect of beamforming alignment errors on the coverage probability analysis is investigated to get insight on the performance in practical scenarios. Downlink rate coverage probability is derived as well to get more insights on the performance of the network. Moreover, effect of deploying low-power smaller cells and effect of biasing factor on energy efficiency is analyzed. Finally, a hybrid cellular network operating in both mmWave and microWave frequency bands is addressed.
