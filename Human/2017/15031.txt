Mist Computing: Principles, Trends and Future Direction

In this paper we present the novel idea of computing near the edge of IOT architecture which enhances the inherent efficiency while computing complex applications. This concept is termed as mist computing. We believe this computing will bring about an massive revolution in future computing technologies. instead of thrusting the control responsibility to gateways while data transmission the control is decentralised to end nodes which decrease the communicational delay of the network thereby increasing the throughput.
