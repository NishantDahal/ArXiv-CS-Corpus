Modeling and Analyzing the Vocal Tract under Normal and Stressful Talking Conditions

In this research, we model and analyze the vocal tract under normal and stressful talking conditions. This research answers the question of the degradation in the recognition performance of text-dependent speaker identification under stressful talking conditions. This research can be used (for future research) to improve the recognition performance under stressful talking conditions.
