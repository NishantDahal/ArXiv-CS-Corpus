Full-Duplex Device-to-Device Collaboration for Low-Latency Wireless Video Distribution

Growing demand for video services is the main driver for increasing traffic in wireless cellular data networks. Wireless video distribution schemes have recently been proposed to offload data via Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. These offloading schemes increase capacity and reduce end-to-end delay in cellular networks and help to serve the dramatically increasing demand for high quality video. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for video distribution over cellular networks by exploiting full-duplex (FD) D2D communication in two scenarios; scenario one: two nodes exchange their desired video files simultaneously with each other, and scenario two: each node can concurrently transmit to and receive from two different nodes. In the latter case, an intermediate transceiver can serve one or multiple users' file requests whilst capturing its desired file from another device in the vicinity. Analytic and simulation results are used to compare the proposed scheme with its half-duplex (HD) counterpart under the same transmitter establishment criteria to show the achievable gain of FD-D2D scheme in video content delivery, in terms of sum throughput and latency.
