Multi-Antenna Assisted Virtual Full-Duplex Relaying with Reliability-Aware Iterative Decoding

In this paper, a multi-antenna assisted virtual full-duplex (FD) relaying with reliability-aware iterative decoding at destination node is proposed to improve system spectral efficiency and reliability. This scheme enables two half-duplex relay nodes, mimicked as FD relaying, to alternatively serve as transmitter and receiver to relay their decoded data signals regardless the decoding errors, meanwhile, cancel the inter-relay interference with QR-decomposition. Then, by deploying the reliability-aware iterative detection/decoding process, destination node can efficiently mitigate inter-frame interference and error propagation effect at the same time. Simulation results show that, without extra cost of time delay and signalling overhead, our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional selective decode-and-forward (S-DF) relaying schemes, such as cyclic redundancy check based S-DF relaying and threshold based S-DF relaying, by up to 8 dB in terms of bit-error-rate.
