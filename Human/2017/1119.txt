Security-related Research in Ubiquitous Computing -- Results of a Systematic Literature Review

In an endeavor to reach the vision of ubiquitous computing where users are able to use pervasive services without spatial and temporal constraints, we are witnessing a fast growing number of mobile and sensor-enhanced devices becoming available. However, in order to take full advantage of the numerous benefits offered by novel mobile devices and services, we must address the related security issues. In this paper, we present results of a systematic literature review (SLR) on security-related topics in ubiquitous computing environments. In our study, we found 5165 scientific contributions published between 2003 and 2015. We applied a systematic procedure to identify the threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, as well as corresponding defense mechanisms that are discussed in those publications. While this paper mainly discusses the results of our study, the corresponding SLR protocol which provides all details of the SLR is also publicly available for download.
