Effective Optimization Criteria and Relay Selection Algorithms for Physical-Layer Security in Multiple-Antenna Relay Networks

Physical-layer security for wireless networks has become an effective approach and recently drawn significant attention in the literature. In particular, the deployment and allocation of resources such as relays to assist the transmission have gained significant interest due to their ability to improve the secrecy rate of wireless networks. In this work, we examine relay selection criteria with arbitrary knowledge of the channels of the users and the eavesdroppers. We present alternative optimization criteria based on the signal-to-interference and the secrecy rate criteria that can be used for resource allocation and that do not require knowledge of the channels of the eavesdroppers and the interference. We then develop effective relay selection algorithms that can achieve a high secrecy rate performance without the need for the knowledge of the channels of the eavesdroppers and the interference. Simulation results show that the proposed criteria and algorithms achieve excellent performance.
