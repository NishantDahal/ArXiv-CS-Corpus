Estimating the resolution of real images

Image resolvability is the primary concern in imaging. This paper reports an estimation of the full width at half maximum of the point spread function from a Fourier domain plot of real sample images by neither using test objects, nor defining a threshold criterion. We suggest that this method can be applied to any type of image, independently of the imaging modality.
