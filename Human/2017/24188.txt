Lossy Asymptotic Equipartition Property For Geometric Networked Data Structures

This article extends the Generalized Asypmtotic Equipartition Property of Networked Data Structures to cover the Wireless Sensor Network modelled as coloured geometric random graph (CGRG). The main techniques used to prove this result remains large deviation principles for properly defined empirical measures on CGRGs. As a motivation for this article, we apply our results to some data from Wireless Sensor Network for Monitoring Water Quality from a Lake..
