On the Degrees of Freedom of the Symmetric Multi-Relay MIMO Y Channel

In this paper, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the symmetric multi-relay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Y channel, where three user nodes, each with M antennas, communicate via K geographically separated relay nodes, each with N antennas. For this model, we establish a general DoF achievability framework based on linear precoding and post-processing methods. The framework poses a nonlinear problem with respect to user precoders and post-processors, as well as relay precoders. To solve this problem, we adopt an uplink-downlink asymmetric strategy, where the user precoders are designed for signal alignment and the user post-processors are used for interference neutralization. With the user precoder and post-processor designs fixed as such, the original problem then reduces to a problem of relay precoder design. To address the solvability of the system, we propose a general method for solving matrix equations. This method is also useful to the DoF analysis of many other multiway relay networks. Together with the techniques of antenna disablement and symbol extension, an achievable DoF of the symmetric multi-relay MIMO Y channel is derived for an arbitrary setup of (K, M, N). We show that, for K >= 2, the optimal DoF is achieved for M/N in [0, max{sqrt(3K)/3,1}) and [(3K+sqrt(9K^2-12K))/6,infinity). We also show that the uplink-downlink asymmetric design proposed in this paper considerably outperforms the conventional approach based on uplink-downlink symmetry.
