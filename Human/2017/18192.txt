Grade Prediction with Temporal Course-wise Influence

There is a critical need to develop new educational technology applications that analyze the data collected by universities to ensure that students graduate in a timely fashion (4 to 6 years); and they are well prepared for jobs in their respective fields of study. In this paper, we present a novel approach for analyzing historical educational records from a large, public university to perform next-term grade prediction; i.e., to estimate the grades that a student will get in a course that he/she will enroll in the next term. Accurate next-term grade prediction holds the promise for better student degree planning, personalized advising and automated interventions to ensure that students stay on track in their chosen degree program and graduate on time. We present a factorization-based approach called Matrix Factorization with Temporal Course-wise Influence that incorporates course-wise influence effects and temporal effects for grade prediction. In this model, students and courses are represented in a latent "knowledge" space. The grade of a student on a course is modeled as the similarity of their latent representation in the "knowledge" space. Course-wise influence is considered as an additional factor in the grade prediction. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baseline approaches and infer meaningful patterns between pairs of courses within academic programs.
