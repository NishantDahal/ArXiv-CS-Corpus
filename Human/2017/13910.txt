Deepest Neural Networks

This paper shows that a long chain of perceptrons (that is, a multilayer perceptron, or MLP, with many hidden layers of width one) can be a universal classifier. The classification procedure is not necessarily computationally efficient, but the technique throws some light on the kind of computations possible with narrow and deep MLPs.
