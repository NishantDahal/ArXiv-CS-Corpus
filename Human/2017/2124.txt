Interpreting Outliers: Localized Logistic Regression for Density Ratio Estimation

We propose an inlier-based outlier detection method capable of both identifying the outliers and explaining why they are outliers, by identifying the outlier-specific features. Specifically, we employ an inlier-based outlier detection criterion, which uses the ratio of inlier and test probability densities as a measure of plausibility of being an outlier. For estimating the density ratio function, we propose a localized logistic regression algorithm. Thanks to the locality of the model, variable selection can be outlier-specific, and will help interpret why points are outliers in a high-dimensional space. Through synthetic experiments, we show that the proposed algorithm can successfully detect the important features for outliers. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm tends to outperform existing algorithms in benchmark datasets.
