Dynamic Network: Graphical Deformation of Penetrated Objects

In a computer-based virtual environment, objects may collide with each other. Therefore, different algorithms are needed to detect the collision and perform a correct action in order to avoid penetration. Based on the application and objects physical characteristics, a correct action can include separating or deforming the penetrated objects. In this article, by using the concepts of dynamic networks and simple physics, a method for deforming two penetrated 3D objects is proposed. In this method, we consider each primitive of the objects as an element interacting with the other elements in a dynamic network. These kinds of interactions make the elements impose force on each other and change their position, until a force-balance happens. The proposed method is implemented and tested on 3D sample objects, and the resulted deformation proved to be visually satisfying.
