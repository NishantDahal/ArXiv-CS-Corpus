Lower Bounds on the mim-width of Some Graph Classes

mim-width is a recent graph width measure that has seen applications in graph algorithms and problems related to propositional satisfiability. In this paper, we show linear lower bounds for the mim-width of strongly chordal split graphs, co-comparability graphs and circle graphs. This improves and refines lower bounds that were known before, some of them only conditionally. In the case of strongly chordal graphs not even a conditional lower bound was known before. All of the bounds given are optimal up to constants.
