DotGrid: a .NET-based cross-platform software for desktop grids

Grid infrastructures that have provided wide integrated use of resources are becoming the de-facto computing platform for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering and commerce. In this evolution, desktop grid technologies allow the grid communities to exploit the idle cycles of pervasive desktop PC systems to increase the available computing power. In this paper we present DotGrid, a cross-platform grid software. DotGrid is the first comprehensive desktop grid software utilising Microsoft's .NET Framework in Windows-based environments and MONO .NET in Unix-class operating systems to operate. Using DotGrid services and APIs, grid desktop middleware and applications can be implemented conveniently. We evaluated our DotGrid's performance by implementing a set of grid-based applications.
