Position and Orientation Estimation through Millimeter Wave MIMO in 5G Systems

Millimeter wave signals and large antenna arrays are considered enabling technologies for future 5G networks. While their benefits for achieving high-data rate communications are well-known, their potential advantages for accurate positioning are largely undiscovered. We derive the Cram√©r-Rao bound (CRB) on position and rotation angle estimation uncertainty from millimeter wave signals from a single transmitter, in the presence of scatterers. We also present a novel two-stage algorithm for position and rotation angle estimation that attains the CRB for average to high signal-to-noise ratio. The algorithm is based on multiple measurement vectors matching pursuit for coarse estimation, followed by a refinement stage based on the space-alternating generalized expectation maximization algorithm. We find that accurate position and rotation angle estimation is possible using signals from a single transmitter, in either line-of- sight, non-line-of-sight, or obstructed-line-of-sight conditions.
