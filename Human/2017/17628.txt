Programming from Metaphorisms

This paper presents a study of the metaphorism pattern of relational specification, showing how it can be refined into recursive programs. Metaphorisms express input-output relationships which preserve relevant information while at the same time some intended optimization takes place. Text processing, sorting, representation changers, etc., are examples of metaphorisms. The kind of metaphorism refinement studied in this paper is a strategy known as change of virtual data structure. By framing metaphorisms in the class of (inductive) regular relations, sufficient conditions are given for such implementations to be calculated using relation algebra. The strategy is illustrated with examples including the derivation of the quicksort and mergesort algorithms, showing what they have in common and what makes them different from the very start of development.
