A Software-Defined Multi-Element VLC Architecture

In the modern era of radio frequency (RF) spectrum crunch, visible light communication (VLC) is a recent and promising alternative technology that operates at the visible light spectrum. Thanks to its unlicensed and large bandwidth, VLC can deliver high throughput, better energy efficiency, and low cost data communications. In this article, a hybrid RF/VLC architecture is considered that can simultaneously provide light- ing and communication coverage across a room. Considered architecture involves a novel multi-element hemispherical bulb design, which can transmit multiple data streams over light emitting diode (LED) modules. Simulations considering various VLC transmitter configurations and topologies show that good link quality and high spatial reuse can be maintained in typical indoor communication scenarios.
