Teaching methods are erroneous: approaches which lead to erroneous end-user computing

If spreadsheets are not erroneous then who, or what, is? Research has found that end-users are. If end-users are erroneous then why are they? Research has found that responsibility lies with human beings' fast and slow thinking modes and the inappropriate way they use them. If we are aware of this peculiarity of human thinking, then why do we not teach students how to train their brains? This is the main problem, this is the weakest link in the process: teaching. We have to make teachers realize that end-users are erroneous because of the erroneous teaching approaches to end-user computing. The proportion of fast and slow thinking modes is not constant, and teachers are mistaken when they apply the same proportion in both the teaching and end-user roles. Teachers should believe in the incremental nature of science and have high self-efficacy to make students understand and appreciate science. This is not currently the case in ICT and CS, and it is high time fundamental changes were introduced.
