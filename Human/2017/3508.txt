How does mobility affect the connectivity of interference-limited ad-hoc networks?

One limiting factor to the performance of mobile ad-hoc networks is the amount of interference that is experienced by each node. In this paper we use the Random Waypoint Mobility Model (RWPM) to represent such a network of mobile devices, and show that the connectivity of a receiver at different parts of the network domain varies significantly. This is a result of a large portion of the nodes in the RWPM being located near the centre of the domain resulting in increased levels of interference between neighbouring devices. A non-trivial trade-off therefore exists between the spatial intensity of interfering signals and non-interfering (useful) ones. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive closed form expressions for the spatial distribution of nodes in a rectangle and the connection probability for an interference limited network indicating the impact an inhomogeneous distribution of nodes has on a network's performance. Our novel results can be used to analyse this trade-off and optimize network performance.
