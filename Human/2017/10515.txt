New Lower Bounds on the Generalized Hamming Weights of AG Codes

A sharp upper bound for the maximum integer not belonging to an ideal of a numerical semigroup is given and the ideals attaining this bound are characterized. Then the result is used, through the so-called Feng-Rao numbers, to bound the generalized Hamming weights of algebraic-geometry codes. This is further developed for Hermitian codes and the codes on one of the Garcia-Stichtenoth towers, as well as for some more general families.
