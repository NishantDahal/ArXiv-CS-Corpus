Graph Equivalence Classes for Spectral Projector-Based Graph Fourier Transforms

We define and discuss the utility of two equivalence graph classes over which a spectral projector-based graph Fourier transform is equivalent: isomorphic equivalence classes and Jordan equivalence classes. Isomorphic equivalence classes show that the transform is equivalent up to a permutation on the node labels. Jordan equivalence classes permit identical transforms over graphs of nonidentical topologies and allow a basis-invariant characterization of total variation orderings of the spectral components. Methods to exploit these classes to reduce computation time of the transform as well as limitations are discussed.
