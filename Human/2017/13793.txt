Modification of Symmetric Cryptography with Combining Affine Chiper and Caesar Chiper which Dynamic Nature in Matrix of Chiper Transposition by Applying Flow Pattern in the Planting Rice

Classical cryptography is a way of disguising the news done by the people when there was no computer. The goal is to protect information by way of encoding. This paper describesa modification of classical algorithms to make cryptanalis difficult to steal undisclosed messages. There are three types of classical algorithms that are combined affine chiper, Caesar chiper and chiper transposition. Where for chiperteks affine chiper and Caesar chiper can be looped as much as the initial key, because the result can be varied as much as key value, then affine chiper and Caesar chiper in this case is dynamic. Then the results of the affine and Caesar will be combined in the transposition chiper matrix by applying the pattern of rice cultivation path and for chipertext retrieval by finally applying the pattern of rice planting path. And the final digit of the digit shown in the form of binary digits so that 5 characters can be changed to 80 digit bits are scrambled. Thus the cryptanalyst will be more difficult and takes a very long time to hack information that has been kept secret.
