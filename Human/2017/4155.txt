Deriving Generic Bounds for Time-Series Constraints Based on Regular Expressions Characteristics

We introduce the concept of regular expression characteristics as a unified way to concisely express bounds on time-series constraints. This allows us not only to define time-series constraints in a compositional way, but also to deal with their combinatorial aspect in a compositional way, without developing ad-hoc bounds for each time-series constraint separately.
