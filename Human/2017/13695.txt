A note on X-rays of permutations and a problem of Brualdi and Fritscher

The subject of this note is a challenging conjecture about X-rays of permutations which is a special case of a conjecture regarding Skolem sequences. In relation to this, Brualdi and Fritscher [Linear Algebra and its Applications, 2014] posed the following problem: Determine a bijection between extremal Skolem sets and binary Hankel X-rays of permutation matrices. We give such a bijection, along with some related observations.
