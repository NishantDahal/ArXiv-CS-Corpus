Automatic link extraction: The good, the bad and the ugly in software ecosystem mining

This abstract presents the automatic link extraction pitfalls based on our experience on manually investigating links in the RubyGems package manager metadata. This work can lead in automating the link extraction approach so as to avoid these pitfalls and produce more complete datasets to be used by researchers when they investigate the multi-platform evolution of software ecosystems.
