Implementing $\Diamond P$ with Bounded Messages on a Network of ADD Channels

We present an implementation of the eventually perfect failure detector ($\Diamond P$) from the original hierarchy of the Chandra-Toueg oracles on an arbitrary partitionable network composed of unreliable channels that can lose and reorder messages. Prior implementations of $\Diamond P$ have assumed different partially synchronous models ranging from bounded point-to-point message delay and reliable communication to unbounded message size and known network topologies. We implement $\Diamond P$ under very weak assumptions on an arbitrary, partitionable network composed of Average Delayed/Dropped (ADD) channels to model unreliable communication. Unlike older implementations, our failure detection algorithm uses bounded-sized messages to eventually detect all nodes that are unreachable (crashed or disconnected) from it.
