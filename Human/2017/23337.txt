Evaluation of Handover Exchange Schemes Between Two Cognitive Radio Base Stations with and without Buffers

This article investigates and evaluate a handover exchange scheme between two secondary users (SUs) moving in different directions across the handover region of neighbouring cell in a cognitive radio network. More specifically, this investigation compares the performance of SUs in a cellular cognitive radio network with and without channel exchange systems. The investigation shows reduced handover failure, blocking, forced and access probabilities respectively, for handover exchange scheme with buffer as compared to the other scenario.
