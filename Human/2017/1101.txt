A Comparison of Algorithms for Intrusion Detection on Batch and Data Stream Environments

Intruders detection in computer networks has some deficiencies from machine learning approach, given by the nature of the application. The principal problem is the modest display of detection systems based on learning algorithms under the constraints imposed by real environments. This article focuses on the machine learning approach for network intrusion detection in batch and data stream environments. First, we propose and describe three variants of KDD99 dataset preprocessing including attribute selection. Secondly, a thoroughly experimentation is performed from evaluating and comparing representative batch learning algorithms on the variants obtained from KDD99 pre processing. Finally, since network traffic is a constant data stream, which can present concept drifting with high rate of false positive, along with the fact that there are not many researches addressing intrusion detection on streaming environments, lead us to make a comparison of various representative data stream classification algorithms. This research allows determining the algorithms that better perform on the proposed variants of KDD99 for both batch and data stream environments.
