A Fair Individual Rate Comparison between MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA

In this paper, we compare the individual rate of MIMO-NOMA and MIMO-OMA when users are paired into clusters. A power allocation (PA) strategy is proposed, which ensures that MIMO-NOMA achieves a higher individual rate for each user than MIMO-OMA with arbitrary PA and optimal degrees of freedom split. In addition, a special case with equal degrees of freedom and arbitrary PA for OMA is considered, for which the individual rate superiority of NOMA still holds. Moreover, it is shown that NOMA can attain better fairness through appropriate PA. Finally, simulations are carried out, which validate the developed analytical results.
