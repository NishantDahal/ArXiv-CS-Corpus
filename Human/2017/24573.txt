Limitation of SDMA in Ultra-Dense Small Cell Networks

Benefitting from multi-user gain brought by multi-antenna techniques, space division multiple access (SDMA) is capable of significantly enhancing spatial throughput (ST) in wireless networks. Nevertheless, we show in this letter that, even when SDMA is applied, ST would diminish to be zero in ultra-dense networks (UDN), where small cell base stations (BSs) are fully densified. More importantly, we compare the performance of SDMA, single-user beamforming (SU-BF) (one user is served in each cell) and full SDMA (the number of served users equals the number of equipped antennas). Surprisingly, it is shown that SU-BF achieves the highest ST and critical density, beyond which ST starts to degrade, in UDN. The results in this work could shed light on the fundamental limitation of SDMA in UDN.
