Communicating Correlated Sources Over an Interference Channel

A new coding technique, based on \textit{fixed block-length} codes, is proposed for the problem of communicating a pair of correlated sources over a $2-$user interference channel. Its performance is analyzed to derive a new set of sufficient conditions. The latter is proven to be strictly less binding than the current known best, which is due to Liu and Chen [Dec, 2011]. Our findings are inspired by Dueck's example [March, 1981].
