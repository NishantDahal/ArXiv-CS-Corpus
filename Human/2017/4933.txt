Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Methods for Modalities

Methods for Modalities is a series aimed at bringing together researchers  interested in developing proof methods, verification methods, algorithms and tools based on modal logic. Here the term "modal logics" is conceived broadly, including description logic, guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, dynamic logic, etc. The first workshop was held in May 1999 in Amsterdam, and since then it has travelled the world. Please see https://cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~careces/M4M  for information on past editions of M4M.
  The 9th Methods for Modalities Workshop is being held at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, from January 8 to 10, 2017, co-located with the Indian Conference on Logic and its Applications (ICLA), January 5 to 7, 2017. For details, see https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/icla/M4M/
  This volume constitutes the proceedings of the workshop and given the substantial instructional content, should be of interest especially to young researchers and students looking for tools and techniques as well as exciting problems related to logics and computation.
