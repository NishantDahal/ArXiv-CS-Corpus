Entanglement-assisted capacities of compound quantum channels

We study universal quantum codes for entanglement-assisted quantum communication over compound quantum channels. In this setting, sender and receiver do not know the specific channel that will be used for communication, but only know the set that the channel is selected from. We investigate different variations of the problem: uninformed users, informed receiver, informed sender, and feedback assistance. We derive single-letter formulas for all corresponding channel capacities. Our proofs are based on one-shot decoupling bounds and properties of smooth entropies.
