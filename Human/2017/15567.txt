SigViewer: Visualizing Multimodal Signals Stored in XDF (Extensible Data Format) Files

Multimodal biosignal acquisition is facilitated by recently introduced software solutions such as LabStreaming Layer (LSL) and its associated data format XDF (Extensible Data Format). However, there are no stand-alone applications that can visualize multimodal time series stored in XDF files. We extended SigViewer, an open source cross-platform Qt C++ application with the capability of loading, resampling, annotating, and visualizing signals stored in XDF files and successfully applied the tool for post-hoc visual verification of the accuracy of a system that aims to predict the phase of alpha oscillations within the electroencephalogram in real-time.
