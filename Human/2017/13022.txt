Language Approximation With One-Counter Automata

We present a method for approximating context-free languages with one-counter automata. This approximation allows the reconstruction of parse trees of the original grammar. We identify a decidable superset of regular languages whose elements, i.e. languages, are recognized by one-counter automata.
