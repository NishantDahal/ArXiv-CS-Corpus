An Equivalence Between Secure Network and Index Coding

We extend the equivalence between network coding and index coding by Effros, El Rouayheb, and Langberg to the secure communication setting in the presence of an eavesdropper. Specifically, we show that the most general versions of secure network-coding setup by Chan and Grant and the secure index-coding setup by Dau, Skachek, and Chee, which also include the randomised encoding setting, are equivalent.
