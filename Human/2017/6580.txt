Communication Modalities for Supervised Teleoperation in Highly Dexterous Tasks - Does one size fit all?

This study tries to explain the connection between communication modalities and levels of supervision in teleoperation during a dexterous task, like surgery. This concept is applied to two surgical related tasks: incision and peg transfer. It was found that as the complexity of the task escalates, the combination linking human supervision with a more expressive modality shows better performance than other combinations of modalities and control. More specifically, in the peg transfer task, the combination of speech modality and action level supervision achieves shorter task completion time (77.1 +- 3.4 s) with fewer mistakes (0.20 +- 0.17 pegs dropped).
