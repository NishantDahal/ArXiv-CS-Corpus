The conjugacy problem in free solvable groups and wreath product of abelian groups is in TC$^0$

We show that the conjugacy problem in a wreath product $A \wr B$ is uniform-$\mathsf{TC}^0$-Turing-reducible to the conjugacy problem in the factors $A$ and $B$ and the power problem in $B$. If $B$ is torsion free, the power problem for $B$ can be replaced by the slightly weaker cyclic submonoid membership problem for $B$. Moreover, if $A$ is abelian, the cyclic subgroup membership problem suffices, which itself is uniform-$\mathsf{AC}^0$-many-one-reducible to the conjugacy problem in $A \wr B$.
  Furthermore, under certain natural conditions, we give a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ Turing reduction from the power problem in $A \wr B$ to the power problems of $A$ and $B$. Together with our first result, this yields a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ solution to the conjugacy problem in iterated wreath products of abelian groups - and, by the Magnus embedding, also in free solvable groups.
