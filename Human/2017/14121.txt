Outage Probability of Power-based Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) on the Uplink of a 5G Cell

This letter puts forth an analytical approach to evaluate the outage probability of power-based NOMA on the uplink of a 5G cell, the outage being defined as the event where the receiver fails to successfully decode all the simultaneously received signals. In the examined scenario, Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is considered and an arbitrary number of superimposed signals is present. For the Rayleigh fading case, the outage probability is provided in closed-form, clearly outlining its dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio of the users that are simultaneously transmitting, as well as on their distance from the receiver.
