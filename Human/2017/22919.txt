Optimal Tuning of Two-Dimensional Keyboards

We give a new analysis of a tuning problem in music theory, pertaining specifically to the approximation of harmonics on a two-dimensional keyboard. We formulate the question as a linear programming problem on families of constraints and provide exact solutions for many new keyboard dimensions. We also show that an optimal tuning for harmonic approximation can be obtained for any keyboard of given width, provided sufficiently many rows of octaves.
