Scene Flow Estimation: A Survey

This paper is the first to review the scene flow estimation field, which analyzes and compares methods, technical challenges, evaluation methodologies and performance of scene flow estimation. Existing algorithms are categorized in terms of scene representation, data source, and calculation scheme, and the pros and cons in each category are compared briefly. The datasets and evaluation protocols are enumerated, and the performance of the most representative methods is presented. A future vision is illustrated with few questions arisen for discussion. This survey presents a general introduction and analysis of scene flow estimation.
