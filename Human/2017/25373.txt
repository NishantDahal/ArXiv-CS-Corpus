Computational Properties of Slime Trail

We investigate the combinatorial game Slime Trail.This game is played on a graph with a starting piece in a node. Each player's objective is to reach one of their own goal nodes. Every turn the current player moves the piece and deletes the node they came from. We show that the game is PSPACE-complete when played on a planar graph.
