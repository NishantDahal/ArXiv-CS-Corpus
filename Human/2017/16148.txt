Asymmetric Quantum Codes on Toric Surfaces

Asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes are quantum codes defined over biased quantum channels: qubit-flip and phase-shift errors may have equal or different probabilities. The code construction is the Calderbank-Shor-Steane construction based on two linear codes.
  We present families of toric surfaces, toric codes and associated asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes.
