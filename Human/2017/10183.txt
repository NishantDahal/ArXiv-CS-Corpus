Decoupled limbs yield differentiable trajectory outcomes through intermittent contact in locomotion and manipulation

When limbs are decoupled, we find that trajectory outcomes in mechanical systems subject to unilateral constraints vary differentiably with respect to initial conditions, even as the contact mode sequence varies.
