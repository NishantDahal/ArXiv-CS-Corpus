PWCT: Visual Language for IoT and Cloud Computing Applications and Systems

Developing IoT, Data Computing and Cloud Computing software requires different programming skills and different programming languages. This cause a problem for many companies and researchers that need to hires many programmers to develop a complete solution. The problem is related directly to the financial cost and the development time which are very important factors to many research projects. In this paper we present and propose the PWCT visual programming tool for developing IoT, Data Computing and Cloud Computing Applications and Systems without writing textual code directly. Using PWCT increase productivity and provide researchers with one visual programming tool to develop different solutions.
