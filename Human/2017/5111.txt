On a User-Centric Base Station Cooperation Scheme for Reliable Communications

In this paper, we describe CoMP2flex, a user-centric base station (BS) cooperation scheme that provides improvements in reliability of both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) communications of wireless cellular networks. CoMP2flex supports not only cooperation of two BSs with same direction of traffic but also cooperation of two BSs serving bidirectional traffic. The reliability performance of CoMP2flex is shown with numerical simulations and analytical expressions. We quantify and numerically validate the performance of the greedy BS pairing algorithm by comparing maximum weight matching methods, implemented as the Edmonds matching algorithm for weighted graphs.
