Comparison of SMT and RBMT; The Requirement of Hybridization for Marathi-Hindi MT

We present in this paper our work on comparison between Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Rule-based machine translation for translation from Marathi to Hindi. Rule Based systems although robust take lots of time to build. On the other hand statistical machine translation systems are easier to create, maintain and improve upon. We describe the development of a basic Marathi-Hindi SMT system and evaluate its performance. Through a detailed error analysis, we, point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of both systems. Effectively, we shall see that even with a small amount of training corpus a statistical machine translation system has many advantages for high quality domain specific machine translation over that of a rule-based counterpart.
