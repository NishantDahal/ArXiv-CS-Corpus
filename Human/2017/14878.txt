Explicit Polyhedral Bounds on Network Coding Rate Regions via Entropy Function Region: Algorithms, Symmetry, and Computation

Automating the solutions of multiple network information theory problems, stretching from fundamental concerns such as determining all information inequalities and the limitations of linear codes, to applied ones such as designing coded networks, distributed storage systems, and caching systems, can be posed as polyhedral projections. These problems are demonstrated to exhibit multiple types of polyhedral symmetries. It is shown how these symmetries can be exploited to reduce the complexity of solving these problems through polyhedral projection.
