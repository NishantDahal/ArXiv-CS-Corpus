Internet of Things Security Research: A Rehash of Old Ideas or New Intellectual Challenges?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new computing paradigm that spans wearable devices, homes, hospitals, cities, transportation, and critical infrastructure. Building security into this new computing paradigm is a major technical challenge today. However, what are the security problems in IoT that we can solve using existing security principles? And, what are the new problems and challenges in this space that require new security mechanisms? This article summarizes the intellectual similarities and differences between classic information technology security research and IoT security research.
