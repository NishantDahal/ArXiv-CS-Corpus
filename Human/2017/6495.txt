Proposal of Vital Data Analysis Platform using Wearable Sensor

In this paper, we propose a vital data analysis platform which resolves existing problems to utilize vital data for real-time actions. Recently, IoT technologies have been progressed but in the healthcare area, real-time actions based on analyzed vital data are not considered sufficiently yet. The causes are proper use of analyzing methods of stream / micro batch processing and network cost. To resolve existing problems, we propose our vital data analysis platform. Our platform collects vital data of Electrocardiograph and acceleration using an example of wearable vital sensor and analyzes them to extract posture, fatigue and relaxation in smart phones or cloud. Our platform can show analyzed dangerous posture or fatigue level change. We implemented the platform. And we are now preparing a field test.
