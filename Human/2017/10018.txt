Generalized Index Coding Problem and Discrete Polymatroids

The index coding problem has been generalized recently to accommodate receivers which demand functions of messages and which possess functions of messages. The connections between index coding and matroid theory have been well studied in the recent past. Index coding solutions were first connected to multi linear representation of matroids. For vector linear index codes discrete polymatroids which can be viewed as a generalization of the matroids was used. It was shown that a vector linear solution to an index coding problem exists if and only if there exists a representable discrete polymatroid satisfying certain conditions. In this work we explore the connections between generalized index coding and discrete polymatroids. The conditions that needs to be satisfied by a representable discrete polymatroid for a generalized index coding problem to have a vector linear solution is established. From a discrete polymatroid we construct an index coding problem with coded side information and shows that if the index coding problem has a certain optimal length solution then the discrete polymatroid satisfies certain properties. From a matroid we construct a similar generalized index coding problem and shows that the index coding problem has a binary scalar linear solution of optimal length if and only if the matroid is binary representable.
