Towards a disaster response system based on cognitive radio ad hoc networks

This paper presents an approach towards disaster management based on cognitive radio ad hoc network. Despite the growing interests on cognitive radio ad hoc networks, not much work has been reported on using them for disaster management. This paper discusses opportunities for disaster management based on cognitive radio ad hoc networks. In this direction, the paper presents a novel technique for disaster detection based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN is trained using backward propagation algorithm. An ANN-based spectrum sensing scheme is also presented. Finally, a service discovery scheme is presented for coordination during the time of disaster. The simulation of proposed approach has been performed in NS-2 simulator. The proposed approach shows very low false negative alarm rate using the proposed disaster detection system. The spectrum switching time of spectrum sensing scheme is also analyzed along with an analysis of latency of proposed service discovery scheme
