OpenFlow-compliant Topology Management for SDN-enabled Information Centric Networks

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged as an interesting approach to overcome many of the limitations of legacy IP-based networks. However, the drastic changes to legacy infrastructure required to realise an ICN have significantly hindered its adoption by network operators. As a result, alternative deployment strategies are investigated, with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) arising as a solution compatible with legacy infrastructure, thus opening new possibilities for integrating ICN concepts in operators' networks. This paper discusses the seamless integration of these two architectural paradigms and suggests a scalable and dynamic network topology bootstrapping and management framework to deploy and operate ICN topologies over SDN-enabled operator networks. We describe the designed protocol and supporting mechanisms, as well as the minimum required implementation to realize this inter-operability. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented to validate the feasibility of the approach. Results show that topology bootstrapping time is not significantly affected by the topology size, substantially facilitating the intelligent management of an ICN-enabled network.
