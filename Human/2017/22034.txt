IoT based Platform as a Service for Provisioning of Concurrent Applications

The modern era has seen a speedy growth in the Internet of Things (IoT). As per statistics of 2020, twenty billion devices will be connected to the Internet. This massive increase in Internet connected devices will lead to a lot of efforts to execute critical concurrent applications such fire detection, health care based system, disaster management, high energy physics, automobiles, and medical imaging efficiently. To fasten the emergence of novel applications, this vast infrastructure requires "Platform as a Service(PaaS)" model to leverage IoT things. As a single global standard for all device types and IoT-based application domain is impracticable, we propose an IoT-based Cloud to leverage PaaS model in this paper. This model can host the concurrent application for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The proposed model offers the communication interface among processes by uniquely allocating network interface to a particular container.
