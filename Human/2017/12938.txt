Towards a new Framework linking knowledge management systems and organizational agility : an empirical study

The amount of data has exploded over the last ten years. Data is captured and shared from personal devices, transactional operations, sensors, social media and other sources. Firms should, thus, be able to explore the new opportunities and rapidly seize them by developing the corresponding capabilities. In our work, we focus on two emerging dynamic capabilities: Absorptive capacity and organizational agility. We propose a new theoretical Framework based on the previous literature linking the use of knowledge management systems and organizational agility by highlighting the mediating role of absorptive capacity. In addition, we carried out an empirical study based on a survey to support and validate the proposed Framework. The main findings of this study are presented.
