Systematic Mapping Protocol: The impact of using software patterns during requirements engineering activities in real-world settings

This document details the planning phase of a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS). Our goal is to identify the software patterns used during the RE phase, in real-world setting (i.e., in real projects), not in academia (toy projects) and, to understand the impact of their application, in terms of different characteristics, pertaining to the development process as well as the final product. Through a review of the literature published until January 2017, we will investigate what the research community has reported on the application of patterns in the industrial context, the data supporting these claims, the specific patterns employed, the RE activities, the results (positive or negative) and the metrics used to validate these results.
