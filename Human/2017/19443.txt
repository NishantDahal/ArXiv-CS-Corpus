Anisotropic-Scale Junction Detection and Matching for Indoor Images

Junctions play an important role in the characterization of local geometric structures in images, the detection of which is a longstanding and challenging task. Existing junction detectors usually focus on identifying the junction locations and the orientations of the junction branches while ignoring their scales; however, these scales also contain rich geometric information. This paper presents a novel approach to junction detection and characterization that exploits the locally anisotropic geometries of a junction and estimates the scales of these geometries using an \emph{a contrario} model. The output junctions have anisotropic scales --- i.e., each branch of a junction is associated with an independent scale parameter --- and are thus termed anisotropic-scale junctions (ASJs). We then apply the newly detected ASJs for the matching of indoor images, in which there may be dramatic changes in viewpoint and the detected local visual features, e.g., key-points, are usually insufficiently distinctive. We propose to use the anisotropic geometries of our junctions to improve the matching precision for indoor images. Matching results obtained on sets of indoor images demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor image matching.
