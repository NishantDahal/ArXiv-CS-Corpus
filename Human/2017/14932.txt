An algorithm for 3-SAT problems

This paper presents an algorithm for 3-SAT problems. First, logical formulas are transformed into elementary algebraic formulas. Second, complex trigonometric functions are assigned to the variables in the elementary algebraic formulas, and the sums of the formulas are calculated. The algorithm outputs the number of satisfying assignments. The computational complexity of the algorithm is probably polynomial.
