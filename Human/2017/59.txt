Contraction of Cyclic Codes Over Finite Chain Rings

Let $\texttt{R}$ be a commutative finite chain ring of invariants $(q,s)$ and $Γ(\texttt{R})$ the Teichmüller's set of $\texttt{R}.$ In this paper, the trace representation cyclic $\texttt{R}$-linear codes of length $\ell,$ is presented, when $\texttt{gcd}(\ell, q) = 1.$ We will show that the contractions of some cyclic $\texttt{R}$-linear codes of length $u\ell$ are $γ$-constacyclic $\texttt{R}$-linear codes of length $\ell,$ where $γ\inΓ(\texttt{R})$ and the multiplicative order of is $u.$
