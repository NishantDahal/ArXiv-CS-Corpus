Energy Efficient Scheduling for Loss Tolerant IoT Applications with Uninformed Transmitter

In this work we investigate energy efficient packet scheduling problem for the loss tolerant applications. We consider slow fading channel for a point to point connection with no channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT). In the absence of CSIT, the slow fading channel has an outage probability associated with every transmit power. As a function of data loss tolerance parameters and peak power constraints, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the average transmit energy for the user equipment (UE). The optimization problem is not convex and we use stochastic optimization technique to solve the problem. The numerical results quantify the effect of different system parameters on average transmit power and show significant power savings for the loss tolerant applications.
