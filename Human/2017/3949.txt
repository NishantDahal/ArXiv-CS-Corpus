The Emergence of Crowdsourcing among Pokémon Go Players

Since its launching, Pok{é}mon Go has been pointed as the largest gaming phenomenon of the smartphone age. As the game requires the user to walk in the real world to see and capture Pok{é}mons, a new wave of crowdsourcing apps have emerged to allow users to collaborate with each other, sharing where and when Pok{é}mons were found. In this paper we characterize one of such initiatives, called PokeCrew. Our analyses uncover a set of aspects of user behavior and system usage in such emerging crowdsourcing task, helping unveil some problems and benefits. We hope our effort can inspire the design of new crowdsourcing systems.
