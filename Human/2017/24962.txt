Intel SGX Enabled Key Manager Service with OpenStack Barbican

Protecting data in the cloud continues to gain in importance, with encryption being used to achieve the desired data protection. While there is desire to use encryption, various cloud components do not want to deal with key management, which points to a strong need for a separate key management system. OpenStack Barbican is a platform developed by the OpenStack community aimed at providing cryptographic functions useful for all environments, including large ephemeral clouds. Barbican exposes REST APIs designed for the secure storage, provisioning and management of secrets such as passwords, encryption keys, and X.509 certificates, and supports plugins for a variety of crypto solutions in the backend. Crypto plugins store secrets as encrypted blobs within the Barbican database. Software based crypto plugins offer a scalable solution, but are vulnerable to system software attacks. Hardware Security Module or HSM plugins offer strong security guarantees, but they are expensive and don't scale well. We propose to build an Intel Software Guard Extension or SGX based software crypto plugin that offers security similar to an HSM with the low cost and scalability of a software based solution. We extend OpenStack Barbican API to support attestation of an Intel SGX crypto plugin, to allow clients higher confidence in the software they are using for storing keys. In addition, the API provides support for mutual attestation for Intel SGX enabled clients, multi-user key distribution, and extensions for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the backend database.
