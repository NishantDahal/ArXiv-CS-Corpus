Mobility and Popularity-Aware Coded Small-Cell Caching

In heterogeneous cellular networks with caching capability, due to mobility of users and storage constraints of small-cell base stations (SBSs), users may not be able to download all of their requested content from the SBSs within the delay deadline of the content. In that case, the users are directed to the macro-cell base station (MBS) in order to satisfy the service quality requirement. Coded caching is exploited here to minimize the amount of data downloaded from the MBS taking into account the mobility of the users as well as the popularity of the contents. An optimal distributed caching policy is presented when the delay deadline is below a certain threshold, and a distributed greedy caching policy is proposed when the delay deadline is relaxed.
