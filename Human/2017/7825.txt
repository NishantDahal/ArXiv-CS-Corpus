Bent functions and line ovals

In this paper we study those bent functions which are linear on elements of spreads, their connections with ovals and line ovals, and we give descriptions of their dual bent functions. In particular, we give a geometric characterization of Niho bent functions and of their duals, we give explicit formula for the dual bent function and present direct connections with ovals and line ovals. We also show that bent functions which are linear on elements of inequivalent spreads can be EA-equivalent.
