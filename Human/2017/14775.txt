Reweighted Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition based on t-SVD and its Applications in Video Denoising

The t-SVD based Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) decomposes low rank multi-linear signal corrupted by gross errors into low multi-rank and sparse component by simultaneously minimizing tensor nuclear norm and l 1 norm. But if the multi-rank of the signal is considerably large and/or large amount of noise is present, the performance of TRPCA deteriorates. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a new efficient iterative reweighted tensor decomposition scheme based on t-SVD which significantly improves tensor multi-rank in TRPCA. Further, the sparse component of the tensor is also recovered by reweighted l 1 norm which enhances the accuracy of decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is established by applying it to the video denoising problem and the experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms its counterparts.
