Quantum key distribution protocol with pseudorandom bases

Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a way for establishing information-theoretically secure communications. An important part of QKD technology is a high-quality random number generator (RNG) for quantum states preparation and for post-processing procedures. In the present work, we consider a novel class of prepare-and-measure QKD protocols, utilizing additional pseudorandomness in the preparation of quantum states. We study one of such protocols and analyze its security against the intercept-resend attack. We demonstrate that, for single-photon sources, the considered protocol gives better secret key rates than the BB84 and the asymmetric BB84 protocol. However, the protocol strongly requires single-photon sources.
