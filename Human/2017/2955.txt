Rethinking Information Sharing for Actionable Threat Intelligence

In the past decade, the information security and threat landscape has grown significantly making it difficult for a single defender to defend against all attacks at the same time. This called for introduc- ing information sharing, a paradigm in which threat indicators are shared in a community of trust to facilitate defenses. Standards for representation, exchange, and consumption of indicators are pro- posed in the literature, although various issues are undermined. In this paper, we rethink information sharing for actionable intelli- gence, by highlighting various issues that deserve further explo- ration. We argue that information sharing can benefit from well- defined use models, threat models, well-understood risk by mea- surement and robust scoring, well-understood and preserved pri- vacy and quality of indicators and robust mechanism to avoid free riding behavior of selfish agent. We call for using the differential nature of data and community structures for optimizing sharing.
