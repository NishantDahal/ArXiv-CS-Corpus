Storage and Caching: Synthesis of Flow-based Microfluidic Biochips

Flow-based microfluidic biochips are widely used in lab- on-a-chip experiments. In these chips, devices such as mixers and detectors connected by micro-channels execute specific operations. Intermediate fluid samples are saved in storage temporarily until target devices become avail- able. However, if the storage unit does not have enough capacity, fluid samples must wait in devices, reducing their efficiency and thus increasing the overall execution time. Consequently, storage and caching of fluid samples in such microfluidic chips must be considered during synthesis to balance execution efficiency and chip area.
