Exact Approach for Survivable Regenerator Placement in Translucent WDM Networks

Most studies addressing translucent network design targeted a trade-off between minimizing the number of deployed regenerators and minimizing the number of regeneration sites. The latter highly depends on the carrier's strategy and is motivated by various considerations such as power consumption, maintenance and supervision costs. However, concentrating regenerators into a small number of nodes exposes the network to a high risk of data losses in the eventual case of regenerator pool failure. In this paper, we address the problem of survivable translucent network design taking into account the simultaneous effect of four transmission impairments. We propose an exact approach based on a mathematical formulation to solve the problem of regenerator placement while ensuring the network survivability in the hazardous event of a regenerator pool failure. For this purpose, for each accepted request requiring regeneration, the network management plane computes in advance several routing paths along with associated valid wavelengths going through different regeneration sites. In doing so, we target to implement an M : N shared regenerator pool protection scheme. Simulation results highlight the gain obtained by reducing the number of regeneration sites without sacrificing network survivability.
