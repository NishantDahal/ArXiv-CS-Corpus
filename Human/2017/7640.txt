Optimal Design of Energy and Spectral Efficiency Tradeoff in One-Bit Massive MIMO Systems

This paper considers a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system equipped with a base station (BS) that uses one-bit quantization and investigates the energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) trade-off. We first propose a new precoding scheme and downlink power allocation strategy that results in uplink-downlink SINR duality for one-bit MIMO systems. Taking into account the effect of the imperfect channel state information, we obtain approximate closed-form expressions for the uplink and downlink achievable rates under duality with maximum ratio combining/matched-filter and zero-forcing processing. We then focus on joint optimization of the competing SE and EE objectives over the number of users, pilot training duration and operating power, using the weighted product method to obtain the EE/SE Pareto boundary. Numerical results are presented to verify our analytical resultsand demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between EE and SE for different parameter settings.
