Locality Sim: Cloud Simulator with Data Locality

Cloud Computing (CC) is a model for enabling on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. Testing and evaluating the performance of the cloud environment for allocating, provisioning, scheduling, and data allocation policy have great attention to be achieved. Therefore, using cloud simulator would save time and money, and provide a flexible environment to evaluate new research work. Unfortunately, the current simulators (e.g., CloudSim, NetworkCloudSim, GreenCloud, etc..) deal with the data as for size only without any consideration about the data allocation policy and locality. On the other hand, the NetworkCloudSim simulator is considered one of the most common used simulators because it includes different modules which support needed functions to a simulated cloud environment, and it could be extended to include new extra modules. According to work in this paper, the NetworkCloudSim simulator has been extended and modified to support data locality. The modified simulator is called LocalitySim. The accuracy of the proposed LocalitySim simulator has been proved by building a mathematical model. Also, the proposed simulator has been used to test the performance of the three-tire data center as a case study with considering the data locality feature.
