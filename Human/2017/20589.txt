Hierarchical semantic segmentation using modular convolutional neural networks

Image recognition tasks that involve identifying parts of an object or the contents of a vessel can be viewed as a hierarchical problem, which can be solved by initial recognition of the main object, followed by recognition of its parts or contents. To achieve such modular recognition, it is necessary to use the output of one recognition method (which identifies the general object) as the input for a second method (which identifies the parts or contents). In recent years, convolutional neural networks have emerged as the dominant method for segmentation and classification of images. This work examines a method for serially connecting convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of materials inside transparent vessels. It applies one fully convolutional neural net to segment the image into vessel and background, and the vessel region is used as an input for a second net which recognizes the contents of the glass vessel. Transferring the segmentation map generated by the first nets to the second net was performed using the valve filter attention method that involves using different filters on different segments of the image. This modular semantic segmentation method outperforms a single step method in which both the vessel and its contents are identified using a single net. An advantage of the modular neural net is that it allows networks to be built from existing trained modules, as well the transfer and reuse of trained net modules without the need for any retraining of the assembled net.
