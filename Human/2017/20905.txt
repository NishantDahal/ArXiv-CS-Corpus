Complexity of Detectability, Opacity and A-Diagnosability for Modular Discrete Event Systems

We study the complexity of deciding whether a modular discrete event system is detectable (resp. opaque, A-diagnosable). Detectability arises in the state estimation of discrete event systems, opacity is related to the privacy and security analysis, and A-diagnosability appears in the fault diagnosis of stochastic discrete event systems. Previously, deciding weak detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) for monolithic systems was shown to be PSPACE-complete. In this paper, we study the complexity of deciding weak detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) for modular systems. We show that the complexities of these problems are significantly worse than in the monolithic case. Namely, we show that deciding modular weak detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) is EXPSPACE-complete. We further discuss a special case where all unobservable events are private, and show that in this case the problems are PSPACE-complete. Consequently, if the systems are all fully observable, then deciding weak detectability (opacity) for modular systems is PSPACE-complete.
