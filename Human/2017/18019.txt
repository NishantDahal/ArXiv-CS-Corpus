Dopamine modulation via memristive schematic

In this technical report we present novel results of the dopamine neuromodulation inspired modulation of a polyaniline (PANI) memristive device excitatory learning STDP. Results presented in this work are of two experiments setup computer simulation and physical prototype experiments. We present physical prototype of inhibitory learning or iSTDP as well as the results of iSTDP learning.
