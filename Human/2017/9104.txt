Benchmark for Complex Answer Retrieval

Retrieving paragraphs to populate a Wikipedia article is a challenging task. The new TREC Complex Answer Retrieval (TREC CAR) track introduces a comprehensive dataset that targets this retrieval scenario. We present early results from a variety of approaches -- from standard information retrieval methods (e.g., tf-idf) to complex systems that using query expansion using knowledge bases and deep neural networks. The goal is to offer future participants of this track an overview of some promising approaches to tackle this problem.
