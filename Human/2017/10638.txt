Cache-enabled Wireless Networks with Opportunistic Interference Alignment

Both caching and interference alignment (IA) are promising techniques for future wireless networks. Nevertheless, most of existing works on cache-enabled IA wireless networks assume that the channel is invariant, which is unrealistic considering the time-varying nature of practical wireless environments. In this paper, we consider realistic time-varying channels. Specifically, the channel is formulated as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). The complexity of the system is very high when we consider realistic FSMC models. Therefore, we propose a novel big data reinforcement learning approach in this paper. Deep reinforcement learning is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that uses deep $Q$ network to approximate the $Q$ value-action function. Deep reinforcement learning is used in this paper to obtain the optimal IA user selection policy in cache-enabled opportunistic IA wireless networks. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
