Classification of graphs based on homotopy equivalence. Homotopy equivalent graphs. Basic graphs and complexity of homotopy equivalence classes of graphs

Graph classification plays an important role is data mining, and various methods have been developed recently for classifying graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel method for graph classification that is based on homotopy equivalence of graphs. Graphs are called homotopy equivalent if one of them can be converted to the other one by contractible transformations. A basic graph and the complexity of a homotopy equivalence class are defined and investigated. It is shown all graphs belonging to a given homotopy equivalence class have similar topological properties and are represented by a basic graph with the minimal number of points and edges. Diagrams are given of basic graphs with the complexity N<7. The advantage of this classification is that it relies on computer experiments demonstrating a close connection between homotopy equivalent topological spaces and homotopy equivalent graphs.
