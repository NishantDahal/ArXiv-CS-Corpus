Distributed System for Remote Monitoring and Control Greenhouse Environment

This article treats the issue of remote monitoring and control of greenhouse environment through a distributed system that interconnects several subsystems. Thus, a wireless data acquisition subsystem, a fully automated subsystem made of PLCs and industrial communication networks and an irrigation subsystem consists of two water tanks, sensors and actuators are interconnected. According to data provided by sensors, the automatic control subsystem decides whether the irrigation cycle of plants should be performed. In this case, it provides corresponding commands to irrigation subsystem. Moreover, two graphical interfaces (eKo-View and eKo-GreenHouse) are added of the process and presented in detail in this paper.
