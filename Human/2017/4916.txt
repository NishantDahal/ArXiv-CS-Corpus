Radial and circular synchronization clusters in extended starlike network of van der Pol oscillators

We consider extended starlike networks where the hub node is coupled with several chains of nodes representing star rays. Assuming that nodes of the network are occupied by nonidentical self-oscillators we study various forms of their cluster synchronization. Radial cluster emerges when the nodes are synchronized along a ray, while circular cluster is formed by nodes without immediate connections but located on identical distances to the hub. By its nature the circular synchronization is a new manifestation of so called remote synchronization [Phys. Rev. E 85 (2012), 026208]. We report its long-range form when the synchronized nodes interact through at least three intermediate nodes. Forms of long-range remote synchronization are elements of scenario of transition to the total synchronization of the network. We observe that the far ends of rays synchronize first. Then more circular clusters appear involving closer to hub nodes. Subsequently the clusters merge and, finally, all network become synchronous. Behavior of the extended starlike networks is found to be strongly determined by the ray length, while varying the number of rays basically affects fine details of a dynamical picture. Symmetry of the star also extensively influences the dynamics. In an asymmetric star circular cluster mainly vanish in favor of radial ones, however, long-range remote synchronization survives.
