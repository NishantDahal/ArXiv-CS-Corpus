Problemas com modelagem algébrica: três exemplos para semestres iniciais

This paper describes three programming problems that are simple enough to be used in the beginning of a CS undergraduate program but also interesting enough to be worth exploring with different approaches. We are able to apply a mixture of programming practices, abstraction and algebraic approaches to the problems, so that these subjects may be presented as complementary and allowing for clear and elegant solutions.
