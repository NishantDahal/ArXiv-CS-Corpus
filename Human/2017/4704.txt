Segmenting Dermoscopic Images

We propose an automatic algorithm, named SDI, for the segmentation of skin lesions in dermoscopic images, articulated into three main steps: selection of the image ROI, selection of the segmentation band, and segmentation. We present extensive experimental results achieved by the SDI algorithm on the lesion segmentation dataset made available for the ISIC 2017 challenge on Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection, highlighting its advantages and disadvantages.
