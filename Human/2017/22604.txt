Zero-shot Learning via Shared-Reconstruction-Graph Pursuit

Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects from novel unseen classes without any training data. Recently, structure-transfer based methods are proposed to implement ZSL by transferring structural knowledge from the semantic embedding space to image feature space to classify testing images. However, we observe that such a knowledge transfer framework may suffer from the problem of the geometric inconsistency between the data in the training and testing spaces. We call this problem as the space shift problem. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based method to alleviate this space shift problem. Specifically, a Shared Reconstruction Graph (SRG) is pursued to capture the common structure of data in the two spaces. With the learned SRG, each unseen class prototype (cluster center) in the image feature space can be synthesized by the linear combination of other class prototypes, so that testing instances can be classified based on the distance to these synthesized prototypes. The SRG bridges the image feature space and semantic embedding space. By applying spectral clustering on the learned SRG, many meaningful clusters can be discovered, which interprets ZSL performance on the datasets. Our method can be easily extended to the generalized zero-shot learning setting. Experiments on three popular datasets show that our method outperforms other methods on all datasets. Even with a small number of training samples, our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.
