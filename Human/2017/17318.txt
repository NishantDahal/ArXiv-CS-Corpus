Differentially Private Ordinary Least Squares

Linear regression is one of the most prevalent techniques in machine learning, however, it is also common to use linear regression for its \emph{explanatory} capabilities rather than label prediction. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is often used in statistics to establish a correlation between an attribute (e.g. gender) and a label (e.g. income) in the presence of other (potentially correlated) features. OLS assumes a particular model that randomly generates the data, and derives \emph{$t$-values} --- representing the likelihood of each real value to be the true correlation. Using $t$-values, OLS can release a \emph{confidence interval}, which is an interval on the reals that is likely to contain the true correlation, and when this interval does not intersect the origin, we can \emph{reject the null hypothesis} as it is likely that the true correlation is non-zero. Our work aims at achieving similar guarantees on data under differentially private estimators. First, we show that for well-spread data, the Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (JLT) gives a very good approximation of $t$-values, secondly, when JLT approximates Ridge regression (linear regression with $l_2$-regularization) we derive, under certain conditions, confidence intervals using the projected data, lastly, we derive, under different conditions, confidence intervals for the "Analyze Gauss" algorithm (Dwork et al, STOC 2014).
