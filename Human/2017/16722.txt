SaltiNet: Scan-path Prediction on 360 Degree Images using Saliency Volumes

We introduce SaltiNet, a deep neural network for scanpath prediction trained on 360-degree images. The model is based on a temporal-aware novel representation of saliency information named the saliency volume. The first part of the network consists of a model trained to generate saliency volumes, whose parameters are fit by back-propagation computed from a binary cross entropy (BCE) loss over downsampled versions of the saliency volumes. Sampling strategies over these volumes are used to generate scanpaths over the 360-degree images. Our experiments show the advantages of using saliency volumes, and how they can be used for related tasks.
