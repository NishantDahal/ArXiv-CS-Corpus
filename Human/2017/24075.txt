Modeling flow in porous media with double porosity/permeability: A stabilized mixed formulation, error analysis, and numerical solutions

The flow of incompressible fluids through porous media plays a crucial role in many technological applications such as enhanced oil recovery and geological carbon-dioxide sequestration. The flow within numerous natural and synthetic porous materials that contain multiple scales of pores cannot be adequately described by the classical Darcy equations. It is for this reason that mathematical models for fluid flow in media with multiple scales of pores have been proposed in the literature. However, these models are analytically intractable for realistic problems. In this paper, a stabilized mixed four-field finite element formulation is presented to study the flow of an incompressible fluid in porous media exhibiting double porosity/permeability. The stabilization terms and the stabilization parameters are derived in a mathematically and thermodynamically consistent manner, and the computationally convenient equal-order interpolation of all the field variables is shown to be stable. A systematic error analysis is performed on the resulting stabilized weak formulation. Representative problems, patch tests and numerical convergence analyses are performed to illustrate the performance and convergence behavior of the proposed mixed formulation in the discrete setting. The accuracy of numerical solutions is assessed using the mathematical properties satisfied by the solutions of this double porosity/permeability model. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed framework can perform well under transient conditions and that it can capture well-known instabilities such as viscous fingering.
