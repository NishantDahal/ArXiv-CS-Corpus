Reconstruction of~3-D Rigid Smooth Curves Moving Free when Two Traceable Points Only are Available

This paper extends previous research in that sense that for orthogonal projections of rigid smooth (true-3D) curves moving totally free it reduces the number of required traceable points to two only (the best results known so far to the author are 3 points from free motion and 2 for motion restricted to rotation around a fixed direction and and 2 for motion restricted to influence of a homogeneous force field). The method used is exploitation of information on tangential projections. It discusses also possibility of simplification of reconstruction of flat curves moving free for prospective projections.
