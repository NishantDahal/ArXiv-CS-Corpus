Weightwise perfectly balanced functions with high weightwise nonlinearity profile

Boolean functions with good cryptographic criteria when restricted to the set of vectors with constant Hamming weight play an important role in the recent FLIP stream cipher. In this paper, we propose a large class of weightwise perfectly balanced (WPB) functions, which is not extended affinely (EA) equivalent to the known constructions. We also discuss the weightwise nonlinearity profile of these functions, and present general lower bounds on $k$-weightwise nonlinearity, where $k$ is a power of $2$. Moreover, we exhibit a subclass of the family. By a recursive lower bound, we show that these subclass of WPB functions have very high weightwise nonlinearity profile.
