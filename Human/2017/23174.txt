Stability and Transparency Analysis of a Bilateral Teleoperation in Presence of Data Loss

This paper presents a novel approach for stability and transparency analysis for bilateral teleoperation in the presence of data loss in communication media. A new model for data loss is proposed based on a set of periodic continuous pulses and its finite series representation. The passivity of the overall system is shown using wave variable approach including the newly defined model for data loss. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
