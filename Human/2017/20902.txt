Response to "Counterexample to global convergence of DSOS and SDSOS hierarchies"

In a recent note [8], the author provides a counterexample to the global convergence of what his work refers to as "the DSOS and SDSOS hierarchies" for polynomial optimization problems (POPs) and purports that this refutes claims in our extended abstract [4] and slides in [3]. The goal of this paper is to clarify that neither [4], nor [3], and certainly not our full paper [5], ever defined DSOS or SDSOS hierarchies as it is done in [8]. It goes without saying that no claims about convergence properties of the hierarchies in [8] were ever made as a consequence. What was stated in [4,3] was completely different: we stated that there exist hierarchies based on DSOS and SDSOS optimization that converge. This is indeed true as we discuss in this response. We also emphasize that we were well aware that some (S)DSOS hierarchies do not converge even if their natural SOS counterparts do. This is readily implied by an example in our prior work [5], which makes the counterexample in [8] superfluous. Finally, we provide concrete counterarguments to claims made in [8] that aim to challenge the scalability improvements obtained by DSOS and SDSOS optimization as compared to sum of squares (SOS) optimization.
