Analysis of chromatic dispersion compensation and carrier phase recovery in long-haul optical transmission system influenced by equalization enhanced phase noise

The performance of long-haul coherent optical fiber transmission system is significantly affected by the equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN), due to the interaction between the electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) and the laser phase noise. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on different chromatic dispersion (CD) compensation and carrier phase recovery (CPR) approaches, in the n-level phase shift keying (n-PSK) and the n-level quadrature amplitude modulation (n-QAM) coherent optical transmission systems, considering the impacts of EEPN. Four CD compensation methods are considered: the time-domain equalization (TDE), the frequency-domain equalization (FDE), the least mean square (LMS) adaptive equalization are applied for EDC, and the dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) is employed for optical dispersion compensation (ODC). Meanwhile, three carrier phase recovery methods are also involved: a one-tap normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm, a block-wise average (BWA) algorithm, and a Viterbi-Viterbi (VV) algorithm. Numerical simulations have been carried out in a 28-Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) coherent transmission system, and the results indicate that the origin of EEPN depends on the choice of chromatic dispersion compensation methods, and the effects of EEPN also behave moderately different in accordance to different carrier phase recovery scenarios.
