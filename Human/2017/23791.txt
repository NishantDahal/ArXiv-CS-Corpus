Bayesian Optimization for Parameter Tuning of the XOR Neural Network

When applying Machine Learning techniques to problems, one must select model parameters to ensure that the system converges but also does not become stuck at the objective function's local minimum. Tuning these parameters becomes a non-trivial task for large models and it is not always apparent if the user has found the optimal parameters. We aim to automate the process of tuning a Neural Network, (where only a limited number of parameter search attempts are available) by implementing Bayesian Optimization. In particular, by assigning Gaussian Process Priors to the parameter space, we utilize Bayesian Optimization to tune an Artificial Neural Network used to learn the XOR function, with the result of achieving higher prediction accuracy.
