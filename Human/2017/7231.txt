On Resource-bounded versions of the van Lambalgen theorem

The van Lambalgen theorem is a surprising result in algorithmic information theory concerning the symmetry of relative randomness. It establishes that for any pair of infinite sequences $A$ and $B$, $B$ is Martin-Löf random and $A$ is Martin-Löf random relative to $B$ if and only if the interleaved sequence $A \uplus B$ is Martin-Löf random. This implies that $A$ is relative random to $B$ if and only if $B$ is random relative to $A$ \cite{vanLambalgen}, \cite{Nies09}, \cite{HirschfeldtBook}. This paper studies the validity of this phenomenon for different notions of time-bounded relative randomness.
  We prove the classical van Lambalgen theorem using martingales and Kolmogorov compressibility. We establish the failure of relative randomness in these settings, for both time-bounded martingales and time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. We adapt our classical proofs when applicable to the time-bounded setting, and construct counterexamples when they fail. The mode of failure of the theorem may depend on the notion of time-bounded randomness.
