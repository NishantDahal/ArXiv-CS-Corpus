An Enhanced LMMSE Channel Estimation under High Speed Railway Scenarios

With the rapid deployment of the high speed railway (HSR), the wireless communication in HSR has been one of the indispensable scenarios in the fifth generation (5G) communications. In order to improve the performance of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in the HSR scenarios, we propose an enhanced linear minimum mean square error channel estimation scheme based on multi-path Doppler frequency offset (DFO) estimation in this paper. The proposed scheme can estimate DFO of each path, and generate the frequency and time channel correlation more accurately, which can improve the accuracy of channel estimation in the HSR scenarios. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the channel estimation error and achieve attractive gain in the HSR scenarios.
