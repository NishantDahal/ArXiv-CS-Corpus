Homotheties and incidences

We consider problems involving rich homotheties in a set S of n points in the plane (that is, homotheties that map many points of S to other points of S). By reducing these problems to incidence problems involving points and lines in R^3, we are able to obtain refined and new bounds for the number of rich homotheties, and for the number of distinct equivalence classes, under homotheties, of k-element subsets of S, for any k >= 3. We also discuss the extensions of these problems to three and higher dimensions.
