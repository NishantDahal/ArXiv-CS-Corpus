Downlink Coordinated Joint Transmission for Mutual Information Accumulation

In this letter, we propose a new coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique based on mutual information (MI) accumulation using rateless codes. Using a stochastic geometry model for the cellular downlink, we quantify the performance enhancements in coverage probability and rate due to MI accumulation. By simulation and analysis, we show that MI accumulation using rateless codes leads to remarkable improvements in coverage and rate for general users and specific cell edge users.
