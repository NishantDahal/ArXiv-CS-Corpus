Nondeterministic Communication Complexity with Help and Graph Functions

We define nondeterministic communication complexity in the model of communication complexity with help of Babai, Hayes and Kimmel. We use it to prove logarithmic lower bounds on the NOF communication complexity of explicit graph functions, which are complementary to the bounds proved by Beame, David, Pitassi and Woelfel.
