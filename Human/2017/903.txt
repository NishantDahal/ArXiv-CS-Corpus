Network Topology Modulation for Energy and Data Transmission in Internet of Magneto-Inductive Things

Internet-of-things (IoT) architectures connecting a massive number of heterogeneous devices need energy efficient, low hardware complexity, low cost, simple and secure mechanisms to realize communication among devices. One of the emerging schemes is to realize simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in an energy harvesting network. Radio frequency (RF) solutions require special hardware and modulation methods for RF to direct current (DC) conversion and optimized operation to achieve SWIPT which are currently in an immature phase. On the other hand, magneto-inductive (MI) communication transceivers are intrinsically energy harvesting with potential for SWIPT in an efficient manner. In this article, novel modulation and demodulation mechanisms are presented in a combined framework with multiple-access channel (MAC) communication and wireless power transmission. The network topology of power transmitting active coils in a transceiver composed of a grid of coils is changed as a novel method to transmit information. Practical demodulation schemes are formulated and numerically simulated for two-user MAC topology of small size coils. The transceivers are suitable to attach to everyday objects to realize reliable local area network (LAN) communication performances with tens of meters communication ranges. The designed scheme is promising for future IoT applications requiring SWIPT with energy efficient, low cost, low power and low hardware complexity solutions.
