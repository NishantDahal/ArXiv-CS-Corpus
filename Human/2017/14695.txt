Private Social Network Data Sharing

The increasing popularity of online social network brings huge privacy threat for the end users. While existing work focus on inferring sensitive attributes from the social network such as age, location and gender, little has been done on how to protect the users' privacy by preventing the malicious inference. In this paper we investigated the privacy vulnerability of the existing social network and designed a privacy-preserving framework. We evaluated the framework's privacy and usefulness guarantees, demonstrated its effectiveness on classification and the defense against the privacy attack.
