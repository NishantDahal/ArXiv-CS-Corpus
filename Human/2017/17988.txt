Parameterization of configuration space obstacles in three-dimensional rotational motion planning

This study investigates the exact geometry of the configuration space in three-dimensional rotational motion planning. A parameterization of configuration space obstacles is derived for a given triangulated or ball-approximated scene with an object rotating around a given point. The results obtained are an important step towards a complete description of the rich structure of a configuration space in three-dimensional rotational motion planning.
