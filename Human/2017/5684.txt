LSTM with Working Memory

Previous RNN architectures have largely been superseded by LSTM, or "Long Short-Term Memory". Since its introduction, there have been many variations on this simple design. However, it is still widely used and we are not aware of a gated-RNN architecture that outperforms LSTM in a broad sense while still being as simple and efficient. In this paper we propose a modified LSTM-like architecture. Our architecture is still simple and achieves better performance on the tasks that we tested on. We also introduce a new RNN performance benchmark that uses the handwritten digits and stresses several important network capabilities.
