Towards an Automated Optimization of Laminated Composite Structures: Hierarchical Zoning Approach with Exact Blending Rules

We present an automated methodology to optimize laminated composite structures. Our approach, inspired by bi-level optimization scheme, avoids its prime deficiencies and is based on developed computationally inexpensive stacking sequences reconstruction algorithm, which identically satisfies conventional set of blending rules. We combine it with proposed tight approximation to feasible domain of composite integral parameters and hierarchical zoning procedure to get highly efficient optimization methodology, which we test in two example applications. In both cases it is shown that blending rules compliant optimal solution remains within 10% gap from one with no rules applied.
