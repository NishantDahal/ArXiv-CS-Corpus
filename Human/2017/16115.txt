Modality-bridge Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification

This paper presents a new approach of transfer learning-based medical image classification to mitigate insufficient labeled data problem in medical domain. Instead of direct transfer learning from source to small number of labeled target data, we propose a modality-bridge transfer learning which employs the bridge database in the same medical imaging acquisition modality as target database. By learning the projection function from source to bridge and from bridge to target, the domain difference between source (e.g., natural images) and target (e.g., X-ray images) can be mitigated. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a high classification performance even for a small number of labeled target medical images, compared to various transfer learning approaches.
