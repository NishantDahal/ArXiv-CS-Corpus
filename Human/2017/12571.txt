Factor Graphs for Quantum Probabilities

A factor-graph representation of quantum-mechanical probabilities (involving any number of measurements) is proposed. Unlike standard statistical models, the proposed representation uses auxiliary variables (state variables) that are not random variables. All joint probability distributions are marginals of some complex-valued function $q$, and it is demonstrated how the basic concepts of quantum mechanics relate to factorizations and marginals of $q$.
