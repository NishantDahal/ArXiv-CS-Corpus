Approximate solution of length-bounded maximum multicommodity flow with unit edge-lengths

An improved fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and a greedy heuristic for the fractional length-bounded maximum multicommodity flow problem with unit edge-lengths are proposed. Computational experiments are carried out on benchmark graphs and on graphs that model software defined satellite networks to compare the proposed algorithms and an exact linear programming solver. The results of experiments demonstrate a trade-off between the computing time and the precision of algorithms under consideration.
