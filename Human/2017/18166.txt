Hybrid Fault diagnosis capability analysis of Hypercubes under the PMC model and MM* model

System level diagnosis is an important approach for the fault diagnosis of multiprocessor systems. In system level diagnosis, diagnosability is an important measure of the diagnosis capability of interconnection networks. But as a measure, diagnosability can not reflect the diagnosis capability of multiprocessor systems to link faults which may occur in real circumstances. In this paper, we propose the definition of $h$-edge tolerable diagnosability to better measure the diagnosis capability of interconnection networks under hybrid fault circumstances. The $h$-edge tolerable diagnosability of a multiprocessor system $G$ is the maximum number of faulty nodes that the system can guarantee to locate when the number of faulty edges does not exceed $h$,denoted by $t_h^{e}(G)$. The PMC model and MM model are the two most widely studied diagnosis models for the system level diagnosis of multiprocessor systems. The hypercubes are the most well-known interconnection networks. In this paper, the $h$-edge tolerable diagnosability of $n$-dimensional hypercube under the PMC model and MM$^{*}$ is determined as follows: $t_h^{e}(Q_n)= n-h$, where $1\leq h<n$, $n\geq3$.
