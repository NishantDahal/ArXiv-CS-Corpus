Linear Prediction based Data Detection of Convolutional Coded DQPSK in SIMO-OFDM

Data detection of convolutional coded differential quaternary phase shift keyed (DQPSK) signals using a predictive Viterbi algorithm (VA) based receiver, is presented for single input, multiple output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) systems. The receiver has both error correcting capability and also the ability to perform channel estimation (prediction). The predictive VA operates on a supertrellis with just $S_{\mathrm{ST}}=S_{\mathrm{E}}\times 2^{P-1}$ states instead of $S_{\mathrm{ST}}=S_{\mathrm{E}}\times 2^{P}$ states, where the complexity reduction is achieved by using the concept of isometry (here $S_{\mathrm{E}}$ denotes the number of states in the encoder trellis and $P$ denotes the prediction order). Though the linear prediction based data detection in turbo coded OFDM and the bit interleaved coded (BIC) OFDM systems perform better than the proposed approach in terms of bit error rate (BER) for a given signal to noise ratio (SNR), the decoding delay of the proposed approach is significantly lower than that of the BIC and the turbo coded OFDM systems.
