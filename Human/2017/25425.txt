Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of ZigBee Node Battery Characteristics and Operation

ZigBee network technology has been used widely in different commercial, medical and industrial applications, and the importance of keeping the network operating at a longer time was the main objective of ZigBee manufacturers. In this paper, ZigBee battery characteristics and operation has been researched extensively and a mathematical modeling has been applied on existed practical data provided by Freescale semiconductors Inc [1], and Farnell [2]. As a result a mathematical optimized formula has been established which describes battery characteristic and voltage behavior as a function of time, and since ZigBee node batteries has been the core objective of this research work, a decline in battery voltage below 50% of battery capacity could influence and degrade ZigBee network performance.
