OSPF extension for the support of multi-area networks with arbitrary topologies

OSPF currently supports multi-area networking with two severe limitations, due to the distance vector approach taken in the inter-area routing protocol: (i) the multi-area topology is restricted to a two-level hierarchy, and (ii) globally optimal routing may not be achieved. In this letter, we propose an OSPF extension that overcomes these limitations by adopting a link state inter-area routing protocol. The extension applies to both OSPFv2 (IPv4) and OSPFv3 (IPv6), and is fully transparent to area-internal routers. Despite its simplicity, this extension may have a large impact in the operation of the current Internet.
