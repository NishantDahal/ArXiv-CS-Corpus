Effect of NBTI/PBTI Aging and Process Variations on Write Failures in MOSFET and FinFET Flip-Flops

The assessment of noise margins and the related probability of failure in digital cells has growingly become essential, as nano-scale CMOS and FinFET technologies are confronting reliability issues caused by aging mechanisms, such as NBTI, and variability in process parameters. The influence of such phenomena is particularly associated to the Write Noise Margins (WNM) in memory elements, since a wrong stored logic value can result in an upset of the system state. In this work, we calculated and compared the effect of process variations and NBTI aging over the years on the actual WNM of various CMOS and FinFET based flip-flop cells. The massive transistor-level Monte Carlo simulations produced both nominal (i.e. mean) values and associated standard deviations of the WNM of the chosen flip-flops. This allowed calculating the consequent write failure probability as a function of an input voltage shift on the flip-flop cells, and assessing a comparison for robustness among different circuit topologies and technologies.
