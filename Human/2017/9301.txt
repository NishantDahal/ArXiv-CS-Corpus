3D Placement of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Station (UAV-BS) for Energy-Efficient Maximal Coverage

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle mounted base stations (UAV-BSs) can provide wireless services in a variety of scenarios. In this letter, we propose an optimal placement algorithm for UAV-BSs that maximizes the number of covered users using the minimum transmit power. We decouple the UAV-BS deployment problem in the vertical and horizontal dimensions without any loss of optimality. Furthermore, we model the UAV-BS deployment in the horizontal dimension as a circle placement problem and a smallest enclosing circle problem. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for different spatial distributions of the users.
