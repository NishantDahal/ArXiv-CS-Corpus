Modelo de Aprendizaje Biocibernetico BLM

Education in the digital period in which we live, is reaching challenges never before seen, preceded by phenomena that involve not only traditional social units, but also new virtual communities; Innovating is difficult, it is a challenge, however, we must think of new teaching methods that impact the current generation of students, who arrive with new needs and expectations. The construction of knowledge from the subject and the virtual world that surrounds it, establishes the basis for the development of a new model of teaching, where the classroom is the particular representation of a new physical-cybernetic ecosystem composed of the three large dimensions. Which are part of this new techno-social convergence (human - information - machine); Allowing an interrelation between the student, information, machine and the teacher; Using Biocybernetic methods of influence, control and replication, by means of the massive impact vector (i); In addition, the development of new strategies assisted by cybernetics and the updating of academic content according to the new teaching environment. Hence the importance of this study, which leads us to the need for a new model of transforming academic instruction, which is not based on a conglomerate of technological tools, but establishes a new educational and transformative model, based on "Collaborative Thinking" and the ubiquity of information, thus establishing the relationship between the subject and object of study, thus allowing us to establish the new Biocybernetic educational paradigm in the digital period.
