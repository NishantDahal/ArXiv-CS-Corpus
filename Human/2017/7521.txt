Arbitrary Beam Synthesis of Different Hybrid Beamforming Systems

For future mmWave mobile communication systems the use of analog/hybrid beamforming is envisioned be a key as- pect. The synthesis of beams is a key technology of enable the best possible operation during beamsearch, data transmission and MU MIMO operation. The developed method for synthesizing beams is based on previous work in radar technology considering only phase array antennas. With this technique it is possible to generate a desired beam of any shape with the constraints of the desired target transceiver antenna frontend. It is not constraint to a certain antenna array geometry, but can handle 1d, 2d and even 3d antenna array geometries like cylindric arrays. The numerical examples show that the method can synthesize beams by considering a user defined tradeoff between gain, transition width and passband ripples.
