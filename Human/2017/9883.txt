The Ontological Multidimensional Data Model

In this extended abstract we describe, mainly by examples, the main elements of the Ontological Multidimensional Data Model, which considerably extends a relational reconstruction of the multidimensional data model proposed by Hurtado and Mendelzon by means of tuple-generating dependencies, equality-generating dependencies, and negative constraints as found in Datalog+-. We briefly mention some good computational properties of the model.
