On-line Assembling Mitochondrial DNA from de novo transcriptome

This paper is focused in designing an efficient on-line algorithm to reconstruct a DNA sequence and search the genes in it, we assume that the segment have no mutation or reading error, the algorithm is based on de Bruijn Graph for reconstructing the DNA from the segments taking k-mers large enough no to generate cycles, once the sequence is ready a Boyer-Moore's algorithm implementation is used to search the genes inside de sequence using starts and stop codons, this solution give a high performance when all genes can be found, and there is no need to read all the segments to reach maximum number of genes, but due to the online nature one cannot be sure about the finals genes given
