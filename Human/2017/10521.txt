Using Second-Order Hidden Markov Model to Improve Speaker Identification Recognition Performance under Neutral Condition

In this paper, second-order hidden Markov model (HMM2) has been used and implemented to improve the recognition performance of text-dependent speaker identification systems under neutral talking condition. Our results show that HMM2 improves the recognition performance under neutral talking condition compared to the first-order hidden Markov model (HMM1). The recognition performance has been improved by 9%.
