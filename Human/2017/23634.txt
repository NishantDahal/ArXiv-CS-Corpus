Performance Analysis for Massive MIMO Downlink with Low Complexity Approximate Zero-Forcing Precoding

Zero-forcing (ZF) precoding plays an important role for massive MIMO downlink due to its near optimal performance. However, the high computation cost of the involved matrix inversion hinders its application. In this paper, we adopt the first order Neumann series (NS) for a low-complexity approximation. By introducing a relaxation parameter jointly with one selected user's interference to others into the precondition matrix, we propose the identity-plus-column NS (ICNS) method. By further exploiting the multi-user diversity gain via choosing the user with the largest interference to others, the ordered ICNS method is also proposed. Moreover, the sum-rate approximations of the proposed ICNS method and the competitive existing identity matrix based NS (INS) method are derived in closed-form, based on which the performance loss of ICNS due to inversion approximation compared with ideal ZF and its performance gain over INS are explicitly analyzed for three typical massive MIMO scenarios. Finally, simulations verify our analytical results and also show that the proposed two designs achieve better performance-complexity tradeoff than ideal ZF and existing low-complexity ZF precodings for practical large antenna number, correlated channels and not-so-small loading factor.
