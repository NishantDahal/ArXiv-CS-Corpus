Dynamic Path Planning and Movement Control in Pedestrian Simulation

Modeling and simulation of pedestrian behavior is used in applications such as planning large buildings, disaster management, or urban planning. Realistically simulating pedestrian behavior is challenging, due to the complexity of individual behavior as well as the complexity of interactions of pedestrians with each other and with the environment. This work-in-progress paper addresses the tactical (path planning) and the operational level (movement control) of pedestrian simulation from the perspective of multiagent-based modeling. We propose (1) an novel extension of the JPS routing algorithm for tactical planning, and (2) an architecture how path planning can be integrated with a social-force based movement control. The architecture is inspired by layered architectures for robot planning and control. We validate correctness and efficiency of our approach through simulation runs.
