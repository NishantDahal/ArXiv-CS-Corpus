BEP Enhancement for Semi-Femtocell MIMO Systems Employing SC-QICs and OSTBCs

In mobile cellular networks, it is estimated that more than 60% of voice and data services occur indoors. Therefore, cellular network operators have shown an unprecedented interest in research on femtocell systems from various aspects to extend the indoor wireless coverage for providing high-quality and high data-rate wireless multimedia services contents. In an effort for reducing the bit-error probabilities (BEPs) and also increasing bit/symbol capacity of bandwidth limited error-prone wireless channels in femtocell propagation areas, this paper presents the performance of a promising candidate technology designed based on the state-of-the-art techniques. The performance of powerful space-time turbo codes (STTCs) based on serial concatenation of quadratic interleaved codes (SC-QICs) with the optimal and also suboptimal decoding algorithms, in conjunction with orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBCs) have been presented in this contribution for wireless multiple-input single-output (MISO), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) semi-femtocells.
