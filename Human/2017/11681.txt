Approximate Shifted Combinatorial Optimization

Shifted combinatorial optimization is a new nonlinear optimization framework, which is a broad extension of standard combinatorial optimization, involving the choice of several feasible solutions at a time. It captures well studied and diverse problems ranging from congestive to partitioning problems. In particular, every standard combinatorial optimization problem has its shifted counterpart, which is typically much harder. Here we initiate a study of approximation algorithms for this broad optimization framework.
