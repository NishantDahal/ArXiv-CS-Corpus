Handover analysis of the Improved Phantom Cells

Improved Phantom cell is a new scenario which has been introduced recently to enhance the capacity of Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). The main trait of this scenario is that, besides maximizing the total network capacity in both indoor and outdoor environments, it claims to reduce the handover number compared to the conventional scenarios. In this paper, by a comprehensive review of the Improved Phantom cells structure, an appropriate algorithm will be introduced for the handover procedure of this scenario. To reduce the number of handover in the proposed algorithm, various parameters such as the received Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at the user equipment (UE), users access conditions to the phantom cells, and users staying time in the target cell based on its velocity, has been considered. Theoretical analyses and simulation results show that applying the suggested algorithm the improved phantom cell structure has a much better performance than conventional HetNets in terms of the number of handover.
