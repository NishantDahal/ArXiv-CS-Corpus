Maximum-Area Quadrilateral in a Convex Polygon, Revisited

In this note we show by example that the algorithm presented in 1979 by Dobkin and Snyder for finding the largest-area k-gon that is inscribed in a convex polygon fails to find the optimal solution for k=4. This question, posed by Keikha et al. where they showed that the Dobkin Snyder algorithm fails for k=3.
