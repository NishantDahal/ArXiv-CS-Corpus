Optimal Discrete Spatial Compression for Beamspace Massive MIMO Signals

Deploying massive number of antennas at the base station side can boost the cellular system performance dramatically. Meanwhile, it however involves significant additional radio-frequency (RF) front-end complexity, hardware cost and power consumption. To address this issue, the beamspace-multiple-input-multiple-output (beamspace-MIMO) based approach is considered as a promising solution. In this paper, we first show that the traditional beamspace-MIMO suffers from spatial power leakage and imperfect channel statistics estimation. A beam combination module is hence proposed, which consists of a small number (compared with the number of antenna elements) of low-resolution (possibly one-bit) digital (discrete) phase shifters after the beamspace transformation to further compress the beamspace signal dimensionality, such that the number of RF chains can be reduced beyond beamspace transformation and beam selection. The optimum discrete beam combination weights for the uplink are obtained based on the branch-and-bound (BB) approach. The key to the BB-based solution is to solve the embodied sub-problem, whose solution is derived in a closed-form. Based on the solution, a sequential greedy beam combination scheme with linear-complexity (w.r.t. the number of beams in the beamspace) is proposed. Link-level simulation results based on realistic channel models and long-term-evolution (LTE) parameters are presented which show that the proposed schemes can reduce the number of RF chains by up to $25\%$ with a one-bit digital phase-shifter-network.
