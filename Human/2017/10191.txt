Physical Layer Security-Aware Routing and Performance Tradeoffs in Ad Hoc Networks

The application of physical layer security in ad hoc networks has attracted considerable academic attention recently. However, the available studies mainly focus on the single-hop and two-hop network scenarios, and the price in terms of degradation of communication quality of service (QoS) caused by improving security is largely uninvestigated. As a step to address these issues, this paper explores the physical layer security-aware routing and performance tradeoffs in a multi-hop ad hoc network. Specifically, for any given end-to-end path we first derive its connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) in closed-form, which serve as the performance metrics of communication QoS and transmission security, respectively. Based on the closed-form expressions, we then study the security-QoS tradeoffs to minimize COP (resp. SOP) conditioned on that SOP (resp. COP) is guaranteed. With the help of analysis of a given path, we further propose the routing algorithms which can achieve the optimal performance tradeoffs for any pair of source and destination nodes in a distributed manner. Finally, simulation and numerical results are presented to validate the efficiency of our theoretical analysis, as well as to illustrate the security-QoS tradeoffs and the routing performance.
