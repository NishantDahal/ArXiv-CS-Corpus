Time-triggering versus event-triggering control over communication channels

Time-triggered and event-triggered control strategies for stabilization of an unstable plant over a rate-limited communication channel subject to unknown, bounded delay are studied and compared. Event triggering carries implicit information, revealing the state of the plant. However, the delay in the communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state information out of date. There is a critical delay value, when the loss of information due to the communication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by the triggering events. This occurs when the maximum delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant. In this context, extensions of our previous results for event triggering strategies are presented for vector systems and are compared with the data-rate theorem for time-triggered control, that is extended here to a setting with unknown delay.
