D2D Communications in LoRaWAN Low Power Wide Area Network: From Idea to Empirical Validation

In this paper we advocate the use of device-to-device (D2D) communications in a LoRaWAN Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). After overviewing the critical features of the LoRaWAN technology, we discuss the pros and cons of enabling the D2D communications for it. Subsequently we propose a network-assisted D2D communications protocol and show its feasibility by implementing it on top of a LoRaWAN-certified commercial transceiver. The conducted experiments show the performance of the proposed D2D communications protocol and enable us to assess its performance. More precisely, we show that the D2D communications can reduce the time and energy for data transfer by 6 to 20 times compared to conventional LoRaWAN data transfer mechanisms. In addition, the use of D2D communications may have a positive effect on the network by enabling spatial re-use of the frequency resources. The proposed LoRaWAN D2D communications can be used for a wide variety of applications requiring high coverage, e.g. use cases in distributed smart grid deployments for management and trading.
