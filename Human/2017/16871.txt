Xorshift random number generators from primitive polynomials

A class of xorshift random number generators (RNGs) are introduced by Marsaglia. We have proposed an algorithm which constructs a full period xorshift RNG from a given primitive polynomial. It is shown there is a weakness present in those RNGs and is suggested its improvement. A separate algorithm is also proposed which returns a full period xorshift generator with desired number of xorshift operations.%We also introduce the notion of tweaked primitive multiple-recursive matrix method with improved linear complexity.
