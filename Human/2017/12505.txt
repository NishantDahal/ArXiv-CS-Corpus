Achievable DoF Regions of MIMO Networks with Imperfect CSIT

We focus on a two-receiver Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) Broadcast Channel (BC) and Interference Channel (IC) with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node. We assume an imperfect knowledge of local Channel State Information at the Transmitters (CSIT), whose error decays with the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio. With such configuration, we characterize the achievable Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) regions in both BC and IC, by proposing a Rate-Splitting approach, which divides each receiver's message into a common part and a private part. Compared to the RS scheme designed for the symmetric MIMO case, this scheme is suitable for the general asymmetric deployment with an arbitrary number of antennas at each node. In BC, the proposed block 1) employs an unequal power allocation to the private messages of the two receivers, 2) exploits the benefit of having an extra spatial dimension at one receiver, and 3) is carried out with a Space-Time transmission. These features enable the scheme to yield a greater DoF region than trivially extending the scheme designed for the symmetric case. In IC, we modify the scheme proposed for the BC case by applying a linear transformation to the channel matrices. Such a linear transformation allows us to identify the signal space where the two transmitted signals interfere with each other and propose a proper power allocation policy. The achievable DoF regions are shown to be optimal for some antenna configurations.
