Extended Product and Integrated Interleaved Codes

A new class of codes, Extended Product (EPC) Codes, consisting of a product code with a number of extra parities added, is presented and applications for erasure decoding are discussed. An upper bound on the minimum distance of EPC codes is given, as well as constructions meeting the bound for some relevant cases. A special case of EPC codes, Extended Integrated Interleaved (EII) codes, which naturally unify Integrated Interleaved (II) codes and product codes, is defined and studied in detail. It is shown that EII codes often improve the minimum distance of II codes with the same rate, and they enhance the decoding algorithm by allowing decoding on columns as well as on rows. It is also shown that EII codes allow for encoding II codes with an uniform distribution of the parity symbols.
