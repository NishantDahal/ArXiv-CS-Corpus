Multipermutation Ulam Sphere Analysis Toward Characterizing Maximal Code Size

Permutation codes, in the form of rank modulation, have shown promise for applications such as flash memory. One of the metrics recently suggested as appropriate for rank modulation is the Ulam metric, which measures the minimum translocation distance between permutations. Multipermutation codes have also been proposed as a generalization of permutation codes that would improve code size (and consequently the code rate). In this paper we analyze the Ulam metric in the context of multipermutations, noting some similarities and differences between the Ulam metric in the context of permutations. We also consider sphere sizes for multipermutations under the Ulam metric and resulting bounds on code size.
