Introduction to a Temporal Graph Benchmark

A temporal graph is a data structure, consisting of nodes and edges in which the edges are associated with time labels. To analyze the temporal graph, the first step is to find a proper graph dataset/benchmark. While many temporal graph datasets exist online, none could be found that used the interval labels in which each edge is associated with a starting and ending time. Therefore we create a temporal graph data based on Wikipedia reference graph for temporal analysis. This report aims to provide more details of this graph benchmark to those who are interested in using it.
