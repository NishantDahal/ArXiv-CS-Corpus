Models for the Displacement Calculus

The displacement calculus $\mathbf{D}$ is a conservative extension of the Lambek calculus $\mathbf{L1}$ (with empty antecedents allowed in sequents). $\mathbf{L1}$ can be said to be the logic of concatenation, while $\mathbf{D}$ can be said to be the logic of concatenation and intercalation. In many senses, it can be claimed that $\mathbf{D}$ mimics $\mathbf{L1}$ in that the proof theory, generative capacity and complexity of the former calculus are natural extensions of the latter calculus. In this paper, we strengthen this claim. We present the appropriate classes of models for $\mathbf{D}$ and prove some completeness results; strikingly, we see that these results and proofs are natural extensions of the corresponding ones for $\mathbf{L1}$.
