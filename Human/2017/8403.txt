Duel and sweep algorithm for order-preserving pattern matching

Given a text $T$ and a pattern $P$ over alphabet $Î£$, the classic exact matching problem searches for all occurrences of pattern $P$ in text $T$. Unlike exact matching problem, order-preserving pattern matching (OPPM) considers the relative order of elements, rather than their real values. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for OPPM problem using the "duel-and-sweep" paradigm. Our algorithm runs in $O(n + m\log m)$ time in general and $O(n + m)$ time under an assumption that the characters in a string can be sorted in linear time with respect to the string size. We also perform experiments and show that our algorithm is faster that KMP-based algorithm. Last, we introduce the two-dimensional order preserved pattern matching and give a duel and sweep algorithm that runs in $O(n^2)$ time for duel stage and $O(n^2 m)$ time for sweeping time with $O(m^3)$ preprocessing time.
