This volume contains a selection of the papers presented at the XVI Jornadas sobre Programación y Lenguajes (PROLE 2016), held at Salamanca, Spain, during September 14th-15th, 2016. Previous editions of the workshop were held in Santander (2015), Cádiz (2014), Madrid (2013), Almería (2012), A Coruña (2011), València (2010), San Sebastián (2009), Gijón (2008), Zaragoza (2007), Sitges (2006), Granada (2005), Málaga (2004), Alicante (2003), El Escorial (2002), and Almagro (2001). Programming languages provide a conceptual framework which is necessary for the development, analysis, optimization and understanding of programs and programming tasks. The aim of the PROLE series of conferences (PROLE stems from PROgramación y LEnguajes) is to serve as a meeting point for Spanish research groups which develop their work in the area of programming and programming languages. The organization of this series of events aims at fostering the exchange of ideas, experiences and results among these groups. Promoting further collaboration is also one of its main goals.
