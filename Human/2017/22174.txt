Design of an Integrated Analytics Platform for Healthcare Assessment Centered on the Episode of Care

Assessing care quality and performance is essential to improve healthcare processes and population health management. However, due to bad system design and lack of access to required data, this assessment is often delayed or not done at all. The goal of our research is to investigate an advanced analytics platform that enables healthcare quality and performance assessment. We used a user-centered design approach to identify the system requirements and have the concept of episode of care as the building block of information for a key performance indicator analytics system. We implemented architecture and interface prototypes, and performed a usability test with hospital users with managerial roles. The results show that by using user-centered design we created an analytical platform that provides a holistic and integrated view of the clinical, financial and operational aspects of the institution. Our encouraging results warrant further studies to understand other aspects of usability.
