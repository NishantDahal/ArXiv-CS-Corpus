Proceedings Eighth International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics and Formal Verification

This volume contains the proceedings of the Eighth International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logic and Formal Verification (GandALF 2017). The symposium took place in Roma, Italy, from the 20th to the 22nd of September 2017. The GandALF symposium was established by a group of Italian computer scientists interested in mathematical logic, automata theory, game theory, and their applications to the specification, design, and verification of complex systems. Its aim is to provide a forum where people from different areas, and possibly with different backgrounds, can fruitfully interact. GandALF has a truly international spirit, as witnessed by the composition of the program and steering committee and by the country distribution of the submitted papers.
