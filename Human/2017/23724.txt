A density version of Cobham's theorem

Cobham's theorem asserts that if a sequence is automatic with respect to two multiplicatively independent bases, then it is ultimately periodic. We prove a stronger density version of the result: if two sequences which are automatic with respect to two multiplicatively independent bases coincide on a set of density one, then they also coincide on a set of density one with a periodic sequence. We apply the result to a problem of Deshouillers and Ruzsa concerning the least nonzero digit of $n!$ in base $12$.
