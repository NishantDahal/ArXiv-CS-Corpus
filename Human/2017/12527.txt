Boosting Information Spread: An Algorithmic Approach

The majority of influence maximization (IM) studies focus on targeting influential seeders to trigger substantial information spread in social networks. In this paper, we consider a new and complementary problem of how to further increase the influence spread of given seeders. Our study is motivated by the observation that direct incentives could "boost" users so that they are more likely to be influenced by friends. We study the $k$-boosting problem which aims to find $k$ users to boost so that the final "boosted" influence spread is maximized. The $k$-boosting problem is different from the IM problem because boosted users behave differently from seeders: boosted users are initially uninfluenced and we only increase their probability to be influenced. Our work also complements the IM studies because we focus on triggering larger influence spread on the basis of given seeders. Both the NP-hardness of the problem and the non-submodularity of the objective function pose challenges to the $k$-boosting problem. To tackle the problem on general graphs, we devise two efficient algorithms with the data-dependent approximation ratio. For the $k$-boosting problem on bidirected trees, we present an efficient greedy algorithm and a rounded dynamic programming that is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments using real social networks and synthetic bidirected trees. We show that boosting solutions returned by our algorithms achieves boosts of influence that are up to several times higher than those achieved by boosting solutions returned by intuitive baselines, which have no guarantee of solution quality. We also explore the "budget allocation" problem in our experiments. Compared with targeting seeders with all budget, larger influence spread is achieved when we allocation the budget to both seeders and boosted users.
