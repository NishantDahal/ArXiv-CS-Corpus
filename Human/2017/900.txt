A Chunk Caching Location and Searching Scheme in Content Centric Networking

Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a new network infrastructure around content dissemination and retrieval, shift from host addresses to named data. Each CCN router has a cache to store the chunks passed by it. Therefore the caching strategy about chunk placement can greatly affect the whole CCN performance. This paper proposes an implicit coordinate chunk caching location and searching scheme (CLS) in CCN hierarchical infrastructure. In CLS, there is at most one copy of a chunk cached on the path between a server and a leaf router. This copy is pulled down one level towards the leaf router by a request or pushed up one level towards the server by the cache eviction. Thus, it is possible to store more diverse contents in the whole CCN and improve the network performance. Plus, in order to reduce the server workload and file download time, a caching trail of chunk is created to direct the following request where to find the chunk. Extensive test-bed experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of a wide range of performance metrics. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing algorithms.
