Yet Another Pseudorandom Number Generator

We propose a novel pseudorandom number generator based on RÃ¶ssler attractor and bent Boolean function. We estimated the output bits properties by number of statistical tests. The results of the cryptanalysis show that the new pseudorandom number generation scheme provides a high level of data security.
