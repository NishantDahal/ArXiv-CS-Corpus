New Optimal Binary Sequences with Period $4p$ via Interleaving Ding-Helleseth-Lam Sequences

Binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation play important roles in radar, communication, and cryptography. Finding new binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation has been an interesting research topic in sequence design. Ding-Helleseth-Lam sequences are such a class of binary sequences of period $p$, where $p$ is an odd prime with $p\equiv 1(\bmod~4)$. The objective of this letter is to present a construction of binary sequences of period $4p$ via interleaving four suitable Ding-Helleseth-Lam sequences. This construction generates new binary sequences with optimal autocorrelation which can not be produced by earlier ones.
