GSM based CommSense system to measure and estimate environmental changes

Facilitating the coexistence of radar systems with communication systems has been a major area of research in radar engineering. The current work presents a new way to sense the environment using the channel equalization block of existing communication systems. We have named this system CommSense. In the current paper we demonstrate the feasibility of the system using Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) signals. The implementation has been done using open-source Software Defined Radio (SDR) environment. In the preliminary results obtained in our work we show that it is possible to distinguish environmental changes using the proposed system. The major advantage of the system is that it is inexpensive as channel estimation is an inherent block in any communication system and hence the added cost to make it work as an environment sensor is minimal. The major challenge, on which we are continuing our work, is how to characterize the features in the environmental changes. This is an acute challenge given the fact that the bandwidth available is narrow and the system is inherently a forward looking radar. However the initial results, as shown in this paper, are encouraging and we intend to use an application specific instrumentation (ASIN) scheme to distinguish the environmental changes.
