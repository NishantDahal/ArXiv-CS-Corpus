Spectrum and Energy Efficient Beamspace MIMO-NOMA for Millimeter-Wave Communications Using Lens Antenna Array

The recent concept of beamspace multiple input multiple output (MIMO) can significantly reduce the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains in millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems without obvious performance loss. However, the fundamental limit of existing beamspace MIMO is that, the number of supported users cannot be larger than the number of RF chains at the same time-frequency resources. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper we propose a new spectrum and energy efficient mmWave transmission scheme that integrates the concept of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with beamspace MIMO, i.e., beamspace MIMO-NOMA. By using NOMA in beamspace MIMO systems, the number of supported users can be larger than the number of RF chains at the same time-frequency resources. Particularly, the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA in a typical mmWave channel model is analyzed, which shows an obvious performance gain compared with the existing beamspace MIMO. Then, a precoding scheme based on the principle of zero-forcing (ZF) is designed to reduce the inter-beam interferences in the beamspace MIMO-NOMA system. Furthermore, to maximize the achievable sum rate, a dynamic power allocation is proposed by solving the joint power optimization problem, which not only includes the intra-beam power optimization, but also considers the inter-beam power optimization. Finally, an iterative optimization algorithm with low complexity is developed to realize the dynamic power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA can achieve higher spectrum and energy efficiency compared with existing beamspace MIMO.
