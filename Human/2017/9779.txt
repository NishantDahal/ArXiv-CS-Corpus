Secure Precise Wireless Transmission with Random-Subcarrier-Selection-based Directional Modulation Transmit Antenna Array

In this paper, a practical wireless transmission scheme is proposed to transmit confidential messages to the desired user securely and precisely by the joint use of multiple techniques including artificial noise (AN) projection, phase alignment (PA)/beamforming, and random subcarrier selection (RSCS) based on OFDM, and directional modulation (DM), namely RSCS-OFDM-DM. This RSCS-OFDM-DM scheme provides an extremely low-complexity structures for the transmitter and desired receiver and makes the secure and precise wireless transmission realizable in practice. For illegal eavesdroppers, the receive power of confidential messages is so weak that their receivers cannot intercept these confidential messages successfully once it is corrupted by AN. In such a scheme, the design of phase alignment/beamforming vector and AN projection matrix depend intimately on the desired direction angle and distance. It is particularly noted that the use of RSCS leads to a significant outcome that the receive power of confidential messages mainly concentrates on the small neighboring region around the desired receiver and only small fraction of its power leaks out to the remaining large broad regions. This concept is called secure precise transmission. The probability density function of real-time receive signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is derived. Also, the average SINR and its tight upper bound are attained. The approximate closed-form expression for average secrecy rate is derived by analyzing the first-null positions of SINR and clarifying the wiretap region.
