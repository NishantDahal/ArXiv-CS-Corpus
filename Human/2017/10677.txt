Power- and Spectral Efficient Communication System Design Using 1-Bit Quantization

Improving the power efficiency and spectral efficiency of communication systems has been one of the major research goals over the recent years. However, there is a tradeoff in achieving both goals at the same time. In this work, we consider the joint optimization of the power amplifier and a pulse shaping filter over a single-input single-output (SISO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using 1-bit analog-todigital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters. The goal of the optimization is the selection of the optimal system parameters in order to maximize the desired figure-of-merit (FOM) which is the product of power efficiency and spectral efficiency. Simulation results give an insight in choosing the optimal parameters of the pulse shaping filter and power amplifier to maximize the desired FOM.
