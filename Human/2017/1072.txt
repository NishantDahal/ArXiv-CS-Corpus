Performance Evaluation of Spectrum Mobility in Multi-homed Mobile IPv6 Cognitive Radio Cellular Networks

Technological developments alongside VLSI achievements enable mobile devices to be equipped with multiple radio interfaces which is known as multihoming. On the other hand, the combination of various wireless access technologies, known as Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs) has been introduced to provide continuous connection to mobile devices in any time and location. Cognitive radio networks as a part of NGWNs aroused to overcome spectrum inefficiency and spectrum scarcity issues. In order to provide seamless and ubiquitous connection across heterogeneous wireless access networks in the context of cognitive radio networks, utilizing Mobile IPv6 is beneficial. In this paper, a mobile device equipped with two radio interfaces is considered in order to evaluate performance of spectrum handover in terms of handover latency. The analytical results show that the proposed model can achieve better performance compared to other related mobility management protocols mainly in terms of handover latency.
