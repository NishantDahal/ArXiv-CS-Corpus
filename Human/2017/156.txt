FM-Delta: Fault Management Packet Compression

Fault Management (FM) is a cardinal feature in communication networks. One of the most common FM approaches is to use periodic keepalive messages. Hence, switches and routers are required to transmit a large number of FM messages periodically, requiring a hardware-based packet generator that periodically transmits a set of messages that are stored in an expensive on-chip memory. With the rapid growth of carrier networks, and as 5G technologies emerge, the number of users and the traffic rates are expected to significantly increase over the next few years. Consequently, we expect the on-chip memories used for FM to become a costly component in switch and router chips. We introduce a novel approach in which FM messages are stored in compressed form in the on-chip memory, allowing to significantly reduce the memory size. We present FM-Delta, a simple hardware-friendly delta encoding algorithm that allows FM messages to be compressed by a factor of 2.6. We show that this compression ratio is very close to the results of the zlib compression library, which requires much higher implementation complexity.
