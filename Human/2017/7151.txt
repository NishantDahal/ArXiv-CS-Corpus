Quasi-cyclic self-dual codes of length 70

In this paper we obtain a number of [70,35,12] singly even self-dual codes as a quasi-cyclic codes with m=2 (tailbitting convolutional codes). One of them is the first known code with parameters Beta=140 Gamma=0. All codes are not pure double circulant i.e. could not be represented in systematic form.
