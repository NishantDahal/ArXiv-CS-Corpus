Data-Driven Analysis and Common Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CPOD)-Based Spatio-Temporal Emulator for Design Exploration

The present study proposes a data-driven framework trained with high-fidelity simulation results to facilitate decision making for combustor designs. At its core is a surrogate model employing a machine-learning technique called kriging, which is combined with data-driven basis functions to extract and model the underlying coherent structures. This emulation framework encompasses key design parameter sensitivity analysis, physics-guided classification of design parameter sets, and flow evolution modeling for efficient design survey. To better inform the model of quantifiable physical knowledge, a sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices and a decision tree are incorporated into the framework. This information improves the surrogate model training process, which employs basis functions as regression functions over the design space for the kriging model. The novelty of the proposed approach is the construction of the model through Common Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which allows for data-reduction and extraction of common coherent structures. The accuracy of prediction of mean flow features for new swirl injector designs is assessed and the dynamic flowfield is captured in the form of power spectrum densities. This data-driven framework also demonstrates the uncertainty quantification of predictions, providing a metric for model fit. The significantly reduced computation time required for evaluating new design points enables efficient survey of the design space.
