Adaptive Interface for Accommodating Colour-Blind Users by Using Ishihara Test

Imperative visual data frequently vanishes when color applications are seen by partially color blind users. A new method for adaptive interface for accommodating color blind users is presented. The method presented here has two sections: 1) test client perceivability by utilizing Ishihara plates. 2) change the interface color scheme to accommodate color blind users if necessary. We demonstrate how the method works via a simple interface and evaluate the efficiency of our method by experimenting it on 100 users.
