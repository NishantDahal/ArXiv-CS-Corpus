Local Voting: Optimal Distributed Node Scheduling Algorithm for Multihop Wireless Networks

An efficient and fair node scheduling is a big challenge in multihop wireless networks. In this work, we propose a distributed node scheduling algorithm, called Local Voting. The idea comes from the finding that the shortest delivery time or delay is obtained when the load is equalized throughout the network. Simulation results demonstrate that Local Voting achieves better performance in terms of average delay, maximum delay, and fairness compared to several representative scheduling algorithms from the literature. Despite being distributed, Local Voting has a very close performance to a centralized algorithm that is considered to have the optimal performance.
