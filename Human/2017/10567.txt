Dynamic Video Streaming in Caching-enabled Wireless Mobile Networks

Recent advances in software-defined mobile networks (SDMNs), in-network caching, and mobile edge computing (MEC) can have great effects on video services in next generation mobile networks. In this paper, we jointly consider SDMNs, in-network caching, and MEC to enhance the video service in next generation mobile networks. With the objective of maximizing the mean measurement of video quality, an optimization problem is formulated. Due to the coupling of video data rate, computing resource, and traffic engineering (bandwidth provisioning and paths selection), the problem becomes intractable in practice. Thus, we utilize dual-decomposition method to decouple those three sets of variables. Extensive simulations are conducted with different system configurations to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
