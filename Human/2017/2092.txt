Framework for an Innovative Perceptive Mobile Network Using Joint Communication and Sensing

In this paper, we develop a framework for an innovative perceptive mobile (i.e. cellular) network that integrates sensing with communication, and supports new applications widely in transportation, surveillance and environmental sensing. Three types of sensing methods implemented in the base-stations are proposed, using either uplink or downlink multiuser communication signals. The required changes to system hardware and major technical challenges are briefly discussed. We also demonstrate the feasibility of estimating sensing parameters via developing a compressive sensing based scheme and providing simulation results to validate its effectiveness.
