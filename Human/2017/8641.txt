Application of the Computer Capacity to the Analysis of Processors Evolution

The notion of computer capacity was proposed in 2012, and this quantity has been estimated for computers of different kinds.
  In this paper we show that, when designing new processors, the manufacturers change the parameters that affect the computer capacity. This allows us to predict the values of parameters of future processors. As the main example we use Intel processors, due to the accessibility of detailed description of all their technical characteristics.
