Replication of Virtual Network Functions: Optimizing Link Utilization and Resource Costs

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is enabling the softwarization of traditional network services, commonly deployed in dedicated hardware, into generic hardware in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), which can be located flexibly in the network. However, network load balancing can be critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service Function Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. The placement of these chained functions increases the ping-pong traffic between VNFs, directly affecting to the efficiency of bandwidth utilization. The optimization of the placement of these VNFs is a challenge as also other factors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address this issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and especially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network, while the server utilization is minimized. In this paper we present a Linear Programming (LP) model for the optimum placement of functions finding a trade-off between the minimization of two objectives: the link utilization and CPU resource usage. The results show how the model load balance the utilization of all links in the network using minimum resources.
