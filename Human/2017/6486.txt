Testing Docker Performance for HPC Applications

The main goal for this article is to compare performance penalties when using KVM virtualization and Docker containers for creating isolated environments for HPC applications. The article provides both data obtained using commonly accepted synthetic tests (High Performance Linpack) and real life applications (OpenFOAM). The article highlights the influence on resulting application performance of major infrastructure configuration options: CPU type presented to VM, networking connection type used.
