At Every Corner: Determining Corner Points of Two-User Gaussian Interference Channels

The corner points of the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian interference channel under strong or weak interference are determined using the notions of almost Gaussian random vectors, almost lossless addition of random vectors, and almost linearly dependent random vectors. In particular, the "missing" corner point problem is solved in a manner that differs from previous works in that it avoids the use of integration over a continuum of SNR values or of Monge-Kantorovitch transportation problems.
