When data mining meets optimization: A case study on the quadratic assignment problem

This paper presents a hybrid approach called frequent pattern based search that combines data mining and optimization. The proposed method uses a data mining procedure to mine frequent patterns from a set of high-quality solutions collected from previous search, and the mined frequent patterns are then employed to build starting solutions that are improved by an optimization procedure. After presenting the general approach and its composing ingredients, we illustrate its application to solve the well-known and challenging quadratic assignment problem. Computational results on the 21 hardest benchmark instances show that the proposed approach competes favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms both in terms of solution quality and computing time.
