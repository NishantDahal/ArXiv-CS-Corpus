Plugo: a VLC Systematic Perspective of Large-scale Indoor Localization

Indoor localization based on Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been in favor with both the academia and industry for years. In this paper, we present a prototyping photodiode-based VLC system towards large-scale localization. Specially, we give in-depth analysis of the design constraints and considerations for large-scale indoor localization research. After that we identify the key enablers for such systems: 1) distributed architecture, 2) one-way communication, and 3) random multiple access. Accordingly, we propose Plugo -- a photodiode-based VLC system conforming to the aforementioned criteria. We present a compact design of the VLC-compatible LED bulbs featuring plug-and-go use-cases. The basic framed slotted Additive Links On-line Hawaii Area (ALOHA) is exploited to achieve random multiple access over the shared optical medium. We show its effectiveness in beacon broadcasting by experiments, and further demonstrate its scalability to large-scale scenarios through simulations. Finally, preliminary localization experiments are conducted using fingerprinting-based methods in a customized testbed, achieving an average accuracy of 0.14 m along with a 90-percentile accuracy of 0.33 m.
