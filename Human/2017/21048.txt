Latent Tree Approximation in Linear Model

We consider the problem of learning underlying tree structure from noisy, mixed data obtained from a linear model. To achieve this, we use the expectation maximization algorithm combined with Chow-Liu minimum spanning tree algorithm. This algorithm is sub-optimal, but has low complexity and is applicable to model selection problems through any linear model.
