Towards Effective Exact Algorithms for the Maximum Balanced Biclique Problem

The Maximum Balanced Biclique Problem (MBBP) is a prominent model with numerous applications. Yet, the problem is NP-hard and thus computationally challenging. We propose novel ideas for designing effective exact algorithms for MBBP. Firstly, we introduce an Upper Bound Propagation procedure to pre-compute an upper bound involving each vertex. Then we extend an existing branch-and-bound algorithm by integrating the pre-computed upper bounds. We also present a set of new valid inequalities induced from the upper bounds to tighten an existing mathematical formulation for MBBP. Lastly, we investigate another exact algorithm scheme which enumerates a subset of balanced bicliques based on our upper bounds. Experiments show that compared to existing approaches, the proposed algorithms and formulations are more efficient in solving a set of random graphs and large real-life instances.
