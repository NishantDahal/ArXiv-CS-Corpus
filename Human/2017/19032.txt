Practical Inner Codes for Batched Sparse Codes in Wireless Multihop Networks

Batched sparse (BATS) code is a promising technology for reliable data transmission in multi-hop wireless networks. As a BATS code consists of an outer code and an inner code that typically is a random linear network code, one main research topic for BATS codes is to design an inner code with good performance in transmission efficiency and complexity. In this paper, this issue is addressed with a focus on the problem of minimizing the total number of packets transmitted by the source and intermediate nodes. Subsequently, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is NP-hard in general. By exploiting the properties of inner codes and the incomplete beta function, we construct a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that gives a valid upper bound on the best performance that can be achieved by any feasible solutions. Moreover, both centralized and decentralized real-time optimization strategies are developed. In particular, the decentralized approach is performed independently by each node to find a feasible solution in linear time with the use of look-up tables. Numerical results show that the gap in performance between our proposed approaches and the upper bound is very small, which demonstrates that all feasible solutions developed in the paper are near-optimal with a guaranteed performance bound.
