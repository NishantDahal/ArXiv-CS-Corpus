Probing Multivariate Indicators for Academic Evaluation

We combine the Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) and the h-index into the I3-type framework and introduce the publication vector X = (X1, X2, X3) and the citation vector Y = (Y1, Y2, Y3) , the publication score I3X=X1+X2+X3 and the citation score I3Y=Y1+Y2+Y3, and alternative indicators based on percentile classes generated by the h-index. These multivariate indicators can be used for academic evaluation. The empirical studies show that the h-core distribution is suitable to evaluate scholars, the X1 and Y1 are applied to measure core impact power of universities, and I3X and I3Y are alternatives of journal impact factor (JIF). The multivariate indicators provide a multidimensional view of academic evaluation with using the advantages of both the h-index and I3.
