First- and Second-Order Models of Recursive Arithmetics

We study a quadruple of interrelated subexponential subsystems of arithmetic WKL$_0^-$, RCA$^-_0$, I$Δ_0$, and $Δ$RA$_1$, which complement the similarly related quadruple WKL$_0$, RCA$_0$, I$Σ_1$, and PRA studied by Simpson, and the quadruple WKL$_0^\ast$, RCA$_0^\ast$, I$Δ_0$(exp), and EFA studied by Simpson and Smith. We then explore the space of subexponential arithmetic theories between I$Δ_0$ and I$Δ_0$(exp). We introduce and study first- and second-order theories of recursive arithmetic $A$RA$_1$ and $A$RA$_2$ capable of characterizing various computational complexity classes and based on function algebras $A$, studied by Clote and others.
