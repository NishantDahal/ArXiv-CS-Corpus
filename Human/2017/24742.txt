Building Robust Deep Neural Networks for Road Sign Detection

Deep Neural Networks are built to generalize outside of training set in mind by using techniques such as regularization, early stopping and dropout. But considerations to make them more resilient to adversarial examples are rarely taken. As deep neural networks become more prevalent in mission-critical and real-time systems, miscreants start to attack them by intentionally making deep neural networks to misclassify an object of one type to be seen as another type. This can be catastrophic in some scenarios where the classification of a deep neural network can lead to a fatal decision by a machine. In this work, we used GTSRB dataset to craft adversarial samples by Fast Gradient Sign Method and Jacobian Saliency Method, used those crafted adversarial samples to attack another Deep Convolutional Neural Network and built the attacked network to be more resilient against adversarial attacks by making it more robust by Defensive Distillation and Adversarial Training
