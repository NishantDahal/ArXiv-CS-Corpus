Generating Memorable Mnemonic Encodings of Numbers

The major system is a mnemonic system that can be used to memorize sequences of numbers. In this work, we present a method to automatically generate sentences that encode a given number. We propose several encoding models and compare the most promising ones in a password memorability study. The results of the study show that a model combining part-of-speech sentence templates with an $n$-gram language model produces the most memorable password representations.
