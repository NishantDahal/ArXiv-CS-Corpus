Applications and Challenges of Real-time Mobile DNA Analysis

The DNA sequencing is the process of identifying the exact order of nucleotides within a given DNA molecule. The new portable and relatively inexpensive DNA sequencers, such as Oxford Nanopore MinION, have the potential to move DNA sequencing outside of laboratory, leading to faster and more accessible DNA-based diagnostics. However, portable DNA sequencing and analysis are challenging for mobile systems, owing to high data throughputs and computationally intensive processing performed in environments with unreliable connectivity and power.
  In this paper, we provide an analysis of the challenges that mobile systems and mobile computing must address to maximize the potential of portable DNA sequencing, and in situ DNA analysis. We explain the DNA sequencing process and highlight the main differences between traditional and portable DNA sequencing in the context of the actual and envisioned applications. We look at the identified challenges from the perspective of both algorithms and systems design, showing the need for careful co-design.
