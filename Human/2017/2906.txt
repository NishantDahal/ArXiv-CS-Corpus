Quantum Optimal Multiple Assignment Scheme for Realizing General Access Structure of Secret Sharing

The multiple assignment scheme is to assign one or more shares to single participant so that any kind of access structure can be realized by classical secret sharing schemes. We propose its quantum version including ramp secret sharing schemes. Then we propose an integer optimization approach to minimize the average share size.
