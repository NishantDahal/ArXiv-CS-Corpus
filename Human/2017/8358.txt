A Data-Driven Analysis of the Influence of Care Coordination on Trauma Outcome

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that variation in care coordination is related to LOS. DESIGN We applied a spectral co-clustering methodology to simultaneously infer groups of patients and care coordination patterns, in the form of interaction networks of health care professionals, from electronic medical record (EMR) utilization data. The care coordination pattern for each patient group was represented by standard social network characteristics and its relationship with hospital LOS was assessed via a negative binomial regression with a 95% confidence interval. SETTING AND PATIENTS This study focuses on 5,588 adult patients hospitalized for trauma at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The EMRs were accessed by healthcare professionals from 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital LOS for trauma inpatients, as an indicator of care coordination efficiency. RESULTS: Three general types of care coordination patterns were discovered, each of which was affiliated with a specific patient group. The first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital LOS and was managed by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number of operational areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patient groups), but exhibited the largest number of collaborations between operational areas (e.g., an average of 27.1 connections per operational area compared to 22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). The hospital LOS for the second and third patient groups was 14 hours (P = 0.024) and 10 hours (P = 0.042) longer than the first patient group, respectively.
