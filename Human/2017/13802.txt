Designing Sampling Schemes for Multi-Dimensional Data

In this work, we propose a method for determining a non-uniform sampling scheme for multi-dimensional signals by solving a convex optimization problem reminiscent of the sensor selection problem. The resulting sampling scheme minimizes the sum of the Cram√©r-Rao lower bound for the parameters of interest, given a desired number of sampling points. The proposed framework allows for selecting an arbitrary subset of the parameters detailing the model, as well as weighing the importance of the different parameters. Also presented is a scheme for incorporating any imprecise a priori knowledge of the locations of the parameters, as well as defining estimation performance bounds for the parameters of interest. Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
