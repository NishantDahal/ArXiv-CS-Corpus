A Bottom Up Procedure for Text Line Segmentation of Latin Script

In this paper we present a bottom up procedure for segmentation of text lines written or printed in the Latin script. The proposed method uses a combination of image morphology, feature extraction and Gaussian mixture model to perform this task. The experimental results show the validity of the procedure.
