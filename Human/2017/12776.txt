Line codes generated by finite Coxeter groups

Using an algebraic approach based on the theory of Coxeter groups, we design, and describe the performance of, a class of line codes for parallel transmission of $b$ bits over $b+1$ wires that admit especially simple encoding and decoding algorithms. A number of designs are exhibited, some of them being novel or improving on previously obtained codes.
