Internet of Things: An Overview

As technology proceeds and the number of smart devices continues to grow substantially, need for ubiquitous context-aware platforms that support interconnected, heterogeneous, and distributed network of devices has given rise to what is referred today as Internet-of-Things. However, paving the path for achieving aforementioned objectives and making the IoT paradigm more tangible requires integration and convergence of different knowledge and research domains, covering aspects from identification and communication to resource discovery and service integration. Through this chapter, we aim to highlight researches in topics including proposed architectures, security and privacy, network communication means and protocols, and eventually conclude by providing future directions and open challenges facing the IoT development.
