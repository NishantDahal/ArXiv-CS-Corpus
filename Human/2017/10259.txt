Energy Efficiency in Multiuser Transmission Over Parallel Frequency Channels

Energy efficiency is an important design criterion for wireless communications. When parallel frequency channels are used for multiuser transmission, the channel bandwidths and user power are adjusted to maximize the sum information rate with the bandwidth budget, the transmit power budget, and the user-specific rate requirements. The maximum sum rate is used in measuring the energy efficiency. With fixed or flexible bandwidths of the frequency channels, practical methods are developed to find the total transmit power with the unique optimal resource (bandwidth and power) allocation for maximum energy efficiency. This resource allocation ensures that, while each user's minimum rate requirement is satisfied, all the excess resource of the spectrum and transmit power is dedicated to the one user with the best channel quality. Simulation results validate the optimal solutions of total transmit power and resource allocation that support the energy-efficient multiuser transmission.
