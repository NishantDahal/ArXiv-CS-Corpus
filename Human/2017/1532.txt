The second Feng-Rao number for codes coming from telescopic semigroups

In this manuscript we show that the second Feng-Rao number of any telescopic numerical semigroup agrees with the multiplicity of the semigroup. To achieve this result we first study the behavior of Ap√©ry sets under gluings of numerical semigroups. These results provide a bound for the second Hamming weight of one-point Algebraic Geometry codes, which improves upon other estimates such as the Griesmer Order Bound.
