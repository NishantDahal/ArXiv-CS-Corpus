Jamming Resistant Receivers for Massive MIMO

We design jamming resistant receivers to enhance the robustness of a massive MIMO uplink channel against jamming. In the pilot phase, we estimate not only the desired channel, but also the jamming channel by exploiting purposely unused pilot sequences. The jamming channel estimate is used to construct the linear receive filter to reduce impact that jamming has on the achievable rates. The performance of the proposed scheme is analytically and numerically evaluated. These results show that the proposed scheme greatly improves the rates, as compared to conventional receivers. Moreover, the proposed schemes still work well with stronger jamming power.
