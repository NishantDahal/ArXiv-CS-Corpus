Inverse of a Special Matrix and Application

The matrix inversion is an interesting topic in algebra mathematics. However, to determine an inverse matrix from a given matrix is required many computation tools and time resource if the size of matrix is huge. In this paper, we have shown an inverse closed form for an interesting matrix which has much applications in communication system. Base on this inverse closed form, the channel capacity closed form of a communication system can be determined via the error rate parameter alpha
