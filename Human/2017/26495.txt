Exponential Strong Converse for Content Identification with Lossy Recovery

We revisit the high-dimensional content identification with lossy recovery problem (Tuncel and Gündüz, 2014) and establish an exponential strong converse theorem. As a corollary of the exponential strong converse theorem, we derive an upper bound on the joint identification-error and excess-distortion exponent for the problem. Our main results can be specialized to the biometrical identification problem~(Willems, 2003) and the content identification problem~(Tuncel, 2009) since these two problems are both special cases of the content identification with lossy recovery problem. We leverage the information spectrum method introduced by Oohama and adapt the strong converse techniques therein to be applicable to the problem at hand.
