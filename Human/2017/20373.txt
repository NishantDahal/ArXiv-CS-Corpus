A Distributed, Dynamical System View of Finite, Static Games

This paper contains a reformulation of any $n$-player finite, static game into a framework of distributed, dynamical system based on agents' payoff-based deviations. The reformulation generalizes the method employed in the second part of the study of countries' relation formation problem in Li and Morse (2017) to the case of any finite, static game. In the paper two deviation rules are provided and possible applications of this framework are discussed.
