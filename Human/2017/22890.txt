A Public Image Database for Benchmark of Plant Seedling Classification Algorithms

A database of images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages is made publicly available. It comprises annotated RGB images with a physical resolution of roughly 10 pixels per mm. To standardise the evaluation of classification results obtained with the database, a benchmark based on $f_{1}$ scores is proposed. The dataset is available at https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset
