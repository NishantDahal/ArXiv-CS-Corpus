Corrupted Sensing with Sub-Gaussian Measurements

This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a structured signal from a small number of corrupted sub-Gaussian measurements. We consider three different procedures to reconstruct signal and corruption when different kinds of prior knowledge are available. In each case, we provide conditions for stable signal recovery from structured corruption with added unstructured noise. The key ingredient in our analysis is an extended matrix deviation inequality for isotropic sub-Gaussian matrices.
