An Efficient Keyless Fragmentation Algorithm for Data Protection

The family of Information Dispersal Algorithms is applied to distributed systems for secure and reliable storage and transmission. In comparison with perfect secret sharing it achieves a significantly smaller memory overhead and better performance, but provides only incremental confidentiality. Therefore, even if it is not possible to explicitly reconstruct data from less than the required amount of fragments, it is still possible to deduce some information about the nature of data by looking at preserved data patterns inside a fragment. The idea behind this paper is to provide a lightweight data fragmentation scheme, that would combine the space efficiency and simplicity that could be find in Information Dispersal Algorithms with a computational level of data confidentiality.
