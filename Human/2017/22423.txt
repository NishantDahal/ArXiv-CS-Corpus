Neuron-level Selective Context Aggregation for Scene Segmentation

Contextual information provides important cues for disambiguating visually similar pixels in scene segmentation. In this paper, we introduce a neuron-level Selective Context Aggregation (SCA) module for scene segmentation, comprised of a contextual dependency predictor and a context aggregation operator. The dependency predictor is implicitly trained to infer contextual dependencies between different image regions. The context aggregation operator augments local representations with global context, which is aggregated selectively at each neuron according to its on-the-fly predicted dependencies. The proposed mechanism enables data-driven inference of contextual dependencies, and facilitates context-aware feature learning. The proposed method improves strong baselines built upon VGG16 on challenging scene segmentation datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness in modeling context information.
