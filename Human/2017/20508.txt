A Survey on Optical Character Recognition System

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has been a topic of interest for many years. It is defined as the process of digitizing a document image into its constituent characters. Despite decades of intense research, developing OCR with capabilities comparable to that of human still remains an open challenge. Due to this challenging nature, researchers from industry and academic circles have directed their attentions towards Optical Character Recognition. Over the last few years, the number of academic laboratories and companies involved in research on Character Recognition has increased dramatically. This research aims at summarizing the research so far done in the field of OCR. It provides an overview of different aspects of OCR and discusses corresponding proposals aimed at resolving issues of OCR.
