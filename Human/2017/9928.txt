On the Performance of Wireless Powered Communication With Non-linear Energy Harvesting

In this paper, we analyze the performance of a time-slotted multi-antenna wireless powered communication (WPC) system, where a wireless device first harvests radio frequency (RF) energy from a power station (PS) in the downlink to facilitate information transfer to an information receiving station (IRS) in the uplink. The main goal of this paper is to provide insights and guidelines for the design of practical WPC systems. To this end, we adopt a recently proposed parametric non-linear RF energy harvesting (EH) model, which has been shown to accurately model the end-to-end non-linearity of practical RF EH circuits. In order to enhance the RF power transfer efficiency, maximum ratio transmission is adopted at the PS to focus the energy signals on the wireless device. Furthermore, at the IRS, maximum ratio combining is used. We analyze the outage probability and the average throughput of information transfer, assuming Nakagami-$m$ fading uplink and downlink channels. Moreover, we study the system performance as a function of the number of PS transmit antennas, the number of IRS receive antennas, the transmit power of the PS, the fading severity, the transmission rate of the wireless device, and the EH time duration. In addition, we obtain a fixed point equation for the optimal transmission rate and the optimal EH time duration that maximize the asymptotic throughput for high PS transmit powers. All analytical results are corroborated by simulations.
