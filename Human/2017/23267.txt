Location-Aided Coordinated Analog Precoding for Uplink Multi-User Millimeter Wave Systems

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is expected to play an important role in next generation cellular networks, aiming to cope with the bandwidth shortage affecting conventional wireless carriers. Using side-information has been proposed as a potential approach to accelerate beam selection in mmWave massive MIMO (m-MIMO) communications. However, in practice, such information is not error-free, leading to performance degradation. In the multi-user case, a wrong beam choice might result in irreducible inter-user interference at the base station (BS) side. In this paper, we consider location-aided precoder design in a mmWave uplink scenario with multiple users (UEs). Assuming the existence of direct device-to-device (D2D) links, we propose a decentralized coordination mechanism for robust fast beam selection. The algorithm allows for improved treatment of interference at the BS side and in turn leads to greater spectral efficiencies.
