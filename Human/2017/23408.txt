When Cars Meet Distributed Computing: Data Storage as an Example

As cars are ubiquitous they could play a major role in a next generation communication and computation framework. In the last years, the development of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication took huge steps forward and therefore gives us the tools to build "mobile computing service" on cars equipped with computation capabilities. Recently, several groups of researchers independently proposed the design of "vehicular clouds" that materializes the concept. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm of the vehicular clouds, followed by a case study of data storage on top of the proposed cloud. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the intersection of vehicular clouds and distributed computing.
