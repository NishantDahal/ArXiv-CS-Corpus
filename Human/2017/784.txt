Cost estimation of a fixed network deployment over an urban territory

Using theoretical results presented in former papers, two prototypes were developed, aiming at estimating within minutes the cost of a fibre network deployment on a given territory. The first one helps defining the limit of an urban territory and computes mathematical parameters representing its street system. The second one gives global information on a fixed network deployment on this territory, namely the probability distributions of distances and attenuation from a node of the network to the final customer, and an evaluation of the deployment cost, once given an architecture and engineering rules. This allows a final user to easily design various network architectures in the tool, to compare different deployment scenarios, and to optimize the budget and the efficiency of the network in a few minutes. The results were compared on two real French urban territories (in Tours and Rouen) to those given by an optimization tool currently used by Orange.
