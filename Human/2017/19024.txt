Cognitive Connectivity Resilience in Multi-layer Remotely Deployed Mobile Internet of Things

Enabling the Internet of things in remote areas without traditional communication infrastructure requires a multi-layer network architecture. The devices in the overlay network are required to provide coverage to the underlay devices as well as to remain connected to other overlay devices. The coordination, planning, and design of such two-layer heterogeneous networks is an important problem to address. Moreover, the mobility of the nodes and their vulnerability to adversaries pose new challenges to the connectivity. For instance, the connectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., the mobility of the underlay devices or the unavailability of overlay devices due to failure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedback based adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlay network that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to provide reliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Our results show that if sufficient overlay devices are available, the framework leads to a connected configuration that ensures a high coverage of the mobile underlay network. Moreover, the framework can actively reconfigure itself in the event of varying levels of device failure.
