Improved Representation Learning for Predicting Commonsense Ontologies

Recent work in learning ontologies (hierarchical and partially-ordered structures) has leveraged the intrinsic geometry of spaces of learned representations to make predictions that automatically obey complex structural constraints. We explore two extensions of one such model, the order-embedding model for hierarchical relation learning, with an aim towards improved performance on text data for commonsense knowledge representation. Our first model jointly learns ordering relations and non-hierarchical knowledge in the form of raw text. Our second extension exploits the partial order structure of the training data to find long-distance triplet constraints among embeddings which are poorly enforced by the pairwise training procedure. We find that both incorporating free text and augmented training constraints improve over the original order-embedding model and other strong baselines.
