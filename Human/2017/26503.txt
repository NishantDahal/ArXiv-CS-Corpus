Closed-Form Error Analysis on RSS-based Indoor Localization Method

Received Signal Strength (RSS) is considered as a promising measurement for indoor positioning. Lots of RSS-based localization methods have been proposed by its convenience and low cost. This paper focuses on two challenging issues in RSS-based localization schemes: finding optimal localization algorithms and knowing what affects the accuracy of these algorithms. Through theoretical and experimental analysis, we present three important results: 1) we prove that the Non-linear Least Square (NLS) method is efficient to solve the RSS-based localization problem, i.e., its localization error is minimal in theory; 2) we provide a closed-form expression of the localization error for the NLS method. Such an expression reveals the key factors that affect the accuracy of the NLS method; 3) we further conduct a new lower bound of localization error, i.e., the best accuracy achieved possibly. The study of this paper shows the inherent limitation of RSS-based localization schemes and provides guidance for achieving optimal accuracy.
