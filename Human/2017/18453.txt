Imitation Learning for Vision-based Lane Keeping Assistance

This paper aims to investigate direct imitation learning from human drivers for the task of lane keeping assistance in highway and country roads using grayscale images from a single front view camera. The employed method utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to act as a policy that is driving a vehicle. The policy is successfully learned via imitation learning using real-world data collected from human drivers and is evaluated in closed-loop simulated environments, demonstrating good driving behaviour and a robustness for domain changes. Evaluation is based on two proposed performance metrics measuring how well the vehicle is positioned in a lane and the smoothness of the driven trajectory.
