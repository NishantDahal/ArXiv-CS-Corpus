Encoding Bitrate Optimization Using Playback Statistics for HTTP-based Adaptive Video Streaming

HTTP video streaming is in wide use to deliver video over the Internet. With HTTP adaptive steaming, a video playback dynamically selects a video stream from a pre-encoded representation based on available bandwidth and viewport (screen) size. The viewer's video quality is therefore influenced by the encoded bitrates. We minimize the average delivered bitrate subject to a quality lower bound on a per-chunk basis by modeling the probability that a player selects a particular encoding. Through simulation and real-world experiments, the proposed method saves 9.6% of bandwidth while average delivered video quality comparing with state of the art while keeping average delivered video quality.
