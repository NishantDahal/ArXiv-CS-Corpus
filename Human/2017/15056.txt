Smart Bike Sharing System to make the City even Smarter

These last years with the growing population in the smart city demands an efficient transportation sharing (bike sharing) system for developing the smart city. The Bike sharing as we know is affordable, easily accessible and reliable mode of transportation. But an efficient bike sharing capable of not only sharing bike also provides information regarding the availability of bike per station, route business, time/day-wise bike schedule. The embedded sensors are able to opportunistically communicate through wireless communication with stations when available, providing real-time data about tours/minutes, speed, effort, rhythm, etc. We have been based on our study analysis data to predict regarding the bike's available at stations, bike schedule, a location of the nearest hub where a bike is available etc., reduce the user time and effort.
