An Improvement on LSB Matching and LSB Matching Revisited Steganography Methods

The aim of the steganography methods is to communicate securely in a completely undetectable manner. LSB Matching and LSB Matching Revisited steganography methods are two general and esiest methods to achieve this aim. Being secured against first order steganalysis methods is the most important feature of these methods. On the other hand, these methods don't consider inter pixel dependency. Therefore, recently, several steganalysis methods are proposed that by using co-occurrence matrix detect stego images that are hidden by these steganography methods. Therefore, if incremental and decremental operations are done adaptively as causes to less distortion on co-occurrence matrix, these steganography methods will secure against steganalysis methods that use this matrix. In this paper we are going to improve these two steganography methods base on mentioned manner. On the other word, we hide the message in the cover image based on LSB Matching and LSB Matching Revisited method by using adaptive feature. Experimental results show that proposed improvement causes to reduce distortions in co-occurrence matrix and these methods being secure against some steganalysis methods that use this matrix to detect stego images
