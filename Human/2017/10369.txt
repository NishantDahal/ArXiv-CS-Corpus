Structural Resolution: a Framework for Coinductive Proof Search and Proof Construction in Horn Clause Logic

Logic programming (LP) is a programming language based on first-order Horn clause logic that uses SLD-resolution as a semi-decision procedure. Finite SLD-computations are inductively sound and complete with respect to least Herbrand models of logic programs. Dually, the corecursive approach to SLD-resolution views infinite SLD-computations as successively approximating infinite terms contained in programs' greatest complete Herbrand models. State-of-the-art algorithms implementing corecursion in LP are based on loop detection. However, such algorithms support inference of logical entailment only for rational terms, and they do not account for the important property of productivity in infinite SLD-computations. Loop detection thus lags behind coinductive methods in interactive theorem proving (ITP) and term-rewriting systems (TRS).
  Structural resolution is a newly proposed alternative to SLD-resolution that makes it possible to define and semi-decide a notion of productivity appropriate to LP. In this paper, we prove soundness of structural resolution relative to Herbrand model semantics for productive inductive, coinductive, and mixed inductive-coinductive logic programs.
  We introduce two algorithms that support coinductive proof search for infinite productive terms. One algorithm combines the method of loop detection with productive structural resolution, thus guaranteeing productivity of coinductive proofs for infinite rational terms. The other allows to make lazy sound observations of fragments of infinite irrational productive terms. This puts coinductive methods in LP on par with productivity-based observational approaches to coinduction in ITP and TRS.
