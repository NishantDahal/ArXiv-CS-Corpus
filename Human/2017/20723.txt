Aprendendo Programacao Orientada a Objetos com uma Abordagem Ludica Baseada em Greenfoot e Robocode

One the major challenges in undergraduate computing programs is the learning of object-oriented programming (OOP). This paradigm has a variety of concepts with an abstraction level usually high for most beginners, even the ones who already code in an imperative language. Furthermore, transitioning from imperative programming to OOP is a complex issue, with various inappropriate side effects. A significant effort has been pursued in the search of motivating and attractive solutions for such issues. One of those is the use of playful environments that merge games with learning. In this work, we report our experience with OOP learning workshops by means of games, challenges and competitions, supported by Greenfoot and Robocode learning environments. A workshop with sophomore students in a Computer Engineering program is presented here. Lessons learning to motive students include: design of motivating examples, use of competitive challenges, and an appropriate ratio between tutors and students. Results suggest that the workshop was a practical and effective way to introduce OOP and motivate students to learn it.
