The Role of Compliance in Heterogeneous Interacting Agents: Data from Observations

The dynamics of agent-based systems provide a framework to face the complexity of pedestrian-vehicle interactions in future cities, in which the compliance to traffic norms plays a fundamental role. The data of an observation performed at a non-signalized intersection are presented to provide useful insights for supporting the future development of agent-based models. Results focus on drivers' compliance to crossing pedestrians, describing potentially conflictual interactions among heterogeneous agents. The discussion closes with the potential applications of the collected data set for modelling the phenomenon.
