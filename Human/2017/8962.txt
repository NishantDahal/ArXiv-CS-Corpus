A Tropical F5 algorithm

Let K be a field equipped with a valuation. Tropical varieties over K can be defined with a theory of Gr{ö}bner bases taking into account the valuation of K. While generalizing the classical theory of Gr{ö}bner bases, it is not clear how modern algorithms for computing Gr{ö}bner bases can be adapted to the tropical case. Among them, one of the most efficient is the celebrated F5 Algorithm of Faug{è}re. In this article, we prove that, for homogeneous ideals, it can be adapted to the tropical case. We prove termination and correctness. Because of the use of the valuation, the theory of tropical Gr{ö}b-ner bases is promising for stable computations over polynomial rings over a p-adic field. We provide numerical examples to illustrate time-complexity and p-adic stability of this tropical F5 algorithm.
