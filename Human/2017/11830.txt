Swarm Intelligence in Semi-supervised Classification

This Paper represents a literature review of Swarm intelligence algorithm in the area of semi-supervised classification. There are many research papers for applying swarm intelligence algorithms in the area of machine learning. Some algorithms of SI are applied in the area of ML either solely or hybrid with other ML algorithms. SI algorithms are also used for tuning parameters of ML algorithm, or as a backbone for ML algorithms. This paper introduces a brief literature review for applying swarm intelligence algorithms in the field of semi-supervised learning
