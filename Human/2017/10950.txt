On the Performance of Ultra-Reliable Decode and Forward Relaying Under the Finite Blocklength

In this paper, we examine the performance of the decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols with finite blocklength (FB). We provide the overall outage probability of three distinct DF relaying protocols, where the channels are assumed to be quasi static Rayleigh fading. More importantly, we derive the closed form expressions of the outage probability in the three relaying scenarios. We illustrate protocols where the cooperative communications outperform the direct transmission (DT). In addition, we compare the operating efficiency of the cooperative schemes in the ultra-reliable (UR) region.
