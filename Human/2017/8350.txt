Stochastic Feedback Control of Systems with Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics

This paper studies the stochastic optimal control problem for systems with unknown dynamics. First, an open-loop deterministic trajectory optimization problem is solved without knowing the explicit form of the dynamical system. Next, a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is designed for the nominal trajectory-dependent linearized system, such that under a small noise assumption, the actual states remain close to the optimal trajectory. The trajectory-dependent linearized system is identified using input-output experimental data consisting of the impulse responses of the nominal system. A computational example is given to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.
