Analysis of QoS of VoIP Traffic through WiFi-UMTS Networks

Simulation of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) traffic through UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) and WiFi (IEEE 802.11x) alone and together are analysed for Quality of Service (QoS) performance. The average jitter of VoIP transiting the WiFi-UMTS network has been found to be lower than that of either solely through the WiFi and the UMTS networks. It is normally expected to be higher than traversing through the WiFi network only. Both the MOS (Mean Opinion Score) and the packet end-to-end delay were also found to be much lower than expected through the heterogeneous WiFi-UMTS network.
