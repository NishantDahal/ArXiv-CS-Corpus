Java Code Analysis and Transformation into AWS Lambda Functions

Software developers are faced with the issue of either adapting their programming model to the execution model (e.g. cloud platforms) or finding appropriate tools to adapt the model and code automatically. A recent execution model which would benefit from automated enablement is Function-as-a-Service. Automating this process requires a pipeline which includes steps for code analysis, transformation and deployment. In this paper, we outline the design and runtime characteristics of Podilizer, a tool which implements the pipeline specifically for Java source code as input and AWS Lambda as output. We contribute technical and economic metrics about this concrete 'FaaSification' process by observing the behaviour of Podilizer with two representative Java software projects.
