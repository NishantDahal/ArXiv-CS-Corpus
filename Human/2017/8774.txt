Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Elastic Optical Networks using Convex Optimization

We propose a two-stage algorithm for energy-efficient resource allocation constrained to QoS and physical requirements in OFDM-based EONs. The first stage deals with routing, grooming and traffic ordering and aims at minimizing amplifier power consumption and number of active transponders. We provide a heuristic procedure which yields an acceptable solution for the complex ILP formulation of the routing and grooming. In the second stage, we optimize transponder configuration including spectrum and transmit power parameters to minimize transponder power consumption. We show how QoS and transponder power consumption are represented by convex expressions and use the results to formulate a convex problem for configuring transponders in which transmit optical power is an optimization variable. Simulation results demonstrate that the power consumption is reduced by 9% when the proposed routing and grooming algorithm is applied to European Cost239 network with aggregate traffic 60 Tbps. It is shown that our convex formulation for transponder parameter assignment is considerably faster than its MINLP counterpart and its ability to optimize transmit optical power improves transponder power consumption by 8% for aggregate traffic 60 Tbps. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of adaptive modulation assignment and transponder capacity on inherent tradeoff between network CAPEX and OPEX.
