Modulation and Multiple Access for 5G Networks

Fifth generation (5G) wireless networks face various challenges in order to support large-scale heterogeneous traffic and users, therefore new modulation and multiple access (MA) schemes are being developed to meet the changing demands. As this research space is ever increasing, it becomes more important to analyze the various approaches, therefore in this article we present a comprehensive overview of the most promising modulation and MA schemes for 5G networks. We first introduce the different types of modulation that indicate their potential for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes and compare their performance in terms of spectral efficiency, out-of-band leakage, and bit-error rate. We then pay close attention to various types of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) candidates, including power-domain NOMA, code-domain NOMA, and NOMA multiplexing in multiple domains. From this exploration we can identify the opportunities and challenges that will have significant impact on the design of modulation and MA for 5G networks.
