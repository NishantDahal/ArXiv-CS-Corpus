Toward the automated analysis of complex diseases in genome-wide association studies using genetic programming

Machine learning has been gaining traction in recent years to meet the demand for tools that can efficiently analyze and make sense of the ever-growing databases of biomedical data in health care systems around the world. However, effectively using machine learning methods requires considerable domain expertise, which can be a barrier of entry for bioinformaticians new to computational data science methods. Therefore, off-the-shelf tools that make machine learning more accessible can prove invaluable for bioinformaticians. To this end, we have developed an open source pipeline optimization tool (TPOT-MDR) that uses genetic programming to automatically design machine learning pipelines for bioinformatics studies. In TPOT-MDR, we implement Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) as a feature construction method for modeling higher-order feature interactions, and combine it with a new expert knowledge-guided feature selector for large biomedical data sets. We demonstrate TPOT-MDR's capabilities using a combination of simulated and real world data sets from human genetics and find that TPOT-MDR significantly outperforms modern machine learning methods such as logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We further analyze the best pipeline discovered by TPOT-MDR for a real world problem and highlight TPOT-MDR's ability to produce a high-accuracy solution that is also easily interpretable.
