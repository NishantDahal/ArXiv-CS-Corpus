Rotation Symmetric Bent Boolean Functions for n = 2p

It has been conjectured that there are no homogeneous rotation symmetric bent Boolean functions of degree greater than two. In this paper we begin by proving that sums of short-cycle rotation symmetric bent Boolean functions must contain a specific degree two monomial rotation symmetric Boolean function. We then prove most cases of the conjecture in n=2p, p>2 prime, variables and extend this work to the nonhomogeneous case.
