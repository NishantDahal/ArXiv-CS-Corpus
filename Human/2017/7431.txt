ParaGraphE: A Library for Parallel Knowledge Graph Embedding

Knowledge graph embedding aims at translating the knowledge graph into numerical representations by transforming the entities and relations into continuous low-dimensional vectors. Recently, many methods [1, 5, 3, 2, 6] have been proposed to deal with this problem, but existing single-thread implementations of them are time-consuming for large-scale knowledge graphs. Here, we design a unified parallel framework to parallelize these methods, which achieves a significant time reduction without influencing the accuracy. We name our framework as ParaGraphE, which provides a library for parallel knowledge graph embedding.
