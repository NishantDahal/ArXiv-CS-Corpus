Classifying document types to enhance search and recommendations in digital libraries

In this paper, we address the problem of classifying documents available from the global network of (open access) repositories according to their type. We show that the metadata provided by repositories enabling us to distinguish research papers, thesis and slides are missing in over 60% of cases. While these metadata describing document types are useful in a variety of scenarios ranging from research analytics to improving search and recommender (SR) systems, this problem has not yet been sufficiently addressed in the context of the repositories infrastructure. We have developed a new approach for classifying document types using supervised machine learning based exclusively on text specific features. We achieve 0.96 F1-score using the random forest and Adaboost classifiers, which are the best performing models on our data. By analysing the SR system logs of the CORE [1] digital library aggregator, we show that users are an order of magnitude more likely to click on research papers and thesis than on slides. This suggests that using document types as a feature for ranking/filtering SR results in digital libraries has the potential to improve user experience.
