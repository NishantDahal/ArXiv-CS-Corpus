A Distributed Method for Optimal Capacity Reservation

We consider the problem of reserving link capacity in a network in such a way that any of a given set of flow scenarios can be supported. In the optimal capacity reservation problem, we choose the reserved link capacities to minimize the reservation cost. This problem reduces to a large linear program, with the number of variables and constraints on the order of the number of links times the number of scenarios. Small and medium size problems are within the capabilities of generic linear program solvers. We develop a more scalable, distributed algorithm for the problem that alternates between solving (in parallel) one flow problem per scenario, and coordination steps, which connect the individual flows and the reservation capacities.
