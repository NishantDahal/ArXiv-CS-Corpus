Noninvasive Corneal Image-Based Gaze Measurement System

Gaze tracking is an important technology as the system can give information about a person from what and where the person is seeing. There have been many attempts to make robust and accurate gaze trackers using either monitor or wearable devices. However, those contraptions often require fine individual calibration per session and/or require a person wearing a device, which may not be suitable for certain situations. In this paper, we propose a robust and a completely noninvasive gaze tracking system that involves neither complex calibrations nor the use of wearable devices. We achieve this via direct eye reflection analysis by building a real-time system that effectively enables it. We also show several interesting applications for our system including experiments with young children.
