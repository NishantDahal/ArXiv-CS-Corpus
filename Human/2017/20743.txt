Porcellio scaber algorithm (PSA) for solving constrained optimization problems

In this paper, we extend a bio-inspired algorithm called the porcellio scaber algorithm (PSA) to solve constrained optimization problems, including a constrained mixed discrete-continuous nonlinear optimization problem. Our extensive experiment results based on benchmark optimization problems show that the PSA has a better performance than many existing methods or algorithms. The results indicate that the PSA is a promising algorithm for constrained optimization.
