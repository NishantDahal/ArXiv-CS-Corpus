An Efficient Reconfigurable FIR Digital Filter Using Modified Distribute Arithmetic Technique

This paper provides modified Distributed Arithmetic based technique to compute sum of products saving appreciable number of Multiply And accumulation blocks and this consecutively reduces circuit size. In this technique multiplexer based structure is used to reuse the blocks so as to reduce the required memory locations. In this technique a Carry Look Ahead based adder tree is used to have better area-delay product. Designing of FIR filter is done using VHDL and synthesized using Xilinx 12.2 synthesis tool and ISIM simulator. The power analysis is done using Xilinx Xpower analyzer. The proposed structure requires nearly 42% less cells, 40% less LUT flip-flop pairs used, and also 2% less power compared with existing structure.
