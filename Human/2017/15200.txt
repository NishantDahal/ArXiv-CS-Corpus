Study of Clear Sky Models for Singapore

The estimation of total solar irradiance falling on the earth's surface is important in the field of solar energy generation and forecasting. Several clear-sky solar radiation models have been developed over the last few decades. Most of these models are based on empirical distribution of various geographical parameters; while a few models consider various atmospheric effects in the solar energy estimation. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of several popular clear-sky models, in the tropical region of Singapore. This is important in countries like Singapore, where we are primarily focused on reliable and efficient solar energy generation. We analyze and compare three popular clear-sky models that are widely used in the literature. We validate our solar estimation results using actual solar irradiance measurements obtained from collocated weather stations. We finally conclude the most reliable clear sky model for Singapore, based on all clear sky days in a year.
