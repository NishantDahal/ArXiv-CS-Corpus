Coding for Arbitrarily Varying Remote Sources

We study a lossy source coding problem for a memoryless remote source. The source data is broadcast over an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) controlled by an adversary. One output of the AVC is received as input at the encoder, and another output is received as side information at the decoder. The adversary is assumed to know the source data non-causally, and can employ randomized jamming strategies arbitrarily correlated to the source data. The decoder reconstructs the source data from the encoded message and the side information. We prove upper and lower bounds on the adversarial rate distortion function for the source under randomized coding. Furthermore, we present some interesting special cases of our general setup where the above bounds coincide, and thus, provide their complete rate distortion function characterization.
