IEEE 802.11ad-based Radar: An Approach to Joint Vehicular Communication-Radar System

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is widely used in vehicles for applications such as adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose an IEEE 802.11ad-based radar for long-range radar (LRR) applications at the 60 GHz unlicensed band. We exploit the preamble of a single-carrier (SC) physical layer (PHY) frame, which consists of Golay complementary sequences with good correlation properties, as a radar waveform. This system enables a joint waveform for automotive radar and a potential mmWave vehicular communication system based on IEEE 802.11ad, allowing hardware reuse. To formulate an integrated framework of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and LRR based on a mmWave consumer wireless local area network (WLAN) standard, we make typical assumptions for LRR applications and incorporate the full duplex radar assumption due to the possibility of sufficient isolation and self-interference cancellation. We develop single- and multi-frame radar receiver algorithms for target detection as well as range and velocity estimation within a coherent processing interval. Our proposed radar processing algorithms leverage channel estimation and time-frequency synchronization techniques used in a conventional IEEE 802.11ad receiver with minimal modifications. Analysis and simulations show that in a single target scenario, a Gbps data rate is achieved simultaneously with cm-level range accuracy and cm/s-level velocity accuracy. The target vehicle is detected with a high probability of detection ($>$99.9$\%$) at a low false alarm of 10$^{-6}$ for an equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 43 dBm up to a vehicle separation distance of 200 m.
