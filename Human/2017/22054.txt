A Survey of Learning Management Systems and Synchronous Distance Education Tools

Although compelling assessments have been quite frequently examined in recent years, more studies are required to yield a better understanding of several Distance Learning (DL) methods where Learning Management Systems (LMSs) significantly affect student learning process. Most studies in this area do not consider the effect of varying web-facilitated DL application tools. To address these drawbacks, the objective of our study is to compare two LMSs and four synchronous distance education tools (SDET). The comparisons confirm the superiority of Moodle Integrated Synchrotrons Teaching Conferencing (MIST/C), which seems to be the most practical, convenient and modest distance education tool offered in the market today because it is open source and has a second mirrored whiteboard for simulteaching that is not available with any other system.
