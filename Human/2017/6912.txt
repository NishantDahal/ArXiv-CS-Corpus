Constant Modulus Beamforming via Convex Optimization

We present novel convex-optimization-based solutions to the problem of blind beamforming of constant modulus signals, and to the related problem of linearly constrained blind beamforming of constant modulus signals. These solutions ensure global optimality and are parameter free, namely, do not contain any tuneable parameters and do not require any a-priori parameter settings. The performance of these solutions, as demonstrated by simulated data, is superior to existing methods.
