Fast Simplified Successive-Cancellation List Decoding of Polar Codes

Polar codes are capacity achieving error correcting codes that can be decoded through the successive-cancellation algorithm. To improve its error-correction performance, a list-based version called successive-cancellation list (SCL) has been proposed in the past, that however substantially increases the number of time-steps in the decoding process. The simplified SCL (SSCL) decoding algorithm exploits constituent codes within the polar code structure to greatly reduce the required number of time-steps without introducing any error-correction performance loss. In this paper, we propose a faster decoding approach to decode one of these constituent codes, the Rate-1 node. We use this Rate-1 node decoder to develop Fast-SSCL. We demonstrate that only a list-size-bound number of bits needs to be estimated in Rate-1 nodes and Fast-SSCL exactly matches the error-correction performance of SCL and SSCL. This technique can potentially greatly reduce the total number of time-steps needed for polar codes decoding: analysis on a set of case studies show that Fast-SSCL has a number of time-steps requirement that is up to 66.6% lower than SSCL and 88.1% lower than SCL.
