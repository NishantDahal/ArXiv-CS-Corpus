Strong Coordination of Signals and Actions over Noisy Channels

-We develop a random binning scheme for strong coordination in a network of two nodes separated by a noisy channel, in which the input and output signals have to be coordinated with the source and its reconstruction. In the case of non-causal encoding and decoding, we propose a joint source-channel coding scheme and develop inner and outer bounds for the strong coordination region. While the set of achievable target distributions is the same as for empirical coordination, we characterize the rate of common randomness required for strong coordination.
