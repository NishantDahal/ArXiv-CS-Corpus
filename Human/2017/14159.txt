Logically automorphically equivalent knowledge bases

Knowledge bases theory provide an important example of the field where applications of universal algebra and algebraic logic look very natural, and their interaction with practical problems arising in computer science might be very productive.
  In this paper we study the equivalence problem for knowledge bases. Our interest is to find out how the informational equivalence is related to the logical description of knowledge. Studying various equivalences of knowledge bases allows us to compare different knowledge bases. The main objective of this paper is logically automorphically equivalent knowledge bases. As we will see this notion gives us a good enough characterization of knowledge bases.
