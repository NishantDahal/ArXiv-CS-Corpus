Finite-Time Stabilization of Longitudinal Control for Autonomous Vehicles via a Model-Free Approach

This communication presents a longitudinal model-free control approach for computing the wheel torque command to be applied on a vehicle. This setting enables us to overcome the problem of unknown vehicle parameters for generating a suitable control law. An important parameter in this control setting is made time-varying for ensuring finite-time stability. Several convincing computer simulations are displayed and discussed. Overshoots become therefore smaller. The driving comfort is increased and the robustness to time-delays is improved.
