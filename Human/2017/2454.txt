Evolution-Preserving Dense Trajectory Descriptors

Recently Trajectory-pooled Deep-learning Descriptors were shown to achieve state-of-the-art human action recognition results on a number of datasets. This paper improves their performance by applying rank pooling to each trajectory, encoding the temporal evolution of deep learning features computed along the trajectory. This leads to Evolution-Preserving Trajectory (EPT) descriptors, a novel type of video descriptor that significantly outperforms Trajectory-pooled Deep-learning Descriptors. EPT descriptors are defined based on dense trajectories, and they provide complimentary benefits to video descriptors that are not based on trajectories. In particular, we show that the combination of EPT descriptors and VideoDarwin leads to state-of-the-art performance on Hollywood2 and UCF101 datasets.
