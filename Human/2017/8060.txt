Models and termination of proof reduction in the $λ$$Π$-calculus modulo theory

We define a notion of model for the $λ$$Π$-calculus modulo theory and prove a soundness theorem. We then define a notion of super-consistency and prove that proof reduction terminates in the $λ$$Π$-calculus modulo any super-consistent theory. We prove this way the termination of proof reduction in several theories including Simple type theory and the Calculus of constructions .
