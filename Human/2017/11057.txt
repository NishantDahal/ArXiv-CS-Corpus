A Bayesian algorithm for detecting identity matches and fraud in image databases

A statistical algorithm for categorizing different types of matches and fraud in image databases is presented. The approach is based on a generative model of a graph representing images and connections between pairs of identities, trained using properties of a matching algorithm between images.
