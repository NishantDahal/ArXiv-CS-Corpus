Proceedings 13th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic

This volume contains the proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2016), which was held June 6-10, 2016 at the University of Strathclyde. QPL is a conference that brings together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas, with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to the study of physical behaviour in general.
