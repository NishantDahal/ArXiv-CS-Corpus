Working Locally Thinking Globally - Part II: Stability and Algorithms for Convolutional Sparse Coding

The convolutional sparse model has recently gained increasing attention in the signal and image processing communities, and several methods have been proposed for solving the pursuit problem emerging from it -- in particular its convex relaxation, Basis Pursuit. In the first of this two-part work, we have provided a theoretical back-bone for this model, providing guarantees for the uniqueness of the sparsest solution and for the success of pursuit algorithms by introducing the notion of stripe sparsity and other related measures. Herein, we extend the analysis to a noisy regime, thereby considering signal perturbations and model deviations. We address questions of stability of the sparsest solutions and the success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex. Classical definitions such as the RIP are generalized to the convolutional model, and existing notions such as the ERC are connected to our setting. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment.
