Optimal performance of heterogeneous networks bases on the bit rate

Networks Lte(4G) and Wi-Fi complementarity establishes a heterogeneous system of wireless and mobile networks. We study and analyze the optimal performances of this heterogeneous system based on the bit rate, the blocking probability and user connection loss. Random Waypoint (RWP) is the user mobility model. Users provided mobile terminal equipped with multiple accesses interfaces. We developed a Markov chain to estimate the performances obtained from the heterogeneous networks system, which allowed us to propose an average bit rate value in a sub-zone of this system then the average blocking probability user connection in this zone. We also proposed a sensitivity factor of maximal decrease of these selection network parameters. This factor informs about the heterogeneous networks congestion and dis-congestion system.
