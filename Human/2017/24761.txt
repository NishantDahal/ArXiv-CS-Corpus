Density-aware Dynamic Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges

We experience a major paradigm change in mobile networks. The infrastructure of cellular networks becomes mobile as it is densified by using mobile and nomadic small cells to increase coverage and capacity. Furthermore, the innovative approaches such as green operation through sleep scheduling, user-controlled small cells, and end-to-end slicing will make the network highly dynamic. Mobile cells, while bringing many benefits, introduce many unconventional challenges that we present in this paper. We have to introduce novel techniques for adapting network functions, communication protocols and their parameters to network density. Especially when cells on wheels or wings are considered, static and man-made configurations will waste valuable resources such as spectrum or energy if density is not considered as an optimization parameter. In this paper, we present the existing density estimators. We analyze the impact of density on coverage, interference, mobility management, scalability, capacity, caching, routing protocols and energy consumption. We evaluate nomadic cells in dynamic networks in a comprehensive way and illustrate the potential objectives we can achieve by adapting mobile networks to base station density. The main challenges we may face by employing dynamic networks and how we can tackle these problems are discussed in detail.
