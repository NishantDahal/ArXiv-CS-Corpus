On distance r-dominating and 2r-independent sets in sparse graphs

Dvorak (2013) gave a bound on the minimum size of a distance r dominating set in the terms of the maximum size of a distance 2r independent set and generalized coloring numbers, thus obtaining a constant factor approximation algorithm for the parameters in any class of graphs with bounded expansion. We improve and clarify this dependence using an LP-based argument inspired by the work of Bansal and Umboh (2017).
