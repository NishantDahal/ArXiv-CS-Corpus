TableQA: Question Answering on Tabular Data

Tabular data is difficult to analyze and to search through, yielding for new tools and interfaces that would allow even non tech-savvy users to gain insights from open datasets without resorting to specialized data analysis tools or even without having to fully understand the dataset structure. The goal of our demonstration is to showcase answering natural language questions from tabular data, and to discuss related system configuration and model training aspects. Our prototype is publicly available and open-sourced (see https://svakulenko.ai.wu.ac.at/tableqa).
