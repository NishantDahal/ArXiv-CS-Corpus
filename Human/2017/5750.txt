Time and Frequency Domain Investigation of Selected Memristor based Analog Circuits

In this paper, we investigate few memristor-based analog circuits namely the phase shift oscillator, integrator, and differentiator which have been explored numerously using the traditional lumped components. We use LTspice-IV platform for simulation of the above-said circuits. The investigation resorts to the nonlinear dopant drift model of memristor and the window function portrayed in the literature for nonlinearity realization. The results of our investigations depict good agreement with the conventional lumped component based phase shift oscillator, integrator, and differentiator circuits. The results are evident to showcase the potential of the memristor as a promising candidate for the next generation analog circuits.
