Paving the Way to Smart Micro Energy Internet: Concepts, Design Principles, and Engineering Practices

The energy internet is one of the most promising future energy infrastructures that could both enhance energy efficiency and improve its operating flexibility. Analogous to the micro-grid, the micro energy internet emphasizes the distribution level and demand side. This paper proposes concepts and design principles of a smart micro energy internet for accommodating micro-grids, distributed poly-generation systems, energy storage facilities, and associated energy distribution infrastructures. Since the dispatch and control system of the smart micro energy internet is responsible for external disturbances, it should be able to approach a satisfactory operating point while supporting multiple criteria, such as safety, economy, and environmental protection. To realize the vision of a smart micro energy internet, an engineering game theory based energy management system with self-approaching-optimum capability is investigated. Based on the proposed concepts, design principles, and energy management system, this paper presents a prototype of China's first conceptual solar-based smart micro energy internet, established in Qinghai University.
