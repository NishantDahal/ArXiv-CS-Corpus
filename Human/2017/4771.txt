A Low-Complexity Adaptive Multisine Waveform Design for Wireless Power Transfer

Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in the last decade. Recently, channel-adaptive waveforms have been shown to significantly increase the DC power level at the output of the rectifier. However the design of those waveforms is generally computationally complex and does not lend itself easily to practical implementation. We here propose a low-complexity channel-adaptive multisine waveform design whose performance is very close to that of the optimal design. Performance evaluations confirm the benefits of the new design in various rectifier topologies.
