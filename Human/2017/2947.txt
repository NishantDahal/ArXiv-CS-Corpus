Ultra Reliable Short Message Relaying with Wireless Power Transfer

We consider a dual-hop wireless network where an energy constrained relay node first harvests energy through the received radio-frequency signal from the source, and then uses the harvested energy to forward the source's information to the destination node. The throughput and delay metrics are investigated for a decode-and-forward relaying mechanism at finite blocklength regime and delay-limited transmission mode. We consider ultra-reliable communication scenarios under discussion for the next fifth-generation of wireless systems, with error and latency constraints. The impact on these metrics of the blocklength, information bits, and relay position is investigated.
