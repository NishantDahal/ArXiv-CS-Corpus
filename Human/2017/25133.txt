Migrate when necessary: toward partitioned reclaiming for soft real-time tasks

This paper presents a new strategy for scheduling soft real-time tasks on multiple identical cores. The proposed approach is based on partitioned CPU reservations and it uses a reclaiming mechanism to reduce the number of missed deadlines. We introduce the possibility for a task to temporarily migrate to another, less charged, CPU when it has exhausted the reserved bandwidth on its allocated CPU. In addition, we propose a simple load balancing method to decrease the number of deadlines missed by the tasks. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated through simulations, showing its effectiveness (compared to other multi-core reclaiming approaches) and comparing the performance of different partitioning heuristics (Best Fit, Worst Fit and First Fit).
