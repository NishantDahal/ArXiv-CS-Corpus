Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer (SLIPT) for Indoor IoT Applications

We present the concept of Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer (SLIPT) for indoor Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Specifically, we propose novel and fundamental SLIPT strategies, which can be implemented through Visible Light or Infrared communication systems, equipped with a simple solar panel-based receiver. These strategies are performed at the transmitter or at the receiver, or at both sides, named Adjusting transmission, Adjusting reception and Coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception, correspondingly. Furthermore, we deal with the fundamental trade-off between harvested energy and quality-of-service (QoS), by maximizing the harvested energy, while achieving the required user's QoS. To this end, two optimization problems are formulated and optimally solved. Computer simulations validate the optimum solutions and reveal that the proposed strategies considerably increase the harvested energy, compared to SLIPT with fixed policies.
