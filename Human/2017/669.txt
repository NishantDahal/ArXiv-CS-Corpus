hMDAP: A Hybrid Framework for Multi-paradigm Data Analytical Processing on Spark

We propose hMDAP, a hybrid framework for large-scale data analytical processing on Spark, to support multi-paradigm process (incl. OLAP, machine learning, and graph analysis etc.) in distributed environments. The framework features a three-layer data process module and a business process module which controls the former. We will demonstrate the strength of hMDAP by using traffic scenarios in a real world.
