Big Data is about the capture, storage, analysis and visualization of huge volumes of data in both structured and unstructured forms generated from a myriad of applications and devices in a wide set of scenarios. Focusing on the need of academia to develop professional posing the competencies that industry demands, the paper presents the approach adopted by the Faculty of Computer Sciences at Ã˜stfold University College, Norway to deploy Big Data related contents throughout its studies in the computing field. This paper describes initiatives in bachelor and master programs along with continuous education courses with regards to Big Data topics. New master courses were implemented in the 2014-2015 academic year, while bachelor and continuous education courses will be deployed the year after.
