Cell-Free and User-Centric Massive MIMO at Millimeter Wave Frequencies

In a cell-free (CF) massive MIMO architecture a very large number of distributed access points (APs) simultaneously and jointly serves a much smaller number of mobile stations (MSs); a variant of the cell-free technique is the user-centric (UC) approach, wherein each AP just decodes a reduced set of MSs, practically the ones that are received best. This paper introduces and analyzes the CF and UC architectures at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. First of all, a multiuser clustered channel model is introduced in order to account for the correlation among the channels of nearby users; then, an uplink multiuser channel estimation scheme is described along with low-complexity hybrid analog/digital beamforming architectures. Interestingly, in the proposed scheme no channel estimation is needed at the MSs, and the beamforming schemes used at the MSs are channel-independent and have a very simple structure. Numerical results show that the considered architectures provide good performance, especially in lightly loaded systems, with the UC approach outperforming the CF one.
