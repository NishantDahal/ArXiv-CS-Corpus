Data Warehouse Benchmarking with DWEB

Performance evaluation is a key issue for designers and users of Database Management Systems (DBMSs). Performance is generally assessed with software benchmarks that help, e.g., test architectural choices, compare different technologies or tune a system. In the particular context of data warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP), although the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) aims at issuing standard decision-support benchmarks, few benchmarks do actually exist. We present in this chapter the Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB), which allows generating various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized to fulfill various data warehouse design needs. However, two levels of parameterization keep it relatively easy to tune. We also expand on our previous work on DWEB by presenting its new Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) feature as well as its new execution protocol. A Java implementation of DWEB is freely available on-line, which can be interfaced with most existing relational DMBSs. To the best of our knowledge, DWEB is the only easily available, up-to-date benchmark for data warehouses.
