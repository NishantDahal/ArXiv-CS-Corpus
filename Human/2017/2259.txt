Optimal Non-uniform Deployments in Ultra-Dense Finite-Area Cellular Networks

Network densification and heterogenisation through the deployment of small cellular access points (picocells and femtocells) are seen as key mechanisms in handling the exponential increase in cellular data traffic. Modelling such networks by leveraging tools from Stochastic Geometry has proven particularly useful in understanding the fundamental limits imposed on network coverage and capacity by co-channel interference. Most of these works however assume infinite sized and uniformly distributed networks on the Euclidean plane. In contrast, we study finite sized non-uniformly distributed networks, and find the optimal non-uniform distribution of access points which maximises network coverage for a given non-uniform distribution of mobile users, and vice versa.
