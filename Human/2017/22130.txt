Self-Organizing Maps Classification with Application to Laptop's Adapters Magnetic Field

This paper presents an application of the Self-Organizing-Map classification method, which is used for classification of the extremely low frequency magnetic field emission in the near neighborhood of the laptop adapters. The experiment is performed on different laptop adapters of the same characteristics. After that, the Self-Organizing-Map classification on the obtained emission data is performed. The classification results establish the typical emission levels of the laptop adapters, which are far above the safety standards' limit. At the end, a discussion is carried out about the importance of using the classification as a possible solution for safely use the laptop adapters in order to reduce the negative effects of the magnetic field emission to the laptop users.
