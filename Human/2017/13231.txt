Effects of Network Structure on the Performance of a Modeled Traffic Network under Drivers' Bounded Rationality

We propose a minority route choice game to investigate the effect of the network structure on traffic network performance under the assumption of drivers' bounded rationality. We investigate ring-and-hub topologies to capture the nature of traffic networks in cities, and employ a minority game-based inductive learning process to model the characteristic behavior under the route choice scenario. Through numerical experiments, we find that topological changes in traffic networks induce a phase transition from an uncongested phase to a congested phase. Understanding this phase transition is helpful in planning new traffic networks.
