The 2017 Hands in the Million Challenge on 3D Hand Pose Estimation

We present the 2017 Hands in the Million Challenge, a public competition designed for the evaluation of the task of 3D hand pose estimation. The goal of this challenge is to assess how far is the state of the art in terms of solving the problem of 3D hand pose estimation as well as detect major failure and strength modes of both systems and evaluation metrics that can help to identify future research directions. The challenge follows up the recent publication of BigHand2.2M and First-Person Hand Action datasets, which have been designed to exhaustively cover multiple hand, viewpoint, hand articulation, and occlusion. The challenge consists of a standardized dataset, an evaluation protocol for two different tasks, and a public competition. In this document we describe the different aspects of the challenge and, jointly with the results of the participants, it will be presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Observing and Understanding Hands in Action, HANDS 2017, with ICCV 2017.
