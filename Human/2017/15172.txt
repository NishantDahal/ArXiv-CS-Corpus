13th European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC 2017): Fast Abstracts and Student Forum Proceedings

Fast Abstracts are short presentations of work in progress or opinion pieces and aim to serve as a rapid and flexible mechanism to (i) Report on current work that may or may not be complete; (ii) Introduce new ideas to the community; (iii) State positions on controversial issues or open problems. Student Forum is a vibrant and friendly environment where students can present their work, exchange ideas and experiences, get feedback on their work, get new inspirations and points of view. In addition, the forum stimulates interaction between young researchers, experienced researchers, and industry.
