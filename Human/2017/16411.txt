Challenges & Solutions for above 6 GHz Radio Access Network Integration for Future Mobile Communication Systems

Mobile communication technology has been rapidly evolving ever since its first introduction in the late 1980s. The development witnessed is not just in the refinement of the radio access techniques, but also in the progression towards offering sophisticated features and services to the mobile phone users. To fulfill this ever-growing user demand and market trends, frequency ranges in millimeter wave bands are envisioned for wireless radio transmission. To respond to this trends, the EU-funded mmMAGIC project has been launched and its main objective is to design and develop radio access techniques operating in 6-100 GHz bands. When it comes to developing technologies for systems operating these frequency ranges, a major challenge encountered will be in terms of its radio access network integration. Unquestionably, issues at various aspects of physical layer design, channel modelling, architecture, network functions and deployment will be encountered; problems in multi-node and multi-antenna transceiver designs will surface as well. The work carried in this project will address those challenges and propose solutions; but additionally, measure its efficiency against the project specific KPIs set to meet the requirements of the operational future 5G systems. The main intention of this paper is to outline some of the challenges, more specifically to highlight the network integration challenges, and discuss some of its technical solutions. The primary purpose here is to focus towards integrated 5G technology, thereby opening further research avenues for the exploration of new and alternate frequency bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.
