Computing in Memory with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM

In-memory computing is a promising approach to addressing the processor-memory data transfer bottleneck in computing systems. We propose Spin-Transfer Torque Compute-in-Memory (STT-CiM), a design for in-memory computing with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM). The unique properties of spintronic memory allow multiple wordlines within an array to be simultaneously enabled, opening up the possibility of directly sensing functions of the values stored in multiple rows using a single access. We propose modifications to STT-MRAM peripheral circuits that leverage this principle to perform logic, arithmetic, and complex vector operations. We address the challenge of reliable in-memory computing under process variations by extending ECC schemes to detect and correct errors that occur during CiM operations. We also address the question of how STT-CiM should be integrated within a general-purpose computing system. To this end, we propose architectural enhancements to processor instruction sets and on-chip buses that enable STT-CiM to be utilized as a scratchpad memory. Finally, we present data mapping techniques to increase the effectiveness of STT-CiM. We evaluate STT-CiM using a device-to-architecture modeling framework, and integrate cycle-accurate models of STT-CiM with a commercial processor and on-chip bus (Nios II and Avalon from Intel). Our system-level evaluation shows that STT-CiM provides system-level performance improvements of 3.93x on average (upto 10.4x), and concurrently reduces memory system energy by 3.83x on average (upto 12.4x).
