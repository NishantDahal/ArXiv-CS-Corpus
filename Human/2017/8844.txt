Ground state entanglement entropy for discrete-time two coupled harmonic oscillators

The ground state entanglement of the system, both in discrete-time and continuous-time cases, is quantified through the linear entropy. The result shows that the entanglement increases as the interaction between the particles increases in both time scales. It is also found that the strength of the harmonic potential affects the formation rate of the entanglement of the system. The different feature of the entanglement between continuous-time and discrete-time scales is that, for discrete-time entanglement, there is a cut-off condition. This condition implies that the system can never be in a maximally entangled state.
