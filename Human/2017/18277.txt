WOAH: Preliminaries to Zero-shot Ontology Learning for Conversational Agents

The present paper presents the Weighted Ontology Approximation Heuristic (WOAH), a novel zero-shot approach to ontology estimation for conversational agents development environments. This methodology extracts verbs and nouns separately from data by distilling the dependencies obtained and applying similarity and sparsity metrics to generate an ontology estimation configurable in terms of the level of generalization.
