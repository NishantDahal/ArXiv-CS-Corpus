Massive MIMO-Enabled Full-Duplex Cellular Networks

In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework for the study of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-enabled full-duplex (FD) cellular networks in which the self-interference (SI) channels follow the Rician distribution and other channels are Rayleigh distributed. To facilitate bi-directional wireless functionality, we adopt (i) a downlink (DL) linear zero-forcing with self-interference-nulling (ZF-SIN) precoding scheme at the FD base stations (BSs), and (ii) an uplink (UL) self-interference-aware (SIA) fractional power control mechanism at the FD user equipments (UEs). Linear ZF receivers are further utilized for signal detection in the UL. The results indicate that the UL rate bottleneck in the baseline FD single-antenna system can be overcome via exploiting massive MIMO. On the other hand, the findings may be viewed as a reality-check, since we show that, under state-of-the-art system parameters, the spectral efficiency (SE) gain of FD massive MIMO over its half-duplex (HD) counterpart largely depends on the SI cancellation capability of the UEs. In addition, the anticipated two-fold increase in SE is shown to be only achievable with an infinitely large number of antennas.
