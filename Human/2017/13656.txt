Review: Modeling and Classical Controller Of Quad-rotor

This paper presents an overview of the most effective ideas for the Quad-rotor project. The concept of modeling using different methods is presented. The modeling part presented the nonlinear model, and the concept of linearization using small disturbance theory. Parameter identifications part explained the most important parameters that affect the system stability and tried to get suitable solutions for these problems and identify some parameters experimentally. Data filtration, Kalman filter, Structure design, motor distribution, aerodynamic effect, analysis of shroud and its effect on the resultant thrust were explained. The control part incorporates different classical schemes such as PD and PID controllers to stabilize the Quad-rotor. Also, different ideas are presented to stabilize the quad rotor using PID controllers with some modification to get high maneuverability and better performance.
