Smart Guiding Glasses for Visually Impaired People in Indoor Environment

To overcome the travelling difficulty for the visually impaired group, this paper presents a novel ETA (Electronic Travel Aids)-smart guiding device in the shape of a pair of eyeglasses for giving these people guidance efficiently and safely. Different from existing works, a novel multi sensor fusion based obstacle avoiding algorithm is proposed, which utilizes both the depth sensor and ultrasonic sensor to solve the problems of detecting small obstacles, and transparent obstacles, e.g. the French door. For totally blind people, three kinds of auditory cues were developed to inform the direction where they can go ahead. Whereas for weak sighted people, visual enhancement which leverages the AR (Augment Reality) technique and integrates the traversable direction is adopted. The prototype consisting of a pair of display glasses and several low cost sensors is developed, and its efficiency and accuracy were tested by a number of users. The experimental results show that the smart guiding glasses can effectively improve the user's travelling experience in complicated indoor environment. Thus it serves as a consumer device for helping the visually impaired people to travel safely.
