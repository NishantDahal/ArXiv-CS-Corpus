Odd holes in bull-free graphs

The complexity of testing whether a graph contains an induced odd cycle of length at least five is currently unknown. In this paper we show that this can be done in polynomial time if the input graph has no induced subgraph isomorphic to the bull (a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges).
