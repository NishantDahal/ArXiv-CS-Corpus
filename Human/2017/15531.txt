Simplified Cooperative Detection for Multi-Receiver Molecular Communication

Diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems experience significant reliability losses. To boost the reliability, an MC scheme where multiple receivers (RXs) work cooperatively to decide the signal of a transmitter (TX) by sending the same type of molecules to a fusion center (FC) is proposed in this paper. The FC observes the total number of molecules received and compares this number with a threshold to determine the TX's signal. The proposed scheme is more bio-realistic and requires relatively low computational complexity compared to existing cooperative schemes where the RXs send and the FC recognizes different types of molecules. Asymmetric and symmetric topologies are considered, and closed-form expressions are derived for the global error probability for both topologies. Results show that the trade-off for simplified computations leads to a slight reduction in error performance, compared to the existing cooperative schemes.
