Beyond WYSIWYG: Sharing Contextual Sensing Data Through mmWave V2V Communications

In vehicular scenarios context awareness is a key enabler for road safety. However, the amount of contextual information that can be collected by a vehicle is stringently limited by the sensor technology itself (e.g., line-of-sight, coverage, weather robustness) and by the low bandwidths offered by current wireless vehicular technologies such as DSRC/802.11p. Motivated by the upsurge of research around millimeter-wave vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications, in this work we propose a distributed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) association scheme that considers a quantitative measure of the potential value of the shared contextual information in the pairing process. First, we properly define the utility function of every vehicle balancing classical channel state and queuing state information (CSI/QSI) with context information i.e., sensing content resolution, timeliness and enhanced range of the sensing. Next we solve the problem via a distributed many-to-one matching game in a junction scenario with realistic vehicular mobility traces. It is shown that when receivers are able to leverage information from different sources, the average volume of collected extended sensed information under our proposed scheme is up to 71% more than that of distance and minimum delay-based matching baselines.
