Charge-based computing with analogue reconfigurable gates

As the world enters the age of ubiquitous computing, the need for reconfigurable hardware operating close to the fundamental limits of energy consumption becomes increasingly pressing. Simultaneously, scaling-driven performance improvements within the framework of traditional analogue and digital design become progressively more restricted by fundamental physical constraints. Thus, a true paradigm shift in electronics design is required for fuelling the next big burst in technology. Here we lay the foundations of a new design paradigm that fuses analogue and digital thinking by combining digital electronics with memristive devices for achieving charge-based computation; information processing where every dissipated charge counts. This is realised by introducing memristive devices into standard logic gates, thus rendering them reconfigurable and able to perform analogue computation at a power cost close to digital. The power of this concept is then showcased by experimentally demonstrating a hardware data clusterer and a fuzzy NAND gate using this principle.
