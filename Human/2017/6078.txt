Hypothesis Testing under Mutual Information Privacy Constraints in the High Privacy Regime

Hypothesis testing is a statistical inference framework for determining the true distribution among a set of possible distributions for a given dataset. Privacy restrictions may require the curator of the data or the respondents themselves to share data with the test only after applying a randomizing privacy mechanism. This work considers mutual information (MI) as the privacy metric for measuring leakage. In addition, motivated by the Chernoff-Stein lemma, the relative entropy between pairs of distributions of the output (generated by the privacy mechanism) is chosen as the utility metric. For these metrics, the goal is to find the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) and the corresponding optimal privacy mechanism for both binary and m-ary hypothesis testing. Focusing on the high privacy regime, Euclidean information-theoretic approximations of the binary and m-ary PUT problems are developed. The solutions for the approximation problems clarify that an MI-based privacy metric preserves the privacy of the source symbols in inverse proportion to their likelihoods.
