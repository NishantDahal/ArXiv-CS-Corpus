Massive Machine Type Communication with Data Aggregation and Resource Scheduling

To enable massive machine type communication (mMTC), data aggregation is a promising approach to reduce the congestion caused by a massive number of machine type devices (MTDs). In this work, we consider a two-phase cellular-based mMTC network where MTDs transmit to aggregators (i.e., aggregation phase) and the aggregated data is then relayed to base stations (i.e., relaying phase). Due to the limited resources, the aggregators not only aggregate data, but also schedule resources among MTDs. We consider two scheduling schemes: random resource scheduling (RRS) and channel-aware resource scheduling (CRS). By leveraging the stochastic geometry, we present a tractable analytical framework to investigate the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) for each phase, thereby computing the MTD success probability, the average number of successful MTDs and probability of successful channel utilization, which are the key metrics characterizing the overall mMTC performance. Our numerical results show that, although the CRS outperforms the RRS in terms of SIR at the aggregation phase, the simpler RRS has almost the same performance as the CRS for most cases with regards to the overall mMTC performance. Furthermore, the provision of more resources at the aggregation phase is not always beneficial to the mMTC performance.
