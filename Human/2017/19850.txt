Stationarity Region of Mm-Wave Channel Based on Outdoor Microcellular Measurements at 28 GHz

The stationarity region, i.e., the area in which the statistics of a propagation channel remain constant, is an important measure of the propagation channel, and essential for efficient system design. This paper presents what is to our knowledge the first extensive measurement campaign for measuring the stationarity region of MIMO mm-wave channels. Using a novel 28 GHz phased-array sounder with high phase stability, we present results in an urban microcell LoS, and LOS to NLOS transition region scenario, for the stationarity region of shadowing, power delay profile, and the angular power spectrum. A comparison to results at cm-waves shows considerably reduced stationarity region size, which has an important impact on system design.
