Evolving Optical Networks for Latency-Sensitive Smart-Grid Communications via Optical Time Slice Switching (OTSS) Technologies

In this paper, we proposed a novel OTSS-assisted optical network architecture for smart-grid communication networks, which has unique requirements for low-latency connections. Illustrative results show that, OTSS can provide extremely better performance in latency and blocking probability than conventional flexi-grid optical networks.
