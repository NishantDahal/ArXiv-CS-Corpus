Integration of 5G Technologies in LEO Mega-Constellations

3GPP is finalising the first release of the 5G New Radio physical layer. To cope with the demanding 5G requirements on global connectivity and large throughput, Satellite Communications might be a valuable resource to extend and complement terrestrial networks. In this context, we introduce an integrated architecture for 5G-based LEO mega-constellations and assess the impact of large Doppler shifts and delays on both the 5G waveform and the PHY/MAC layer procedures.
