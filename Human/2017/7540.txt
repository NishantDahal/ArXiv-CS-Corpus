Neuromorphic computing with nanoscale spintronic oscillators

Neurons in the brain behave as non-linear oscillators, which develop rhythmic activity and interact to process information. Taking inspiration from this behavior to realize high density, low power neuromorphic computing will require huge numbers of nanoscale non-linear oscillators. Indeed, a simple estimation indicates that, in order to fit a hundred million oscillators organized in a two-dimensional array inside a chip the size of a thumb, their lateral dimensions must be smaller than one micrometer. However, despite multiple theoretical proposals, there is no proof of concept today of neuromorphic computing with nano-oscillators. Indeed, nanoscale devices tend to be noisy and to lack the stability required to process data in a reliable way. Here, we show experimentally that a nanoscale spintronic oscillator can achieve spoken digit recognition with accuracies similar to state of the art neural networks. We pinpoint the regime of magnetization dynamics leading to highest performance. These results, combined with the exceptional ability of these spintronic oscillators to interact together, their long lifetime, and low energy consumption, open the path to fast, parallel, on-chip computation based on networks of oscillators.
