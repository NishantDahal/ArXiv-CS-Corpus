Photorealistic Facial Expression Synthesis by the Conditional Difference Adversarial Autoencoder

Photorealistic facial expression synthesis from single face image can be widely applied to face recognition, data augmentation for emotion recognition or entertainment. This problem is challenging, in part due to a paucity of labeled facial expression data, making it difficult for algorithms to disambiguate changes due to identity and changes due to expression. In this paper, we propose the conditional difference adversarial autoencoder, CDAAE, for facial expression synthesis. The CDAAE takes a facial image of a previously unseen person and generates an image of that human face with a target emotion or facial action unit label. The CDAAE adds a feedforward path to an autoencoder structure connecting low level features at the encoder to features at the corresponding level at the decoder. It handles the problem of disambiguating changes due to identity and changes due to facial expression by learning to generate the difference between low-level features of images of the same person but with different facial expressions. The CDAAE structure can be used to generate novel expressions by combining and interpolating between facial expressions/action units within the training set. Our experimental results demonstrate that the CDAAE can preserve identity information when generating facial expression for unseen subjects more faithfully than previous approaches. This is especially advantageous when training with small databases.
