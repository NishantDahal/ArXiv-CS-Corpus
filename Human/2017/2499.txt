5G Software Defined Vehicular Networks

With the emerging of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems and software defined networks, not only the performance of vehicular networks could be improved but also new applications of vehicular networks are required by future vehicles, e.g., pilotless vehicles. To meet requirements from intelligent transportation systems, a new vehicular network architecture integrated with 5G mobile communication technologies and software defined network is proposed in this paper. Moreover, fog cells have been proposed to flexibly cover vehicles and avoid frequently handover between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Based on the proposed 5G software defined vehicular networks, the transmission delay and throughput are analyzed and compared. Simulation results indicate that there exist a minimum transmission delay of 5G software defined vehicular networks considering different vehicle densities. Moreover, the throughput of fog cells in 5G software defined vehicular networks is better than the throughput of traditional transportation management systems.
