Analyzing Learned Convnet Features with Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models

Convolutional Neural Networks (Convnets) have achieved good results in a range of computer vision tasks the recent years. Though given a lot of attention, visualizing the learned representations to interpret Convnets, still remains a challenging task. The high dimensionality of internal representations and the high abstractions of deep layers are the main challenges when visualizing Convnet functionality. We present in this paper a technique based on clustering internal Convnet representations with a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model, for visualization of learned representations in Convnets. Our method copes with the high dimensionality of a Convnet by clustering representations across all nodes of each layer. We will discuss how this application is useful when considering transfer learning, i.e.\ transferring a model trained on one dataset to solve a task on a different one.
