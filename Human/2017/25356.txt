Ellipsoid Method for Linear Programming made simple

In this paper, ellipsoid method for linear programming is derived using only minimal knowledge of algebra and matrices. Unfortunately, most authors first describe the algorithm, then later prove its correctness, which requires a good knowledge of linear algebra.
