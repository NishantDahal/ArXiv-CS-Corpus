Bibliometric-Enhanced Information Retrieval: 5th International BIR Workshop

Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshops serve as the annual gathering of IR researchers who address various information-related tasks on scientific corpora and bibliometrics. The workshop features original approaches to search, browse, and discover value-added knowledge from scientific documents and related information networks (e.g., terms, authors, institutions, references). We welcome contributions elaborating on dedicated IR systems, as well as studies revealing original characteristics on how scientific knowledge is created, communicated, and used. In this paper we introduce the BIR workshop series and discuss some selected papers presented at previous BIR workshops.
