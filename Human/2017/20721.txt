A Simple Nonlinearity-Tailored Probabilistic Shaping Distribution for Square QAM

A new probabilistic shaping distribution that outperforms Maxwell-Boltzmann is studied for the nonlinear fiber channel. Additional gains of 0.1 bit/symbol MI or 0.2 dB SNR for both DP-256QAM and DP-1024QAM are reported after 200 km nonlinear fiber transmission.
