Enhancement of Physical Layer Security Using Destination Artificial Noise Based on Outage Probability

In this paper, we study using Destination Artificial Noise (DAN) besides Source Artificial Noise (SAN) to enhance physical layer secrecy with an outage probability based approach. It is assumed that all nodes in the network (i.e. source, destination and eavesdropper) are equipped with multiple antennas. In addition, the eavesdropper is passive and its channel state and location are unknown at the source and destination. In our proposed scheme, by optimized allocation of power to the SAN, DAN and data signal, a minimum value for the outage probability is guaranteed at the eavesdropper, and at the same time a certain level of signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the destination is ensured. Our simulation results show that using DAN along with SAN brings a significant enhancement in power consumption compared to methods that merely adopt SAN to achieve the same outage probability at the eavesdropper.
