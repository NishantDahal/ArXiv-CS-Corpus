Performance of Dynamic and Static TDD in Self-backhauled mmWave Cellular Networks

Initial deployments of millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks are likely to be enabled with self-backhauling. In this work, we propose a random spatial model to analyze uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) SINR distribution and mean rates corresponding to different access-backhaul and UL-DL resource allocation schemes in a self-backhauled mmWave cellular network with Poisson point process (PPP) deployment of users and base stations. In particular, we focus on heuristic implementations of static and dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) for access links with synchronized or unsynchronized access-backhaul (SAB or UAB) time splits. We propose PPP approximations to characterize the distribution of the new types of interference encountered with dynamic TDD and UAB. These schemes offer better resource utilization than static TDD and SAB, however potentially higher interference makes their choice non-trivial and the offered gains sensitive to different network parameters, including UL/DL traffic asymmetry, user load per BS or number of slave BSs per master BS. One can harness notable gains from UAB and/or dynamic TDD only if backhaul links are designed to have much larger throughput than the access links.
