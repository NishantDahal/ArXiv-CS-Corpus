Optimal prevention with possibilistic and mixed background risk

In this paper the effect of posibilistic or mixed background risk on the level of optimal prevention is studied. In the framework of five purely possibilistic or mixed models, necessary and sufficient conditions are found such that the level of optimal saving decreases or increases as a result of the actions of various types of background risk. This way our results complete those obtained by Courbage and Rey for some prevention models with probabilistic background risk.
