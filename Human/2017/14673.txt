Explicit Constructions and Bounds for Batch Codes with Restricted Size of Reconstruction Sets

Linear batch codes and codes for private information retrieval (PIR) with a query size $t$ and a restricted size $r$ of the reconstruction sets are studied. New bounds on the parameters of such codes are derived for small values of $t$ or of $r$ by providing corresponding constructions. By building on the ideas of Cadambe and Mazumdar, a new bound in a recursive form is derived for batch codes and PIR codes.
