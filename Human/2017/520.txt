An Implementation of SCADA Network Security Testbed

The security of industrial network has become an increasing concern in industry infrastructure operation. Motivated by on-going collaborations with Fortinet Corp., a security company, this project implements a testbed for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network security research by software emulation. Concepts about SCADA and Modbus protocol are reviewed in the report. Besides Modbus, vulnerabilities about several other industrial protocols are also studied for this project. In this report, a typical tank system following Modbus protocol is built as a testbed. Both attack and defense toolkits are introduced to emulate the attack and protection of the Modbus network. The emulation platform is also capable of entrapping hackers and gathering their activity data.
