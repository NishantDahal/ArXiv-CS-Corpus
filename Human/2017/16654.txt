Image Denoising via CNNs: An Adversarial Approach

Is it possible to recover an image from its noisy version using convolutional neural networks? This is an interesting problem as convolutional layers are generally used as feature detectors for tasks like classification, segmentation and object detection. We present a new CNN architecture for blind image denoising which synergically combines three architecture components, a multi-scale feature extraction layer which helps in reducing the effect of noise on feature maps, an l_p regularizer which helps in selecting only the appropriate feature maps for the task of reconstruction, and finally a three step training approach which leverages adversarial training to give the final performance boost to the model. The proposed model shows competitive denoising performance when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
