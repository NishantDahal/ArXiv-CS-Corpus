Robust and adaptive search

Binary search finds a given element in a sorted array with an optimal number of $\log n$ queries. However, binary search fails even when the array is only slightly disordered or access to its elements is subject to errors. We study the worst-case query complexity of search algorithms that are robust to imprecise queries and that adapt to perturbations of the order of the elements. We give (almost) tight results for various parameters that quantify query errors and that measure array disorder. In particular, we exhibit settings where query complexities of $\log n + ck$, $(1+\varepsilon)\log n + ck$, and $\sqrt{cnk}+o(nk)$ are best-possible for parameter value $k$, any $\varepsilon>0$, and constant $c$.
