Several Classes of Permutation Trinomials over $\mathbb F_{5^n}$ From Niho Exponents

The construction of permutation trinomials over finite fields attracts people's interest recently due to their simple form and some additional properties. Motivated by some results on the construction of permutation trinomials with Niho exponents, by constructing some new fractional polynomials that permute the set of the $(q+1)$-th roots of unity in $\mathbb F_{q^2}$, we present several classes of permutation trinomials with Niho exponents over $\mathbb F_{q^2}$, where $q=5^k$.
