Power Allocation for Energy Efficiency and Secrecy of Interference Wireless Networks

Considering a multi-user interference network with an eavesdropper, this paper aims at the power allocation to optimize the worst secrecy throughput among the network links or the secure energy efficiency in terms of achieved secrecy throughput per Joule under link security requirements. Three scenarios for the access of channel state information are considered: the perfect channel state information, partial channel state information with channels from the transmitters to the eavesdropper exponentially distributed, and not perfectly known channels between the transmitters and the users with exponentially distributed errors. The paper develops various path-following procedures of low complexity and rapid convergence for the optimal power allocation. Their effectiveness and viability are illustrated through numerical examples. The power allocation schemes are shown to achieve both high secrecy throughput and energy efficiency.
