Large-scale Feature Selection of Risk Genetic Factors for Alzheimer's Disease via Distributed Group Lasso Regression

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have achieved great success in the genetic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Collaborative imaging genetics studies across different research institutions show the effectiveness of detecting genetic risk factors. However, the high dimensionality of GWAS data poses significant challenges in detecting risk SNPs for AD. Selecting relevant features is crucial in predicting the response variable. In this study, we propose a novel Distributed Feature Selection Framework (DFSF) to conduct the large-scale imaging genetics studies across multiple institutions. To speed up the learning process, we propose a family of distributed group Lasso screening rules to identify irrelevant features and remove them from the optimization. Then we select the relevant group features by performing the group Lasso feature selection process in a sequence of parameters. Finally, we employ the stability selection to rank the top risk SNPs that might help detect the early stage of AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed feature selection model integrated with group Lasso feature selection as well as detecting the risk genetic factors across multiple research institutions system. Empirical studies are conducted on 809 subjects with 5.9 million SNPs which are distributed across several individual institutions, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.
