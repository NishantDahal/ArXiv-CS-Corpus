The Weight Hierarchy of a Family of Cyclic Codes with Arbitrary Number of Nonzeroes

The generalized Hamming weights (GHWs) are fundamental parameters of linear codes. GHWs are of great interest in many applications since they convey detailed information of linear codes. In this paper, we continue the work of [10] to study the GHWs of a family of cyclic codes with arbitrary number of nonzeroes. The weight hierarchy is determined by employing a number-theoretic approach.
