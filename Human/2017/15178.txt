A Machine Learning Approach For Identifying Patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Using Diffusion MRI Modeling

While diffusion MRI has been extremely promising in the study of MTBI, identifying patients with recent MTBI remains a challenge. The literature is mixed with regard to localizing injury in these patients, however, gray matter such as the thalamus and white matter including the corpus callosum and frontal deep white matter have been repeatedly implicated as areas at high risk for injury. The purpose of this study is to develop a machine learning framework to classify MTBI patients and controls using features derived from multi-shell diffusion MRI in the thalamus, frontal white matter and corpus callosum.
