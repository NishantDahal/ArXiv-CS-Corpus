Universal Tree Source Coding Using Grammar-Based Compression

We apply so-called tree straight-line programs to the problem of lossless compression of binary trees. We derive upper bound on the maximal pointwise redundancy (or worst-case redundancy) that improve previous bounds obtained by Zhang, Yang, and Kieffer using directed acyclic graphs. Using this, we obtain universal codes for new classes of structered tree sources.
