Towards Cross-Surface Immersion Using Low Cost Multi-Sensory Output Cues to Support Proxemics and Kinesics Across Heterogeneous Systems

Collaboration in immersive systems can be achieved by using an immersive display system (i.e. CAVE and Head-Mounted Display), but how do we communicate immersion cross-surface for low immersive displays, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones? In this paper, we present a discussion of proxemics and kinesics to support based on observation of physical collaboration. We present our research agenda to investigate low-cost multi-sensory output cues to communicate proxemics and kinesics aspects cross-surface. Doing so may increase the level of presence, co-presence, and immersion, and improve the effectiveness of collaboration cross-surface.
