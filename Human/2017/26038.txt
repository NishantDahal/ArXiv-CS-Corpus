Automating Release of Deep Link APIs for Android Applications

Unlike the Web where each web page has a global URL to reach, a specific "content page" inside a mobile app cannot be opened unless the user explores the app with several operations from the landing page. Recently, deep links have been advocated by major companies to enable targeting and opening a specific page of an app externally with an accessible uniform resource identifier (URI). To empirically investigate the state of the practice on adopting deep links, in this article, we present the largest empirical study of deep links over 20,000 Android apps, and find that deep links do not get wide adoption among current Android apps, and non-trivial manual efforts are required for app developers to support deep links. To address such an issue, we propose the Aladdin approach and supporting tool to release deep links to access arbitrary location of existing apps. Aladdin instantiates our novel cooperative framework to synergically combine static analysis and dynamic analysis while minimally engaging developers to provide inputs to the framework for automation, without requiring any coding efforts or additional deployment efforts. We evaluate Aladdin with popular apps and demonstrate its effectiveness and performance.
