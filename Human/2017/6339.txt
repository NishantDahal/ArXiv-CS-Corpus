Revisiting wireless network jamming by SIR-based considerations and Multiband Robust Optimization

We revisit the mathematical models for wireless network jamming introduced by Commander et al.: we first point out the strong connections with classical wireless network design and then we propose a new model based on the explicit use of signal-to-interference quantities. Moreover, to address the intrinsic uncertain nature of the jamming problem and tackle the peculiar right-hand-side (RHS) uncertainty of the problem, we propose an original robust cutting-plane algorithm drawing inspiration from Multiband Robust Optimization. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed cutting plane algorithm by experiments on realistic network instances.
