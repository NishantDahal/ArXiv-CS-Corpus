Discrete Event Simulation of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) Systems

The article discusses issues related to the construction of the PRT network simulator and the simulation process: the elements of PRT network structure, their representation in the simulator, the simulation process itself, animation, and automation of the experiments. An example of a simulation environment Feniks is described, elaborated within the framework of the Eco-Mobility project.
