Secure Full-Duplex Two-Way Relaying for SWIPT

This letter studies bi-directional secure information exchange in a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled by a full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. The AF relay injects artificial noise (AN) in order to confuse the eavesdropper. Specifically, we assume a zeroforcing (ZF) solution constraint to eliminate the residual self-interference (RSI). As a consequence, we address the optimal joint design of the ZF matrix and the AN covariance matrix at the relay node as well as the transmit power at the sources. We propose an alternating algorithm utilizing semi-definite programming (SDP) technique and one-dimensional searching to achieve the optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
