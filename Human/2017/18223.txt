Commonsense Scene Semantics for Cognitive Robotics: Towards Grounding Embodied Visuo-Locomotive Interactions

We present a commonsense, qualitative model for the semantic grounding of embodied visuo-spatial and locomotive interactions. The key contribution is an integrative methodology combining low-level visual processing with high-level, human-centred representations of space and motion rooted in artificial intelligence. We demonstrate practical applicability with examples involving object interactions, and indoor movement.
