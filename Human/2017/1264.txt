Porous Structure Design in Tissue Engineering Using Anisotropic Radial Basis Function

Development of additive manufacturing in last decade greatly improves tissue engineering. During the manufacturing of porous scaffold, simplified but functionally equivalent models are getting focused for practically reasons. Scaffolds can be classified into regular porous scaffolds and irregular porous scaffolds. Several methodologies are developed to design these scaffolds. A novel method is proposed in this paper using anisotropic radial basis function (ARBF) interpolation. This is method uses geometric models such as volumetric meshes as input and proves to be flexible because geometric models are able to capture the characteristics of complex tissues easily. Moreover, this method is straightforward and easy to implement.
