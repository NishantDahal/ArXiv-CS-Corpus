A New Concept for an Obstacle Avoidance System for the AUV "SLOCUM Glider" Operation under Ice

This paper presents a concept for a control System for an autonomous underwater vehicle under ice using a "SLOCUM" underwater glider. The project concept, the separate working tasks for the next one-and-a-half years and the first results will be presented. In this context the structure of the obstacle avoidance system and a simulator structure with a sensor and environment simulation as well as the interfaces to the glider hardware will be discussed. As a first result of the main research, a graph-based algorithm for the path planning in a time-varying environment (variable ocean field, moving obstacles) will be described.
