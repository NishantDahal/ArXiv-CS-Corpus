Database Benchmarks

The aim of this article is to present an overview of the major families of state-of-the-art data-base benchmarks, namely: relational benchmarks, object and object-relational benchmarks, XML benchmarks, and decision-support benchmarks, and to discuss the issues, tradeoffs and future trends in database benchmarking. We particularly focus on XML and decision-support benchmarks, which are currently the most innovative tools that are developed in this area.
