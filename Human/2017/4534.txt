Interference Networks with Caches at Both Ends

A $K_T \times K_R$ cache-aided wireless interference network, in which both the transmitters and the receivers are equipped with cache memories is studied. Each user requests one file from a library of $N$ popular files. The goal is to design the cache contents without the knowledge of the particular user demands, such that all possible demand combinations can be satisfied reliably over the interference channel. The achievable sum degrees-of-freedom ($\mathrm{sDoF}$) and the normalized delivery time (NDT) are studied for centralized and decentralized network architectures, respectively. First, using a combination of interference alignment (IA), zero-forcing (ZF) and interference cancellation (IC) techniques, a novel caching and transmission scheme for centralized networks is introduced, and it is shown to improve the $\mathrm{sDoF}$ upon the state-of-the-art. Then, the NDT is studied when the content placement at the receiver caches is carried out in a decentralized manner. Our results indicate that, for this particular network architecture, caches located at the receiver side are more effective than those at the transmitter side in order to reduce the NDT.
