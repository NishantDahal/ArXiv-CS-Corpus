Multi-Relevance Transfer Learning

Transfer learning aims to faciliate learning tasks in a label-scarce target domain by leveraging knowledge from a related source domain with plenty of labeled data. Often times we may have multiple domains with little or no labeled data as targets waiting to be solved. Most existing efforts tackle target domains separately by modeling the `source-target' pairs without exploring the relatedness between them, which would cause loss of crucial information, thus failing to achieve optimal capability of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach called Multi-Relevance Transfer Learning (MRTL) for this purpose, which can simultaneously transfer different knowledge from the source and exploits the shared common latent factors between target domains. Specifically, we formulate the problem as an optimization task based on a collective nonnegative matrix tri-factorization framework. The proposed approach achieves both source-target transfer and target-target leveraging by sharing multiple decomposed latent subspaces. Further, an alternative minimization learning algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. Empirical study validates the performance and effectiveness of MRTL compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
