Unified Hanani-Tutte theorem

We introduce a common generalization of the strong Hanani-Tutte theorem and the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem: if a graph $G$ has a drawing $D$ in the plane where every pair of independent edges crosses an even number of times, then $G$ has a planar drawing preserving the rotation of each vertex whose incident edges cross each other evenly in $D$. The theorem is implicit in the proof of the strong Hanani-Tutte theorem by Pelsmajer, Schaefer and Štefankovič. We give a new, somewhat simpler proof.
