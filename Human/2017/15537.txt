Device-Aware Routing and Scheduling in Multi-Hop Device-to-Device Networks

The dramatic increase in data and connectivity demand, in addition to heterogeneous device capabilities, poses a challenge for future wireless networks. One of the promising solutions is Device-to-Device (D2D) networking. D2D networking, advocating the idea of connecting two or more devices directly without traversing the core network, is promising to address the increasing data and connectivity demand. In this paper, we consider D2D networks, where devices with heterogeneous capabilities including computing power, energy limitations, and incentives participate in D2D activities heterogeneously. We develop (i) a device-aware routing and scheduling algorithm (DARS) by taking into account device capabilities, and (ii) a multi-hop D2D testbed using Android-based smartphones and tablets by exploiting Wi-Fi Direct and legacy Wi-Fi connections. We show that DARS significantly improves throughput in our testbed as compared to state-of-the-art.
