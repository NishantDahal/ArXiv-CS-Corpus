Effect of Retransmissions on Optimal Caching in Cache-enabled Small Cell Networks

Caching popular content in the storage of small cells is being considered as an efficient technique to complement limited backhaul of small cells in ultra-dense heterogeneous cellular networks. Limited storage capacity of the small cells renders it important to determine the optimal set of files (cache) to be placed on each small cell. In contrast to prior works on optimal caching, in this work we study the effect of retransmissions on the optimal cache placement policy for both static and mobile user scenarios. With the popularity of files modeled as a Zipf distribution and a maximum n transmissions, i.e., n-1 retransmissions, allowed to receive each file, we determine the optimal caching probability of the files that maximizes the hit probability. Our closed-form optimal solutions concretely demonstrate that the optimal caching probabilities are very sensitive to the number of retransmissions.
