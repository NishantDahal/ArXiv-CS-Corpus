Canonical Selection of Colimits

Colimits are a powerful tool for the combination of objects in a category. In the context of modeling and specification, they are used in the institution-independent semantics (1) of instantiations of parameterised specifications (e.g. in the specification language CASL), and (2) of combinations of networks of specifications (in the OMG standardised language DOL).
