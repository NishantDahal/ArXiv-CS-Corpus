Phase Congruency Parameter Optimization for Enhanced Detection of Image Features for both Natural and Medical Applications

Following the presentation and proof of the hypothesis that image features are particularly perceived at points where the Fourier components are maximally in phase, the concept of phase congruency (PC) is introduced. Subsequently, a two-dimensional multi-scale phase congruency (2D-MSPC) is developed, which has been an important tool for detecting and evaluation of image features. However, the 2D-MSPC requires many parameters to be appropriately tuned for optimal image features detection. In this paper, we defined a criterion for parameter optimization of the 2D-MSPC, which is a function of its maximum and minimum moments. We formulated the problem in various optimal and suboptimal frameworks, and discussed the conditions and features of the suboptimal solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through several examples, ranging from natural objects to medical images from patients with a neurological disease, multiple sclerosis.
