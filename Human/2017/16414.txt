Diffusion, Influence and Best-Response Dynamics in Networks: An Action Model Approach

Threshold models and their dynamics may be used to model the spread of `behaviors' in social networks. Regarding such from a modal logical perspective, it is shown how standard update mechanisms may be emulated using action models -- graphs encoding agents' decision rules. A small class of action models capturing the possible sets of decision rules suitable for threshold models is identified, and shown to include models characterizing best-response dynamics of both coordination and anti-coordination games played on graphs.
