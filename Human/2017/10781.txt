Centralized Radio Resource Management for 5G small cells as LSA enabler

The stringent requirements defined for 5G systems drive the need to promote new paradigms to the existing cellular networks. Dense and ultra-dense networks based on small cells, together with new spectrum sharing schemes seem to be key enabling technologies for emerging 5G mobile networks. This article explores the vision of the SPEED-5G project, analyzing the ability of a Centralized Radio Resource Management entity to support the Licensed Shared Access spectrum sharing framework in a deployment based on Network Slicing and Network Sharing paradigms.
