Survivable Probability of SDN-enabled Cloud Networking with Random Physical Link Failure

Software-driven cloud networking is a new paradigm in orchestrating physical resources (CPU, network bandwidth, energy, storage) allocated to network functions, services, and applications, which is commonly modeled as a cross-layer network. This model carries a physical network representing the physical infrastructure, a logical network showing demands, and logical-to-physical node/link mappings. In such networks, a single failure in the physical network may trigger cascading failures in the logical network and disable network services and connectivity. In this paper, we propose an evaluation metric, survivable probability, to evaluate the reliability of such networks under random physical link failure(s). We propose the concept of base protecting spanning tree and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for its existence and relation to survivability. We then develop mathematical programming formulations for reliable cross-layer network routing design with the maximal reliable probability. Computation results demonstrate the viability of our approach.
