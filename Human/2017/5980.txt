Logically Isolated, Actually Unpredictable? Measuring Hypervisor Performance in Multi-Tenant SDNs

Ideally, by enabling multi-tenancy, network virtualization allows to improve resource utilization, while providing performance isolation: although the underlying resources are shared, the virtual network appears as a dedicated network to the tenant. However, providing such an illusion is challenging in practice, and over the last years, many expedient approaches have been proposed to provide performance isolation in virtual networks, by enforcing bandwidth reservations. We in this paper study another source for overheads and unpredictable performance in virtual networks: the hypervisor.
  The hypervisor is a critical component in multi-tenant environments, but its overhead and influence on performance are hardly understood today. In particular, we focus on OpenFlow-based virtualized Software Defined Networks (vSDNs). Network virtualization is considered a killer application for SDNs: a vSDN allows each tenant to flexibly manage its network from a logically centralized perspective, via a simple API. For the purpose of our study, we developed a new benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes, enabling high and consistent OpenFlow message rates. Using our tool, we identify and measure controllable and uncontrollable effects on performance and overhead, including the hypervisor technology, the number of tenants as well as the tenant type, as well as the type of OpenFlow messages.
