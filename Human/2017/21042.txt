Diffusion Based Cooperative Molecular Communication in Nano-Networks

This work presents a novel diffusion based dual-phase molecular communication system where the source leverages multiple cooperating nanomachines to improve the end-to-end reliability of communication. The Neyman-Pearson Likelihood Ratio Tests are derived for each of the cooperative as well as the destination nanomachines in the presence of multi-user interference. Further, to characterize the performance of the aforementioned system, closed form expressions are derived for the probabilities of detection, false alarm at the individual cooperative, destination nanomachines, as well as the overall end-to-end probability of error. Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in the end-to-end performance of the proposed cooperative framework in comparison to multiple-input single-output and single-input single-output molecular communication scenarios in the existing literature.
