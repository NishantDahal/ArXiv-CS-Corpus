BIOS ORAM: Improved Privacy-Preserving Data Access for Parameterized Outsourced Storage

Algorithms for oblivious random access machine (ORAM) simulation allow a client, Alice, to obfuscate a pattern of data accesses with a server, Bob, who is maintaining Alice's outsourced data while trying to learn information about her data. We present a novel ORAM scheme that improves the asymptotic I/O overhead of previous schemes for a wide range of size parameters for client-side private memory and message blocks, from logarithmic to polynomial. Our method achieves statistical security for hiding Alice's access pattern and, with high probability, achieves an I/O overhead that ranges from $O(1)$ to $O(\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$, depending on these size parameters, where $n$ is the size of Alice's outsourced memory. Our scheme, which we call BIOS ORAM, combines multiple uses of B-trees with a reduction of ORAM simulation to isogrammic access sequences.
