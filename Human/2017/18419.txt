Sketch-pix2seq: a Model to Generate Sketches of Multiple Categories

Sketch is an important media for human to communicate ideas, which reflects the superiority of human intelligence. Studies on sketch can be roughly summarized into recognition and generation. Existing models on image recognition failed to obtain satisfying performance on sketch classification. But for sketch generation, a recent study proposed a sequence-to-sequence variational-auto-encoder (VAE) model called sketch-rnn which was able to generate sketches based on human inputs. The model achieved amazing results when asked to learn one category of object, such as an animal or a vehicle. However, the performance dropped when multiple categories were fed into the model. Here, we proposed a model called sketch-pix2seq which could learn and draw multiple categories of sketches. Two modifications were made to improve the sketch-rnn model: one is to replace the bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) encoder with a convolutional neural network(CNN); the other is to remove the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the objective function of VAE. Experimental results showed that models with CNN encoders outperformed those with RNN encoders in generating human-style sketches. Visualization of the latent space illustrated that the removal of KL-divergence made the encoder learn a posterior of latent space that reflected the features of different categories. Moreover, the combination of CNN encoder and removal of KL-divergence, i.e., the sketch-pix2seq model, had better performance in learning and generating sketches of multiple categories and showed promising results in creativity tasks.
