Nearly Optimal Sampling Algorithms for Combinatorial Pure Exploration

We study the combinatorial pure exploration problem Best-Set in stochastic multi-armed bandits. In a Best-Set instance, we are given $n$ arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as a family $\mathcal{F}$ of feasible subsets over the arms. Our goal is to identify the feasible subset in $\mathcal{F}$ with the maximum total mean using as few samples as possible. The problem generalizes the classical best arm identification problem and the top-$k$ arm identification problem, both of which have attracted significant attention in recent years. We provide a novel instance-wise lower bound for the sample complexity of the problem, as well as a nontrivial sampling algorithm, matching the lower bound up to a factor of $\ln|\mathcal{F}|$. For an important class of combinatorial families, we also provide polynomial time implementation of the sampling algorithm, using the equivalence of separation and optimization for convex program, and approximate Pareto curves in multi-objective optimization. We also show that the $\ln|\mathcal{F}|$ factor is inevitable in general through a nontrivial lower bound construction. Our results significantly improve several previous results for several important combinatorial constraints, and provide a tighter understanding of the general Best-Set problem.
  We further introduce an even more general problem, formulated in geometric terms. We are given $n$ Gaussian arms with unknown means and unit variance. Consider the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, and a collection $\mathcal{O}$ of disjoint subsets. Our goal is to determine the subset in $\mathcal{O}$ that contains the $n$-dimensional vector of the means. The problem generalizes most pure exploration bandit problems studied in the literature. We provide the first nearly optimal sample complexity upper and lower bounds for the problem.
