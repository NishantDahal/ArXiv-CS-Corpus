Optimal Control of Wireless Computing Networks

Augmented information (AgI) services allow users to consume information that results from the execution of a chain of service functions that process source information to create real-time augmented value. Applications include real-time analysis of remote sensing data, real-time computer vision, personalized video streaming, and augmented reality, among others. We consider the problem of optimal distribution of AgI services over a wireless computing network, in which nodes are equipped with both communication and computing resources. We characterize the wireless computing network capacity region and design a joint flow scheduling and resource allocation algorithm that stabilizes the underlying queuing system while achieving a network cost arbitrarily close to the minimum, with a tradeoff in network delay. Our solution captures the unique chaining and flow scaling aspects of AgI services, while exploiting the use of the broadcast approach coding scheme over the wireless channel.
