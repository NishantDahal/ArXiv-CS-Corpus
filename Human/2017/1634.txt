Explicit Frames for Deterministic Phase Retrieval via PhaseLift

We explicitly give a frame of cardinality $5n-6$ such that every signal in $\mathbb{C}^n$ can be recovered up to a phase from its associated intensity measurements via the PhaseLift approach. Furthermore, we give explicit linear measurements with $4r(n-r)+n-2r$ outcomes that enable the recovery of every positive semidefinite $n\times n$ matrix of rank at most $r$.
