Étude sur les portails et agrégateurs des ressources pédagogiques universitaires francophones en accès libre

This study responds to the first measure undertaken on July 17, 2015 by IDNEUF prject, that of an exploratory analysis of the existing portals and aggregators of free French-language academic resources. The idea is to provide an overview of the most common trends and practices in the constitution and organization of digital online learning resource portals. The study of these trends would help to define the appropriate choices and conditions for designing the future common French-language portal and to optimize its services for the conservation, exchange, integration and pooling of educational resources within the distributed technological framework of French-language universities. This framework should therefore be interconnected, transparent and interoperable, reflecting both the linguistic and cultural specificities of partner institutions and their ambitions for technological and economic developments. The development of this first exploratory study of portals would take into account the two technological solutions discussed at the task force meeting on 17 July 2015.1. The alternative of extending the capabilities of France's Digital University's search engine to French-language academic institutions will require that the experience of the UNT (Numerical Thematic University) be taken into account as a key player in the digital portal In higher education (supnumerique.gouv.fr). Thus, the present study should first target the portals of the UNT as models replicable or extensible to the French context by analyzing their technological choices, their modes of organization and their modes of use and communication;2. Next, the study will not be limited to analyzing UNT portals. The proposed hypothesis to create a common portal of French portals from the existing university portals also requires exploring this possibility and proposing an analysis of existing portals that function according to other organizational models.
