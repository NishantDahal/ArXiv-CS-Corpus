InterPSS: A New Generation Power System Simulation Engine

This paper presents the design of InterPSS simulation engine, including its object model, open software architecture, and software development process. Several advanced applications, including an integrated transmission and distribution co-simulation, an electromagnetic transient and phasor domain hybrid simulation, and InterPSS integration with a market simulator, have been developed by either extending InterPSS simulation engine or integrating it with other programs and/or platforms. These advanced applications show that the open architecture combined with the comprehensive modeling and simulation capabilities make InterPSS a very attractive option for the research and the future new power system simulation application development.
