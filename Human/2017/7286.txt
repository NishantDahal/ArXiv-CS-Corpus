Convolutional Polar Codes

Arikan's Polar codes attracted much attention as the first efficiently decodable and capacity achieving codes. Furthermore, Polar codes exhibit an exponentially decreasing block error probability with an asymptotic error exponent upper bounded by 1/2. Since their discovery, many attempts have been made to improve the error exponent and the finite block-length performance, while keeping the bloc-structured kernel. Recently, two of us introduced a new family of efficiently decodable error-correction codes based on a recently discovered efficiently-contractible tensor network family in quantum many-body physics, called branching MERA. These codes, called branching MERA codes, include Polar codes and also extend them in a non-trivial way by substituting the bloc-structured kernel by a convolutional structure. Here, we perform an in-depth study of a particular example that can be thought of as a direct extension to Arikan's Polar code, which we therefore name Convolutional Polar codes. We prove that these codes polarize and exponentially suppress the channel's error probability, with an asymptotic error exponent log_2(3)/2 which is provably better than for Polar codes under successive cancellation decoding. We also perform finite block-size numerical simulations which display improved error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity.
