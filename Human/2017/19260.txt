Approximate Analytical Solutions of Power Flow Equations Based on Multi-Dimensional Holomorphic Embedding Method

It is well known that closed-form analytical solutions for AC power flow equations do not exist in general. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional holomorphic embedding method (MDHEM) to obtain an explicit approximate analytical AC power-flow solution by finding a physical germ solution and arbitrarily embedding each power, each load or groups of loads with respective scales. Based on the MDHEM, the complete approximate analytical solutions to the power flow equations in the high-dimensional space become achievable, since the voltage vector of each bus can be explicitly expressed by a convergent multivariate power series of all the loads. Unlike the traditional iterative methods for power flow calculation and inaccurate sensitivity analysis method for voltage control, the algebraic variables of a power system in all operating conditions can be prepared offline and evaluated online by only plugging in the values of any operating conditions into the scales of the non-linear multivariate power series. Case studies implemented on the 4-bus test system and the IEEE 14-bus standard system confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.
