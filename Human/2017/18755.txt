EpiFi: An In-Home Sensor Network Architecture for Epidemiological Studies

We design and build a system called EpiFi, which allows epidemiologists to easily design and deploy experiments in homes. The focus of EpiFi is reducing the barrier to entry for deploying and using an in-home sensor network. We present a novel architecture for in-home sensor networks configured using a single configuration file and provide: a fast and reliable method for device discovery when installed in the home, a new mechanism for sensors to authenticate over the air using a subject's home WiFi router, and data reliability mechanisms to minimize loss in the network through a long-term deployment. We work collaboratively with pediatric asthma researchers to design three studies and deploy EpiFi in homes.
