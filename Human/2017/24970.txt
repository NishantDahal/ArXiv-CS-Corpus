An Analytical Perspective to Traffic Engineering in Anonymous Communication Systems

Anonymous communication systems (ACS) offer privacy and anonymity through the Internet. They are mostly free tools and are popular among users all over the world. In the recent years, anonymity applications faced many problems regarding traffic engineering methods. Even though they ensure privacy under some conditions, their anonymity will be endangered by high performance processing units. To address these issues, this study is devoted to investigating traffic-engineering methods in anonymous communication systems, and proposes an analytical view of the current issues in ACS privacy and anonymity. Our study also indicates new types of solutions for these current issues with ACS.
