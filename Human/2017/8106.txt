Efficient Regression in Metric Spaces via Approximate Lipschitz Extension

We present a framework for performing efficient regression in general metric spaces. Roughly speaking, our regressor predicts the value at a new point by computing a Lipschitz extension --- the smoothest function consistent with the observed data --- after performing structural risk minimization to avoid overfitting. We obtain finite-sample risk bounds with minimal structural and noise assumptions, and a natural speed-precision tradeoff. The offline (learning) and online (prediction) stages can be solved by convex programming, but this naive approach has runtime complexity $O(n^3)$, which is prohibitive for large datasets. We design instead a regression algorithm whose speed and generalization performance depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data, to which the algorithm adapts. While our main innovation is algorithmic, the statistical results may also be of independent interest.
