Computability and Complexity of Unconventional Computing Devices

We discuss some claims that certain UCOMP devices can perform hypercomputation (compute Turing-uncomputable functions) or perform super-Turing computation (solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time). We discover that all these claims rely on the provision of one or more unphysical resources.
