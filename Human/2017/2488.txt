Overlapping Community Detection by Local Decentralised Vertex-centred Process

This paper focuses on the identification of overlapping communities, allowing nodes to simultaneously belong to several communities, in a decentralised way. To that aim it proposes LOCNeSs, an algorithm specially designed to run in a decentralised environment and to limit propagation, two essential characteristics to be applied in mobile networks. It is based on the exploitation of the preferential attachment mechanism in networks. Experimental results show that LOCNeSs is stable and achieves good overlapping vertex identification.
