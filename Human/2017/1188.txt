A Resource Management Protocol for Mobile Cloud Using Auto-Scaling

Cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) and Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) have emerged as promising candidates for the next generation access network techniques. MCC enables resource limited mobile devices to offload computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, while C-RAN offers a technology that addresses the increasing mobile traffic. In this paper, we propose a protocol for task offloading and for managing resources in both C-RAN and mobile cloud together using a centralised controller. Experiments on resource management using cloud auto-scaling shows that resource (CPU, RAM, Storage) scaling times vary.
