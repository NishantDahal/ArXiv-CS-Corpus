A note on the multiple-recursive matrix method for generating pseudorandom vectors

The multiple-recursive matrix method for generating pseudorandom vectors was introduced by Niederreiter (Linear Algebra Appl. 192 (1993), 301-328). We propose an algorithm for finding an efficient primitive multiple-recursive matrix method. Moreover, for improving the linear complexity, we introduce a tweak on the contents of the primitive multiple-recursive matrix method.
