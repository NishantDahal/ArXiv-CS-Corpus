VMDV: A 3D Visualization Tool for Modeling, Demonstration, and Verification

The output of an automated theorem prover is usually presented by using a text format, they are often too heavy to be understood. In model checking setting, it would be helpful if one can observe the structure of models and the verification procedures. A 3D visualization tool (\textsf{VMDV}) is proposed in this paper to address these problems. The facility of \vmdv is illustrated by applying it to a proof systems.
