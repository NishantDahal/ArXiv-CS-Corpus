Facial Recognition Enabled Smart Door Using Microsoft Face API

Privacy and Security are two universal rights and, to ensure that in our daily life we are secure, a lot of research is going on in the field of home security, and IoT is the turning point for the industry, where we connect everyday objects to share data for our betterment. Facial recognition is a well-established process in which the face is detected and identified out of the image. We aim to create a smart door, which secures the gateway on the basis of who we are. In our proof of concept of a smart door we have used a live HD camera on the front side of setup attached to a display monitor connected to the camera to show who is standing in front of the door, also the whole system will be able to give voice outputs by processing text them on the Raspberry Pi ARM processor used and show the answers as output on the screen. We are using a set of electromagnets controlled by the microcontroller, which will act as a lock. So a person can open the smart door with the help of facial recognition and at the same time also be able to interact with it. The facial recognition is done by Microsoft face API but our state of the art desktop application operating over Microsoft Visual Studio IDE reduces the computational time by detecting the face out of the photo and giving that as the output to Microsoft Face API, which is hosted over Microsoft Azure cloud support.
