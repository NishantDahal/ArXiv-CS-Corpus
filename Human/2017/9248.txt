Energy-Efficient Joint Unicast and Multicast Beamforming with Multi-Antenna User Terminals

This paper studies energy-efficient joint transmit and receive beamforming in multi-cell multi-user multiple-input multiple-output systems. We consider conventional network energy efficiency metric where the users can receive unicasting streams in addition to the group-specific common multicasting streams which have certain rate constraints. The goal is to use the transmission resources more efficiently to improve the energy efficiency, when the users are equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results show the achieved energy efficiency gains by using the additional degrees of freedom of the multicasting transmission to private message unicasting.
