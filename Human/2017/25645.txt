Multi-destination Aggregation with Binary Symmetric Broadcast Channel Based Coding in 802.11 WLANs

In this paper we consider the potential benefits of adopting a binary symmetric broadcast channel paradigm for multi-destination aggregation in 802.11 WLANs, as opposed to a more conventional packet erasure channel paradigm. We propose two approaches for multi-destination aggregation, i.e. superposition coding and a simpler time-sharing coding. Theoretical and simulation results for both unicast and multicast traffic demonstrate that increases in network throughput of more than 100% are possible over a wide range of network conditions and that the much simpler time-sharing scheme yields most of these gains and have minimal loss of performance. Importantly, these performance gains are achieved exclusively through software rather than hardware changes.
