Comparison of fingerprint authentication algorithms for small imaging sensors

The demand for biometric systems has been increasing with the growth of the smartphone market. Biometric devices allow the user to authenticate easily while securing its private data without the need to remember any access code. Amongst them, fingerprint sensors are the most widespread because they seem to provide a good balance between reliability, cost and ease of use. According to smartphone manufacturers, the security level is guaranteed to be high. However, the size of those sensors, which is only a few millimeters squared, prevents the use of minutiae algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, very few studies shed light onto this problem, though many pattern recognition algorithms already exist as well as commercial solutions which are supposedly robust. In this article we try to provide insights on how to tackle this problem by analyzing the performance of three algorithms dedicated to pattern recognition.
