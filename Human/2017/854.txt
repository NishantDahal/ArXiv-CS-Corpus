Greedy Sparse Signal Reconstruction Using Matching Pursuit Based on Hope-tree

The reconstruction of sparse signals requires the solution of an $\ell_0$-norm minimization problem in Compressed Sensing. Previous research has focused on the investigation of a single candidate to identify the support (index of nonzero elements) of a sparse signal. To ensure that the optimal candidate can be obtained in each iteration, we propose here an iterative greedy reconstruction algorithm (GSRA). First, the intersection of the support sets estimated by the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Subspace Pursuit (SP) is set as the initial support set. Then, a hope-tree is built to expand the set. Finally, a developed decreasing subspace pursuit method is used to rectify the candidate set. Detailed simulation results demonstrate that GSRA is more accurate than other typical methods in recovering Gaussian signals, 0--1 sparse signals, and synthetic signals.
