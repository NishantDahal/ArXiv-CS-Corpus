Polar codes for secret sharing

A secret can be an encrypted message or a private key to decrypt the ciphertext. One of the main issues in cryptography is keeping this secret safe. Entrusting secret to one person or saving it in a computer can conclude betrayal of the person or destruction of that device. For solving this issue, secret sharing can be used between some individuals which a coalition of a specific number of them can only get access to the secret. In practical issues, some of the members have more power and by a coalition of fewer of them, they should know about the secret. In a bank, for example, president and deputy can have a union with two members by each other. In this paper, by using Polar codes secret sharing has been studied and a secret sharing scheme based on Polar codes has been introduced. Information needed for any member would be sent by the channel which Polar codes are constructed by it.
