Evaluation of Lightweight Block Ciphers in Hardware Implementation: A Comprehensive Survey

The conventional cryptography solutions are ill-suited to strict memory, size and power limitations of resource-constrained devices, so lightweight cryptography solutions have been specifically developed for this type of applications. In this domain of cryptography, the term lightweight never refers to inadequately low security, but rather to establishing the best balance to maintain sufficient security. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey evaluation of lightweight block ciphers in terms of their speed, cost, performance, and balanced efficiency in hardware implementation, and facilitates the comparison of studied ciphers in these respects. The cost of lightweight block ciphers is evaluated with the metric of Gate Equivalent (Fig.1), their speed with the metric of clock-cycle-per-block (Fig.2), their performance with the metric of throughput (Fig.3) and their balanced efficiency with the metric of Figure of Merit (Fig.4). The results of these evaluations show that SIMON, SPECK, and Piccolo are the best lightweight block ciphers in hardware implementation.(Abstract)
