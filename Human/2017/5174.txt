Video transrating in AVC and HEVC transcoding

HEVC (MPEG-H Part 2 and H.265) is a new coding technology which is expected to be deployed on the market along with new video services in the near future. HEVC is a successor of currently widely used AVC (MPEG-4 Part 10 and H.264). In this paper, the quality coding gains obtained for the Cascaded Pixel Domain Transcoder of AVC-coded material to HEVC standard are reported. Extensive experiments showed that transcoding with bitrate reduction allows the achievement of better rate-distortion performance than by compressing an original video sequence with the use of AVC at the same (reduced) bitrate.
