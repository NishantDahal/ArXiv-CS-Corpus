Sample Complexity of the Boolean Multireference Alignment Problem

The Boolean multireference alignment problem consists in recovering a Boolean signal from multiple shifted and noisy observations. In this paper we obtain an expression for the error exponent of the maximum A posteriori decoder. This expression is used to characterize the number of measurements needed for signal recovery in the low SNR regime, in terms of higher order autocorrelations of the signal. The characterization is explicit for various signal dimensions, such as prime and even dimensions.
