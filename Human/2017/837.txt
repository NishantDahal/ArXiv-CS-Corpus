On the Tradeoff Region of Secure Exact-Repair Regenerating Codes

We consider the $(n,k,d,\ell)$ secure exact-repair regenerating code problem, which generalizes the $(n,k,d)$ exact-repair regenerating code problem with the additional constraint that the stored file needs to be kept information-theoretically secure against an eavesdropper, who can access the data transmitted to regenerate a total of $\ell$ different failed nodes. For all known results on this problem, the achievable tradeoff regions between the normalized storage capacity and repair bandwidth have a single corner point, achieved by a scheme proposed by Shah, Rashmi and Kumar (the SRK point). Since the achievable tradeoff regions of the exact-repair regenerating code problem without any secrecy constraints are known to have multiple corner points in general, these existing results suggest a phase-change-like behavior, i.e., enforcing a secrecy constraint ($\ell\geq 1$) immediately reduces the tradeoff region to one with a single corner point. In this work, we first show that when the secrecy parameter $\ell$ is sufficiently large, the SRK point is indeed the only corner point of the tradeoff region. However, when $\ell$ is small, we show that the tradeoff region can in fact have multiple corner points. In particular, we establish a precise characterization of the tradeoff region for the $(7,6,6,1)$ problem, which has exactly two corner points. Thus, a smooth transition, instead of a phase-change-type of transition, should be expected as the secrecy constraint is gradually strengthened.
