Data Dissemination using Instantly Decodable Binary Codes in Fog-Radio Access Networks

Consider a device-to-device (D2D) fog-radio access network wherein a set of devices are required to store a set of files. Each device is connected to a subset of the cloud data centers and thus possesses a subset of the data. This paper investigates the problem of disseminating all files among the devices while reducing the total time of communication, i.e., the completion time, using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). While previous studies on the use of IDNC in D2D systems assume a fully connected communication network, this paper tackles the more realistic scenario of a partially connected network in which devices can only target devices in their transmission range. The paper first formulates the optimal joint optimization of selecting the transmitting device(s) and the file combination(s) and exhibits its intractability. The completion time is approximated using the celebrated decoding delay approach by deriving the relationship between the quantities in a partially connected network. The paper introduces the cooperation graph and demonstrates that the relaxed problem is equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem over the newly designed graph wherein the weights are obtained by solving a similar problem on the local IDNC graphs. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed solution provides noticeable performance enhancement and outperforms previously proposed IDNC-based schemes.
