Random Caching in Backhaul-Limited Multi-Antenna Networks: Analysis and Area Spectrum Efficiency Optimization

Caching at base stations is a promising technology to satisfy the increasing capacity requirements and reduce the backhaul loads in future wireless networks. Careful design of random caching can fully exploit the file popularity and achieve good performance. However, previous works on random caching scheme usually assumed single antenna at BSs and users, which is not the case in practical multi-antenna networks. In this paper, we consider the analysis and optimization in the cache-enabled multi-antenna networks with limited backhaul. We first derive a closed-form expression and a simple tight upper bound of the successful transmission probability, using tools from stochastic geometry and a gamma approximation. Based on the analytic results, we then consider the area spectrum efficiency maximization by optimizing design parameters, which is a complicated mixed-integer optimization problem. After analyzing the optimal properties, we obtain a local optimal solution with lower complexity. To further simplify the optimization, we then solve an asymptotic optimization problem in the high user density region, using the upper bound as the objective function. Numerical simulations show that the asymptotic optimal caching scheme achieves better performance over existing caching schemes. The analysis and optimization results provide insightful design guidelines for random caching in practical networks.
