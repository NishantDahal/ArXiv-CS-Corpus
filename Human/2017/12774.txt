Strawman: an Ensemble of Deep Bag-of-Ngrams for Sentiment Analysis

This paper describes a builder entry, named "strawman", to the sentence-level sentiment analysis task of the "Build It, Break It" shared task of the First Workshop on Building Linguistically Generalizable NLP Systems. The goal of a builder is to provide an automated sentiment analyzer that would serve as a target for breakers whose goal is to find pairs of minimally-differing sentences that break the analyzer.
