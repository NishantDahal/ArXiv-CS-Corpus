Intelligent Infrastructure for Smart Agriculture: An Integrated Food, Energy and Water System

Agriculture provides economic opportunity through innovation; helps rural America to thrive; promotes agricultural production that better nourishes Americans; and aims to preserve natural resources through healthy private working lands, conservation, improved watersheds, and restored forests. From agricultural production to food supply, agriculture supports rural and urban economies across the U.S. It accounts for 10% of U.S. jobs and is currently creating new jobs in the growing field of data-driven farming. However, U.S. global competitiveness associated with food and nutrition security is at risk because of accelerated investments by many other countries in agriculture, food, energy, and resource management. To ensure U.S. global competitiveness and long-term food security, it is imperative that we build sustainable physical and cyber infrastructures to enable self-managing and sustainable farming. Such infrastructures should enable next generation precision-farms by harnessing modern and emerging technologies such as small satellites, broadband Internet, tele-operation, augmented reality, advanced data analytics, sensors, and robotics.
