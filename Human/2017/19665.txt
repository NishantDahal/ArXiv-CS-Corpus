On strictly Chordality-k graphs

Strictly Chordality-k graphs (SC_k graphs) are graphs which are either cycle free or every induced cycle is exactly k, for some fixed k, k \geq 3. Note that k = 3 and k = 4 are precisely the Chordal graphs and Chordal Bipartite graphs, respectively. In this paper, we initiate a structural and an algorithmic study of SCk, k \geq 5 graphs.
