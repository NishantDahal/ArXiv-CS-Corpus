Context Aware Document Embedding

Recently, doc2vec has achieved excellent results in different tasks. In this paper, we present a context aware variant of doc2vec. We introduce a novel weight estimating mechanism that generates weights for each word occurrence according to its contribution in the context, using deep neural networks. Our context aware model can achieve similar results compared to doc2vec initialized byWikipedia trained vectors, while being much more efficient and free from heavy external corpus. Analysis of context aware weights shows they are a kind of enhanced IDF weights that capture sub-topic level keywords in documents. They might result from deep neural networks that learn hidden representations with the least entropy.
