Multi-hop Links Quality Analysis of 5G Enabled Vehicular Networks

With the emerging of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems, millimeter wave transmissions are believed to be a promising solution for vehicular networks, especially in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications. In millimeter wave V2V communications, different vehicular networking services have different quality requirements for V2V multi-hop links. To evaluate the quality of different V2V wireless links, a new link quality indicator is proposed in this paper considering requirements of the real-time and the reliability in V2V multi-hop links. Moreover, different weight factors are configured to reflect the different requirements of different types of services on real-time and reliability in the new quality indicator. Based on the proposed link quality indicator, the relationship between V2V link quality and one-hop communication distance under different vehicle densities is analyzed in this paper. Simulation results indicate that the link quality is improved with the increasing of vehicle density and there exists an optimal one-hop communication distance for the link quality when the vehicle density is fixed.
