On the complete weight enumerators of some linear codes with a few weights

Linear codes with a few weights have important applications in authentication codes, secret sharing, consumer electronics, etc.. The determination of the parameters such as Hamming weight distributions and complete weight enumerators of linear codes are important research topics. In this paper, we consider some classes of linear codes with a few weights and determine the complete weight enumerators from which the corresponding Hamming weight distributions are derived with help of some sums involving Legendre symbol.
