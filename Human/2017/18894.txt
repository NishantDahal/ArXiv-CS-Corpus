Deep learning: Technical introduction

This note presents in a technical though hopefully pedagogical way the three most common forms of neural network architectures: Feedforward, Convolutional and Recurrent. For each network, their fundamental building blocks are detailed. The forward pass and the update rules for the backpropagation algorithm are then derived in full.
