System Reliability, Fault Tolerance and Design Metrics Tradeoffs in the Distributed Minority and Majority Voting Based Redundancy Scheme

The distributed minority and majority voting based redundancy (DMMR) scheme was recently proposed as an efficient alternative to the conventional N-modular redundancy (NMR) scheme for the physical design of mission/safety-critical circuits and systems. The DMMR scheme enables significant improvements in fault tolerance and design metrics compared to the NMR scheme albeit at the expense of a slight decrease in the system reliability. In this context, this paper studies the system reliability, fault tolerance and design metrics tradeoffs in the DMMR scheme compared to the NMR scheme when the majority logic group of the DMMR scheme is increased in size relative to the minority logic group. Some example DMMR and NMR systems were realized using a 32/28nm CMOS process and compared. The results show that 5-of-M DMMR systems have a similar or better fault tolerance whilst requiring similar or fewer function modules than their counterpart NMR systems and simultaneously achieve optimizations in design metrics. Nevertheless, 3-of-M DMMR systems have the upper hand with respect to fault tolerance and design metrics optimizations than the comparable NMR and 5-of-M DMMR systems. With regard to system reliability, NMR systems are closely followed by 5-of-M DMMR systems which are closely followed by 3-of-M DMMR systems. The verdict is 3-of-M DMMR systems are preferable to implement higher levels of redundancy from a combined system reliability, fault tolerance and design metrics perspective to realize mission/safety-critical circuits and systems.
