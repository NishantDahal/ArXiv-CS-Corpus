Coarse-graining and the Blackwell order

Suppose we have a pair of information channels, $κ_{1},κ_{2}$, with a common input. The Blackwell order is a partial order over channels that compares $κ_{1}$ and $κ_{2}$ by the maximal expected utility an agent can obtain when decisions are based on the channel outputs. Equivalently, $κ_{1}$ is said to be Blackwell-inferior to $κ_{2}$ if and only if $κ_{1}$ can be constructed by garbling the output of $κ_{2}$. A related partial order stipulates that $κ_{2}$ is more capable than $κ_{1}$ if the mutual information between the input and output is larger for $κ_{2}$ than for $κ_{1}$ for any distribution over inputs. A Blackwell-inferior channel is necessarily less capable. However, examples are known where $κ_{1}$ is less capable than $κ_{2}$ but not Blackwell-inferior. We show that this may even happen when $κ_{1}$ is constructed by coarse-graining the inputs of $κ_{2}$. Such a coarse-graining is a special kind of "pre-garbling" of the channel inputs. This example directly establishes that the expected value of the shared utility function for the coarse-grained channel is larger than it is for the non-coarse-grained channel. This contradicts the intuition that coarse-graining can only destroy information and lead to inferior channels. We also discuss our results in the context of information decompositions.
