Triangular Decomposition of Matrices in a Domain

Deterministic recursive algorithms for the computation of matrix triangular decompositions with permutations like LU and Bruhat decomposition are presented for the case of commutative domains. This decomposition can be considered as a generalization of LU and Bruhat decompositions, because they both may be easily obtained from this triangular decomposition. Algorithms have the same complexity as the algorithm of matrix multiplication.
