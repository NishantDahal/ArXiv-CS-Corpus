Recent progress on conditional randomness

In this article, recent progress on ML-randomness with respect to conditional probabilities is reviewed. In particular a new result of conditional randomness with respect to mutually singular probabilities are shown, which is a generalization of Hanssen's result (2010) for Bernoulli processes.
