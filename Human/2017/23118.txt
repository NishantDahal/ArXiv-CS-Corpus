Multi-agent based IoT smart waste monitoring and collection architecture

Solid waste management is one of the existing challenges in urban areas and it is becoming a critical issue due to rapid increase in population. Appropriate solid waste management systems are important for improving the environment and the well being of residents. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for real time waste monitoring and collection has been proposed; able to improve and optimize solid waste collection in a city. Netlogo Multiagent platform has been used to simulate real time monitoring and smart decisions on waste management. Waste filling level in bins and truck collection process are abstracted to a multiagent model and citizen are involved by paying the price for waste collection services. Furthermore, waste level data are updated and recorded continuously and are provided to decision algorithms to determine the vehicle optimal route for waste collection to the distributed bins in the city. Several simulation cases executed and results validated. The presented solution gives substantial benefits to all waste stakeholders by enabling the waste collection process to be more efficient.
