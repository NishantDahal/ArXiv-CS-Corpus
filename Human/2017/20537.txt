Small-depth Multilinear Formula Lower Bounds for Iterated Matrix Multiplication, with Applications

In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$ many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$, and show that the well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.
  Formally, for each depth $Δ\leq \log d$, we show that any product-depth $Δ$ multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have size $\exp(Ω(Δd^{1/Δ})).$ It also follows from this that any multilinear circuit of product-depth $Δ$ for the same polynomial of the above form must have a size of $\exp(Ω(d^{1/Δ})).$ In particular, any polynomial-sized multilinear formula for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth $Ω(\log d)$, and any polynomial-sized multilinear circuit for $\mathrm{IMM}_d$ must have depth $Ω(\log d/\log \log d).$ Both these bounds are tight up to constant factors.
  1. Depth-reduction: A well-known result of Brent (JACM 1974) implies that any formula of size $s$ can be converted to one of size $s^{O(1)}$ and depth $O(\log s)$; further, this reduction continues to hold for multilinear formulas. Our lower bound implies that any depth-reduction in the multilinear setting cannot reduce the depth to $o(\log s)$ without a superpolynomial blow-up in size.
  2. Separations from general formulas: Our result, along with a non-trivial upper bound for $\mathrm{IMM}_{d}$ implied by a result of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal and Saptharishi (SICOMP 2016), shows that for any size $s$ and product-depth $Δ= o(\log s),$ general formulas of size $s$ and product-depth $Δ$ cannot be converted to multilinear formulas of size $s^{ω(1)}$ and product-depth $Δ,$ when the underlying field has characteristic zero.
