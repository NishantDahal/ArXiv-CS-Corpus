360 Panorama Cloning on Sphere

In this paper, we address a novel problem of cloning a patch of the source spherical panoramic image to the target spherical panoramic image, which we call 360 panorama cloning. Considering the sphere geometry constraint embedded in spherical panoramic images, we develop a coordinate-based method that directly clones in the spherical domain. Our method neither differentiates the polar regions and equatorial regions, nor identifies the boundaries in the unrolled planar-formatted panorama. We discuss in depth two unique issues in panorama cloning, i.e. preserving the patch's orientation, and handling the large-patch cloning (covering over 180 field of view) which may suffer from discoloration artifacts. As experimental results demonstrate, our method is able to get visually pleasing cloning results and achieve real time cloning performance.
