Python Implementation and Construction of Finite Abelian Groups

Here we present a working framework to establish finite abelian groups in python. The primary aim is to allow new A-level students to work with examples of finite abelian groups using open source software. We include the code used in the implementation of the framework. We also prove some useful results regarding finite abelian groups which are used to establish the functions and help show how number theoretic results can blend with computational power when studying algebra. The groups established are based modular multiplication and addition. We include direct products of cyclic groups meaning the user has access to all finite abelian groups.
