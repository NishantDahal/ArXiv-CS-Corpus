Full-Duplex Operations in Wireless Powered Communication Networks

In this paper, a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) consisting of a hybrid access point (H-AP) and multiple user equipment (UEs), all of which operate in full-duplex (FD), is described. We first propose a transceiver structure that enables FD operation of each UE to simultaneously receive energy in the downlink (DL) and transmit information in the uplink (UL). We then provide an energy usage model in the proposed UE transceiver that accounts for the energy leakage from the transmit chain to the receive chain. It is shown that the throughput of an FD WPCN using the proposed FD UEs can be maximized by optimally allocating the UL transmission time to the UEs by solving a convex optimization problem. Simulation results reveal that the use of the proposed FD UEs efficiently improves the throughput of a WPCN with practical self-interference cancellation (SIC) capability at the H-AP. With current SIC technologies reducing the power of the residual self-interference to the level of background noise, the proposed FD WPCN using FD UEs achieves 18% and 25 % of throughput gain as compared to the conventional FD WPCN using HD UEs and HD WPCN, respectively.
