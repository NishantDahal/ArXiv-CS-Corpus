A Preamble Collision Resolution Scheme via Tagged Preambles for Cellular IoT/M2M Communications

In this paper, we propose a preamble (PA) collision resolution (PACR) scheme based on multiple timing advance (TA) values captured via tagged PAs. In the proposed PACR scheme, tags are embedded in random access (RA) PAs and multiple TA values are captured for a single detected PA during a tag detection procedure. The proposed PACR scheme significantly improves RA success probability for stationary machine nodes since the nodes using collided PAs can successfully complete the corresponding RAs using exclusive data resource blocks.
