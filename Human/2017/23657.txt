It is one of the significant developments in short-range wireless communication technology. As stated by the SIG, the new standard will forever change the way people approach the Internet of Things (IoT), turning it into something that takes place around them in an almost natural and transparent way. In this article, the future IoT scenarios and use cases that justify the push for Bluetooth 5 are introduced. A set of new technical features that are included in Bluetooth 5 are presented, and their advantages and drawbacks are described.
