Achievable Rate Regions Using Novel Location Assisted Coding (LAC)

The recent increase in number of wireless devices has been driven by the growing markets of smart homes and the Internet of Things (IoT). As a result, expanding and/or efficient utilization of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum is critical to accommodate such an increase in wireless bandwidth. Alternatively, recent free-space optical (FSO) communication technologies have demonstrated the feasibility of building WiFO, a high capacity indoor wireless network using the femtocell architecture. Since FSO transmission does not interfere with the RF signals, such a system can be integrated with the current WiFi systems to provide orders of magnitude improvement in bandwidth. A novel component of WiFO is its ability to jointly encode bits from different flows for optimal transmissions. In this paper, we introduce the WiFO architecture and a novel cooperative transmission framework using location assisted coding (LAC) technique to increase the overall wireless capacity. Specifically, achievable rate regions for WiFO using LAC will be characterized. Both numerical and theoretical analyses are given to validate the proposed coding schemes.
