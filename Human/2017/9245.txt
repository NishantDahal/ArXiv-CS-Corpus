Uplink Analysis of Large MU-MIMO Systems With Space-Constrained Arrays in Ricean Fading

Closed-form approximations to the expected per-terminal signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and ergodic sum spectral efficiency of a large multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system are presented. Our analysis assumes correlated Ricean fading with maximum ratio combining on the uplink, where the base station (BS) is equipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) with physical size restrictions. Unlike previous studies, our model caters for the presence of unequal correlation matrices and unequal Rice factors for each terminal. As the number of BS antennas grows without bound, with a finite number of terminals, we derive the limiting expected per-terminal SINR and ergodic sum spectral efficiency of the system. Our findings suggest that with restrictions on the size of the ULA, the expected SINR saturates with increasing operating signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and BS antennas. Whilst unequal correlation matrices result in higher performance, the presence of strong line-of-sight (LoS) has an opposite effect. Our analysis accommodates changes in system dimensions, SNR, LoS levels, spatial correlation levels and variations in fixed physical spacings of the BS array.
