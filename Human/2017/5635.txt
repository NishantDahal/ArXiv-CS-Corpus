Two-way relay beamforming optimization for full-duplex SWIPT systems

In this paper, we investigate the problem of two-way relay beamforming optimization to maximize the achievable sum-rate of a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with a full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. In particular, we address the optimal joint design of the receiver power splitting (PS) ratio and the beamforming matrix at the relay node given the channel state information (CSI). Our contribution is an iterative algorithm based on difference of convex (DC) programming and one-dimensional searching to achieve the joint optimal solution. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
