An experimental mechatronic design and control of a 5 DOF Robotic arm for identification and sorting of different sized objects

The purpose of this paper is to present the construction and programming of a five degrees of freedom robotic arm which interacts with an infrared sensor for the identification and sorting of different sized objects. The main axis of the construction design will be up to the three main branches of science that make up the Mechatronics: Mechanical Engineering, Electronic-Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. The methods that have been used for the construction are presented as well as the methods for the programming of the arm in cooperation with the sensor. The aim is to present the manual and automatic control of the arm for the recognition and the installation of the objects through a simple (in operation) and low in cost sensor like the one that was used by this paper. Furthermore, this paper presents the significance of this robotic arm design and its further applications in contemporary industrial forms of production.
