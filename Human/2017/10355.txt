One generator quasi-cyclic codes over F2 + uF2 + vF2 + uvF2

In this paper, we study the structure of 1-generator quasi-cyclic codes over the ring R = F2 + uF2 + vF2 + uvF2, with u2 = v2 = 0 and uv = vu. We determine the minimal spanning sets for these codes. As a generalization of these codes, we also investigate the structure of 1-generator generalized quasi-cyclic codes over R and determine a BCH type bound for them.
