A New Paradigm for Robotic Dust Collection: Theorems, User Studies, and a Field Study

We pioneer a new future in robotic dust collection by introducing passive dust-collecting robots that, unlike their predecessors, do not require locomotion to collect dust. While previous research has exclusively focused on active dust-collecting robots, we show that these robots fail with respect to practical and theoretical aspects, as well as human factors. By contrast, passive robots, through their unconstrained versatility, shine brilliantly in all three metrics. We present a mathematical formalism of both paradigms followed by a user study and field study.
