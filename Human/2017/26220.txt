On the Existence and Structure of Mixed Nash Equilibria for In-Band Full-Duplex Wireless Networks

This article offers the first characterisation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for a wireless system with full-duplex capable terminals that share a common channel via Aloha-based contention. Focussing on a simple grid topology, we prove that mixed MNE exist only if proportionality, driven by the accuracy of self-interference cancellation, is granted between the cost undergone for full- and half-duplex operations. The analysis shows how a proper selection of such costs allows MNE that are also optimal from a network viewpoint in terms of aggregate throughput. The sensitivity of system performance to costs is tackled and discussed considering the price of anarchy.
