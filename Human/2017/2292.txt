An Information-Theoretic Analysis of the Gaussian Multicast Channel with Interactive User Cooperation

We consider the transmission of a common message from a transmitter to three receivers over a broadcast channel, referred to as a multicast channel in this case. All the receivers are allowed to cooperate with each other over full-duplex bi-directional non-orthogonal cooperation links. We investigate the information-theoretic upper and lower bounds on the transmission rate. In particular, we propose a three-receiver fully interactive cooperation scheme (3FC) based on superpositions of CF and DF at the receivers. In the 3FC scheme, the receivers interactively perform compress-forward (CF) simultaneously to initiate the scheme, and then decode-forward (DF) sequentially to allow a correlation of each layer of the DF superposition in cooperation with the transmitter toward the next receiver in the chain to improve the achievable rate. The analysis leads to a closed-form expression that allows for numerical evaluation, and also gives some insight on key points to design interactive schemes. The numerical results provided in the Gaussian case show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes and show the benefit of interaction.
