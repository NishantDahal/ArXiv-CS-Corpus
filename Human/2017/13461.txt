Learn More, Pay Less! Lessons Learned from Applying the Wizard-of-Oz Technique for Exploring Mobile App Requirements

Mobile apps have exploded in popularity, encouraging developers to provide content to the massive user base of the main app stores. Although there exist automated techniques that can classify user comments into various topics with high levels of precision, recent studies have shown that the top apps in the app stores do not have customer ratings that directly correlate with the app's success. This implies that no single requirements elicitation technique can cover the full depth required to produce a successful product and that applying alternative requirements gathering techniques can lead to success when these two are combined. Since user involvement has been found to be the most impactful contribution to project success, in this paper we will explore how the Wizard of Oz (WOz) technique and user reviews available in Google Play, can be integrated to produce a product that meets the demand of more stakeholders than either method alone. To compare the role of early interactive requirements specification and app reviews, we conducted two studies (i) a case study analysis on 13 mobile app development teams who used very early stages Requirements Engineering (RE) by applying WOz, and (ii) a study analyzing 40 (70, 592 reviews) similar mobile apps on Google Play. The results of both studies show that while each of WOz and app review analysis techniques can be applied to capture specific types of requirements, an integrated process including both methods would eliminate the communication gap between users and developers at early stages of the development process and mitigates the risk of requirements change in later stages.
