Multi-behavioral Sequential Prediction with Recurrent Log-bilinear Model

With the rapid growth of Internet applications, sequential prediction in collaborative filtering has become an emerging and crucial task. Given the behavioral history of a specific user, predicting his or her next choice plays a key role in improving various online services. Meanwhile, there are more and more scenarios with multiple types of behaviors, while existing works mainly study sequences with a single type of behavior. As a widely used approach, Markov chain based models are based on a strong independence assumption. As two classical neural network methods for modeling sequences, recurrent neural networks cannot well model short-term contexts, and the log-bilinear model is not suitable for long-term contexts. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Log-BiLinear (RLBL) model. It can model multiple types of behaviors in historical sequences with behavior-specific transition matrices. RLBL applies a recurrent structure for modeling long-term contexts. It models several items in each hidden layer and employs position-specific transition matrices for modeling short-term contexts. Moreover, considering continuous time difference in behavioral history is a key factor for dynamic prediction, we further extend RLBL and replace position-specific transition matrices with time-specific transition matrices, and accordingly propose a Time-Aware Recurrent Log-BiLinear (TA-RLBL) model. Experimental results show that the proposed RLBL model and TA-RLBL model yield significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on three datasets, i.e., Movielens-1M dataset, Global Terrorism Database and Tmall dataset with different numbers of behavior types.
