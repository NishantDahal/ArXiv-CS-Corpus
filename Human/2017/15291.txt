Carnot Efficiency of Publication

This paper analyzes publication efficiency in terms of Hirsch-index or h-index and total citations, with an analogy to the Carnot efficiency used in thermodynamics. Such publication efficiency, with typical value of 30%, can be utilized to normalize the research output judgment, favoring quality outputs in reduced quantity, which is currently lacking in many discipline.
