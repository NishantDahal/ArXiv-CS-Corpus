Topological indices of k-th subdivision and semi total point graphs

Graph theory has provided a very useful tool, called topological indices which are a number obtained from the graph $G$ with the property that every graph $H$ isomorphic to $G$, value of a topological index must be same for both $G$ and $H$. In this article, we present exact expressions for some topological indices of k-th subdivision graph and semi total point graphs respectively, which are a generalization of ordinary subdivision and semi total graph for $k\ge 1$.
