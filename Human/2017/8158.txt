Sequential Dynamic Decision Making with Deep Neural Nets on a Test-Time Budget

Deep neural network (DNN) based approaches hold significant potential for reinforcement learning (RL) and have already shown remarkable gains over state-of-art methods in a number of applications. The effectiveness of DNN methods can be attributed to leveraging the abundance of supervised data to learn value functions, Q-functions, and policy function approximations without the need for feature engineering. Nevertheless, the deployment of DNN-based predictors with very deep architectures can pose an issue due to computational and other resource constraints at test-time in a number of applications. We propose a novel approach for reducing the average latency by learning a computationally efficient gating function that is capable of recognizing states in a sequential decision process for which policy prescriptions of a shallow network suffices and deeper layers of the DNN have little marginal utility. The overall system is adaptive in that it dynamically switches control actions based on state-estimates in order to reduce average latency without sacrificing terminal performance. We experiment with a number of alternative loss-functions to train gating functions and shallow policies and show that in a number of applications a speed-up of up to almost 5X can be obtained with little loss in performance.
