On the Communication Cost of Determining an Approximate Nearest Lattice Point

We consider the closest lattice point problem in a distributed network setting and study the communication cost and the error probability for computing an approximate nearest lattice point, using the nearest-plane algorithm, due to Babai. Two distinct communication models, centralized and interactive, are considered. The importance of proper basis selection is addressed. Assuming a reduced basis for a two-dimensional lattice, we determine the approximation error of the nearest plane algorithm. The communication cost for determining the Babai point, or equivalently, for constructing the rectangular nearest-plane partition, is calculated in the interactive setting. For the centralized model, an algorithm is presented for reducing the communication cost of the nearest plane algorithm in an arbitrary number of dimensions.
