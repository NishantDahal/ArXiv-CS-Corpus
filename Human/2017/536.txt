Locally recoverable codes from algebraic curves and surfaces

A locally recoverable code is a code over a finite alphabet such that the value of any single coordinate of a codeword can be recovered from the values of a small subset of other coordinates. Building on work of Barg, Tamo, and Vlăduţ, we present several constructions of locally recoverable codes from algebraic curves and surfaces.
