Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Full-Duplex Systems with Massive Antenna Arrays

We consider a multiuser wireless system with a full-duplex hybrid access point (HAP) that transmits to a set of users in the downlink channel, while receiving data from a set of energy-constrained sensors in the uplink channel. We assume that the HAP is equipped with a massive antenna array, while all users and sensor nodes have a single antenna. We adopt a time-switching protocol where in the first phase, sensors are powered through wireless energy transfer from HAP and HAP estimates the downlink channel of the users. In the second phase, sensors use the harvested energy to transmit to the HAP. The downlink-uplink sum-rate region is obtained by solving downlink sum-rate maximization problem under a constraint on uplink sum-rate. Moreover, assuming perfect and imperfect channel state information, we derive expressions for the achievable uplink and downlink rates in the large-antenna limit and approximate results that hold for any finite number of antennas. Based on these analytical results, we obtain the power-scaling law and analyze the effect of the number of antennas on the cancellation of intra-user interference and the self-interference.
