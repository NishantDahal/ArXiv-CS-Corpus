Mining Significant Microblogs for Misinformation Identification: An Attention-based Approach

With the rapid growth of social media, massive misinformation is also spreading widely on social media, such as microblog, and bring negative effects to human life. Nowadays, automatic misinformation identification has drawn attention from academic and industrial communities. For an event on social media usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly based on global statistical features. However, information on social media is full of noisy and outliers, which should be alleviated. Moreover, most of microblogs about an event have little contribution to the identification of misinformation, where useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless information. Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for a reliable misinformation identification method. In this paper, we propose an Attention-based approach for Identification of Misinformation (AIM). Based on the attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with largest attention values for misinformation identification. The attention mechanism in AIM contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention is calculated based textual features of each microblog. Dynamic attention is related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the beginning of the event. To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series of experiments on the Weibo dataset and the Twitter dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed AIM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
