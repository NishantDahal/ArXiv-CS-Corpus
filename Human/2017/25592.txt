Terrain Database Correlation Assessment Using an Open Source Tool

Configuring networked simulators for training military teams in a distributed environment requires the usage of a set of terrain databases to represent the same training area. The results of simulation exercises can be degraded if the terrain databases are poorly correlated. A number of methodologies for determining the correlation between terrain databaHowever, there are few computational tools for this task and most of them were developed to address government needs, have limited availability, and handle specific digital formats. The goal of this paper is thus to present a novel open source tool developed as part of an academic research project.
