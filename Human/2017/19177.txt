Arithmetic Circuits for Multilevel Qudits Based on Quantum Fourier Transform

We present some basic integer arithmetic quantum circuits, such as adders and multipliers-accumulators of various forms, as well as diagonal operators, which operate on multilevel qudits. The integers to be processed are represented in an alternative basis after they have been Fourier transformed. Several arithmetic circuits operating on Fourier transformed integers have appeared in the literature for two level qubits. Here we extend these techniques on multilevel qudits, as they may offer some advantages relative to qubits implementations. The arithmetic circuits presented can be used as basic building blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation, quantum simulation, quantum optimization etc., but they can also be used in the implementation of a quantum fractional Fourier transform as it is shown in a companion work presented separately.
