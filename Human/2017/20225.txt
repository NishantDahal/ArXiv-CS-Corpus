On the Duality of Fractional Repetition Codes

Erasure codes have emerged as an efficient technology for providing data redundancy in distributed storage systems. However, it is a challenging task to repair the failed storage nodes in erasure-coded storage systems, which requires large quantities of network resources. In this paper, we study fractional repetition (FR) codes, which enable the minimal repair complexity and also minimum repair bandwidth during node repair. We focus on the duality of FR codes, and investigate the relationship between the supported file size of an FR code and its dual code. Furthermore, we present a dual bound on the supported file size of FR codes.
