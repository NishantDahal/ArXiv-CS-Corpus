Towards Decision Support for Smart Energy Systems based on Spatio-temporal Models

This report presents our SmartSpace event handling framework for managing smart-grids and renewable energy installations. SmartSpace provides decision support for human stakeholders. Based on different datasources that feed into our framework, a variety of analysis and decision steps are supported. These decision steps are ultimately used to provide adequate information to human stakeholders. The paper discusses potential data sources for decisions around smart energy systems and introduces a spatio-temporal modeling technique for the involved data. Operations to reason about the formalized data are provided. Our spatio-temporal models help to provide a semantic context for the data. Customized rules allow the specification of conditions under which information is provided to stakeholders. We exemplify our ideas and present our demonstrators including visualization capabilities.
