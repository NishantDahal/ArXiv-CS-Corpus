Two weight $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$-codes, $p$ odd prime

We show that regular homogeneous two-weight $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$-codes where $p$ is odd and $k\geqslant 2$ with dual Hamming distance at least four do not exist. The proof relies on existence conditions for the strongly regular graph built on the cosets of the dual code.
