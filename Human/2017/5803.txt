Execution-Cache-Memory Performance Model: Introduction and Validation

This report serves two purposes: To introduce and validate the Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) performance model and to provide a thorough analysis of current Intel processor architectures with a special emphasis on Intel Xeon Haswell-EP. The ECM model is a simple analytical performance model which focuses on basic architectural resources. The architectural analysis and model predictions are showcased and validated using a set of elementary microbenchmarks.
