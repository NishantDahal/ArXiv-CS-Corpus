Blockchain Based Intelligent Vehicle Data sharing Framework

The Intelligent vehicle (IV) is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from many security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable to provide secure IV data sharing. The major issues in IV data sharing are trust, data accuracy and reliability of data sharing data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV Data sharing. In this paper, we have proposed Intelligent Vehicle data sharing we are proposing a trust environment based Intelligent Vehicle framework. In proposed framework, we have use the blockchain technology as backbone of the IV data-sharing environment. The blockchain technology is provide the trust environment between the vehicles with the based on proof of driving.
