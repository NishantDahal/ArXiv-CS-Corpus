A Game-Theoretic Model for Analysis and Design of Self-Organization Mechanisms in IoT

We propose a framework based on Network Formation Game for self-organization in the Internet of Things (IoT), in which heterogeneous and multi-interface nodes are modeled as self-interested agents who individually decide on establishment and severance of links to other agents. Through analysis of the static game, we formally confirm the emergence of realistic topologies from our model, and analytically establish the criteria that lead to stable multi-hop network structures.
