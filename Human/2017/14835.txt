Joint Cell Muting and User Scheduling in Multi-Cell Networks with Temporal Fairness

A semi-centralized joint cell muting and user scheduling scheme for interference coordination in a multicell network is proposed under two different temporal fairness criteria. The main principle behind the proposed scheme is that a central entity selects a cell muting pattern out of a pattern set at a decision instant, and subsequently the un-muted base stations opportunistically schedule the users in the associated cells, both decisions made on a temporal-fair basis. Although some pattern sets are easily obtainable from static frequency reuse systems, we propose a more general pattern set construction algorithm in this paper. As for the first fairness criterion, all cells are assigned to receive the same temporal share with the ratio between the temporal share of a cell center section and that of the cell edge section is set to a fixed desired value for all cells. The second fairness criterion is based on the max-min temporal fairness for which the temporal share of the network-wide worst-case user is maximized. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for both criteria. The impact of choice of the cell muting pattern set is also studied through numerical examples for various cellular topologies.
