Information Storage and Retrieval using Macromolecules as Storage Media

To store information at extremely high-density and data-rate, we propose to adapt, integrate, and extend the techniques developed by chemists and molecular biologists for the purpose of manipulating biological and other macromolecules. In principle, volumetric densities in excess of 10^21 bits/cm^3 can be achieved when individual molecules having dimensions below a nanometer or so are used to encode the 0's and 1's of a binary string of data. In practice, however, given the limitations of electron-beam lithography, thin film deposition and patterning technologies, molecular manipulation in submicron dimensions, etc., we believe that volumetric storage densities on the order of 10^16 bits/cm^3 (i.e., petabytes per cubic centimeter) should be readily attainable, leaving plenty of room for future growth. The unique feature of the proposed new approach is its focus on the feasibility of storing bits of information in individual molecules, each only a few angstroms in size.
