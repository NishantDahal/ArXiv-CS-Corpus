When is an automatic set an additive basis?

We characterize those $k$-automatic sets $S$ of natural numbers that form an additive basis for the natural numbers, and we show that this characterization is effective. In addition, we give an algorithm to determine the smallest $j$ such that $S$ forms an additive basis of order $j$, if it exists.
