A Testbed for Experimenting Internet of Things Applications

The idea of IoT world has grown to multiple dimensions enclosing different technologies and standards which can provide solutions and goal oriented intelligence to the widespread things via network or internet. In spite of different advancement in technology, challenges related to assessment of IoT solutions under real scenarios and empirical deployments still hinder their evolvement and significant expansion. To design a system that can adequately bolster substantial range of applications and be compliant with superfluity of divergent requirements and also integrating heterogeneous technologies is a difficult task. Thus, simulations and testing to design robust applications becomes paramount elements of a development process. For this, there rises a need of a tool or a methodology to test and manage the applications. This paper presents a novel approach by proposing a testbed for experimenting Internet of Things (IoT) applications. An idea of an open source test bed helps in developing an exploited and sustainable smart system. In order to validate the idea of such testbed we have also implemented two use cases.
