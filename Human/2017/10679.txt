PSK Precoding in Multi-User MISO Systems

We consider the downlink scenario of multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems with constant envelope (CE) signals emitted from each antenna. This results in energy efficient power amplifiers (PAs). We propose a holistic CE precoding scheme based on the symbol-wise minimum squared error (SMSE) criterion. Additionally, we analyze the distortions introduced by low-resolution quantization to PSK for higher energy efficiency reasons. We present three solution algorithms and examine their performance to decide for the best pick for different quantization resolutions. Our results show that good performance can be achieved with minimal loss compared to an ideal unquantized case. Finally, we analyze and discuss the results and consider the overall complexity of the precoder as well as implementation issues.
