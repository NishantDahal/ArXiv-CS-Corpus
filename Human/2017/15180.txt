Learning a 3D descriptor for cross-source point cloud registration from synthetic data

As the development of 3D sensors, registration of 3D data (e.g. point cloud) coming from different kind of sensor is dispensable and shows great demanding. However, point cloud registration between different sensors is challenging because of the variant of density, missing data, different viewpoint, noise and outliers, and geometric transformation. In this paper, we propose a method to learn a 3D descriptor for finding the correspondent relations between these challenging point clouds. To train the deep learning framework, we use synthetic 3D point cloud as input. Starting from synthetic dataset, we use region-based sampling method to select reasonable, large and diverse training samples from synthetic samples. Then, we use data augmentation to extend our network be robust to rotation transformation. We focus our work on more general cases that point clouds coming from different sensors, named cross-source point cloud. The experiments show that our descriptor is not only able to generalize to new scenes, but also generalize to different sensors. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully aligns two 3D cross-source point clouds which outperforms state-of-the-art method.
