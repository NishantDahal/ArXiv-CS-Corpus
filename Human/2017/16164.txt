Measuring Inconsistency in Argument Graphs

There have been a number of developments in measuring inconsistency in logic-based representations of knowledge. In contrast, the development of inconsistency measures for computational models of argument has been limited. To address this shortcoming, this paper provides a general framework for measuring inconsistency in abstract argumentation, together with some proposals for specific measures, and a consideration of measuring inconsistency in logic-based instantiations of argument graphs, including a review of some existing proposals and a consideration of how existing logic-based measures of inconsistency can be applied.
