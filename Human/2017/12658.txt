Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications

Ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is expected to be supported without compromising the resource usage efficiency. In this paper, we study how to maximize energy efficiency (EE) for URLLC under the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirement imposed on the end-to-end (E2E) delay and overall packet loss, where the E2E delay includes queueing delay and transmission delay, and the overall packet loss consists of queueing delay violation, transmission error with finite blocklength channel codes, and proactive packet dropping in deep fading. Transmit power, bandwidth and number of active antennas are jointly optimized to maximize the system EE under the QoS constraints. Since the achievable rate with finite blocklength channel codes is not convex in radio resources, it is challenging to optimize resource allocation. By analyzing the properties of the optimization problem, the global optimal solution is obtained. Simulation and numerical results validate the analysis and show that the proposed policy can improve EE significantly compared with existing policy.
