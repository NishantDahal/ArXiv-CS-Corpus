The GangaWatch Mobile App to Enable Usage of Water Data in Every Day Decisions Integrating Historical and Real-time Sensing Data

We demonstrate a novel mobile application called GangaWatch that makes water pollution data usable and accessible focusing on one of the most polluted river basins in the world. It is intended to engage common public who want to see water condition and safe limits, and their relevance based on different purposes. The data is a combination of old data determined from lab tests on physical samples and new data from real time sensors collected from Ganga basin. The platform is open for contribution from others, the data is also available for reuse via public APIs, and it has already been used to derive new insights.
