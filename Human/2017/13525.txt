A secure approach for embedding message text on an elliptic curve defined over prime fields, and building 'EC-RSA-ELGamal' Cryptographic System

This paper presents a new probabilistic approach to embedding message text on an elliptic curve, by using the concept of the RSA Algorithm and its security, and such approach allows us discovering the message from the point, only according to the security of the RSA Algorithm. By mixing between the concept of this approach and the concept of EC-ELGamal Cryptographic System, we have built a cryptographic System and we named it 'EC-RSA-ELGamal'
