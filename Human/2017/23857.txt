Consensus of second order multi-agents with actuator saturation and asynchronous time-delays

This article presents the consensus of a saturated second order multi-agent system with non-switching dynamics that can be represented by a directed graph. The system is affected by data processing (input delay) and communication time-delays that are assumed to be asynchronous. The agents have saturation nonlinearities, each of them is approximated into separate linear and nonlinear elements. Nonlinear elements are represented by describing functions. Describing functions and stability of linear elements are used to estimate the existence of limit cycles in the system with multiple control laws. Stability analysis of the linear element is performed using Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions and frequency domain analysis. A comparison of pros and cons of both the analyses with respect to time-delay ranges, applicability and computation complexity is presented. Simulation and corresponding hardware implementation results are demonstrated to support theoretical results.
