Proceedings Fifth International Workshop on Verification and Program Transformation

This volume contains the proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Verification and Program Transformation (VPT 2017). The workshop took place in Uppsala, Sweden, on April 29th, 2017, affiliated with the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS). The aim of the VPT workshop series is to provide a forum where people from the areas of program transformation and program verification can fruitfully exchange ideas and gain a deeper understanding of the interactions between those two fields. Seven papers were presented at the workshop. Additionally, three invited talks were given by Javier Esparza (Technische  Universität München, Germany), Manuel Hermenegildo (IMDEA Software Institute, Madrid, Spain), and Alexey Khoroshilov (Linux Verification Center, ISPRAS, Moscow, Russia).
