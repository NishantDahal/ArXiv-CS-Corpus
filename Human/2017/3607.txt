Frequency Switching for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer

A new frequency switching receiver structure is proposed for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in multi-carrier communication systems. Each subcarrier is switched to either the energy harvesting unit or the information decoding unit, according to the optimal subcarrier allocation. To implement the system, one-bit feedback is required for each subcarrier. Two optimization problems are defined, converted to binary knapsack problems, and solved using dynamic programming approaches. Upper bounds are obtained using continuous relaxations. Power allocation is integrated to further increase the performance. Numerical studies show that the proposed frequency switching based model is better than existing models in a wide range of parameters.
