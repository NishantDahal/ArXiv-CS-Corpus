Modeling temporal constraints for a system of interactive scores

In this chapter we explain briefly the fundamentals of the interactive scores formalism. Then we develop a solution for implementing the ECO machine by mixing petri nets and constraints propagation. We also present another solution for implementing the ECO machine using concurrent constraint programming. Finally, we present an extension of interactive score with conditional branching.
