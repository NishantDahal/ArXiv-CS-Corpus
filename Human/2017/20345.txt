Comparative Analysis of Software Development Methods between Parallel, V-Shaped and Iterative

Any organization that will develop software is faced with a difficult choice of choosing the right software development method. Whereas the software development methods used, play a significant role in the overall software development process. Software development methods are needed so that the software development process can be systematic so that it is not only completed within the right time frame but also must have good quality. There are various methods of software development in System Development Lyfe Cycle (SDLC). Each SDLC method provides a general guiding line about different software development and has different characteristics. Each method of software development has its drawbacks and advantages so that the selection of software development methods should be compatible with the capacity of the software developed. This paper will compare three different software development methods: V-Shaped Model, Parallel Development Model, and Iterative Model with the aim of providing an understanding of software developers to choose the right method.
