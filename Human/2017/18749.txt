A Geometric Approach to Harmonic Color Palette Design

We address the problem of finding harmonic colors, this problem has many applications, from fashion to industrial design. In order to solve this problem we consider that colors follow normal distributions in tone (chroma and lightness) and hue. The proposed approach relies in the CIE standard for representing colors and evaluate proximity. Other approaches to this problem use a set of rules. Experimental results show that lines with specific parameters angles of inclination, and distance from the reference point are preferred over others, and that uncertain line patterns outperform non-linear patterns.
