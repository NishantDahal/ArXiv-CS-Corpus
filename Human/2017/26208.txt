Inference of Personal Attributes from Tweets Using Machine Learning

Using machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, we studied the prediction of personal attributes from the text of tweets, such as gender, occupation, and age groups. We applied word2vec to construct word vectors, which were then used to vectorize tweet blocks. The resulting tweet vectors were used as inputs for training models, and the prediction accuracy of those models was examined as a function of the dimension of the tweet vectors and the size of the tweet blacks. The results showed that the machine learning algorithms could predict the three personal attributes of interest with 60-70% accuracy.
