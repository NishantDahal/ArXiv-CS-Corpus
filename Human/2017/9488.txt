Exploiting OxRAM Resistive Switching for Dynamic Range Improvement of CMOS Image Sensors

We present a unique application of OxRAM devices in CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) for dynamic range (DR) improvement. We propose a modified 3T-APS (Active Pixel Sensor) circuit that incorporates OxRAM in 1T-1R configuration. DR improvement is achieved by resistive compression of the pixel output signal through autonomous programming of OxRAM device resistance during exposure. We show that by carefully preconditioning the OxRAM resistance, pixel DR can be enhanced. Detailed impact of OxRAM SET-to-RESET and RESET-to-SET transitions on pixel DR is discussed. For experimental validation with specific OxRAM preprogrammed states, a 4 Kb 10 nm thick HfOx (1T-1R) matrix was fabricated and characterized. Best case, relative pixel DR improvement of ~ 50 dB was obtained for our design.
