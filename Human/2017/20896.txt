Countries' Survival in Networked International Environments

This paper applies a recently developed power allocation game in Li and Morse (2017) to study the countries' survival problem in networked international environments. In the game, countries strategically allocate their power to support the survival of themselves and their friends and to oppose that of their foes, where by a country's survival is meant when the country's total support equals or exceeds its total threats. This paper establishes conditions that characterize different types of networked international environments in which a country may survive, such as when all the antagonism among countries makes up a complete or bipartite graph.
