Including Dialects and Language Varieties in Author Profiling

This paper presents a computational approach to author profiling taking gender and language variety into account. We apply an ensemble system with the output of multiple linear SVM classifiers trained on character and word $n$-grams. We evaluate the system using the dataset provided by the organizers of the 2017 PAN lab on author profiling. Our approach achieved 75% average accuracy on gender identification on tweets written in four languages and 97% accuracy on language variety identification for Portuguese.
