Direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication with Infrastructure Assistance in 5G Network

Compared with today's 4G wireless communication network, the next generation of wireless system should be able to provide a wider range of services with different QoS requirements. One emerging new service is to exploit cooperative driving to actively avoid accidents and improve traffic efficiency. A key challenge for cooperative driving is on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication which requires a high reliability and a low end-to-end (E2E) latency. In order to meet these requirements, 5G should be evaluated by new key performance indicators (KPIs) rather than the conventional metric, as throughput in the legacy cellular networks. In this work, we exploit network controlled direct V2V communication for information exchange among vehicles. This communication process refers to packet transmission directly among vehicles without the involvement of network infrastructure in U-plane. In order to have a network architecture to enable direct V2V communication, the architecture of the 4G network is enhanced by deploying a new central entity with specific functionality for V2V communication. Moreover, a resource allocation scheme is also specifically designed to adapt to traffic model and service requirements of V2V communication. Last but not least, different technologies are considered and simulated in this work to improve the performance of direct V2V communication.
