A Low Complexity OFDM Receiver with Combined GAMP and MF Message Passing

With a unified belief propagation (BP) and mean field (MF) framework, we propose an iterative message passing receiver, which performs joint channel state and noise precision (the reciprocal of noise variance) estimation and decoding for OFDM systems. The recently developed generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) is incorporated to the BP-MF framework, where MF is used to handle observation factor nodes with unknown noise precision and GAMP is used for channel estimation in the time-frequency domain. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature, the proposed algorithm either delivers similar performance with much lower complexity, or delivers much better performance with similar complexity. In addition, the proposed algorithm exhibits fastest convergence.
