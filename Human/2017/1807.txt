SDN Based QoS Provision in WSN Technologies

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have rapidly progressed over the years, they are now applied in health care systems, home automation, security surveillance, disaster management and more. With this rapid growth in the number of users and applications leading to WSNs becoming increasingly complex, this growth makes high demands on WSNs to provide the requirements of every user and application that uses them. They have recently been envisioned to be integrated into Internet of Things (IoT), their role will be to provide sensing services to the ever increasing community of internet users. However even with so much potential, WSNs still experience issues in node deployment, fault tolerance, scalability and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning amongst others. In this paper we propose to improve QoS provisioning by introducing Software Defined principles into WSN technologies.
