Open Badges: A Low-Cost Toolkit for Measuring Team Communication and Dynamics

We present Open Badges, an open-source framework an toolkit for measuring and shaping face-to-face social interactions using either custom hardware devices or smart phones, and real-time web-based visualizations. Open Badges is a modular system that allows researchers to monitor and collect interaction data from people engaged in real-life social settings. In this paper we describe the technical aspects of the Open Badges project and the motivation for its creation.
