Optimal Dynamic Routing for the Wireless Relay Channel

Consider a communication network with a source, a relay and a destination. Each time interval, the source may dynamically choose between a few possible coding schemes, based on the channel state, traffic pattern and its own queue status. For example, the source may choose between a direct route to the destination and a relay-assisted scheme. Clearly, due to the difference in the performance achieved, as well as the resources each scheme uses, a sender might wish to choose the most appropriate one based on its status.
  In this work, we formulate the problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process. This formulation allows us to find an optimal policy, expressed as a function of the number of packets in the source queue and other parameters. In particular, we show a general solution which covers various configurations, including different packet size distributions and varying channels. Furthermore, for the case of exponential transmission times, we analytically prove the optimal policy has a threshold structure, that is, there is a unique value of a single parameter which determines which scheme (or route) is optimal. Results are also validated with simulations for several interesting models.
