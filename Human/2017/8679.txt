Some Schemes for Implementation of Arithmetic Operations with Complex Numbers Using Squaring Units

In this paper, new schemes for a squarer, multiplier and divider of complex numbers are proposed. Traditional structural solutions for each of these operations require the presence some number of general-purpose binary multipliers. The advantage of our solutions is a removing of multiplications through replacing them by less costly squarers. We use Logan's trick and quarter square technique, which propose to replace the calculation of the product of two real numbers by summing the squares. Replacing usual multipliers on digital squares implies reducing power consumption as well as decreases hardware circuit complexity. The squarer requiring less area and power as compared to general-purpose multiplier, it is interesting to assess the use of squarers to implementation of complex arithmetic.
