Secure SWIPT Networks Based on a Non-linear Energy Harvesting Model

We optimize resource allocation to enable communication security in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for internet-of-things (IoT) networks. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. We aim at maximizing the total harvested power at energy harvesting (EH) receivers via the joint optimization of transmit beamforming vectors and the covariance matrix of the artificial noise injected to facilitate secrecy provisioning. The proposed problem formulation takes into account the non-linearity of energy harvesting circuits and the quality of service requirements for secure communication.
  To obtain a globally optimal solution of the resource allocation problem, we first transform the resulting non-convex sum-of-ratios objective function into an equivalent objective function in parametric subtractive form, which facilitates the design of a novel iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is adopted to solve a rank-constrained optimization problem optimally. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can guarantee communication security and provide a significant performance gain in terms of the harvested energy compared to existing designs which are based on the traditional linear EH model.
