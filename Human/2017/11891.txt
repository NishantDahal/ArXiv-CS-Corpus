Position-sensitive propagation of information on social media using social physics approach

The excitement and convergence of tweets on specific topics are well studied. However, by utilizing the position information of Tweet, it is also possible to analyze the position-sensitive tweet. In this research, we focus on bomb terrorist attacks and propose a method for separately analyzing the number of tweets at the place where the incident occurred, nearby, and far. We made measurements of position-sensitive tweets and suggested a theory to explain it. This theory is an extension of the mathematical model of the hit phenomenon.
