Finite State Markov Wiretap Channel with Delayed Feedback

The finite state Markov channel (FSMC), where the channel transition probability is controlled by a state undergoing a Markov process, is a useful model for the mobile wireless communication channel. In this paper, we investigate the security issue in the mobile wireless communication systems by considering the FSMC with an eavesdropper, which we call the finite state Markov wiretap channel (FSM-WC). We assume that the state is perfectly known by the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, and through a noiseless feedback channel, the legitimate receiver sends his received channel output and the state back to the transmitter after some time delay. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation regions of the FSM-WC with delayed state feedback and with or without delayed channel output feedback are provided in this paper, and we show that these bounds meet if the eavesdropper's received symbol is a degraded version of the legitimate receiver's. The above results are further explained via degraded Gaussian and Gaussian fading examples.
