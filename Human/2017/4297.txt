Charging Wireless Sensor Networks with Mobile Charger and Infrastructure Pivot Cluster Heads

Wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) consisting of sensor nodes with batteries have been at the forefront of sensing and communication technologies in the last few years. Sensor networks with different missions are being massively rolled out, particularly in the internet-of-things commercial market. To ensure sustainable operation of WRSNs, charging in a timely fashion is very important, since lack of energy of even a single sensor node could result in serious outcomes. With the large number of WRSNs existing and to be existed, energy-efficient charging schemes are becoming indispensable to workplaces that demand a proper level of operating cost. Selection of charging scheme depends on network parameters such as the distribution pattern of sensor nodes, the mobility of the charger, and the availability of the directional antenna. Among current charging techniques, radio frequency (RF) remote charging with a small transmit antenna is gaining interest when non-contact type charging is required for sensor nodes. RF charging is particularly useful when sensor nodes are distributed in the service area. To obtain higher charging efficiency with RF charging, optimal path planning for mobile chargers, and the beamforming technique, implemented by making use of a directional antenna, can be considered. In this article, we present a review of RF charging for WRSNs from the perspectives of charging by mobile charger, harvesting using sensor nodes, and energy trading between sensor nodes. The concept of a pivot cluster head is introduced and a novel RF charging scheme in two stages, consisting of charging pivot cluster heads by a mobile charger with a directional antenna and charging member sensor nodes by pivot cluster heads with directional antennae, is presented.
