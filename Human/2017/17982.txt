On Graphs and the Gotsman-Linial Conjecture for d = 2

We give an infinite class of counterexamples to the Gotsman-Linial conjecture when d = 2. On the other hand, we establish an asymptotic form of the conjecture for quadratic threshold functions whose non-zero quadratic terms define a graph with either low fractional chromatic number or few edges. Our techniques are elementary and our exposition is self-contained, if you're into that.
