Automatic verification and interactive theorem proving

Automatic verification deals with the validation by means of computers of correctness certificates. The related tools, usually called proof assistants or interactive provers, provide an interactive environment for the creation of formal certificates whose correctness can be assessed in a purely automatic way. Such systems have applications both in mathematics, where certificates are proofs of theorems, and in computer science, where certificates testify the correctness of a given software with respect to its specification.
