Design Considerations for a 5G Network Architecture

The data rates of up to 10 GB/s will characterize 5G networks telecommunications standards that are envisioned to replace the current 4G/IMT standards. The number of network-connected devices is expected to be 7 trillion by the end of this year and the traffic is expected to rise by an order of magnitude in the next 8 years. It is expected that elements of 5G will be rolled out by early 2020s to meet business and consumer demands as well as requirements of the Internet of Things. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced in September 2016 that the government-led 5G Phase-1 tests of key wireless technologies for future 5G networks were completed with satisfactory results. This paper presents an overview of the challenges facing 5G before it can be implemented to meet expected requirements of capacity, data rates, reduced latency, connectivity to massive number of devices, reduced cost and energy, and appropriate quality of experience.
