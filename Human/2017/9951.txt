A Tractable Framework for Performance Analysis of Dense Multi-Antenna Networks

Densifying the network and deploying more antennas at each access point are two principal ways to boost the capacity of wireless networks. However, due to the complicated distributions of random signal and interference channel gains, largely induced by various space-time processing techniques, it is highly challenging to quantitatively characterize the performance of dense multi-antenna networks. In this paper, using tools from stochastic geometry, a tractable framework is proposed for the analytical evaluation of such networks. The major result is an innovative representation of the coverage probability, as an induced $\ell_1$-norm of a Toeplitz matrix. This compact representation incorporates lots of existing analytical results on single- and multi-antenna networks as special cases, and its evaluation is almost as simple as the single-antenna case with Rayleigh fading. To illustrate its effectiveness, we apply the proposed framework to investigate two kinds of prevalent dense wireless networks, i.e., physical layer security aware networks and millimeter-wave networks. In both examples, in addition to tractable analytical results of relevant performance metrics, insightful design guidelines are also analytically obtained.
