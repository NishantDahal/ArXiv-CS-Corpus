Robust Sparse Coding via Self-Paced Learning

Sparse coding (SC) is attracting more and more attention due to its comprehensive theoretical studies and its excellent performance in many signal processing applications. However, most existing sparse coding algorithms are nonconvex and are thus prone to becoming stuck into bad local minima, especially when there are outliers and noisy data. To enhance the learning robustness, in this paper, we propose a unified framework named Self-Paced Sparse Coding (SPSC), which gradually include matrix elements into SC learning from easy to complex. We also generalize the self-paced learning schema into different levels of dynamic selection on samples, features and elements respectively. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms.
