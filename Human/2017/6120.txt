Joint Hybrid Precoder and Combiner Design for mmWave Spatial Multiplexing Transmission

Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have been considered as a key technology for future 5G wireless networks because of the orders-of-magnitude wider bandwidth than current cellular bands. In this paper, we consider the problem of codebook-based joint analog-digital hybrid precoder and combiner design for spatial multiplexing transmission in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We propose to jointly select analog precoder and combiner pair for each data stream successively aiming at maximizing the channel gain while suppressing the interference between different data streams. After all analog precoder/combiner pairs have been determined, we can obtain the effective baseband channel. Then, the digital precoder and combiner are computed based on the obtained effective baseband channel to further mitigate the interference and maximize the sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm exhibits prominent advantages in combating interference between different data streams and offer satisfactory performance improvement compared to the existing codebook-based hybrid beamforming schemes.
