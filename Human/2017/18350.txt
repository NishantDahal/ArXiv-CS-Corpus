Pisano period codes

The cyclic codes with parity check polynomial the reciprocal of the characteristic polynomial of the Fibonacci recurrence over a prime finite field are shown to have either one weight or two weights. When these codes are irreducible cyclic we obtain many counterexamples to the conjectural classification of two-weight irreducible cyclic codes of Schmidt and White (2002). When they are reducible and projective their duals are uniformly packed.
