Treatment of Unicode canoncal decomposition among operating systems

This article shows how the text characters that have multiple representations under the Unicode standard are treated by popular operating systems. Whilst most characters have a unique representation in Unicode, some characters such as the accented European letters, can have multiple representations due to a feature of Unicode called normalization. These characters are treated differently by popular operating systems, leading to additional challenges during interoperability of computer programs.
