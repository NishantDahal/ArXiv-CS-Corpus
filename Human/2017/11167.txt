Characterizing Lifting and Lowering Activities with Insole FSR sensors in Industrial Exoskeletons

This paper presents an insole FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) to dynamically detect weight variations in an exoskeleton system. The proposed methodology is intended for tasks of lifting and lowering heavy weights with an industrial exoskeleton to substantially reduce spinal loads during these manual handling activities. Instead of extensively placing high-dense force sensors by covering the whole plantar area, as most of commercial applications do, we integrate only a few force sensors in specific plantar area, so that the sensory system is not restricted to an individual foot size and shape, and on the other hand has relatively lower material cost. Industrial exoskeletons are intended to assist workers when handling heavy goods. With this in mind, wearers are not able to use their hands to control the exoskeleton since they use them to handle the goods. Therefore, the exoskeleton controller is required to indirectly infer how much and when the wearer requires assistance for lifting or lowering a heavy weight. Our approach of dynamically detect and characterize the increment/decrement of weight, as well as the rising/falling edge, enables the exoskeleton's controller to trigger the request of assistive force to the actuators.
