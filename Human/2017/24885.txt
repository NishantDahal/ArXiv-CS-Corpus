Source-side Prediction for Neural Headline Generation

The encoder-decoder model is widely used in natural language generation tasks. However, the model sometimes suffers from repeated redundant generation, misses important phrases, and includes irrelevant entities. Toward solving these problems we propose a novel source-side token prediction module. Our method jointly estimates the probability distributions over source and target vocabularies to capture a correspondence between source and target tokens. The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in the headline generation task. Additionally, we show that our method has an ability to learn a reasonable token-wise correspondence without knowing any true alignments.
