Multivariable codes in principal ideal polynomial quotient rings with applications to additive modular bivariate codes over $\mathbb{F}_4$

In this work, we study the structure of multivariable modular codes over finite chain rings when the ambient space is a principal ideal ring. We also provide some applications to additive modular codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_4$.
