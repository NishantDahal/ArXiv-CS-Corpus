A 3D Human Body Blockage Model for Outdoor Millimeter-Wave Cellular Communication

Blocking is one of the most important challenges in exploiting millimeter-wave for fifth-generation (5G) cellular communication systems. Compared to blockages caused by buildings or terrains, human body blockage exhibits a higher complexity due to the mobility and dynamic statistics of humans. To support development of outdoor millimeter-wave cellular systems, in this paper we present a novel 3D physical model of human body blockage. Based on the proposed model, the impact of human body blockage on frame-based data transmission is discussed, with respect to the system specifications and environment conditions.
