The Width and Integer Optimization on Simplices With Bounded Minors of the Constraint Matrices

In this paper, we will show that the width of simplices defined by systems of linear inequalities can be computed in polynomial time if some minors of their constraint matrices are bounded. Additionally, we present some quasi-polynomial-time and polynomial-time algorithms to solve the integer linear optimization problem defined on simplices minus all their integer vertices assuming that some minors of the constraint matrices of the simplices are bounded.
