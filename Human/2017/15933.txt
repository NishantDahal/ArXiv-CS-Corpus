Cyber-Physical Interference Modeling for Predictable Reliability of Inter-Vehicle Communications

Predictable inter-vehicle communication reliability is a basis for the paradigm shift from the traditional singlevehicle-oriented safety and efficiency control to networked vehicle control. The lack of predictable interference control in existing mechanisms of inter-vehicle communications, however, makes them incapable of ensuring predictable communication reliability. For predictable interference control, we propose the Cyber-Physical Scheduling (CPS) framework that leverages the PRK interference model and addresses the challenges of vehicle mobility to PRK-based scheduling. In particular, CPS leverage physical locations of vehicles to define the gPRK interference model, a geometric approximation of the PRK model, for effective interference relation estimation, and CPS leverages cyber-physical structures of vehicle traffic flows (particularly, spatiotemporal interference correlation as well as macro- and micro-scopic vehicle dynamics) for effective use of the gPRK model. Through experimental analysis with high-fidelity ns-3 and SUMO simulation, we observe that CPS enables predictable reliability while achieving high throughput and low delay in communication. To the best of our knowledge, CPS is the first field deployable method that ensures predictable interference control and thus reliability in inter-vehicle communications.
