Adaptive Blind Sparse-Channel Equalization

In this article, a fractional-norm constrained blind adaptive algorithm is presented for sparse channel equalization. In essence, the algorithm improves on the minimization of the constant modulus (CM) criteria by adding a sparsity inducing \(\ell_p\)-norm penalty. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed regularized equalizer exploits the inherent channel sparsity effectively and exhibits faster convergence compared to its counterparts.
