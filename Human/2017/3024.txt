Approximate Capacity of a Class of Partially Connected Interference Channels

We derive inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for a class of three-user partially connected interference channels. We focus on the impact of topology, interference alignment, and interplay between interference and noise. The representative channels we consider are the ones that have clear interference alignment gain. For these channels, Z-channel type outer bounds are tight to within a constant gap from capacity. We present near-optimal achievable schemes based on rate-splitting and lattice alignment.
