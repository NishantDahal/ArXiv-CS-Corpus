Neyman-Pearson Test for Zero-Rate Multiterminal Hypothesis Testing

The problem of zero-rate multiterminal hypothesis testing is revisited from the perspective of information-spectrum approach and finite blocklength analysis. A Neyman-Pearson-like test is proposed and its non-asymptotic performance is clarified; for a short block length, it is numerically determined that the proposed test is superior to the previously reported Hoeffding-like test proposed by Han-Kobayashi. For a large deviation regime, it is shown that our proposed test achieves an optimal trade-off between the type I and type II exponents presented by Han-Kobayashi. Among the class of symmetric (type based) testing schemes, when the type I error probability is non-vanishing, the proposed test is optimal up to the second-order term of the type II error exponent; the latter term is characterized in terms of the variance of the projected relative entropy density. The information geometry method plays an important role in the analysis as well as the construction of the test.
