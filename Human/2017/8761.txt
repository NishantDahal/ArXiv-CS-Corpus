Beam Design and User Scheduling for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access with Multiple Antennas Based on Pareto-Optimality

In this paper, an efficient transmit beam design and user scheduling method is proposed for multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink, based on Pareto-optimality. The proposed beam design and user scheduling method groups simultaneously-served users into multiple clusters with practical two users in each cluster, and then applies spatical zeroforcing (ZF) across clusters to control inter-cluster interference (ICI) and Pareto-optimal beam design with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to two users in each cluster to remove interference to strong users and leverage signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) of interference-experiencing weak users. The proposed method has flexibility to control the rates of strong and weak users and numerical results show that the proposed method yields good performance.
