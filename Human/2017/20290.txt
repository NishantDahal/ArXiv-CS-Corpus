Quasi-random Agents for Image Transition and Animation

Quasi-random walks show similar features as standard random walks, but with much less randomness. We utilize this established model from discrete mathematics and show how agents carrying out quasi-random walks can be used for image transition and animation. The key idea is to generalize the notion of quasi-random walks and let a set of autonomous agents perform quasi-random walks painting an image. Each agent has one particular target image that they paint when following a sequence of directions for their quasi-random walk. The sequence can easily be chosen by an artist and allows them to produce a wide range of different transition patterns and animations.
