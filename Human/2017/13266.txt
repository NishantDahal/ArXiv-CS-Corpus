Study of Buffer-aided physical-layer network coding with ML and MMSE linear code designs for cooperative DS-CDMA systems

In this work, we propose buffer-aided physical-layer network coding (PLNC) techniques for cooperative direct-sequence code-division multiple access systems. In the proposed buffer-aided PLNC schemes, a relay pair selection algorithm is employed to obtain the relay pair and the packets in the buffer entries with the best performance and the associated link combinations used for data transmission. We also devise PLNC schemes based on the design of linear network coding matrices using maximum likelihood and minimum mean-square error criteria to generate the network coded symbols that are sent to the destination. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform prior art.
