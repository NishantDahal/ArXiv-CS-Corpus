Good and asymptotically good quantum codes derived from algebraic geometry codes

In this paper we construct several new families of quantum codes with good and asymptotically good parameters. These new quantum codes are derived from (classical) algebraic geometry (AG) codes by applying the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. Many of these codes have large minimum distances when compared with its code length and they have relatively small Singleton defect. For example, we construct a family [[46; 2(t_2 - t1); d]]_25 of quantum codes, where t_1, t_2 are positive integers such that 1 < t_1 < t_2 < 23 and d >= min {46 - 2t_2, 2t_1-2}, of length n = 46, with minimum distance in the range 2 =< d =< 20, having Singleton defect four. Additionally, by utilizing t-point AG codes, with t >= 2, we show how to obtain sequences of asymptotically good quantum codes.
