Securing Visible Light Communication Systems by Beamforming in the Presence of Randomly Distributed Eavesdroppers

This paper considers secrecy enhancement mechanisms in visible light communication (VLC) systems with spatially distributed passive eavesdroppers (EDs) under the assumption that there are multiple LED transmitters and one legitimate receiver (UE). Based on certain amplitude constraints, we propose an optimal beamforming scheme to optimize secrecy performance. Contrary to the case where null-steering is made possible by using knowledge of the ED locations, we show that the optimal solution when only statistical information about ED locations is available directs the transmission along a particular eigenmode related to the intensity of the ED process and the intended channel. Then, a sub-optimal LED selection scheme is provided to reduce the secrecy outage probability (SOP). An approximate closed-form for the SOP is derived by using secrecy capacity bounds. All analysis is numerically verified by Monte Carlo simulations. The analysis shows that the optimal beamformer yields superior performance to LED selection. However, LED selection is still a highly efficient suboptimal scheme due to the complexity associated with the use of multiple transmitters in the full beamforming approach. These performance trends and exact relations between system parameters can be used to develop a secure VLC system in the presence of randomly distributed EDs.
