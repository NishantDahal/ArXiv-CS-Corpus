Chaos Engineering

Modern software-based services are implemented as distributed systems with complex behavior and failure modes. Many large tech organizations are using experimentation to verify the reliability of such systems. We use the term "Chaos Engineering" to refer to this approach, and discuss the underlying principles and how to use it to run experiments.
