An Online Development Environment for Answer Set Programming

Recent progress in logic programming (e.g., the development of the Answer Set Programming paradigm) has made it possible to teach it to general undergraduate and even high school students. Given the limited exposure of these students to computer science, the complexity of downloading, installing and using tools for writing logic programs could be a major barrier for logic programming to reach a much wider audience. We developed an online answer set programming environment with a self contained file system and a simple interface, allowing users to write logic programs and perform several tasks over the programs.
