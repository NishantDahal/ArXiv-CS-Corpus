Generalized I-MMSE for K-User Gaussian Channels

In this paper, we generalize the fundamental relation between the mutual information and the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) by Guo, Shamai, and Verdu [1] to K-User Gaussian channels. We prove that the derivative of the multiuser mutual information with respect to the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is equal to the total MMSE plus a covariance term with respect to the cross correlation of the multiuser input estimates, the channels and the precoding matrices. We shed light that such relation is a generalized I-MMSE with one step lookahead and lookback, applied to the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) in the decoding process.
