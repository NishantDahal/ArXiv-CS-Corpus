Weighted Sum-Throughput Maximization for Energy Harvesting Powered MIMO Multi-Access Channels

This paper develops a novel approach to obtaining the optimal scheduling strategy in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multi-access channel (MAC), where each transmitter is powered by an individual energy harvesting process. Relying on the state-of-the-art convex optimization tools, the proposed approach provides a low-complexity block coordinate ascent algorithm to obtain the optimal transmission policy that maximizes the weighted sum-throughput for MIMO MAC. The proposed approach can provide the optimal benchmarks for all practical schemes in energy-harvesting powered MIMO MAC transmissions. Based on the revealed structure of the optimal policy, we also propose an efficient online scheme, which requires only causal knowledge of energy arrival realizations. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed novel scheme.
