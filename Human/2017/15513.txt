Further results on discrete unitary invariance

In arXiv:1607.06679, Marcus proved that certain functions of multiple matrices, when summed over the symmetries of the cube, decompose into functions of the original matrices. In this note, we generalize the results from the Marcus paper to a larger class of functions of multiple matrices. We also answer a problem posed in the Marcus paper.
