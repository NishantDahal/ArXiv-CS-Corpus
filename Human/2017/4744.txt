"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn": changing the approach of teaching Computer Organization

Millennials are arriving to university sometimes uncomfortable with the methods of some courses. Ideas that worked with previous generations of students begin to fail when digital natives receive paper and pencil as tools. Courses must update from old paper-based methods to hands-on and computerized versions. The present work discusses about this update and comments on one implementation in the course Computer Organization of the Computer Science curriculum at Universidad de Buenos Aires. It also includes some metrics that show the effectiveness of the changes in attracting and engaging the digital generation.
