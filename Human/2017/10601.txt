Logic Programming for an Introductory Computer Science Course for High School Students

This paper investigates how high school students approach computing through an introductory computer science course situated in the Logic Programming (LP) paradigm. This study shows how novice students operate within the LP paradigm while engaging in foundational computing concepts and skills, and presents a case for LP as a viable paradigm choice for introductory CS courses.
