A Randomized Construction of Polar Subcodes

A method for construction of polar subcodes is presented, which aims on minimization of the number of low-weight codewords in the obtained codes, as well as on improved performance under list or sequential decoding. Simulation results are provided, which show that the obtained codes outperform LDPC and turbo codes.
