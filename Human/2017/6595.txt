Designing a Web-based interactive audio library automation system for visually-impaired people and evaluation of its usability

The aim of this study is to introduce an application that enables information sharing and communication between visually-impaired individuals and able-bodied. For the purposes of the study, web-based audio library automation was designed and the usability of the system was analyzed regarding the volunteers who record audio books and the visually-impaired individuals. The visually-impaired individuals who took part in the test procedures in order to make a general evaluation of the system reported that the system was theoretically necessary and successful. As for the usability aspect, positive comments were received regarding the automation system developed. The authors believe that the current study is likely to be an alternative reference source for the related literature and further research studies to be conducted in the field.
