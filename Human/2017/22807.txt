Empirical model for combinatorial data center network switch design

Data centers require high-performance network equipment that consume low power and support high bandwidth requirements. In this context, a combinatorial approach was proposed to design data center network (DCN) equipment from a library of components in \cite{infocom}. This library includes power splitter, wavelength multiplexers, reconfigurable add-drop multiplexers and optical amplifiers. When interconnecting optical components, it must be ensured that the resultant network supports specified target bit-error-rates (typically, at most $10^{-12}$). This paper reports experiment conducted on component interconnections and their computed bit-error-rates. From the experimental analysis, it was observed that the desired objective can be decided by considering a zeroth-order threshold for optical power at the receiver and before the amplifier. This paves way for the theoretical evaluation of several other such designs using this empirically derived model.
