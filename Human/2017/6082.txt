Face Identification and Clustering

In this thesis, we study two problems based on clustering algorithms. In the first problem, we study the role of visual attributes using an agglomerative clustering algorithm to whittle down the search area where the number of classes is high to improve the performance of clustering. We observe that as we add more attributes, the clustering performance increases overall. In the second problem, we study the role of clustering in aggregating templates in a 1:N open set protocol using multi-shot video as a probe. We observe that by increasing the number of clusters, the performance increases with respect to the baseline and reaches a peak, after which increasing the number of clusters causes the performance to degrade. Experiments are conducted using recently introduced unconstrained IARPA Janus IJB-A, CS2, and CS3 face recognition datasets.
