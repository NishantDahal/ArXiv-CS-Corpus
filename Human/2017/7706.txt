Almost-Polynomial Ratio ETH-Hardness of Approximating Densest $k$-Subgraph

In the Densest $k$-Subgraph problem, given an undirected graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the goal is to find a subgraph of $G$ on $k$ vertices that contains maximum number of edges. Even though the state-of-the-art algorithm for the problem achieves only $O(n^{1/4 + \varepsilon})$ approximation ratio (Bhaskara et al., 2010), previous attempts at proving hardness of approximation, including those under average case assumptions, fail to achieve a polynomial ratio; the best ratios ruled out under any worst case assumption and any average case assumption are only any constant (Raghavendra and Steurer, 2010) and $2^{Î©(\log^{2/3} n)}$ (Alon et al., 2011) respectively.
  In this work, we show, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that approximates Densest $k$-Subgraph to within $n^{1/(\log \log n)^c}$ factor of the optimum, where $c > 0$ is a universal constant independent of $n$. In addition, our result has "perfect completeness", meaning that we prove that it is ETH-hard to even distinguish between the case in which $G$ contains a $k$-clique and the case in which every induced $k$-subgraph of $G$ has density at most $1/n^{-1/(\log \log n)^c}$ in polynomial time.
  Moreover, if we make a stronger assumption that there is some constant $\varepsilon > 0$ such that no subexponential-time algorithm can distinguish between a satisfiable 3SAT formula and one which is only $(1 - \varepsilon)$-satisfiable (also known as Gap-ETH), then the ratio above can be improved to $n^{f(n)}$ for any function $f$ whose limit is zero as $n$ goes to infinity (i.e. $f \in o(1)$).
