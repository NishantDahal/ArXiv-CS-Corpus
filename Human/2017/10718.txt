Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access combined with Random Linear Network Coded Cooperation

This letter considers two groups of source nodes. Each group transmits packets to its own designated destination node over single-hop links and via a cluster of relay nodes shared by both groups. In an effort to boost reliability without sacrificing throughput, a scheme is proposed, whereby packets at the relay nodes are combined using two methods; packets delivered by different groups are mixed using non-orthogonal multiple access principles, while packets originating from the same group are mixed using random linear network coding. An analytical framework that characterizes the performance of the proposed scheme is developed, compared to simulation results and benchmarked against a counterpart scheme that is based on orthogonal multiple access.
