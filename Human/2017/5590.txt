Haploid-Diploid Evolutionary Algorithms

This paper uses the recent idea that the fundamental haploid-diploid lifecycle of eukaryotic organisms implements a rudimentary form of learning within evolution. A general approach for evolutionary computation is here derived that differs from all previous known work using diploid representations. The primary role of recombination is also changed from that previously considered in both natural and artificial evolution under the new view. Using well-known abstract tuneable models it is shown that varying fitness landscape ruggedness varies the benefit of the new approach.
