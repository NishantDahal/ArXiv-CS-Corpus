Short-Term Plasticity and Long-Term Potentiation in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions: Towards Volatile Synapses

Synaptic memory is considered to be the main element responsible for learning and cognition in humans. Although traditionally non-volatile long-term plasticity changes have been implemented in nanoelectronic synapses for neuromorphic applications, recent studies in neuroscience have revealed that biological synapses undergo meta-stable volatile strengthening followed by a long-term strengthening provided that the frequency of the input stimulus is sufficiently high. Such "memory strengthening" and "memory decay" functionalities can potentially lead to adaptive neuromorphic architectures. In this paper, we demonstrate the close resemblance of the magnetization dynamics of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) to short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation observed in biological synapses. We illustrate that, in addition to the magnitude and duration of the input stimulus, frequency of the stimulus plays a critical role in determining long-term potentiation of the MTJ. Such MTJ synaptic memory arrays can be utilized to create compact, ultra-fast and low power intelligent neural systems.
