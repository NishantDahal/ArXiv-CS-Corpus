Rapid Asynchronous Plurality Consensus

We consider distributed plurality consensus in a complete graph of size $n$ with $k$ initial opinions. We design an efficient and simple protocol in the asynchronous communication model that ensures that all nodes eventually agree on the initially most frequent opinion. In this model, each node is equipped with a random Poisson clock with parameter $λ=1$. Whenever a node's clock ticks, it samples some neighbors, uniformly at random and with replacement, and adjusts its opinion according to the sample.
  A prominent example is the so-called two-choices algorithm in the synchronous model, where in each round, every node chooses two neighbors uniformly at random, and if the two sampled opinions coincide, then that opinion is adopted. This protocol is very efficient and well-studied when $k=2$. If $k=O(n^\varepsilon)$ for some small $\varepsilon$, we show that it converges to the initial plurality opinion within $O(k \cdot \log{n})$ rounds, w.h.p., as long as the initial difference between the largest and second largest opinion is $Ω(\sqrt{n \log n})$. On the other side, we show that there are cases in which $Ω(k)$ rounds are needed, w.h.p.
  One can beat this lower bound in the synchronous model by combining the two-choices protocol with randomized broadcasting. Our main contribution is a non-trivial adaptation of this approach to the asynchronous model. If the support of the most frequent opinion is at least $(1+\varepsilon)$ times that of the second-most frequent one and $k=O(\exp(\log{n}/\log \log{n}))$, then our protocol achieves the best possible run time of $O(\log n)$, w.h.p. We relax full synchronicity by allowing $o(n)$ nodes to be poorly synchronized, and the well synchronized nodes are only required to be within a certain time difference from one another. We enforce this synchronicity by introducing a novel gadget into the protocol.
