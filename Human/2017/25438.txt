Ergodic Capacity of Composite Fading Channels in Cognitive Radios with the Product of $κ$-$μ$ and $α$-$μ$ Variates

In this study, the product of two independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) random variables (RVs) for \k{appa}-μ fading distribution and α-μ fading distribution is considered. The method of the product model of RVs has been widely applied in numerous of communications fields, such as cascaded fading channels, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, radar communications and cognitive radio networks (CRs). The exact series expressions of the product of two i.n.i.d. RVs X for \k{appa}-μ variates and Y for α-μ variates are derived instead of Fox H-function to solve the problem that Fox H-function in the RVs product could not be implemented in popular mathematical software packages as Mathematica and Maple. Novel Exact close-form expressions of probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of proposed models are deduced to present the series expressions of product and generalized composite multipath shadowing models. Furthermore, novel exact expressions of the ergodic channel capacity (ECC) are obtained under optimal rate adaptation with constant transmit power (ORA). At last, these analytical results are confirmed with monte-carlo simulations to evaluate spectrum efficiency over generalized composite shadowing fading scenarios in CRs.
