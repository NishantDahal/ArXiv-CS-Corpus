Supporting Requirements Engineering Research that Industry Needs: The Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering Initiative

In light of the 40th jubilee of Requirements Engineering (RE), roughly 40 experts met in Switzerland to discuss where our discipline stands today. As of today, the common view is, indisputably, that RE as a discipline is stable and respected, as pointed out by Sarah Gregory when covering the seminar in her column to which articles like this one are invited to present ongoing research. However, it is also evident that after 40 years of promising research, conducting research that industry needs is still an ongoing challenge. Research that industry needs means research that solves industrial problems practitioners face; but do we really understand those problems? Here, I want to recapitulate on this research challenge and outline an initiative, the Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering Initiative, that aims at tackling this problem.
