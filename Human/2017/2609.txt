Bezier developable surfaces

In this paper we address the issue of designing developable surfaces with Bezier patches. We show that developable surfaces with a polynomial edge of regression are the set of developable surfaces which can be constructed with Aumann's algorithm. We also obtain the set of polynomial developable surfaces which can be constructed using general polynomial curves. The conclusions can be extended to spline surfaces as well.
