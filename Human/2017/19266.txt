Model based approach to study Defect Dependency in Large Scale Integrated Software Products

Large organizations have diverse product offerings to meet various business needs. To increase revenue, its common these days to offer software products as integrated product suite(s) rather than individual products. Creating and maintaining high quality software products within the integrated product suite requires rigorous product engineering methods. The sheer size of products and dependencies involved tend to raise unidentified defects that may become critical post product upgrades or after every release cycle. It is difficult to track such defects and its widespread across underlying sub-products. In this paper, we present a model based approach to study the defect dependency in large scale integrated software products to avoid surprise defects after product release. To validate the approach, we have applied it on some pilot projects in industry.
