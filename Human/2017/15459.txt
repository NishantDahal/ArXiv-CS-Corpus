Machine Learning Inspired Energy-Efficient Hybrid Precoding for MmWave Massive MIMO Systems

Hybrid precoding is a promising technique for mmWave massive MIMO systems, as it can considerably reduce the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains without obvious performance loss. However, most of the existing hybrid precoding schemes require a complicated phase shifter network, which still involves high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient hybrid precoding architecture, where the analog part is realized by a small number of switches and inverters instead of a large number of high-resolution phase shifters. Our analysis proves that the performance gap between the proposed hybrid precoding architecture and the traditional one is small and keeps constant when the number of antennas goes to infinity. Then, inspired by the cross-entropy (CE) optimization developed in machine learning, we propose an adaptive CE (ACE)-based hybrid precoding scheme for this new architecture. It aims to adaptively update the probability distributions of the elements in hybrid precoder by minimizing the CE, which can generate a solution close to the optimal one with a sufficiently high probability. Simulation results verify that our scheme can achieve the near-optimal sum-rate performance and much higher energy efficiency than traditional schemes.
