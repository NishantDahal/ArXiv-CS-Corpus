Consensus tracking in multi agent system with nonlinear and non identical dynamics via event driven sliding modes

In this work, leader follower consensus objective has been addressed with the synthesis of an event based controller utilizing sliding mode robust control. The schema has been partitioned into two parts viz. finite time consensus problem and event triggered control mechanism. A nonlinear multi agent system with non identical dynamics has been put forward to illustrate the robust capabilities of the proposed control. The first part incorporates matching of states of the followers with those of the leader via consensus tracking algorithm. In the subsequent part, an event triggered rule is devised to save computational power and restrict periodic updating of the controller involved while ensuring desired closed loop performance of the system. Switching of the event based controller is achieved via sliding mode control. Advantage of using switched controller like sliding mode is that it retains its inherent robustness as well as event triggering approach aids in saving energy expenditure. Efficacy of the proposed scheme is confirmed via numerical simulations.
