Standards for enabling heterogeneous IaaS cloud federations

Technology market is continuing a rapid growth phase where different resource providers and Cloud Management Frameworks are positioning to provide ad-hoc solutions -in terms of management interfaces, information discovery or billing- trying to differentiate from competitors but that as a result remain incompatible between them when addressing more complex scenarios like federated clouds. Grasping interoperability problems present in current infrastructures is then a must-do, tackled by studying how existing and emerging standards could enhance user experience in the cloud ecosystem. In this paper we will review the current open challenges in Infrastructure as a Service cloud interoperability and federation, as well as point to the potential standards that should alleviate these problems.
