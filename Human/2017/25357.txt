Performance Analysis of Dynamic Source Routing Protocol

Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is an efficient on-demand routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET). It depends on two main procedures: Route Discovery and Route Maintenance. Route discovery is the procedure used at the source of the packets to discover a route to the destination. Route Maintenance is the procedure that discovers link failures and repairs them. Route caching is the sub procedure serviceable to avoid the demand for discovering a route or to reduce route discovery delay before every data packet is sent. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of DSR. Different performance expressions are investigated including, delivery ratio, end to-end delay, and throughput, depending on different cache sizes and different speeds. All of that as a study to develop a new caching strategy as a future work.
