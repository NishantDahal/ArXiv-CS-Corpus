Signed Node Relevance Measurements

In this paper, we perform the initial and comprehensive study on the problem of measuring node relevance on signed social networks. We design numerous relevance measurements for signed social networks from both local and global perspectives and investigate the connection between signed relevance measurements, balance theory and signed network properties. Experimental results are conducted to study the effects of signed relevance measurements with four real-world datasets on signed network analysis tasks.
