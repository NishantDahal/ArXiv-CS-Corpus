Fast and Lightweight Rate Control for Onboard Predictive Coding of Hyperspectral Images

Predictive coding is attractive for compression of hyperspecral images onboard of spacecrafts in light of the excellent rate-distortion performance and low complexity of recent schemes. In this letter we propose a rate control algorithm and integrate it in a lossy extension to the CCSDS-123 lossless compression recommendation. The proposed rate algorithm overhauls our previous scheme by being orders of magnitude faster and simpler to implement, while still providing the same accuracy in terms of output rate and comparable or better image quality.
