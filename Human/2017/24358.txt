A Two Pronged Progress in Structured Dense Matrix Multiplication

Matrix-vector multiplication is one of the most fundamental computing primitives. Given a matrix $A\in\mathbb{F}^{N\times N}$ and a vector $b$, it is known that in the worst case $Î˜(N^2)$ operations over $\mathbb{F}$ are needed to compute $Ab$. A broad question is to identify classes of structured dense matrices that can be represented with $O(N)$ parameters, and for which matrix-vector multiplication can be performed sub-quadratically. One such class of structured matrices is the orthogonal polynomial transforms, whose rows correspond to a family of orthogonal polynomials. Other well known classes include the Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, Cauchy matrices and their extensions that are all special cases of a ldisplacement rank property. In this paper, we make progress on two fronts:
  1. We introduce the notion of recurrence width of matrices. For matrices with constant recurrence width, we design algorithms to compute $Ab$ and $A^Tb$ with a near-linear number of operations. This notion of width is finer than all the above classes of structured matrices and thus we can compute multiplication for all of them using the same core algorithm.
  2. We additionally adapt this algorithm to an algorithm for a much more general class of matrices with displacement structure: those with low displacement rank with respect to quasiseparable matrices. This class includes Toeplitz-plus-Hankel-like matrices, Discrete Cosine/Sine Transforms, and more, and captures all previously known matrices with displacement structure that we are aware of under a unified parametrization and algorithm.
  Our work unifies, generalizes, and simplifies existing state-of-the-art results in structured matrix-vector multiplication. Finally, we show how applications in areas such as multipoint evaluations of multivariate polynomials can be reduced to problems involving low recurrence width matrices.
