Counting paths in perfect trees

We present some exact expressions for the number of paths of a given length in a perfect $m$-ary tree. We first count the paths in perfect rooted $m$-ary trees and then use the results to determine the number of paths in perfect unrooted $m$-ary trees, extending a known result for binary trees.
