Angle-Domain Doppler Pre-Compensation for High-Mobility OFDM Uplink with a Massive ULA

In this paper, we propose a Doppler pre-compensation scheme for high-mobility orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink, where a high-speed terminal transmits signals to the base station (BS). Considering that the time-varying multipath channel consists of multiple Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs) with different angle of departures (AoDs), we propose to perform DFO pre-compensation at the transmitter with a large-scale uniform linear array (ULA). The transmitted signal passes through a beamforming network with high-spatial resolution to produce multiple parallel branches. Each branch transmits signal towards one direction thus it is affected by one dominant DFO when passing over the time-varying channel. Therefore, we can compensate the DFO for each branch at the transmitter previously. Theoretical analysis for the Doppler spread of the equivalent uplink channel is also conducted. It is found that when the number of transmit antennas is sufficiently large, the time-variation of channel can be efficiently suppressed. Therefore, the performance will not degrade significantly if applying the conventional time-invariant channel estimation and equalization methods at the receiver. Simulation results are provided to verify the proposed scheme.
