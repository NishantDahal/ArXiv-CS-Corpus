Secrecy Outage Analysis for Downlink Transmissions in the Presence of Randomly Located Eavesdroppers

We analyze the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for wireless networks with spatially (Poisson) distributed eavesdroppers (EDs) under the assumption that the base station employs transmit antenna selection (TAS) to enhance secrecy performance. We compare the cases where the receiving user equipment (UE) operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and full-duplex (FD) mode. In the latter case, the UE simultaneously receives the intended downlink message and transmits a jamming signal to strengthen secrecy. We investigate two models of (semi)passive eavesdropping: (1) EDs act independently and (2) EDs collude to intercept the transmitted message. For both of these models, we obtain expressions for the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for HD and FD UE operation. The expressions for HD systems have very accurate approximate or exact forms in terms of elementary and/or special functions for all path loss exponents. Those related to the FD systems have exact integral forms for general path loss exponents, while exact closed forms are given for specific exponents. A closed-form approximation is also derived for the FD case with colluding EDs. The resulting analysis shows that the reduction in the secrecy outage probability is logarithmic in the number of antennas used for TAS and identifies conditions under which HD operation should be used instead of FD jamming at the UE. These performance trends and exact relations between system parameters can be used to develop adaptive power allocation and duplex operation methods in practice. Examples of such techniques are alluded to herein.
