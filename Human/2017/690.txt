Observability transition in multiplex networks

We extend the observability model to multiplex networks. We present mathematical frameworks, valid under the treelike ansatz, able to describe the emergence of the macroscopic cluster of mutually observable nodes in both synthetic and real-world multiplex networks. We show that the observability transition in synthetic multiplex networks is discontinuous. In real-world multiplex networks instead, edge overlap among layers is responsible for the disappearance of any sign of abruptness in the emergence of the the macroscopic cluster of mutually observable nodes.
