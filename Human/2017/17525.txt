A Deep Neural Network Approach To Parallel Sentence Extraction

Parallel sentence extraction is a task addressing the data sparsity problem found in multilingual natural language processing applications. We propose an end-to-end deep neural network approach to detect translational equivalence between sentences in two different languages. In contrast to previous approaches, which typically rely on multiples models and various word alignment features, by leveraging continuous vector representation of sentences we remove the need of any domain specific feature engineering. Using a siamese bidirectional recurrent neural networks, our results against a strong baseline based on a state-of-the-art parallel sentence extraction system show a significant improvement in both the quality of the extracted parallel sentences and the translation performance of statistical machine translation systems. We believe this study is the first one to investigate deep learning for the parallel sentence extraction task.
