Joint Power and Admission Control based on Channel Distribution Information: A Novel Two-Timescale Approach

In this letter, we consider the joint power and admission control (JPAC) problem by assuming that only the channel distribution information (CDI) is available. Under this assumption, we formulate a new chance (probabilistic) constrained JPAC problem, where the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) outage probability of the supported links is enforced to be not greater than a prespecified tolerance. To efficiently deal with the chance SINR constraint, we employ the sample approximation method to convert them into finitely many linear constraints. Then, we propose a convex approximation based deflation algorithm for solving the sample approximation JPAC problem. Compared to the existing works, this letter proposes a novel two-timescale JPAC approach, where admission control is performed by the proposed deflation algorithm based on the CDI in a large timescale and transmission power is adapted instantly with fast fadings in a small timescale. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulations.
