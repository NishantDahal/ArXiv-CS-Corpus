Design for X (DfX) in the Internet of Things (IoT)

Designing quality in is a cornerstone of modern quality management philosophies. Design for X (DfX) techniques provide guidelines, heuristics, and metrics to ensure that a particular quality attribute exists in a design. Although hundreds of papers have been published on DfX approaches, few researchers have explored systematically applying multiple DfX in a particular problem context. As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves, boundaries between people, computers, and objects will become less distinct, underscoring the need for more holistic design. Using mixed methods, this paper examines the utility of DfX in the emerging IoT ecosystem. We identify DfX that are applicable to IoT-related design, and find gaps that demand further research and development. The results from this study can be used to help designers and quality managers select or develop appropriate DfX to use in designing components for the Internet of Things (IoT), supporting actionable strategies for quality and customer satisfaction.
