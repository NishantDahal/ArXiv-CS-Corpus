Agile Calibration Process of Full-Stack Simulation Frameworks for V2X Communications

Computer simulations and real-world car trials are essential to investigate the performance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. However, simulations are imperfect models of the physical reality and can be trusted only when they indicate agreement with the real-world. On the other hand, trials lack reproducibility and are subject to uncertainties and errors. In this paper, we will illustrate a case study where the interrelationship between trials, simulation, and the reality-of-interest is presented. Results are then compared in a holistic fashion. Our study will describe the procedure followed to macroscopically calibrate a full-stack network simulator to conduct high-fidelity full-stack computer simulations.
