Improving the Performance of OTDOA based Positioning in NB-IoT Systems

In this paper, we consider positioning with observed-time-difference-of-arrival (OTDOA) for a device deployed in long-term-evolution (LTE) based narrow-band Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) systems. We propose an iterative expectation-maximization based successive interference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of residual frequency-offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of-arrival (ToA) of the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a low complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog circuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as 1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect ToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running the EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated for each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA resolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of time-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate such as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small search window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the refined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three cells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the position of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical simulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against impairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual FO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional ToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device.
