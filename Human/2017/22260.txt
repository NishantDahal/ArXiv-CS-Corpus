An Energy Efficient Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks

The cognitive radio wireless sensor networks have become an integral part of communicating spectrum information to the fusion center, in a cooperative spectrum sensing environment. A group of battery operated sensors or nodes, sensing information about spectrum availability in the radio links, needs an energy efficient strategy to pass on the binary information. A proper routing method through intelligent decision making can be a good solution. In this paper, an energy efficient routing protocol has been introduced and a performance comparison is made with the existing system in terms of its energy consumption. The proposed routing technique considers both uniform and non-uniform clustering strategies and proves to be an energy efficient method of communication.
