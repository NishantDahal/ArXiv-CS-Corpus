Discovery of potential collaboration networks from open knowledge sources

Scientific publishing conveys the outputs of an academic or research activity, in this sense; it also reflects the efforts and issues in which people engage. To identify potential collaborative networks one of the simplest approaches is to leverage the co-authorship relations. In this approach, semantic and hierarchic relationships defined by a Knowledge Organization System are used in order to improve the system's ability to recommend potential networks beyond the lexical or syntactic analysis of the topics or concepts that are of interest to academics.
