Hotspot-aware DSA Grouping and Mask Assignment

In Directed Self Assembly (DSA), poor printing of guiding templates can cause misassembly resulting in high defect probability. Therefore, hotspots should be avoided in the choice of the DSA groups. Accordingly, Directed Self-Assembly (DSA) technologies which use Multiple Patterning (MP) to print the guiding templates need to be aware of hotspots during the DSA grouping and MP Decomposition. In this paper, we present a hotspot-aware heuristic for DSA grouping and MP decomposition. Results show that that the proposed heuristic eliminates 78% of the hotspots and conflicts that result from using a hotspot-unaware grouping and decomposition algorithm. In comparison to the optimal solution using Integer Linear Programming, the proposed heuristic results in ~24% more violations.
