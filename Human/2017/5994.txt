Image reconstruction by domain transform manifold learning

Image reconstruction plays a critical role in the implementation of all contemporary imaging modalities across the physical and life sciences including optical, MRI, CT, PET, and radio astronomy. During an image acquisition, the sensor encodes an intermediate representation of an object in the sensor domain, which is subsequently reconstructed into an image by an inversion of the encoding function. Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic knowledge of the inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the presence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction approach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc stages in a signal processing chain whose composition depends on the details of each acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to optimize reconstruction performance. We present here a unified framework for image reconstruction, AUtomated TransfOrm by Manifold APproximation (AUTOMAP), which recasts image reconstruction as a data-driven, supervised learning task that allows a mapping between sensor and image domain to emerge from an appropriate corpus of training data. We implement AUTOMAP with a deep neural network and exhibit its flexibility in learning reconstruction transforms for a variety of MRI acquisition strategies, using the same network architecture and hyperparameters. We further demonstrate its efficiency in sparsely representing transforms along low-dimensional manifolds, resulting in superior immunity to noise and reconstruction artifacts compared with conventional handcrafted reconstruction methods. In addition to improving the reconstruction performance of existing acquisition methodologies, we anticipate accelerating the discovery of new acquisition strategies across modalities as the burden of reconstruction becomes lifted by AUTOMAP and learned-reconstruction approaches.
