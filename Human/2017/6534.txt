Joint Domain Based Massive Access for Small Packets Traffic of Uplink Wireless Channel

The fifth generation (5G) communication scenarios such as the cellular network and the emerging machine type communications will produce massive small packets. To support massive connectivity and avoid signaling overhead caused by the transmission of those small packets, this paper proposes a novel method to improve the transmission efficiency for massive connections of wireless uplink channel. The proposed method combines compressive sensing (CS) with power domain NOMA jointly, especially neither the scheduling nor the centralized power allocation is necessary in the method. Both the analysis and simulation show that the method can support up to two or three times overloading.
