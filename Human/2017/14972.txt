On the Stabilizer of Weight Enumerators of Linear Codes

This paper investigates the relation between linear codes and the stabilizer in ${\rm GL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ of their weight enumerators. We prove a result on the finiteness of stabilizers and give a complete classification of linear codes with infinite stabilizer in the non-binary case. We present an efficient algorithm to compute explicitly the stabilizer of weight enumerators and we apply it to the family of Reed-Muller codes to show that some of their weight enumerators have trivial stabilizer.
