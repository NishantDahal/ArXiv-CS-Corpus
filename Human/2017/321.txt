Proceedings of the 12th Workshop on User Interfaces for Theorem Provers

The UITP workshop series brings together researchers interested in designing, developing and evaluating user interfaces for automated reasoning tools, such as interactive proof assistants, automated theorem provers, model finders, tools for formal methods, and tools for visualising and manipulating logical formulas and proofs. The twelth edition of UITP took place in Coimbra, Portugal, and was part of the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR'16). The workshop consisted of an invited talk, six presentations of submitted papers and lively hands-on session for reasoning tools and their user-interface. These post-proceedings contain four contributed papers accepted for publication after a second round of reviewing after the workshop as well as the invited paper.
