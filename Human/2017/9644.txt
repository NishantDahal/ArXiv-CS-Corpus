Informative and misinformative interactions in a school of fish

It is generally accepted that, when moving in groups, animals process information to coordinate their motion. Recent studies have begun to apply rigorous methods based on Information Theory to quantify such distributed computation. Following this perspective, we use transfer entropy to quantify dynamic information flows locally in space and time across a school of fish during directional changes around a circular tank, i.e. U-turns. This analysis reveals peaks in information flows during collective U-turns and identifies two different flows: an informative flow (positive transfer entropy) based on fish that have already turned about fish that are turning, and a misinformative flow (negative transfer entropy) based on fish that have not turned yet about fish that are turning. We also reveal that the information flows are related to relative position and alignment between fish, and identify spatial patterns of information and misinformation cascades. This study offers several methodological contributions and we expect further application of these methodologies to reveal intricacies of self-organisation in other animal groups and active matter in general.
