A Heuristic Approach to Protocol Tuning for High Performance Data Transfers

Obtaining optimal data transfer performance is of utmost importance to today's data-intensive distributed applications and wide-area data replication services. Doing so necessitates effectively utilizing available network bandwidth and resources, yet in practice transfers seldom reach the levels of utilization they potentially could. Tuning protocol parameters such as pipelining, parallelism, and concurrency can significantly increase utilization and performance, however determining the best settings for these parameters is a difficult problem, as network conditions can vary greatly between sites and over time. Nevertheless, it is an important problem, since poor tuning can cause either under- or over-utilization of network resources and thus degrade transfer performance. In this paper, we present three algorithms for application-level tuning of different protocol parameters for maximizing transfer throughput in wide-area networks. Our algorithms dynamically tune the number of parallel data streams per file (for large file optimization), the level of control channel pipelining (for small file optimization), and the number of concurrent file transfers to increase I/O throughput (a technique useful for all types of files). The proposed heuristic algorithms improve the transfer throughput up to 10x compared to the baseline and 7x compared to the state of the art solutions.
