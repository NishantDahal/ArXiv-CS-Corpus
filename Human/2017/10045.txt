Optimizing spatial throughput in device-to-device networks

Results are presented for optimizing device-to-device communications in cellular networks, while maintaining spectral efficiency of the base-station-to-device downlink channel. We build upon established and tested stochastic geometry models of signal-to-interference ratio in wireless networks based on the Poisson point process, which incorporate random propagation effects such as fading and shadowing. A key result is a simple formula, allowing one to optimize the device-to-device spatial throughput by suitably adjusting the proportion of active devices. These results can lead to further investigation as they can be immediately applied to more sophisticated models such as studying multi-tier network models to address coverage in closed access networks.
