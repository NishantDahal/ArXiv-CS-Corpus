On the Complexity of Trial and Error for Constraint Satisfaction Problems

In 2013 Bei, Chen and Zhang introduced a trial and error model of computing, and applied to some constraint satisfaction problems. In this model the input is hidden by an oracle which, for a candidate assignment, reveals some information about a violated constraint if the assignment is not satisfying. In this paper we initiate a {\em systematic} study of constraint satisfaction problems in the trial and error model. To achieve this, we first adopt a formal framework for CSPs, and based on this framework we define several types of revealing oracles. Our main contribution is to develop a \emph{transfer theorem} for each type of the revealing oracle, under a broad class of parameters. To any hidden CSP with a specific type of revealing oracle, the transfer theorem associates another, potentially harder CSP in the normal setting, such that their complexities are polynomial time equivalent. This in principle transfers the study of a large class of hidden CSPs, possibly with a promise on the instances, to the study of CSPs in the normal setting. We then apply the transfer theorems to get polynomial-time algorithms or hardness results for hidden CSPs, including satisfaction problems, monotone graph properties, isomorphism problems, and the exact version of the Unique Games problem. Most of the proofs of these results are short and straightforward, which exhibits the power of the transfer theorems.
