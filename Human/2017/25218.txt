Multi-Attribute Robust Component Analysis for Facial UV Maps

Recently, due to the collection of large scale 3D face models, as well as the advent of deep learning, a significant progress has been made in the field of 3D face alignment "in-the-wild". That is, many methods have been proposed that establish sparse or dense 3D correspondences between a 2D facial image and a 3D face model. The utilization of 3D face alignment introduces new challenges and research directions, especially on the analysis of facial texture images. In particular, texture does not suffer any more from warping effects (that occurred when 2D face alignment methods were used). Nevertheless, since facial images are commonly captured in arbitrary recording conditions, a considerable amount of missing information and gross outliers is observed (e.g., due to self-occlusion, or subjects wearing eye-glasses). Given that many annotated databases have been developed for face analysis tasks, it is evident that component analysis techniques need to be developed in order to alleviate issues arising from the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel component analysis technique that is suitable for facial UV maps containing a considerable amount of missing information and outliers, while additionally, incorporates knowledge from various attributes (such as age and identity). We evaluate the proposed Multi-Attribute Robust Component Analysis (MA-RCA) on problems such as UV completion and age progression, where the proposed method outperforms compared techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that MA-RCA method is powerful enough to provide weak annotations for training deep learning systems for various applications, such as illumination transfer.
