Build Fast and Accurate Lemmatization for Arabic

In this paper we describe the complexity of building a lemmatizer for Arabic which has a rich and complex derivational morphology, and we discuss the need for a fast and accurate lammatization to enhance Arabic Information Retrieval (IR) results. We also introduce a new data set that can be used to test lemmatization accuracy, and an efficient lemmatization algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art Arabic lemmatization in terms of accuracy and speed. We share the data set and the code for public.
