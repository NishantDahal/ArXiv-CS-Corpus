Coqatoo: Generating Natural Language Versions of Coq Proofs

Due to their numerous advantages, formal proofs and proof assistants, such as Coq, are becoming increasingly popular. However, one disadvantage of using proof assistants is that the resulting proofs can sometimes be hard to read and understand, particularly for less-experienced users. To address this issue, we have implemented a tool capable of generating natural language versions of Coq proofs called Coqatoo, which we present in this paper.
