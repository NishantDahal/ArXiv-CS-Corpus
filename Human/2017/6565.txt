Proceedings 8th Workshop on Developments in Implicit Computational Complexity and 5th Workshop on Foundational and Practical Aspects of Resource Analysis

The DICE workshop explores the area of Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC), which grew out from several proposals to use logic and formal methods to provide languages for complexity-bounded computation (e.g. Ptime, Logspace computation). It aims at studying the computational complexity of programs without referring to external measuring conditions or a particular machine model, but only by considering language restrictions or logical/computational principles entailing complexity properties. 
  The FOPARA workshop serves as a forum for presenting original research results that are relevant to the analysis of resource (e.g. time, space, energy) consumption by computer programs. The workshop aims to bring together the researchers that work on foundational issues with the researchers that focus more on practical results. Therefore, both theoretical and practical contributions are encouraged. We also encourage papers that combine theory and practice. 
  Given the complementarity and the synergy between these two communities, and following the successful experience of co-location of DICE-FOPARA 2015 in London at ETAPS 2015, we hold these two workshops together at ETAPS 2017, which takes place in Uppsala, Sweden. The provided proceedings collect the papers accepted at the workshop.
