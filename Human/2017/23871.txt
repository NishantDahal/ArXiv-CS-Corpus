Biocompatible Writing of Data into DNA

A simple DNA-based data storage scheme is demonstrated in which information is written using "addressing" oligonucleotides. In contrast to other methods that allow arbitrary code to be stored, the resulting DNA is suitable for downstream enzymatic and biological processing. This capability is crucial for DNA computers, and may allow for a diverse array of computational operations to be carried out using this DNA. Although here we use gel-based methods for information readout, we also propose more advanced methods involving protein/DNA complexes and atomic force microscopy/nano-pore schemes for data readout.
