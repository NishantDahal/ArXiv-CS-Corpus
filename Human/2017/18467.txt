Modeling Profit of Sliced 5G Networks for Advanced Network Resource Management and Slice Implementation

The core innovation in future 5G cellular networksnetwork slicing, aims at providing a flexible and efficient framework of network organization and resource management. The revolutionary network architecture based on slices, makes most of the current network cost models obsolete, as they estimate the expenditures in a static manner. In this paper, a novel methodology is proposed, in which a value chain in sliced networks is presented. Based on the proposed value chain, the profits generated by different slices are analyzed, and the task of network resource management is modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem. Setting strong assumptions, this optimization problem is analyzed starting from a simple ideal scenario. By removing the assumptions step-by-step, realistic but complex use cases are approached. Through this progressive analysis, technical challenges in slice implementation and network optimization are investigated under different scenarios. For each challenge, some potentially available solutions are suggested, and likely applications are also discussed.
