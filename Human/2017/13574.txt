Outfix-guided insertion

Motivated by work on bio-operations on DNA strings, we consider an outfix-guided insertion operation that can be viewed as a generalization of the overlap assembly operation on strings studied previously. As the main result we construct a finite language $L$ such that the outfix-guided insertion closure of $L$ is non-regular. We consider also the closure properties of regular and (deterministic) context-free languages under the outfix-guided insertion operation and decision problems related to outfix-guided insertion. Deciding whether a language recognized by a deterministic finite automaton is closed under outfix-guided insertion can be done in polynomial time. The complexity of the corresponding question for nondeterministic finite automata remains open.
