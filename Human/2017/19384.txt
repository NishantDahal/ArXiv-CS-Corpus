Optimal Repair Layering for Erasure-Coded Data Centers: From Theory to Practice

Repair performance in hierarchical data centers is often bottlenecked by cross-rack network transfer. Recent theoretical results show that the cross-rack repair traffic can be minimized through repair layering, whose idea is to partition a repair operation into inner-rack and cross-rack layers. However, how repair layering should be implemented and deployed in practice remains an open issue. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a practical repair layering framework called DoubleR. We design two families of practical double regenerating codes (DRC), which not only minimize the cross-rack repair traffic, but also have several practical properties that improve state-of-the-art regenerating codes. We implement and deploy DoubleR atop Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and show that DoubleR maintains the theoretical guarantees of DRC and improves the repair performance of regenerating codes in both node recovery and degraded read operations.
