The Power of Waiting for More than One Response in Minimizing the Age-of-Information

The Age-of-Information (AoI) has recently been proposed as an important metric for investigating the timeliness performance in information-update systems. Prior studies on AoI optimization often consider a Push model, which is concerned about when and how to "push" (i.e., generate and transmit) the updated information to the user. In stark contrast, in this paper we introduce a new Pull model, which is more relevant for certain applications (such as the real-time stock quotes service), where a user sends requests to the servers to proactively "pull" the information of interest. Moreover, we propose to employ request replication to reduce the AoI. Interestingly, we find that under this new Pull model, replication schemes capture a novel tradeoff between different levels of information freshness and different response times across the servers, which can be exploited to minimize the expected AoI at the user's side. Specifically, assuming Poisson updating process at the servers and exponentially distributed response time, we derive a closedform formula for computing the expected AoI and obtain the optimal number of responses to wait for to minimize the expected AoI. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to elucidate our theoretical results. Our findings show that waiting for more than one response can significantly reduce the AoI in most scenarios.
