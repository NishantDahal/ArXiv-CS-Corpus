Convolutional Neural Networks: Ensemble Modeling, Fine-Tuning and Unsupervised Semantic Localization for Intraoperative CLE Images

Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is an advanced optical fluorescence technology undergoing assessment for applications in brain tumor surgery. Despite its promising potential, interpreting the unfamiliar gray tone images of fluorescent stains can be difficult. Many of the CLE images can be distorted by motion, extremely low or high fluorescence signal, or obscured by red blood cell accumulation, and these can be interpreted as nondiagnostic. However, just one neat CLE image might suffice for intraoperative diagnosis of the tumor. While manual examination of thousands of nondiagnostic images during surgery would be impractical, this creates an opportunity for a model to select diagnostic images for the pathologists or surgeon's review. In this study, we sought to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect the diagnostic images using a manually annotated dataset, and we employed a patient-based nested cross-validation approach to explore generalizability of the model. We explored various training regimes: deep training, shallow fine-tuning, and deep fine-tuning. Further, we investigated the effect of ensemble modeling by combining the top-5 single models crafted in the development phase. We localized histological features from diagnostic CLE images by visualization of shallow and deep neural activations. Our inter-rater experiment results confirmed that our ensemble of deeply fine-tuned models achieved higher agreement with the ground truth than the other observers. With the speed and precision of the proposed method (110 images/second; 85% on the gold standard test subset), it has potential to be integrated into the operative workflow in the brain tumor surgery.
