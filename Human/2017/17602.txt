A Profit-Maximizing Strategy of Network Resource Management for 5G Tenant Slices

Supported by the emerging technologies of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and network slicing, 5G networks allow tenants to rent resources from mobile network operators (MNOs) in order to provide services without possessing an own network infrastructure. The MNOs are therefore facing the problem of deciding if to accept or decline the resource renting requests they receive. This paper builds a stochastic model that describes the MNO's revenue and opportunity cost of accepting a contract, and therewith proposes a strategy that is analytically derived to maximize the expected profit at every decision.
