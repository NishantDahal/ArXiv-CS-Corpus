Joint Power Control and Beamforming for Uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in 5G Millimeter-Wave Communications

In this paper, we investigate the combination of two key enabling technologies for the fifth generation (5G) wireless mobile communication, namely millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In particular, we consider a typical 2-user uplink mmWave-NOMA system, where the base station (BS) equips an analog beamforming structure with a single RF chain and serves 2 NOMA users. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the achievable sum rate of the 2 users while ensuring a minimal rate constraint for each user. The problem turns to be a joint power control and beamforming problem, i.e., we need to find the beamforming vectors to steer to the two users simultaneously subject to an analog beamforming structure, and meanwhile control appropriate power on them. As direct search for the optimal solution of the non-convex problem is too complicated, we propose to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems that are relatively easy to solve: one is a power control and beam gain allocation problem, and the other is an analog beamforming problem under a constant-modulus constraint. The rational of the proposed solution is verified by extensive simulations, and the performance evaluation results show that the proposed sub-optimal solution achieve a close-to-bound uplink sum-rate performance.
