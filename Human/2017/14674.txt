Two-Party Function Computation on the Reconciled Data

In this paper, we initiate a study of a new problem termed function computation on the reconciled data, which generalizes a set reconciliation problem in the literature. Assume a distributed data storage system with two users $A$ and $B$. The users possess a collection of binary vectors $S_{A}$ and $S_{B}$, respectively. They are interested in computing a function $Ï†$ of the reconciled data $S_{A} \cup S_{B}$.
  It is shown that any deterministic protocol, which computes a sum and a product of reconciled sets of binary vectors represented as nonnegative integers, has to communicate at least $2^n + n - 1$ and $2^n + n - 2$ bits in the worst-case scenario, respectively, where $n$ is the length of the binary vectors. Connections to other problems in computer science, such as set disjointness and finding the intersection, are established, yielding a variety of additional upper and lower bounds on the communication complexity. A protocol for computation of a sum function, which is based on use of a family of hash functions, is presented, and its characteristics are analyzed.
