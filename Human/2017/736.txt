The g-Good-Neighbor Conditional Diagnosability of Locally Twisted Cubes

In the work of Peng et al. in 2012, a new measure was proposed for fault diagnosis of systems: namely, g-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability, which requires that any fault-free vertex has at least g fault-free neighbors in the system. In this paper, we establish the g-good-neighbor conditional diagnosability of locally twisted cubes under the PMC model and the MM^* model.
