Semi-supervised Speech Enhancement in Envelop and Details Subspaces

In this study, we propose a modulation decoupling based single channel speech enhancement subspace framework, in which the spectrogram of noisy speech is decoupled as the product of a spectral envelop subspace and a spectral details subspace. This decoupling approach provides a method to specifically work on elimination of those noises that greatly affect the intelligibility. Two supervised low-rank and sparse decomposition schemes are developed in the spectral envelop subspace to obtain a robust recovery of speech components. A Bayesian formulation of non-negative factorization is used to learn the speech dictionary from the spectral envelop subspace of clean speech samples. In the spectral details subspace, a standard robust principal component analysis is implemented to extract the speech components. The validation results show that compared with four speech enhancement algorithms, including MMSE-SPP, NMF-RPCA, RPCA, and LARC, the proposed MS based algorithms achieve satisfactory performance on improving perceptual quality, and especially speech intelligibility.
