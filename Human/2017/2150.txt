Con los juegos también se educa: un enfoque educativo de los juegos de la Oca y el Parchís

In this work, we have designed and implemented, based on traditional board games such as the game of the Goose or Parchis, an educational software that aim to reinforce the learning of children. The idea that we are going to develop to do this is very simple: the children play with the same rules as in the traditional game but we add the functionality that after throwing the dice the system asks a question randomly chosen from a predefined database that can be easily modified, and the game piece only moves in the case the question is answered correctly.
