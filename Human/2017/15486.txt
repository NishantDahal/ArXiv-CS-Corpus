GitHub and Stack Overflow: Analyzing Developer Interests Across Multiple Social Collaborative Platforms

Increasingly, software developers are using a wide array of social collaborative platforms for software development and learning. In this work, we examined the similarities in developer's interests within and across GitHub and Stack Overflow. Our study finds that developers share common interests in GitHub and Stack Overflow, on average, 39% of the GitHub repositories and Stack Overflow questions that a developer had participated fall in the common interests. Also, developers do share similar interests with other developers who co-participated activities in the two platforms. In particular, developers who co-commit and co-pull-request same GitHub repositories and co-answer same Stack Overflow questions, share more common interests compare to other developers who co-participate in other platform activities.
