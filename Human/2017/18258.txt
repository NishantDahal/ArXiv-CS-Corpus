On Independence and Capacity of Multidimensional Semiconstrained Systems

We find a new formula for the limit of the capacity of certain sequences of multidimensional semiconstrained systems as the dimension tends to infinity. We do so by generalizing the notion of independence entropy, originally studied in the context of constrained systems, to the study of semiconstrained systems. Using the independence entropy, we obtain new lower bounds on the capacity of multidimensional semiconstrained systems in general, and $d$-dimensional axial-product systems in particular. In the case of the latter, we prove our bound is asymptotically tight, giving the exact limiting capacity in terms of the independence entropy. We show the new bound improves upon the best-known bound in a case study of $(0,k,p)$-RLL.
