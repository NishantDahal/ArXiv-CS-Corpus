Myhill-Nerode Relation for Sequentiable Structures

Sequentiable structures are a subclass of monoids that generalise the free monoids and the monoid of non-negative real numbers with addition. In this paper we consider functions $f:Î£^*\rightarrow {\cal M}$ and define the Myhill-Nerode relation for these functions. We prove that a function of finite index, $n$, can be represented with a subsequential transducer with $n$ states.
