Radio Access Network and Spectrum Sharing in Mobile Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Perspective

Next generation mobile networks will rely ever more heavily on resource sharing. In this article we study the sharing of radio access network and spectrum among mobile operators. We assess the impact of sharing these two types of resources on the performance of spatially distributed mobile networks. We apply stochastic geometry to observe the combined effect of, for example, the level of spatial clustering among the deployed base stations, the shared network size, or the coordination in shared spectrum use on network coverage and expected user data rate. We uncover some complex effects of mobile network resource sharing, which involve non-linearly scaling gains and performance trade-offs related to the sharing scenario or the spatial clustering level.
