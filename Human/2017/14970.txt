Online Action Recognition based on Incremental Learning of Weighted Covariance Descriptors

Different from traditional action recognition based on video segments, online action recognition aims to recognize actions from unsegmented streams of data in a continuous manner. One way for online recognition is based on the evidence accumulation over time to make predictions from stream videos. This paper presents a fast yet effective method to recognize actions from stream of noisy skeleton data, and a novel weighted covariance descriptor is adopted to accumulate evidence. In particular, a fast incremental updating method for the weighted covariance descriptor is developed for accumulation of temporal information and online prediction. The weighted covariance descriptor takes the following principles into consideration: past frames have less contribution for recognition and recent and informative frames such as key frames contribute more to the recognition. The online recognition is achieved using a simple nearest neighbor search against a set of offline trained action models. Experimental results on MSC-12 Kinect Gesture dataset and our newly constructed online action recognition dataset have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method.
