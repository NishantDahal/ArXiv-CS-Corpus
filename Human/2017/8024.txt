On the convergence of the sparse possibilistic c-means algorithm

In this paper, a convergence proof for the recently proposed sparse possibilistic c-means (SPCM) algorithm is provided, utilizing the celebrated Zangwill convergence theorem. It is shown that the iterative sequence generated by SPCM converges to a stationary point or there exists a subsequence of it that converges to a stationary point of the cost function of the algorithm.
