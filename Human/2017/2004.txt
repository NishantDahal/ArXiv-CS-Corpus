An architecture for non-invasive software measurement

Analysis of data related to software development helps to increase quality, control and predictability of software development processes and products.However, collecting such data for is a complex task. A non-invasive collection of software metrics is one of the most promising approaches to solve the task. In this paper we present an approach which consists of four parts: collect the data, store all collected data, unify the stored data and analyze the data to provide insights to the user about software product or process. We employ the approach to the development of an architecture for non-invasive software measurement system and explain its advantages and limitations.
