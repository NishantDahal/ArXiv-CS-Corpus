Load Synchronization and Sustained Oscillations Induced by Transactive Control

Transactive or market-based coordination strategies have recently been proposed for controlling the aggregate demand of a large number of electric loads. Such schemes offer operational benefits such as enforcing distribution feeder capacity limits and providing users with flexibility to consume energy based on the price they are willing to pay. However, this paper demonstrates that they are also prone to load synchronization and power oscillations. A transactive energy framework has been adopted and applied to a population of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). A modified TCL switching logic takes into account market coordination signals, alongside the natural hysteresis-based switching conditions. Studies of this market-based coordination scheme suggest that several factors may contribute to load synchronism, including sharp changes in the market prices that are broadcast to loads, lack of diversity in user specified bid curves, low feeder limits that are encountered periodically, and the form of user bid curves. Case studies illustrate challenges associated with market-based coordination strategies and provide insights into modifications that address those issues.
