Watching Videos with Certain and Constant Quality: PID-based Quality Control Method

In video coding, compressed videos with certain and constant quality can ensure quality of experience (QoE). To this end, we propose in this paper a novel PID-based quality control (PQC) method for video coding. Specifically, a formulation is modelled to control quality of video coding with two objectives: minimizing control error and quality fluctuation. Then, we apply the Laplace domain analysis to model the relationship between quantization parameter (QP) and control error in this formulation. Given the relationship between QP and control error, we propose a solution to the PQC formulation, such that videos can be compressed at certain and constant quality. Finally, experimental results show that our PQC method is effective in both control accuracy and quality fluctuation.
