Mīmā\d{m}sā deontic logic: proof theory and applications

Starting with the deontic principles in Mīmā\d{m}sā texts we introduce a new deontic logic. We use general proof-theoretic methods to obtain a cut-free sequent calculus for this logic, resulting in decidability, complexity results and neighbourhood semantics. The latter is used to analyse a well known example of conflicting obligations from the Vedas.
