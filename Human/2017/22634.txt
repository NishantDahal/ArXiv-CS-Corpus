On the Stability of a N-class Aloha Network

Necessary and sufficient conditions are established for the stability of a high-mobility N-class Aloha network, where the position of the sources follows a Poisson point process, each source has an infinity capacity buffer, packets arrive according to a Bernoulli distribution and the link distance between source and destination follows a Rayleigh distribution. It is also derived simple formulas for the stationary packet success probability and mean delay.
