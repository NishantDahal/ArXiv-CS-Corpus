On The Automated Planning And Design Of SMATV Systems

The paper presents some theoretical and practical considerations regarding the TV information distribution in local (small and medium) networks, using different technologies and architectures. The SMATV concept is chosen to be presented extensively. The most important design formulae are presented with a software package supporting the network planner to design and optimize the network. A case study is realized, using standard components in SMATV, for a 5 floor building. The study proved that it is possible to design and optimize the entire network, without realizing first a costly experimental setup. It is also possible to run different architectures, optimizing also the costs of the final solution of network.
