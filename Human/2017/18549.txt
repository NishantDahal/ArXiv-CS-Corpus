Performance Analysis of Massive MIMO Networks with Random Unitary Pilot Matrices

A common approach to obtain channel state information for massive MIMO networks is to use the same orthogonal training sequences in each cell. We call this the full-pilot reuse (FPR) scheme. In this paper, we study an alternative approach where each cell uses different sets of orthogonal pilot (DOP) sequences. Considering uplink communications with matched filter (MF) receivers, we first derive the SINR in the large system regime where the number of antennas at the base station, the number of users in each cell, and training duration grow large with fixed ratios. For tractability in the analysis, the orthogonal pilots are drawn from Haar distributed random unitary matrices. The resulting expression is simple and easy to compute. As shown by the numerical simulations, the asymptotic SINR approximates the finite-size systems accurately. Secondly, we derive the user capacity of the DOP scheme under a simple power control and show that it is generally better than that of the FPR scheme.
