Energy Harvesting Communications under Explicit and Implicit Temperature Constraints

We consider an energy harvesting communication system where the temperature dynamics is governed by the transmission power policy. Different from the previous work, we consider a discrete time system where transmission power is kept constant in each slot. We consider two models that capture different effects of temperature. In the first model, the temperature is constrained to be below a critical temperature at all time instants; we coin this model as explicit temperature constrained model. We investigate throughput optimal power allocation for multiple energy arrivals under general, as well as temperature and energy limited regimes. We show that the optimal power allocation for the temperature limited case is monotone decreasing. In the second model, we consider the effect of the temperature on the channel quality via its influence on additive noise power; we coin this model as implicit temperature constrained model. In this model, the change in the variance of the additive noise due to previous transmissions is non-negligible. In particular, transmitted signals contribute as interference for all subsequent slots and thus affect the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). In this case, we investigate throughput optimal power allocation under general, as well as low and high SINR regimes. We show in the low SINR regime that the optimal allocation dictates the transmitter to save its harvested energy till the last slot. In the high SINR regime, we show that the optimal power sequence is monotone increasing. Finally, we consider the case in which implicit and explicit temperature constraints are simultaneously active and we show under certain conditions that the optimal power sequence is monotone decreasing.
