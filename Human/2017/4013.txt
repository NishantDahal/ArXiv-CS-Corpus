Width Hierarchies for Quantum and Classical Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams with Repeated Test

We consider quantum, nondterministic and probabilistic versions of known computational model Ordered Read-$k$-times Branching Programs or Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams with repeated test ($k$-QOBDD, $k$-NOBDD and $k$-POBDD). We show width hierarchy for complexity classes of Boolean function computed by these models and discuss relation between different variants of $k$-OBDD.
