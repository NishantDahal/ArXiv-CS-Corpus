A Generic Axiomatic Characterization of Centrality Measures in Social Network

Centrality is an important notion in complex networks; it could be used to characterize how influential a node or an edge is in the network. It plays an important role in several other network analysis tools including community detection. Even though there are a small number of axiomatic frameworks associated with this notion, the existing formalizations are not generic in nature. In this paper we propose a generic axiomatic framework to capture all the intrinsic properties of a centrality measure (a.k.a. centrality index). We analyze popular centrality measures along with other novel measures of centrality using this framework. We observed that none of the centrality measures considered satisfies all the axioms.
