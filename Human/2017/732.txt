Performance Analysis of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes over 2D Interference Channels via Density Evolution

The theoretical analysis of detection and decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes transmitted over channels with two-dimensional (2D) interference and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is provided in this paper. The detection and decoding system adopts the joint iterative detection and decoding scheme (JIDDS) in which the log-domain sum-product algorithm is adopted to decode the LDPC codes. The graph representations of the JIDDS are explained. Using the graph representations, we prove that the message-flow neighborhood of the detection and decoding system will be tree-like for a sufficiently long code length. We further confirm that the performance of the JIDDS will concentrate around the performance in which message-flow neighborhood is tree-like. Based on the tree-like message-flow neighborhood, we employ a modified density evolution algorithm to track the message densities during the iterations. A threshold is calculated using the density evolution algorithm which can be considered as the theoretical performance limit of the system. Simulation results demonstrate that the modified density evolution is effective in analyzing the performance of 2D interference systems.
