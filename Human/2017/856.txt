Quantum Stabilizer Codes Can Realize Access Structures Impossible by Classical Secret Sharing

We show a simple example of a secret sharing scheme encoding classical secret to quantum shares that can realize an access structure impossible by classical information processing with limitation on the size of each share. The example is based on quantum stabilizer codes.
