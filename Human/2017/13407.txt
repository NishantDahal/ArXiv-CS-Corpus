Incorporating TSN/BLS in AFDX for Mixed-Criticality Avionics Applications: Specification and Analysis

In this paper, we propose an extension of the AFDX standard, incorporating a TSN/BLS shaper, to homogenize the avionics communication architecture, and enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality levels, e.g., legacy AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment. First, we present the main specifications of such a proposed solution. Then, we detail the corresponding worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus framework, to infer real-time guarantees. Finally, we conduct the performance analysis of such a proposal on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the efficiency of the Extended AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level constraints, in comparison with the legacy AFDX standard.
