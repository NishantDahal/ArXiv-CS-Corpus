Community Detection with Colored Edges

In this paper, we prove a sharp limit on the community detection problem with colored edges. We assume two equal-sized communities and there are $m$ different types of edges. If two vertices are in the same community, the distribution of edges follows $p_i=α_i\log{n}/n$ for $1\leq i \leq m$, otherwise the distribution of edges is $q_i=β_i\log{n}/n$ for $1\leq i \leq m$, where $α_i$ and $β_i$ are positive constants and $n$ is the total number of vertices. Under these assumptions, a fundamental limit on community detection is characterized using the Hellinger distance between the two distributions. If $\sum_{i=1}^{m}  {(\sqrt{α_i} - \sqrt{β_i})}^2 >2$, then the community detection via maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is possible with high probability. If $\sum_{i=1}^m {(\sqrt{α_i} - \sqrt{β_i})}^2 < 2$, the probability that the ML estimator fails to detect the communities does not go to zero.
