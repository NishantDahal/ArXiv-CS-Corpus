Technical Problems With "Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm"

Rubenstein et al. present an interesting system of programmable self-assembled structure formation using 1000 Kilobot robots. The paper claims to advance work in artificial swarms similar to capabilities of natural systems besides being highly robust. However, the system lacks in terms of matching motility and complex shapes with holes, thereby limiting practical similarity to self-assembly in living systems.
