On Rivest-Vuillemin Conjecture for Fourteen Variables

A boolean function $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ is \textit{weakly symmetric} if it is invariant under a transitive permutation group on its variables. A boolean function $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ is \textit{elusive} if we have to check all $x_1$,..., $x_n$ to determine the output of $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ in the worst-case. It is conjectured that every nontrivial monotone weakly symmetric boolean function is elusive, which has been open for a long time. In this paper, we report that this conjecture is true for $n=14$.
