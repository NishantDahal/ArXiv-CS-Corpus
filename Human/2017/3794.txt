Home-Box based collaborative caching strategy: An asset for Content Delivery Networks

-- Within the Future Internet, a new trend is foreseen with the creation of overlay networks composed of residential gateways (i.e. Home-Box), leveraging their storage and upload capacity in order to achieve scalable and cost-efficient content distribution. In this paper, we highlight an architecture of such a home-box overlay for Video On Demand (VOD) services, in cooperation with a network-aware request redirection and content caching strategy that optimize the resource usage at both network and client side to reduce the overall distribution cost. The proposed system is compared to existing solutions through comprehensive simulations. The results demonstrate the strong advantage of introducing such a network-aware and popularity-based caching strategy in terms of cost reduction for VOD services, especially for Content Delivery Networks.
