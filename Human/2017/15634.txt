Software-Defined Robotics -- Idea & Approach

The methodology of Software-Defined Robotics hierarchical-based and stand-alone framework can be designed and implemented to program and control different sets of robots, regardless of their manufacturers' parameters and specifications, with unified commands and communications. This framework approach will increase the capability of (re)programming a specific group of robots during the runtime without affecting the others as desired in the critical missions and industrial operations, expand the shared bandwidth, enhance the reusability of code, leverage the computational processing power, decrease the unnecessary analyses of vast supplemental electrical components for each robot, as well as get advantages of the most state-of-the-art industrial trends in the cloud-based computing, Virtual Machines (VM), and Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) technologies.
