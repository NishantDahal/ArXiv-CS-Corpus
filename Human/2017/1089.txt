Metric Temporal Logic for Ontology-Based Data Access over Log Data

We present a new metric temporal logic HornMTL over dense time and its datalog extension datalogMTL. The use of datalogMTL is demonstrated in the context of ontology-based data access over meteorological data. We show decidability of answering ontology-mediated queries for a practically relevant non-recursive fragment of datalogMTL. Finally, we discuss directions of the future work, including the potential use-cases in analyzing log data of engines and devices.
