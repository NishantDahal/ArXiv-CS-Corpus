Sign Language Recognition Using Temporal Classification

Devices like the Myo armband available in the market today enable us to collect data about the position of a user's hands and fingers over time. We can use these technologies for sign language translation since each sign is roughly a combination of gestures across time. In this work, we utilize a dataset collected by a group at the University of South Wales, which contains parameters, such as hand position, hand rotation, and finger bend, for 95 unique signs. For each input stream representing a sign, we predict which sign class this stream falls into. We begin by implementing baseline SVM and logistic regression models, which perform reasonably well on high quality data. Lower quality data requires a more sophisticated approach, so we explore different methods in temporal classification, including long short term memory architectures and sequential pattern mining methods.
