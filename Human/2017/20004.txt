A Note on Parallel Asynchronous Channels with Arbitrary Skews

A zero-error coding scheme of asymptotic rate $ \log_2 (1+\sqrt{5}) - 1 $ was recently described for a communication channel composed of parallel asynchronous lines satisfying the so-called no switch assumption. We prove that this is in fact the highest rate attainable, i.e., the zero-error capacity of this channel.
