Scalable linear solvers for sparse linear systems from large-scale numerical simulations

This paper presents our work on designing scalable linear solvers for large-scale reservoir simulations. The main objective is to support implementation of parallel reservoir simulators on distributed-memory parallel systems, where MPI (Message Passing Interface) is employed for communications among computation nodes. Distributed matrix and vector modules are designed, which are the base of our parallel linear systems. Commonly-used Krylov subspace linear solvers are implemented, including the restarted GMRES method, the LGMRES method, and the BiCGSTAB method. It also has an interface to a parallel algebraic multigrid solver, BoomerAMG from HYPRE. Parallel general-purpose preconditioners and special preconditioners for reservoir simulations are also developed. The numerical experiments show that our linear solvers have excellent scalability using thousands of CPU cores.
