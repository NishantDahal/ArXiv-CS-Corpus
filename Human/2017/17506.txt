A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm to Design LDPC Codes without Small Cycles in Communication Systems

In a digital communication system, information is sent from one place to another over a noisy communication channel using binary symbols (bits). Original information is encoded by adding redundant bits, which are then used by low--density parity--check (LDPC) codes to detect and correct errors that may have been introduced during transmission. Error correction capability of an LDPC code is severely degraded due to harmful structures such as small cycles in its bipartite graph representation known as Tanner graph (TG). We introduce an integer programming formulation to generate a TG for a given smallest cycle length. We propose a branch-and-cut algorithm for its solution and investigate structural properties of the problem to derive valid inequalities and variable fixing rules. We introduce a heuristic to obtain feasible solutions of the problem. Our computational experiments show that our algorithm can generate LDPC codes without small cycles in acceptable amount of time for practically relevant code lengths.
