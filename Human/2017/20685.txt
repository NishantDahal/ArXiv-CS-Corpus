NeuroTrainer: An Intelligent Memory Module for Deep Learning Training

This paper presents, NeuroTrainer, an intelligent memory module with in-memory accelerators that forms the building block of a scalable architecture for energy efficient training for deep neural networks. The proposed architecture is based on integration of a homogeneous computing substrate composed of multiple processing engines in the logic layer of a 3D memory module. NeuroTrainer utilizes a programmable data flow based execution model to optimize memory mapping and data re-use during different phases of training operation. A programming model and supporting architecture utilizes the flexible data flow to efficiently accelerate training of various types of DNNs. The cycle level simulation and synthesized design in 15nm FinFET showspower efficiency of 500 GFLOPS/W, and almost similar throughput for a wide range of DNNs including convolutional, recurrent, multi-layer-perceptron, and mixed (CNN+RNN) networks
