Smart Wireless Communication is the Cornerstone of Smart Infrastructures

Emerging smart infrastructures, such as Smart City, Smart Grid, Smart Health, and Smart Transportation, need smart wireless connectivity. However, the requirements of these smart infrastructures cannot be met with today's wireless networks. A new wireless infrastructure is needed to meet unprecedented needs in terms of agility, reliability, security, scalability, and partnerships.
  We are at the beginning of a revolution in how we live with technology, resulting from a convergence of machine learning (ML), the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and robotics. A smart infrastructure monitors and processes a vast amount of data, collected from a dense and wide distribution of heterogeneous sensors (e.g., the IoT), as well as from web applications like social media. In real time, using machine learning, patterns and relationships in the data over space, time, and application can be detected and predictions can be made; on the basis of these, resources can be managed, decisions can be made, and devices can be actuated to optimize metrics, such as cost, health, safety, and convenience.
