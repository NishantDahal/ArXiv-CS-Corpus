Stochastic Assume-Guarantee Contracts for Cyber-Physical System Design Under Probabilistic Requirements

We develop an assume-guarantee contract framework for the design of cyber-physical systems, modeled as closed-loop control systems, under probabilistic requirements. We use a variant of signal temporal logic, namely, Stochastic Signal Temporal Logic (StSTL) to specify system behaviors as well as contract assumptions and guarantees, thus enabling automatic reasoning about requirements of stochastic systems. Given a stochastic linear system representation and a set of requirements captured by bounded StSTL contracts, we propose algorithms that can check contract compatibility, consistency, and refinement, and generate a controller to guarantee that a contract is satisfied, following a stochastic model predictive control approach. Our algorithms leverage encodings of the verification and control synthesis tasks into mixed integer optimization problems, and conservative approximations of probabilistic constraints that produce both sound and tractable problem formulations. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on a few examples, including the design of embedded controllers for aircraft power distribution networks.
