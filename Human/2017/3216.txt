Computing All Distinct Squares in Linear Time for Integer Alphabets

Given a string on an integer alphabet, we present an algorithm that computes the set of all distinct squares belonging to this string in time linear to the string length. As an application, we show how to compute the tree topology of the minimal augmented suffix tree in linear time. Asides from that, we elaborate an algorithm computing the longest previous table in a succinct representation using compressed working space.
