The leveled approach. Using and evaluating text mining tools AVResearcherXL and Texcavator for historical research on public perceptions of drugs

We introduce our explorative historical leveled approach that we use to understand drug debates in the Royal Dutch Library's digital newspaper archive. In this approach we alternate between distant reading and close reading. Furthermore, we use this approach to evaluate two text mining tools: AVResearcherXL and Texcavator.
