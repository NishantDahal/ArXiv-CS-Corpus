Connected Vehicular Transportation: Data Analytics and Traffic-dependent Networking

With onboard operating systems becoming increasingly common in vehicles, the real-time broadband infotainment and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) service applications in fast-motion vehicles become ever demanding, which are highly expected to significantly improve the efficiency and safety of our daily on-road lives. The emerging ITS and vehicular applications, e.g., trip planning, however, require substantial efforts on the real-time pervasive information collection and big data processing so as to provide quick decision making and feedbacks to the fast moving vehicles, which thus impose the significant challenges on the development of an efficient vehicular communication platform. In this article, we present TrasoNET, an integrated network framework to provide realtime intelligent transportation services to connected vehicles by exploring the data analytics and networking techniques. TrasoNET is built upon two key components. The first one guides vehicles to the appropriate access networks by exploring the information of realtime traffic status, specific user preferences, service applications and network conditions. The second component mainly involves a distributed automatic access engine, which enables individual vehicles to make distributed access decisions based on access recommender, local observation and historic information. We showcase the application of TrasoNET in a case study on real-time traffic sensing based on real traces of taxis.
