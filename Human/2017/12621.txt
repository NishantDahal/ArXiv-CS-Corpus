Control and Data Flow Execution of Java Programs

Since decade understanding of programs has become a compulsory task for the students as well as for others who are involved in the process of developing software and providing solutions to open problems. In that aspect showing the problem in a pictorial presentation in a best manner is a key advantage to better understand it. We provide model and structure for Java programs to understand the control and data flow analysis of execution. Especially it helps to understand the static analysis of Java programs, which is an uttermost important phase for software maintenance. We provided information and model for visualization of Java programs that may help better understanding of programs for a learning and analysis purpose. The idea provided for building visualization tool is extracting data and control analysis from execution of Java programs. We presented case studies to prove that our idea is most important for better understanding of Java programs which may help towards static analysis, software debugging and software maintenance.
