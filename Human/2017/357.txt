On the Robustness of Coordinated Beamforming to Uncoordinated Interference and CSI Uncertainty

As network deployments become denser, interference arises as a dominant performance degradation factor. To confront with this trend, Long Term Evolution (LTE) incorporated features aiming at enabling cooperation among different base stations, a technique termed as Coordinated Multi Point (CoMP). Recent field trial results and theoretical studies of the performance of CoMP schemes revealed, however, that their gains are not as high as initially expected, despite their large coordination overhead. In this paper, we review recent advanced Coordinated Beamforming (CB) schemes, a special family of CoMP that reduces the coordination overhead through a joint choice of transmit and receive linear filters. We focus on assessing their resilience to uncoordinated interference and Channel State Information (CSI) imperfections, which both severely limit the performance gains of all CoMP schemes. We present a simple yet encompassing system model that aims at incorporating different parameters of interest in the relative interference power and CSI errors, and then utilize it for the performance evaluation of the state-of-the-art in CB schemes. It is shown that blindly applying CB in all system scenarios can indeed be counter-productive.
