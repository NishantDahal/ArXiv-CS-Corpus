Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in mmWave-Enabled Massive MIMO Networks

Ultra-reliability and low-latency are two key components in 5G networks. In this letter, we investigate the problem of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) in millimeter wave (mmWave)-enabled massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. The problem is cast as a network utility maximization subject to probabilistic latency and reliability constraints. To solve this problem, we resort to the Lyapunov technique whereby a utility-delay control approach is proposed, which adapts to channel variations and queue dynamics. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed approach ensures reliable communication with a guaranteed probability of 99.99%, and reduces latency by 28.41% and 77.11% as compared to baselines with and without probabilistic latency constraints, respectively.
