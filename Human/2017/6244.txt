Fast systematic encoding of multiplicity codes

We present quasi-linear time systematic encoding algorithms for multiplicity codes. The algorithms have their origins in the fast multivariate interpolation and evaluation algorithms of van der Hoeven and Schost (2013), which we generalise to address certain Hermite-type interpolation and evaluation problems. By providing fast encoding algorithms for multiplicity codes, we remove an obstruction on the road to the practical application of the private information retrieval protocol of Augot, Levy-dit-Vehel and Shikfa (2014).
