Online Circle and Sphere Packing

In this paper we consider the Online Bin Packing Problem in three variants: Circles in Squares, Circles in Isosceles Right Triangles, and Spheres in Cubes. The two first ones receive an online sequence of circles (items) of different radii while the third one receive an online sequence of spheres (items) of different radii, and they want to pack the items into the minimum number of unit squares, isosceles right triangles of leg length one, and unit cubes, respectively. For Online Circle Packing in Squares, we improve the previous best-known competitive ratio for the bounded space version, when at most a constant number of bins can be open at any given time, from 2.439 to 2.3536. For Online Circle Packing in Isosceles Right Triangles and Online Sphere Packing in Cubes we show bounded space algorithms of asymptotic competitive ratios 2.5490 and 3.5316, respectively, as well as lower bounds of 2.1193 and 2.7707 on the competitive ratio of any online bounded space algorithm for these two problems. We also considered the online unbounded space variant of these three problems which admits a small reorganization of the items inside the bin after their packing, and we present algorithms of competitive ratios 2.3105, 2.5094, and 3.5146 for Circles in Squares, Circles in Isosceles Right Triangles, and Spheres in Cubes, respectively.
