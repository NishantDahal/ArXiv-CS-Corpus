On self-dual four circulant codes

Four circulant codes form a special class of $2$-generator, index $4$, quasi-cyclic codes. Under some conditions on their generator matrices they can be shown to be self-dual. Artin primitive root conjecture shows the existence of an infinite subclass of these codes satisfying a modified Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
