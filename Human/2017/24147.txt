TFDASH: A Fairness, Stability, and Efficiency Aware Rate Control Approach for Multiple Clients over DASH

Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) has recently been widely deployed in the Internet and adopted in the industry. It, however, does not impose any adaptation logic for selecting the quality of video fragments requested by clients and suffers from lackluster performance with respect to a number of desirable properties: efficiency, stability, and fairness when multiple players compete for a bottleneck link. In this paper, we propose a throughput-friendly DASH (TFDASH) rate control scheme for video streaming with multiple clients over DASH to well balance the trade-offs among efficiency, stability, and fairness. The core idea behind guaranteeing fairness and high efficiency (bandwidth utilization) is to avoid OFF periods during the downloading process for all clients, i.e., the bandwidth is in perfect-subscription or over-subscription with bandwidth utilization approach to 100\%. We also propose a dual-threshold buffer model to solve the instability problem caused by the above idea. As a result, by integrating these novel components, we also propose a probability-driven rate adaption logic taking into account several key factors that most influence visual quality, including buffer occupancy, video playback quality, video bit-rate switching frequency and amplitude, to guarantee high-quality video streaming. Our experiments evidently demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.
