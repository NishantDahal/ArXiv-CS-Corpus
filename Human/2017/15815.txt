Interstitial Content Detection

Interstitial content is online content which grays out, or otherwise obscures the main page content. In this technical report, we discuss exploratory research into detecting the presence of interstitial content in web pages. We discuss the use of computer vision techniques to detect interstitials, and the potential use of these techniques to provide a labelled dataset for machine learning.
