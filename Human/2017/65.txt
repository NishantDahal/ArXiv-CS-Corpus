Variable-Length Resolvability for General Sources and Channels

We introduce the problem of variable-length source resolvability, where a given target probability distribution is approximated by encoding a variable-length uniform random number, and the asymptotically minimum average length rate of the uniform random numbers, called the (variable-length) resolvability, is investigated. We first analyze the variable-length resolvability with the variational distance as an approximation measure. Next, we investigate the case under the divergence as an approximation measure. When the asymptotically exact approximation is required, it is shown that the resolvability under the two kinds of approximation measures coincides. We then extend the analysis to the case of channel resolvability, where the target distribution is the output distribution via a general channel due to the fixed general source as an input. The obtained characterization of the channel resolvability is fully general in the sense that when the channel is just the identity mapping, the characterization reduces to the general formula for the source resolvability. We also analyze the second-order variable-length resolvability.
