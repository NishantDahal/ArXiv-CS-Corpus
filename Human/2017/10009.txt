New quantum mds constacylÄ±c codes

This paper is devoted to the study of the construction of new quantum MDS codes. Based on constacyclic codes over Fq2 , we derive four new families of quantum MDS codes, one of which is an explicit generalization of the construction given in Theorem 7 in [22]. We also extend the result of Theorem 3:3 given in [17].
