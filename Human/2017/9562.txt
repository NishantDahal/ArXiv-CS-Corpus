Pixel Normalization from Numeric Data as Input to Neural Networks

Text to image transformation for input to neural networks requires intermediate steps. This paper attempts to present a new approach to pixel normalization so as to convert textual data into image, suitable as input for neural networks. This method can be further improved by its Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) implementation to provide significant speedup in computational time.
