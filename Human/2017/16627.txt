Reframing Societal Discourse as Requirements Negotiation: Vision Statement

Challenges in spatial planning include adjusting settlement patterns to increasing or shrinking populations; it also includes organizing food delivery in rural and peripheral environments. Discourse typically starts with an open problem and the search for a holistic and innovative solution. Software will often be needed to implement the innovation. Spatial planning problems are characterized by large and heterogeneous groups of stakeholders, such as municipalities, companies, interest groups, citizens, women and men, young people and children. Current techniques for participation are slow, laborious and costly, and they tend to miss out on many stakeholders or interest groups. We propose a triple shift in perspective: (1) Discourse is reframed as a requirements process with the explicit goal to state software, hardware, and organizational requirements. (2) Due to the above-mentioned characteristics of spatial planning problems, we suggest using techniques of requirements engineering (RE) and CrowdRE for getting stakeholders (e.g. user groups) involved. (3) We propose video as a medium for communicating problems, solution alternatives, and arguments effectively within a mixed crowd of officials, citizens, children and elderly people. Although few spatial planning problems can be solved by software alone, this new perspective helps to focus discussions anyway. RE techniques can assist in finding common ground despite the heterogeneous group of stakeholders, e.g. citizens. Digital requirements and video are well-suited for facilitating distribution, feedback, and discourse via the internet. In this paper, we propose this new perspective as a timely opportunity for the spatial planning domain - and as an increasingly important application domain of CrowdRE.
