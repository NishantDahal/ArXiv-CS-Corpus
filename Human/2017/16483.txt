Solving and Sampling with Many Solutions: Satisfiability and Other Hard Problems

We investigate parameterizing hard combinatorial problems by the size of the solution set compared to all solution candidates. Our main result is a uniform sampling algorithm for satisfying assignments of 2-CNF formulas that runs in expected time $O^*(\varepsilon^{-0.617})$ where $\varepsilon$ is the fraction of assignments that are satisfying. This improves significantly over the trivial sampling bound of expected $Θ^*(\varepsilon^{-1})$, and on all previous algorithms whenever $\varepsilon = Ω(0.708^n)$. We also consider algorithms for 3-SAT with an $\varepsilon$ fraction of satisfying assignments, and prove that it can be solved in $O^*(\varepsilon^{-2.27})$ deterministic time, and in $O^*(\varepsilon^{-0.936})$ randomized time. Finally, to further demonstrate the applicability of this framework, we also explore how similar techniques can be used for vertex cover problems.
