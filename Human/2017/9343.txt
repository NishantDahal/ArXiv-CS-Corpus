Low-Complexity Decoding for Symmetric, Neighboring and Consecutive Side-information Index Coding Problems

The capacity of symmetric, neighboring and consecutive side-information single unicast index coding problems (SNC-SUICP) with number of messages equal to the number of receivers was given by Maleki, Cadambe and Jafar. For these index coding problems, an optimal index code construction by using Vandermonde matrices was proposed. This construction requires all the side-information at the receivers to decode their wanted messages and also requires large field size. In an earlier work, we constructed binary matrices of size $m \times n (m\geq n)$ such that any $n$ adjacent rows of the matrix are linearly independent over every field. Calling these matrices as Adjacent Independent Row (AIR) matrices using which we gave an optimal scalar linear index code for the one-sided SNC-SUICP for any given number of messages and one-sided side-information. By using Vandermonde matrices or AIR matrices, every receiver needs to solve $K-D$ equations with $K-D$ unknowns to obtain its wanted message, where $K$ is the number of messages and $D$ is the size of the side-information. In this paper, we analyze some of the combinatorial properties of the AIR matrices. By using these properties, we present a low-complexity decoding which helps to identify a reduced set of side-information for each users with which the decoding can be carried out. By this method every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols). We explicitly give both the reduced set of side-information and the broadcast messages to be used by each receiver to decode its wanted message. For a given pair or receivers our decoding identifies which one will perform better than the other when the broadcast channel is noisy.
