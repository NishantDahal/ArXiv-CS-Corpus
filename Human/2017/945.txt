Design and Implementation of a Wireless OBD II Fleet Management System

This paper describes the work that has been done in the design and development of a wireless OBD II fleet management system. The system aims to measure speed, distance and fuel consumption of vehicles for tracking and analysis purposes. An OBD II reader is designed to measure speed and mass air flow, from which distance and fuel consumption are also computed. This data is then transmitted via WiFi to a remote server. The system also implements GPS tracking to determine the location of the vehicle. A database management system is implemented at the remote server for the storage and management of transmitted data and a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for analysing the transmitted data . Various qualification tests are conducted to verify the functionality of the system. The results demonstrate that the system is capable of reading the various parameters, and can successfully process, transmit and display the readings.
