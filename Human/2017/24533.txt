Engagement in Foundational Computer Science Courses Through Supplementary Content for Algorithms

Engaging students in teaching foundational Computer Science concepts is vital for the student's continual success in more advanced topics in the field. An idea of a series of Jupyter notebooks was conceived as a way of using Bloom's Taxonomy to reinforce concepts taught in an introductory algorithms class. The idea of the notebook is to keep the student's engaged in the lesson and in turn motivate them to persevere through the end of the course.
