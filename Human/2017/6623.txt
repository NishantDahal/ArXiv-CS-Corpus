Energy Efficient Adaptive Network Coding Schemes for Satellite Communications

In this paper, we propose novel energy efficient adaptive network coding and modulation schemes for time variant channels. We evaluate such schemes under a realistic channel model for open area environments and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites. Compared to non-adaptive network coding and adaptive rate efficient network-coded schemes for time variant channels, we show that our proposed schemes, through physical layer awareness can be designed to transmit only if a target quality of service (QoS) is achieved. As a result, such schemes can provide remarkable energy savings.
