Whale Optimization Based Energy-Efficient Cluster Head Selection Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of many individual sensors that are deployed in the area of interest. These sensor nodes have major energy constraints as they are small and their battery can't be replaced. They collaborate together in order to gather, transmit and forward the sensed data to the base station. Consequently, data transmission is one of the biggest reasons for energy depletion in WSN. Clustering is one of the most effective techniques for energy efficient data transmission in WSN. In this paper, an energy efficient cluster head selection algorithm which is based on Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) called WOA-Clustering (WOA-C) is proposed. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm helps in selection of energy aware cluster heads based on a fitness function which considers the residual energy of the node and the sum of energy of adjacent nodes. The proposed algorithm is evaluated for network lifetime, energy efficiency, throughput and overall stability. Furthermore, the performance of WOA-C is evaluated against other standard contemporary routing protocols such as LEACH. Extensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of residual energy, network lifetime and longer stability period.
