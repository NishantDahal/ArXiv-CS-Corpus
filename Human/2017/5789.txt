Approximation Algorithm for Minimum Weight Connected $m$-Fold Dominating Set

Using connected dominating set (CDS) to serve as a virtual backbone in a wireless networks can save energy and reduce interference. Since nodes may fail due to accidental damage or energy depletion, it is desirable that the virtual backbone has some fault-tolerance. A $k$-connected $m$-fold dominating set ($(k,m)$-CDS) of a graph $G$ is a node set $D$ such that every node in $V\setminus D$ has at least $m$ neighbors in $D$ and the subgraph of $G$ induced by $D$ is $k$-connected. Using $(k,m)$-CDS can tolerate the failure of $\min\{k-1,m-1\}$ nodes. In this paper, we study Minimum Weight $(1,m)$-CDS problem ($(1,m)$-MWCDS), and present an $(H(δ+m)+2H(δ-1))$-approximation algorithm, where $δ$ is the maximum degree of the graph and $H(\cdot)$ is the Harmonic number. Notice that there is a $1.35\ln n$-approximation algorithm for the $(1,1)$-MWCDS problem, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Though our constant in $O(\ln \cdot)$ is larger than 1.35, $n$ is replaced by $δ$. Such a replacement enables us to obtain a $(6.67+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the $(1,m)$-MWCDS problem on unit disk graphs.
