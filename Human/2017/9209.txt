Performance of SWIPT-based Differential Amplify-and-Forward Relaying with Direct Link

A novel asymptotic closed-form probability density function (pdf) of the two-hop (TH) link is derived for a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer based differential amplify-and-forward system. Based on the pdf, asymptotic closed-form average bit-error rate expressions of the single TH link and the TH link with direct link combined with a linear combining scheme are both derived. Monte Carlo simulations verify the analytical expressions.
