Robust and Low-Rank Representation for Fast Face Identification with Occlusions

In this paper we propose an iterative method to address the face identification problem with block occlusions. Our approach utilizes a robust representation based on two characteristics in order to model contiguous errors (e.g., block occlusion) effectively. The first fits to the errors a distribution described by a tailored loss function. The second describes the error image as having a specific structure (resulting in low-rank in comparison to image size). We will show that this joint characterization is effective for describing errors with spatial continuity. Our approach is computationally efficient due to the utilization of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). A special case of our fast iterative algorithm leads to the robust representation method which is normally used to handle non-contiguous errors (e.g., pixel corruption). Extensive results on representative face databases (in constrained and unconstrained environments) document the effectiveness of our method over existing robust representation methods with respect to both identification rates and computational time.
