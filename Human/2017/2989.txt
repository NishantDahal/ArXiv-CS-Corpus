Machines and Algorithms

I discuss the evolution of computer architectures with a focus on QCD and with reference to the interplay between architecture, engineering, data motion and algorithms. New architectures are discussed and recent performance results are displayed. I also review recent progress in multilevel solver and integation algorithms.
