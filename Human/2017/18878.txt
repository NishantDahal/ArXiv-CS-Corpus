Queueing systems with renovation vs. queues with RED. Supplementary Material

In this note we consider M/D/1/N queue with renovation and derive analytic expressions for the following performance characteristics: stationary loss rate, moments of the number in the system. Moments of consecutive losses, waiting/sojourn time are out of scope. The motivation for studying these characteristics is in the comparison of renovation with known active queue mechanisms like RED.
