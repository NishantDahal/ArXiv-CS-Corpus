Experimental Demonstration of Dual Polarization Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexed Optical Transmission System

Multi-eigenvalues transmission with information encoded simultaneously in both orthogonal polarizations is experimentally demonstrated. Performance below the HD-FEC limit is demonstrated for 8-bits/symbol 1-GBd signals after transmission up to 207 km of SSMF.
