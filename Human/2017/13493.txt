Characterizing User-to-User Connectivity with RIPE Atlas

Characterizing the interconnectivity of networks at a country level is an interesting but non-trivial task. The IXP Country Jedi is an existing prototype that uses RIPE Atlas probes in order to explore interconnectivity at a country level, taking into account all Autonomous Systems (AS) where RIPE Atlas probes are deployed. In this work, we build upon this basis and specifically focus on "eyeball" networks, i.e. the user-facing networks with the largest user populations in any given country, and explore to what extent we can provide insights on their interconnectivity. In particular, with a focused user-to-user (and/or user-to-content) version of the IXP Country Jedi we work towards meaningful statistics and comparisons between countries/economies. This is something that a general-purpose probe-to-probe version is not able to capture. We present our preliminary work on the estimation of RIPE Atlas coverage in eyeball networks, as well as an approach to measure and visualize user interconnectivity with our Eyeball Jedi tool.
