A Graph Framework for Multimodal Medical Information Processing

Multimodal medical information processing is currently the epicenter of intense interdisciplinary research, as proper data fusion may lead to more accurate diagnoses. Moreover, multimodality may disambiguate cases of co-morbidity. This paper presents a framework for retrieving, analyzing, and storing medical information as a multilayer graph, an abstract format suitable for data fusion and further processing. At the same time, this paper addresses the need for reliable medical information through co-author graph ranking. A use case pertaining to frailty based on Python and Neo4j serves as an illustration of the proposed framework.
