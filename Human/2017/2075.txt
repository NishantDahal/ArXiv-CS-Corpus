Experiment, Modeling, and Analysis of Wireless-Powered Sensor Network for Energy Neutral Power Management

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive system model of a wireless-powered sensor network (WPSN) based on experimental results on a real-life testbed. In the WPSN, a sensor node is wirelessly powered by the RF energy transfer from a dedicated RF power source. We define the behavior of each component comprising the WPSN and analyze the interaction between these components to set up a realistic WPSN model from the systematic point of view. Towards this, we implement a real-life and full-fledged testbed for the WPSN and conduct extensive experiments to obtain model parameters and to validate the proposed model. Based on this WPSN model, we propose an energy management scheme for the WPSN, which maximizes RF energy transfer efficiency while guaranteeing energy neutral operation. We implement the proposed energy management scheme in a real testbed and show its operation and performance.
