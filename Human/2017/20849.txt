Tropicalization, symmetric polynomials, and complexity

D. Grigoriev-G. Koshevoy recently proved that tropical Schur polynomials have (at worst) polynomial tropical semiring complexity. They also conjectured tropical skew Schur polynomials have at least exponential complexity; we establish a polynomial complexity upper bound. Our proof uses results about (stable) Schubert polynomials, due to R. P. Stanley and S. Billey-W. Jockusch-R. P. Stanley, together with a sufficient condition for polynomial complexity that is connected to the saturated Newton polytope property.
