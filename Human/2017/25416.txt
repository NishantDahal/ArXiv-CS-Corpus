On some Graphs with a Unique Perfect Matching

We show that deciding whether a given graph $G$ of size $m$ has a unique perfect matching as well as finding that matching, if it exists, can be done in time $O(m)$ if $G$ is either a cograph, or a split graph, or an interval graph, or claw-free. Furthermore, we provide a constructive characterization of the claw-free graphs with a unique perfect matching.
