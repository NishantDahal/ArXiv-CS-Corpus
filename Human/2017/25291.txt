Queueing Analysis for Block Fading Rayleigh Channels in the Low SNR Regime

Wireless fading channels suffer from both channel fadings and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). As a result, it is impossible for fading channels to support a constant rate data stream without using buffers. In this paper, we consider information transmission over an infinite-buffer-aided block Rayleigh fading channel in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We characterize the transmission capability of the channel in terms of stationary queue length distribution, packet delay, as well as data rate. Based on the memoryless property of the service provided by the channel in each block, we formulate the transmission process as a discrete time discrete state $D/G/1$ queueing problem. The obtained results provide a full characterization of block Rayleigh fading channels and can be extended to the finite-buffer-aided transmissions.
