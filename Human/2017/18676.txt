Method to Detect Eye Position Noise from Video-Oculography when Detection of Pupil or Corneal Reflection Position Fails

We present software to detect noise in eye position signals from video-based eye-tracking systems that depend on accurate pupil and corneal reflection position estimation. When such systems transiently fail to properly detect the pupil or the corneal reflection due to occlusion from eyelids, eye lashes or various shadows, the estimated gaze position is false. This produces an artifactual signal in the position trace that is rapidly, irregularly oscillating between true and false gaze positions. We refer to this noise as RIONEPS (Rapid Irregularly Oscillating Noise of the Eye Position Signal). Our method for detecting these periods automatically is based on an estimate of the relative inefficiency of the eye position signal. We look for RIONEPS in the horizontal and vertical traces separately, and although we typically use it offline, it is suitable to adaptation for real time use. This method requires a threshold to be set, and although we provide some guidance, thresholds will have to be estimated empirically.
