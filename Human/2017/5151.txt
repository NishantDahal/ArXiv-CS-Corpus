Memristor nanodevice for unconventional computing:review and applications

A memristor is a two-terminal nanodevice that its properties attract a wide community of researchers from various domains such as physics, chemistry, electronics, computer and neuroscience.The simple structure for manufacturing, small scalability, nonvolatility and potential of using inlow power platforms are outstanding characteristics of this emerging nanodevice. In this report,we review a brief literature of memristor from mathematic model to the physical realization. Wediscuss different classes of memristors based on the material used for its manufacturing. Thepotential applications of memristor are presented and a wide domain of applications are explainedand classified.
