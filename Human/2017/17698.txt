A Methodology for the Selection of Requirement Elicitation Techniques

In this paper, we present an approach to select a subset of requirement elicitation technique for an optimum result in the requirement elicitation process. Our approach consists of three steps. First, we identify various attribute in three important dimensions namely project, people and the process of software development that can influence the outcome of an elicitation process. Second, we construct three p matrix (3PM) separately for each dimension, that shows a relation between the elicitation techniques and three dimensions of a software. Third, we provide a mapping criteria and use them in the selection of a subset of elicitation techniques. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using case studies to evaluate and provide the contextual knowledge of selecting requirement elicitation technique.
