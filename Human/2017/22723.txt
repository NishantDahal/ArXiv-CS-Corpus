Reconstruction of the External Stimuli from Brain Signals

Despite the rapid advances in Brain-computer Interfacing (BCI) and continuous effort to improve the accuracy of brain decoding systems, the urge for the systems to reconstruct the experiences of the users has been widely acknowledged. This urge has been investigated by some researchers during the past years in terms of reconstruction of the naturalistic images, abstract images, video and audio. In this study, we try to tackle this issue by regressing the stimuli spectrogram using the spectrogram analysis of the brain signals. The results of our regression-based method suggest the feasibility of such reconstructions using the neuroimaging techniques that are appropriate for out-of-lab scenarios.
