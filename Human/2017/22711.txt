Superpixels Based Segmentation and SVM Based Classification Method to Distinguish Five Diseases from Normal Regions in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy

Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is relatively a new technology to examine the entire GI trace. During an examination, it captures more than 55,000 frames. Reviewing all these images is time-consuming and prone to human error. It has been a challenge to develop intelligent methods assisting physicians to review the frames. The WCE frames are captured in 8-bit color depths which provides enough a color range to detect abnormalities. Here, superpixel based methods are proposed to segment five diseases including: bleeding, Crohn's disease, Lymphangiectasia, Xanthoma, and Lymphoid hyperplasia. Two superpixels methods are compared to provide semantic segmentation of these prolific diseases: simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and quick shift (QS). The segmented superpixels were classified into two classes (normal and abnormal) by support vector machine (SVM) using texture and color features. For both superpixel methods, the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision (SLIC, QS) were around 92%, 93%, 93%, and 88%, respectively. However, SLIC was dramatically faster than QS.
