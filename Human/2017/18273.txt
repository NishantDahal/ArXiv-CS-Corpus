Secrecy-Optimized Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communication Underlaying Heterogeneous Networks

Device-to-device (D2D) communications recently have attracted much attention for its potential capability to improve spectral efficiency underlaying the existing heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Due to no sophisticated control, D2D user equipments (DUEs) themselves cannot resist eavesdropping or security attacks. It is urgent to maximize the secure capacity for both cellular users and DUEs. This paper formulates the radio resource allocation problem to maximize the secure capacity of DUEs for the D2D communication underlaying HetNets which consist of high power nodes and low power nodes. The optimization objective function with transmit bit rate and power constraints, which is non-convex and hard to be directly derived, is firstly transformed into matrix form. Then the equivalent convex form of the optimization problem is derived according to the Perron-Frobenius theory. A heuristic iterative algorithm based on the proximal theory is proposed to solve this equivalent convex problem through evaluating the proximal operator of Lagrange function. Numerical results show that the proposed radio resource allocation solution significantly improves the secure capacity with a fast convergence speed.
