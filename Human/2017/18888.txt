A Statistical Approach to Increase Classification Accuracy in Supervised Learning Algorithms

Probabilistic mixture models have been widely used for different machine learning and pattern recognition tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification. In this paper, we focus on trying to solve the most common challenges related to supervised learning algorithms by using mixture probability distribution functions. With this modeling strategy, we identify sub-labels and generate synthetic data in order to reach better classification accuracy. It means we focus on increasing the training data synthetically to increase the classification accuracy.
