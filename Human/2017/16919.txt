Rényi entropy power inequality and a reverse

This paper is twofold. In the first part, we present a refinement of the Rényi Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) recently obtained in \cite{BM16}. The proof largely follows the approach in \cite{DCT91} of employing Young's convolution inequalities with sharp constants. In the second part, we study the reversibility of the Rényi EPI, and confirm a conjecture in \cite{BNT15, MMX16} in two cases. Connections with various $p$-th mean bodies in convex geometry are also explored.
