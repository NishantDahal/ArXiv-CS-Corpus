Interference Modeling in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey

One of the fundamental elements impacting the performance of a wireless system is interference, which has been a long-term issue in wireless networks. In the case of cognitive radio (CR) networks, the problem of interference is tremendously crucial. In other words, CR keeps the important promise of not producing any harmful interference to the primary user (PU) system. Thus, it is essential to investigate the impact of interference caused to the PUs so that its detrimental effect on the performance of the PU system performance is reduced. Study of cognitive interference generally includes developing a model to statistically demonstrate the power of cognitive interference at the PUs, which then can be utilized to examine different performance measures. Having inspected the different models for channel interference present in the literature, it can be obviously seen that interference models have been gradually evolved in terms of complication and sophistication. Although numerous papers can be found in the literature that have investigated different models for interference, to the best of our knowledge, very few publications are available that provide a review of all models and their comparisons. This paper is a collection of state-of-the-art in interference modeling which overviews and compares different models in the literature to provide the valuable insights for researchers when modeling the interference in a specific scenario.
