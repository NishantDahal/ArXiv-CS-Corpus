Topological Analysis and Synthesis of Structures related to Certain Classes of K-Geodetic Computer Networks

A fundamental characteristic of computer networks is their topological structure. The question of the description of the structural characteristics of computer networks represents a problem that is not completely solved. Search methods for structures of computer networks, for which the values of the selected parameters of their operation quality are extreme, have not been completely developed. The construction of computer networks with optimum indices of their operation quality is reduced to the solution of discrete optimization problems over graphs. This paper describes in detail the advantages of the practical use of k-geodetic graphs [2, 3] in the topological design of computer networks as an alternative for the solution of the fundamental problems mentioned above which, we believe, are still open. Also, the topological analysis and synthesis of some classes of these networks have been performed.
