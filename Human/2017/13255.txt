Energy-dissipation Limits in Variance-based Computing

Variance-based logic (VBL) uses the fluctuations or the variance in the state of a particle or a physical quantity to represent different logic levels. In this letter we show that compared to the traditional bi-stable logic representation the variance-based representation can theoretically achieve a superior performance trade-off (in terms of energy dissipation and information capacity) when operating at fundamental limits imposed by thermal-noise. We show that for a bi-stable logic device the lower limit on energy dissipated per bit is 4.35KT/bit, whereas under similar operating conditions, a VBL device could achieve a lower limit of sub-KT/bit. These theoretical results are general enough to be applicable to different instantiations and variants of VBL ranging from digital processors based on energy-scavenging or to processors based on the emerging valleytronic devices.
