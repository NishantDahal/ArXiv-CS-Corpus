Verification of STAR-Vote and Evaluation of FDR and ProVerif

We present the first automated privacy analysis of STAR-Vote, a real world voting system design with sophisticated "end-to-end" cryptography, using FDR and ProVerif. We also evaluate the effectiveness of these tools. Despite the complexity of the voting system, we were able to verify that our abstracted formal model of STAR-Vote provides ballot-secrecy using both formal approaches. Notably, ProVerif is radically faster than FDR, making it more suitable for rapid iteration and refinement of the formal model.
