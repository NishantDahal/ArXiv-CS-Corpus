Sensor Network Based Collision-Free Navigation and Map Building for Mobile Robots

Safe robot navigation is a fundamental research field for autonomous robots including ground mobile robots and flying robots. The primary objective of a safe robot navigation algorithm is to guide an autonomous robot from its initial position to a target or along a desired path with obstacle avoidance. With the development of information technology and sensor technology, the implementations combining robotics with sensor network are focused on in the recent researches. One of the relevant implementations is the sensor network based robot navigation. Moreover, another important navigation problem of robotics is safe area search and map building. In this report, a global collision-free path planning algorithm for ground mobile robots in dynamic environments is presented firstly. Considering the advantages of sensor network, the presented path planning algorithm is developed to a sensor network based navigation algorithm for ground mobile robots. The 2D range finder sensor network is used in the presented method to detect static and dynamic obstacles. The sensor network can guide each ground mobile robot in the detected safe area to the target. Furthermore, the presented navigation algorithm is extended into 3D environments. With the measurements of the sensor network, any flying robot in the workspace is navigated by the presented algorithm from the initial position to the target. Moreover, in this report, another navigation problem, safe area search and map building for ground mobile robot, is studied and two algorithms are presented. In the first presented method, we consider a ground mobile robot equipped with a 2D range finder sensor searching a bounded 2D area without any collision and building a complete 2D map of the area. Furthermore, the first presented map building algorithm is extended to another algorithm for 3D map building.
