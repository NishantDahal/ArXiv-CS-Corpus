Text Mining Descriptions Of Dreams: aesthetic and clinical efforts

Dreams are highly valued in both Freudian psychoanalysis and less conservative clinical traditions. Text mining enables the extraction of meaning from writings in powerful and unexpected ways. In this work, we report methods, uses and results obtained by mining descriptions of dreams. The texts were collected as part of a course in Schizoanalysis (Clinical Psychology) from dozens of participants. They were subsequently mined using various techniques for the achievement of poems and summaries, which were then used in clinical sessions by means of music and declamation. The results were found aesthetically appealing and effective to engage the audience. The expansion of the corpus, mining methods and strategies for using the derivatives for art and therapy are considered for future work.
