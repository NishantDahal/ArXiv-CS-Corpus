Reliable Messaging to Millions of Users with MigratoryData

Web-based notification services are used by a large range of businesses to selectively distribute live updates to customers, following the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model. Typical deployments can involve millions of subscribers expecting ordering and delivery guarantees together with low latencies. Notification services must be vertically and horizontally scalable, and adopt replication to provide a reliable service. We report our experience building and operating MigratoryData, a highly-scalable notification service. We discuss the typical requirements of MigratoryData customers, and describe the architecture and design of the service, focusing on scalability and fault tolerance. Our evaluation demonstrates the ability of MigratoryData to handle millions of concurrent connections and support a reliable notification service despite server failures and network disconnections.
