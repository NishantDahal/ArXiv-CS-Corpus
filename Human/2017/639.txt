Some Results on Circuit Lower Bounds and Derandomization of Arthur-Merlin Problems

We prove a downward separation for $\mathsfΣ_2$-time classes. Specifically, we prove that if $Σ_2$E does not have polynomial size non-deterministic circuits, then $Σ_2$SubEXP does not have \textit{fixed} polynomial size non-deterministic circuits. To achieve this result, we use Santhanam's technique on augmented Arthur-Merlin protocols defined by Aydinlioğlu and van Melkebeek. We show that augmented Arthur-Merlin protocols with one bit of advice do not have fixed polynomial size non-deterministic circuits. We also prove a weak unconditional derandomization of a certain type of promise Arthur-Merlin protocols. Using Williams' easy hitting set technique, we show that $Σ_2$-promise AM problems can be decided in $Σ_2$SubEXP with $n^c$ advice, for some fixed constant $c$.
