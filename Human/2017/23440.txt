Language properties and Grammar of Parallel and Series Parallel Languages

In this paper we have defined the language theoretical properties of Parallel languages and series parallel languages. Parallel languages and Series parallel languages play vital roles in parallel processing and many applications in computer programming. We have defined regular expressions and context free grammar for parallel and series parallel languages based on sequential languages [2]. We have also discussed the recognizability of parallel and series parallel languages using regular expression and regular grammar.
