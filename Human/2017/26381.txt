Limitations on Variance-Reduction and Acceleration Schemes for Finite Sum Optimization

We study the conditions under which one is able to efficiently apply variance-reduction and acceleration schemes on finite sum optimization problems. First, we show that, perhaps surprisingly, the finite sum structure by itself, is not sufficient for obtaining a complexity bound of $\tilde{\cO}((n+L/μ)\ln(1/ε))$ for $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex individual functions - one must also know which individual function is being referred to by the oracle at each iteration. Next, we show that for a broad class of first-order and coordinate-descent finite sum algorithms (including, e.g., SDCA, SVRG, SAG), it is not possible to get an `accelerated' complexity bound of $\tilde{\cO}((n+\sqrt{n L/μ})\ln(1/ε))$, unless the strong convexity parameter is given explicitly. Lastly, we show that when this class of algorithms is used for minimizing $L$-smooth and convex finite sums, the optimal complexity bound is $\tilde{\cO}(n+L/ε)$, assuming that (on average) the same update rule is used in every iteration, and $\tilde{\cO}(n+\sqrt{nL/ε})$, otherwise.
