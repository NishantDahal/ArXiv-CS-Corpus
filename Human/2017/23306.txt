The VACCINE Framework for Building DLP Systems

Conventional Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) systems suffer from the following major drawback: Privacy policies that define what constitutes data leakage cannot be seamlessly defined and enforced across heterogeneous forms of communication. Administrators have the dual burden of: (1) manually self-interpreting policies from handbooks to specify rules (which is error-prone); (2) extracting relevant information flows from heterogeneous communication protocols and enforcing policies to determine which flows should be admissible. To address these issues, we present the Verifiable and ACtionable Contextual Integrity Norms Engine (VACCINE), a framework for building adaptable and modular DLP systems. VACCINE relies on (1) the theory of contextual integrity to provide an abstraction layer suitable for specifying reusable protocol-agnostic leakage prevention rules and (2) programming language techniques to check these rules against correctness properties and to enforce them faithfully within a DLP system implementation. We applied VACCINE to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and Enron Corporation privacy regulations. We show that by using contextual integrity in conjunction with verification techniques, we can effectively create reusable privacy rules with specific correctness guarantees, and check the integrity of information flows against these rules. Our experiments in emulated enterprise settings indicate that VACCINE improves over current DLP system design approaches and can be deployed in enterprises involving tens of thousands of actors.
