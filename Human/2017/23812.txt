Cooperative Network Synchronization: Asymptotic Analysis

Accurate clock synchronization is required for collaborative operations among nodes across wireless networks. Compared with traditional layer-by-layer methods, cooperative network synchronization techniques lead to significant improvement in performance, efficiency, and robustness. This paper develops a framework for the performance analysis of cooperative network synchronization. We introduce the concepts of cooperative dilution intensity (CDI) and relative CDI to characterize the interaction between agents, which can be interpreted as properties of a random walk over the network. Our approach enables us to derive closed-form asymptotic expressions of performance limits, relating them to the quality of observations as well as network topology.
