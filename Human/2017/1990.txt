On normalization of inconsistency indicators in pairwise comparisons

In this study, we provide mathematical and practice-driven justification for using $[0,1]$ normalization of inconsistency indicators in pairwise comparisons. The need for normalization, as well as problems with the lack of normalization, are presented. A new type of paradox of infinity is described.
