Covert Communication in Wireless Relay Networks

Covert communication aims to shield the very existence of wireless transmissions in order to guarantee a strong security in wireless networks. In this work, for the first time we examine the possibility and achievable performance of covert communication in one-way relay networks. Specifically, the relay opportunistically transmits its own information to the destination covertly on top of forwarding the source's message, while the source tries to detect this covert transmission to discover the illegitimate usage of the recourse (e.g., power, spectrum) allocated only for the purpose of forwarding source's information. The necessary condition that the relay can transmit covertly without being detected is identified and the source's detection limit is derived in terms of the false alarm and miss detection rates. Our analysis indicates that boosting the forwarding ability of the relay (e.g., increasing its maximum transmit power) also increases its capacity to perform the covert communication in terms of achieving a higher effective covert rate subject to some specific requirement on the source's detection performance.
