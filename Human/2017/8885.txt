A Note on The Enumeration of Euclidean Self-Dual Skew-Cyclic Codes over Finite Fields

In this paper we give the enumeration formulas for Euclidean self-dual skew-cyclic codes over finite fields when $(n,|θ|)=1$ and for some cases when $(n,|θ|)>1,$ where $n$ is the length of the code and $|θ|$ is the order of automorphism $θ.$
