Sustainable Fair Division

In this paper, I summarize our work on online fair division. In particular, I present two models for online fair division: (1) one existing model for fair division in food banks and (2) one new model for fair division of deceased organs to patients. I further discuss simple mechanisms for these models that allocate the resources as they arrive to agents. In practice, agents are often risk-averse having imperfect information. Within this assumption, I report several interesting axiomatic and complexity results for these mechanisms and conclude with future work.
