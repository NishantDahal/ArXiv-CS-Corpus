B2B applications focus on using the Internet and/or extranet to improve business-to-business partnerships and transform inter-organizational relationships. RFID is relatively low-cost data and wireless transmission technology that helps manufacturers to improve a number of business applications and processes. In this paper we present an RFID_B2B system that brings together the B2B and RFID advantages and which could be a viable solution for the potential problems created due to the globalization process. Using the developed system may help customers sharpen data accuracy, process supply chain transactions faster, and improve supply chain and inventory management.
