Early Prediction for Physical Human Robot Collaboration in the Operating Room

To enable a natural and fluent human robot collaboration flow, it is critical for a robot to comprehend their human peers' on-going actions, predict their behaviors in the near future, and plan its actions correspondingly. Specifically, the capability of making early predictions is important, so that the robot can foresee the precise timing of a turn-taking event and start motion planning and execution early enough to smooth the turn-taking transition. Such proactive behavior would reduce human's waiting time, increase efficiency and enhance naturalness in collaborative task. To that end, this paper presents the design and implementation of an early turn-taking prediction algorithm, catered for physical human robot collaboration scenarios. Specifically, a Robotic Scrub Nurse (RSN) system which can comprehend surgeon's multimodal communication cues and perform turn-taking prediction is presented. The developed algorithm was tested on a collected data set of simulated surgical procedures in a surgeon-nurse tandem. The proposed turn-taking prediction algorithm is found to be significantly superior to its algorithmic counterparts, and is more accurate than human baseline when little partial input is given (less than 30% of full action). After observing more information, the algorithm can achieve comparable performances as humans with a F1 score of 0.90.
