A Participatory Sensing Framework for Environment Pollution Monitoring and Management

Effective monitoring and management of environment pollution is key to the development of modern metropolitan cities. To sustain and to cope with the exponential growth of the cities with high industrialization, expert decision making is very essential in this process. A good governance system must be supported by an actively participating population. In participatory sensing, individuals and groups engages in the data collection actively and the helps the city governance to make proper decisions. In this paper, we propose a participatory sensing based three-tier framework to fight environment pollution in urban areas of Bangladesh. The framework includes an android application named `My City, My Environment', a server for storage and computation and also a web server for the authority to monitor and maintain environmental issues through expert decision making. We have already developed a prototype system and deployed it to a small scale and demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework.
