Outage Analysis of Ambient Backscatter Communication Systems

This paper addresses the problem of outage characterization of an ambient backscatter communication system with a pair of passive tag and reader. In particular, an exact expression for the effective channel distribution is derived. Then, the outage probability at the reader is analyzed rigorously. Since the expression contains an infinite sum, a tight truncation error bound has been derived to facilitate precise numerical evaluations. Furthermore, an asymptotic expression is provided for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.
