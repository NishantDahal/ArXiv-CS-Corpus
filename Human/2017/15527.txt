Towards a Formal, Visual Framework of Emergent Cognitive Development of Scholars

Understanding the cognitive evolution of researchers as they progress in the academia is an important but complex problem, a problem belonging to a class of problems, which often require the development of models for gaining further understanding in the intricacies of the domain. The research question that we address in this paper is how to effectively model this temporal cognitive mental development of prolific researchers. Our proposed solution to this problem is based on noting that the academic progression and notability of a researcher are linked with a progressive increase in the citation count for the scholar's refereed publications quantified using indices such as the Hirsch index. In other words, we propose the use of yearly cognitive increment of a scholar's cognition to be quantifiable using a function of the scholar's citation index, thereby considering the index as an indicator of the discrete approximation of the scholar's cognitive development. Using validated agent-based modeling, a paradigm presented as part of our previous work i.e. Cognitive Agent-based Computing framework, we present both formal as well as visual agent-based complex network representations for this cognitive evolution in the form of a Temporal Cognitive Level Network (TCLN) model. As a proof of the effectiveness of this approach, we demonstrate validation of the model using historic data of citations.
