Time and band limiting for matrix valued functions: an integral and a commuting differential operator

The problem of recovering a signal of finite duration from a piece of its Fourier transform was solved at Bell Labs in the $1960$'s, by exploiting a "miracle": a certain naturally appearing integral operator commutes with an explicit differential one. Here we show that this same miracle holds in a matrix valued version of the same problem.
