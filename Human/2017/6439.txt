Application of Econometric Data Analysis Methods to Physics Software

We report an investigation of data analysis methods derived from other disciplines, which we applied to physics software systems. They concern the analysis of inequality, trend analysis and the analysis of diversity. The analysis of inequality exploits statistical methods originating from econometrics; trend analysis is typical of economics and environmental sciences; the analysis of diversity is based on concepts derived from ecology and treats software as an ecosystem. To the best of our knowledge, this is an innovative exploration, as we could not find track of previous use of these methods in the experimental physics domains within the scope of the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium. We applied these methods in the context of Geant4 physics validation and Geant4 maintainability assessment.
