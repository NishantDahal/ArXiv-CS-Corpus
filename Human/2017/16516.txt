Efficient hybrid search algorithm on ordered datasets

The increase in the rate of data is much higher than the increase in the speed of computers, which results in a heavy emphasis on search algorithms in research literature. Searching an item in ordered list is an efficient operation in data processing. Binary and interpolation search algorithms commonly are used for searching ordered dataset in many applications. In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm to search ordered datasets based on the idea of interpolation and binary search. The proposed algorithm called Hybrid Search (HS), which is designed to work efficiently on unknown distributed ordered datasets, experimental results showed that our proposed algorithm has better performance when compared with other algorithms that use a similar approach.
