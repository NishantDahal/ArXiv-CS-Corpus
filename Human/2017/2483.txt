Schedule based Self Localization of asynchronous wireless nodes with experimental validation

In this paper we have proposed clock error mitigation from the measurements in the scheduled based self localization system. We propose measurement model with clock errors while following a scheduled transmission among anchor nodes. Further, RLS algorithm is proposed to estimate clock error and to calibrate measurements of self localizing node against relative clock errors of anchor nodes. A full-scale experimental validation is provided based on commercial off-the-shelf UWB radios under IEEE-standardized protocols.
