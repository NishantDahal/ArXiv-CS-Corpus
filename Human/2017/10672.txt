Fountain Codes under Maximum Likelihood Decoding

This dissertation focuses on fountain codes under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. First LT codes are considered under a practical and widely used ML decoding algorithm known as inactivation decoding. Different analysis techniques are presented to characterize the decoding complexity. Next an upper bound to the probability of decoding failure of Raptor codes under ML decoding is provided. Then, the distance properties of an ensemble of fixed-rate Raptor codes with linear random outer codes are analyzed. Finally, a novel class of fountain codes is presented, which consists of a parallel concatenation of a block code with a linear random fountain code.
