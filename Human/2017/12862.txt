Polarization-Division Multiplexing Based on the Nonlinear Fourier Transform

Polarization-division multiplexed (PDM) transmission based on the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) is proposed for optical fiber communication. The NFT algorithms are generalized from the scalar nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation for one polarization to the Manakov system for two polarizations. The transmission performance of the PDM nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) and PDM orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) are determined. It is shown that the transmission performance in terms of Q-factor is approximately the same in PDM-NFDM and single polarization NFDM at twice the data rate and that the polarization-mode dispersion does not seriously degrade system performance. Compared with PDM-OFDM, PDM-NFDM achieves a Q-factor gain of 6.4 dB. The theory can be generalized to multi-mode fibers in the strong coupling regime, paving the way for the application of the NFT to address the nonlinear effects in space-division multiplexing.
