Distributed Estimation Recovery under Sensor Failure

Single time-scale distributed estimation of dynamic systems via a network of sensors/estimators is addressed in this letter. In single time-scale distributed estimation, the two fusion steps, consensus and measurement exchange, are implemented only once, in contrast to, e.g., a large number of consensus iterations at every step of the system dynamics. We particularly discuss the problem of failure in the sensor/estimator network and how to recover for distributed estimation by adding new sensor measurements from equivalent states. We separately discuss the recovery for two types of sensors, namely αand βsensors. We propose polynomial order algorithms to find equivalent state nodes in graph representation of system to recover for distributed observability. The polynomial order solution is particularly significant for large-scale systems.
