Relative Transfer Function Inverse Regression from Low Dimensional Manifold

In room acoustic environments, the Relative Transfer Functions (RTFs) are controlled by few underlying modes of variability. Accordingly, they are confined to a low-dimensional manifold. In this letter, we investigate a RTF inverse regression problem, the task of which is to generate the high-dimensional responses from their low-dimensional representations. The problem is addressed from a pure data-driven perspective and a supervised Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is applied to learn a mapping from the source-receiver poses (positions and orientations) to the frequency domain RTF vectors. The experiments show promising results: the model achieves lower prediction error of the RTF than the free field assumption. However, it fails to compete with the linear interpolation technique in small sampling distances.
