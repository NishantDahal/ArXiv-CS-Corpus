Parallel implementation of a vehicle rail dynamical model for multi-core systems

This research presents a model of a complex dynamic object running on a multi-core system. Discretization and numerical integration for multibody models of vehicle rail elements in the vertical longitudinal plane fluctuations is considered. The implemented model and solution of the motion differential equations allow estimating the basic processes occurring in the system with various external influences. Hence the developed programming model can be used for performing analysis and comparing new vehicle designs.
