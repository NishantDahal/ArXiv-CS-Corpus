On the correlation between a level of structure order and properties of composites. In Memory of Yu.L. Klimontovich

Proposed the computerized method for calculating the relative level of order composites. Correlation between a level of structure order and properties of solids is shown. Discussed the possibility of clarifying the terminology used in describing the structure.
