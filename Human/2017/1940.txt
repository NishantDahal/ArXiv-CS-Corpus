R$^3$PUF: A Highly Reliable Memristive Device based Reconfigurable PUF

We present a memristive device based R$ ^3 $PUF construction achieving highly desired PUF properties, which are not offered by most current PUF designs: (1) High reliability, almost 100\% that is crucial for PUF-based cryptographic key generations, significantly reducing, or even eliminating the expensive overhead of on-chip error correction logic and the associated helper on-chip data storage or off-chip storage and transfer. (2) Reconfigurability, while current PUF designs rarely exhibit such an attractive property. We validate our R$ ^3 $PUF via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations in Cadence based on parameters of real devices. The R$ ^3 $PUF is simple, cost-effective and easy to manage compared to other PUF constructions exhibiting high reliability or reconfigurability. None of previous PUF constructions is able to provide both desired high reliability and reconfigurability concurrently.
