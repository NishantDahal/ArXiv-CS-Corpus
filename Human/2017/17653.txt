Malware Detection Approach for Android systems Using System Call Logs

Static detection technologies based on signature-based approaches that are widely used in Android platform to detect malicious applications. It can accurately detect malware by extracting signatures from test data and then comparing the test data with the signature samples of virus and benign samples. However, this method is generally unable to detect unknown malware applications. This is because, sometimes, the machine code can be converted into assembly code, which can be easily read and understood by humans. Furthuremore, the attacker can then make sense of the assembly instructions and understand the functioning of the program from the same. Therefore we focus on observing the behaviour of the malicious software while it is actually running on a host system. The dynamic behaviours of an application are conducted by the system call sequences at the end. Hence, we observe the system call log of each application, use the same for the construction of our dataset, and finally use this dataset to classify an unknown application as malicious or benign.
