Quality-Driven Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex Delay-Constrained Wireless Video Transmissions

In this paper, wireless video transmission over full-duplex channels under total bandwidth and minimum required quality constraints is studied. In order to provide the desired performance levels to the end-users in real-time video transmissions, quality of service (QoS) requirements such as statistical delay constraints are also considered. Effective capacity (EC) is used as the throughput metric in the presence of such statistical delay constraints since deterministic delay bounds are difficult to guarantee due to the time-varying nature of wireless fading channels. A communication scenario with multiple pairs of users in which different users have different delay requirements is addressed. Following characterizations from the rate-distortion (R-D) theory, a logarithmic model of the quality-rate relation is used for predicting the quality of the reconstructed video in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) at the receiver side. Since the optimization problem is not concave or convex, the optimal bandwidth and power allocation policies that maximize the weighted sum video quality subject to total bandwidth, maximum transmission power level and minimum required quality constraints are derived by using monotonic optimization (MO) theory.
