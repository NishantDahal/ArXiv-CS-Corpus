Approaches to Maintain Bi-connectivity for Resilience in Overlaid Multicasting

Application layer multicast (ALM) also called Overlay Multicast, is an attractive alternative solution to most of the problems associated with IP multicast. In ALM, multicast-related functionalities are moved to end-hosts. Application layer multicast builds a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay topology consisting of end-to-end unicast connections between end-hosts. The key advantages, overlays offer, are flexibility, adaptability and ease of deployment [1]. The general approach to build an application layer multicast architecture involves tracking network characteristics and building appropriate topologies by allowing the end users to self organize into logical overlay networks for efficient data delivery. The major concern in designing ALM protocol is the mechanism to build and maintain a topology and to route data efficiently and reliably in this topology. We propose here a two-fold dynamic overlay tree construction and maintenance scheme in which a mesh-like topology is first built, where an arriving host connects to two already connected hosts. This ensures that two node and link disjoint paths are always maintained between every possible pair of nodes. Once the mesh is formed, on top of it, a single or multiple data delivery tree(s) are built using a suitable protocol. An algorithm is run in the nodes of the overlay topology to maintain the biconnectivity by inserting new links and deleting the redundant links as a continuous process.
