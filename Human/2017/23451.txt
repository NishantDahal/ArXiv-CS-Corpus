Joining Local Knowledge to Communicate Reliably (Extended Abstract)

A fundamental primitive in distributed computing is Reliable Message Transmission (RMT), which refers to the task of correctly sending a message from a party (or player) to another, in a network where some intermediate relays might be controlled by an adversary. We address the problem under the realistic assumption that the topological knowledge of players is restricted to a certain subgraph and specifically study the role of local information exchange in the feasibility of RMT. We employ the General Adversary model of Hirt and Maurer and the recently introduced Partial Knowledge Model which subsume all known models for the adversary and local knowledge respectively. Tight feasibility conditions, naturally involving the network topology, the adversary and the local knowledge of players, are presented.
