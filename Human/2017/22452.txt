(Auto)Focus approaches and their applications: A systematic review

Focus, a framework for formal specification and development of interactive systems, was introduced approx. 25 years ago. Since then this approach was broadly used in academic and industrial studies, as well as provided a basis for a number of another frameworks focusing on particular domains, and for the AF3 modelling tool. In this paper we provide a literature review of the corresponding approaches, academic case studies and industrial applications of these methods.
