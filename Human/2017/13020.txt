Controlling a remotely located Robot using Hand Gestures in real time: A DSP implementation

Telepresence is a necessity for present time as we can't reach everywhere and also it is useful in saving human life at dangerous places. A robot, which could be controlled from a distant location, can solve these problems. This could be via communication waves or networking methods. Also controlling should be in real time and smooth so that it can actuate on every minor signal in an effective way. This paper discusses a method to control a robot over the network from a distant location. The robot was controlled by hand gestures which were captured by the live camera. A DSP board TMS320DM642EVM was used to implement image pre-processing and fastening the whole system. PCA was used for gesture classification and robot actuation was done according to predefined procedures. Classification information was sent over the network in the experiment. This method is robust and could be used to control any kind of robot over distance.
