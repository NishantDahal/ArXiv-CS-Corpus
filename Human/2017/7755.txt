Enhanced Factored Three-Way Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Speech Detection

In this letter, we propose enhanced factored three way restricted Boltzmann machines (EFTW-RBMs) for speech detection. The proposed model incorporates conditional feature learning by multiplying the dynamical state of the third unit, which allows a modulation over the visible-hidden node pairs. Instead of stacking previous frames of speech as the third unit in a recursive manner, the correlation related weighting coefficients are assigned to the contextual neighboring frames. Specifically, a threshold function is designed to capture the long-term features and blend the globally stored speech structure. A factored low rank approximation is introduced to reduce the parameters of the three-dimensional interaction tensor, on which non-negative constraint is imposed to address the sparsity characteristic. The validations through the area-under-ROC-curve (AUC) and signal distortion ratio (SDR) show that our approach outperforms several existing 1D and 2D (i.e., time and time-frequency domain) speech detection algorithms in various noisy environments.
