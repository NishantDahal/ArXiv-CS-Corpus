Evaluation of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms for Weighted Max-Sat Problem: Technical Report

An experimental evaluation is conducted to asses the performance of 4 different Particle Swarm Optimization neighborhood structures in solving Max-Sat problem. The experiment has shown that none of the algorithms achieves statistically significant performance over the others under confidence level of 0.05.
