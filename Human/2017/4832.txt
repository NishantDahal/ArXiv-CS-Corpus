A Novel Approach of Pseudorandomly sorted list-based Steganography

We propose a new model of steganography based on a list of pseudo-randomly sorted sequences of characters. Given a list $L$ of $m$ columns containing $n$ distinct strings each, with low or no semantic relationship between columns taken two by two, and a secret message $s \in \{0,1\}^*$, our model embeds $s$ in $L$ block by block, by generating, for each column of $L$, a permutation number and by reordering strings contained in it according to that number. Where, letting $l$ be average bit length of a string, the embedding capacity is given by $[(m-1)*log_2(n!-1)/n*l]$. We've shown that optimal efficiency of the method can be obtained with the condition that $(n >> l)$. The results which has been obtained by experiments, show that our model performs a better hiding process than some of the important existing methods, in terms of hiding capacity.
