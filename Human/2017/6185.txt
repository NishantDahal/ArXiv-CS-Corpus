Investigation of Wireless Channel Asymmetry in Indoor Environments

Asymmetry is unquestionably an important characteristic of the wireless propagation channel, which needs to be accurately modeled for wireless and mobile communications, 5G networks, and associated applications such as indoor/outdoor localization. This paper reports on the potential causes of propagation asymmetry. Practical channel measurements at Khalifa University premises proved that wireless channels are asymmetric in realistic scenarios. Some important conclusions and recommendation are also summarized.
