Multi-measures fusion based on multi-objective genetic programming for full-reference image quality assessment

In this paper, we exploit the flexibility of multi-objective fitness functions, and the efficiency of the model structure selection ability of a standard genetic programming (GP) with the parameter estimation power of classical regression via multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), to propose a new fusion technique for image quality assessment (IQA) that is called Multi-measures Fusion based on Multi-Objective Genetic Programming (MFMOGP). This technique can automatically select the most significant suitable measures, from 16 full-reference IQA measures, used in aggregation and finds weights in a weighted sum of their outputs while simultaneously optimizing for both accuracy and complexity. The obtained well-performing fusion of IQA measures are evaluated on four largest publicly available image databases and compared against state-of-the-art full-reference IQA approaches. Results of comparison reveal that the proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art recently developed fusion approaches.
