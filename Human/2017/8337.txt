Adversarial Learning: A Critical Review and Active Learning Study

This papers consists of two parts. The first is a critical review of prior art on adversarial learning, identifying some significant limitations of previous works. The second part is an experimental study considering adversarial active learning and an investigation of the efficacy of a mixed sample selection strategy for combating an adversary who attempts to disrupt the classifier learning.
