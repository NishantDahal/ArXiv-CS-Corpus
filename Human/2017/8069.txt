SelfieBoost: A Boosting Algorithm for Deep Learning

We describe and analyze a new boosting algorithm for deep learning called SelfieBoost. Unlike other boosting algorithms, like AdaBoost, which construct ensembles of classifiers, SelfieBoost boosts the accuracy of a single network. We prove a $\log(1/Îµ)$ convergence rate for SelfieBoost under some "SGD success" assumption which seems to hold in practice.
