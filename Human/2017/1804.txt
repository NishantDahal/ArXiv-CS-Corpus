Tars: Timeliness-aware Adaptive Replica Selection for Key-Value Stores

In current large-scale distributed key-value stores, a single end-user request may lead to key-value access across tens or hundreds of servers. The tail latency of these key-value accesses is crucial to the user experience and greatly impacts the revenue. To cut the tail latency, it is crucial for clients to choose the fastest replica server as much as possible for the service of each key-value access. Aware of the challenges on the time varying performance across servers and the herd behaviors, an adaptive replica selection scheme C3 is proposed recently. In C3, feedback from individual servers is brought into replica ranking to reflect the time-varying performance of servers, and the distributed rate control and backpressure mechanism is invented. Despite of C3's good performance, we reveal the timeliness issue of C3, which has large impacts on both the replica ranking and the rate control, and propose the Tars (timeliness-aware adaptive replica selection) scheme. Following the same framework as C3, Tars improves the replica ranking by taking the timeliness of the feedback information into consideration, as well as revises the rate control of C3. Simulation results confirm that Tars outperforms C3.
