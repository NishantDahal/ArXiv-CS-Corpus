The linear complexity of new binary cyclotomic sequences of period $p^n$

In this paper, we determine the linear complexity of a class of new binary cyclotomic sequences of period pn constructed by Z. Xiao et al. (Des. Codes Cryptogr. DOI 10.1007/s10623-017-0408-7) and prove their conjecture about high linear complexity of these sequences.
