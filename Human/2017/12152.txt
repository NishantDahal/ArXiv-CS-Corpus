Saliency Detection by Forward and Backward Cues in Deep-CNNs

As prior knowledge of objects or object features helps us make relations for similar objects on attentional tasks, pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to detect salient objects on images regardless of the object class is in the network knowledge or not. In this paper, we propose a top-down saliency model using CNN, a weakly supervised CNN model trained for 1000 object labelling task from RGB images. The model detects attentive regions based on their objectness scores predicted by selected features from CNNs. To estimate the salient objects effectively, we combine both forward and backward features, while demonstrating that partially-guided backpropagation will provide sufficient information for selecting the features from forward run of CNN model. Finally, these top-down cues are enhanced with a state-of-the-art bottom-up model as complementing the overall saliency. As the proposed model is an effective integration of forward and backward cues through objectness without any supervision or regression to ground truth data, it gives promising results compared to state-of-the-art models in two different datasets.
