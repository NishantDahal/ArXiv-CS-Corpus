Optimizing Power and User Association for Energy Saving in Load-Coupled Cooperative LTE

We consider an energy minimization problem for cooperative LTE networks. To reduce energy consumption, we investigate how to jointly optimize the transmit power and the association between cells and user equipments (UEs), by taking into consideration joint transmission (JT), one of the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) techniques. We formulate the optimization problem mathematically. For solving the problem, a dynamic power allocation algorithm that adjusts the transmit power of all cells, and an algorithm for optimizing the cell-UE association, are proposed. The two algorithms are iteratively used in an algorithmic framework to enhance the energy performance. Numerically, the proposed algorithms can lead to lower energy consumption than the optimal energy setting in the non-JT case. In comparison to fixed power allocation in JT, the proposed dynamic power allocation algorithm is able to significantly reduce the energy consumption.
