Differences of halting probabilities

The halting probabilities of universal prefix-free machines are universal for the class of reals with computably enumerable left cut (also known as left-c.e. reals), and coincide with the Martin-Loef random elements of this class. We study the differences of Martin-Loef random left-c.e. reals and show that for each pair of such reals a, b there exists a unique number r > 0 such that qa - b is a 1-random left-c.e. real for each positive rational q > r and a 1-random right-c.e. real for each positive rational q < r. Based on this result we develop a theory of differences of halting probabilities, which answers a number of questions about Martin-Loef random left-c.e. reals, including one of the few remaining open problems from the list of open questions in algorithmic randomness by Miller and Nies in 2006. The halting probability of a prefix-free machine M restricted to a set X is the probability that the machine halts and outputs an element of X. These numbers Omega_M(X) were studied by a number of authors in the last decade as a way to obtain concrete highly random numbers. When X is the complement of a computably enumerable set, the number Omega_M(X) is the difference of two halting probabilities. Becher, Figueira, Grigorieff, and Miller asked whether Omega_U(X) is Martin-Loef random when U is universal and X is the complement of a computably enumerable set. This problem has resisted numerous attempts in the last decade. We apply our theory of differences of halting probabilities to give a positive answer, and show that Omega_U(X) is a Martin-Loef random left-c.e. real whenever X is nonempty and the complement of a computably enumerable set.
