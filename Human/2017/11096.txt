Evidence Logics with Relational Evidence

Dynamic evidence logics are logics for reasoning about the evidence and evidence-based beliefs of agents in a dynamic environment. In this paper, we introduce a family of logics for reasoning about relational evidence: evidence that involves an orderings of states in terms of their relative plausibility. We provide sound and complete axiomatizations for the logics. We also present several evidential actions and prove soundness and completeness for the associated dynamic logics.
