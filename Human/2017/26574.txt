Channel Estimation in Broadband Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems with Few-Bit ADCs

We develop a broadband channel estimation algorithm for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with few-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our methodology exploits the joint sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angle and delay domains. We formulate the estimation problem as a noisy quantized compressed-sensing problem and solve it using efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. In particular, we model the angle-delay coefficients using a Bernoulli-Gaussian-mixture distribution with unknown parameters and use the expectation-maximization (EM) forms of the generalized AMP (GAMP) and vector AMP (VAMP) algorithms to simultaneously learn the distributional parameters and compute approximately minimum mean-squared error (MSE) estimates of the channel coefficients. We design a training sequence that allows fast, FFT-based implementation of these algorithms while minimizing peak-to-average power ratio at the transmitter, making our methods scale efficiently to large numbers of antenna elements and delays. We present the results of a detailed simulation study that compares our algorithms to several benchmarks. Our study investigates the effect of SNR, training length, training type, ADC resolution, and runtime on channel estimation MSE, mutual information, and achievable rate. It shows that our methods allow one-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at low SNR, and 4-bit ADCs to perform comparably to infinite-bit ADCs at medium SNR.
