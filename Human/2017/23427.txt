Interpretable Feature Recommendation for Signal Analytics

This paper presents an automated approach for interpretable feature recommendation for solving signal data analytics problems. The method has been tested by performing experiments on datasets in the domain of prognostics where interpretation of features is considered very important. The proposed approach is based on Wide Learning architecture and provides means for interpretation of the recommended features. It is to be noted that such an interpretation is not available with feature learning approaches like Deep Learning (such as Convolutional Neural Network) or feature transformation approaches like Principal Component Analysis. Results show that the feature recommendation and interpretation techniques are quite effective for the problems at hand in terms of performance and drastic reduction in time to develop a solution. It is further shown by an example, how this human-in-loop interpretation system can be used as a prescriptive system.
