Demo: WiSCoP - Wireless Sensor Communication Prototyping Platform

To enhance system performance of future heterogeneous wireless networks the co-design of PHY, MAC, and higher layer protocols is inevitable. In this work, we present WiSCoP - a novel embedded platform for experimentation, prototyping and implementation of integrated cross-layer network design approaches. WiSCoP is built on top of a Zynq hardware platform integrated with FMCOMMS1/2/4 RF front ends. We demonstrate the flexibility of WiSCoP by using it to prototype a fully standard compliant IEEE 802.15.4 stack with real-time performance and cross-layer integration.
