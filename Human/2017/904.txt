Dynamic Complexity under Definable Changes

This paper studies dynamic complexity under definable change operations in the DynFO framework by Patnaik and Immerman. It is shown that for changes definable by parameter-free first-order formulas, all (uniform) $AC^1$ queries can be maintained by first-order dynamic programs. Furthermore, many maintenance results for single-tuple changes are extended to more powerful change operations: (1) The reachability query for undirected graphs is first-order maintainable under single tuple changes and first-order defined insertions, likewise the reachability query for directed acyclic graphs under quantifier-free insertions. (2) Context-free languages are first-order maintainable under $Î£_1$-defined changes. These results are complemented by several inexpressibility results, for example, that the reachability query cannot be maintained by quantifier-free programs under definable, quantifier-free deletions.
