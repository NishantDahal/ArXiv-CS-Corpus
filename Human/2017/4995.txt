Skin Lesion Classification Using Deep Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks

We present a deep learning approach to the ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Classification Challenge using a multi-scale convolutional neural network. Our approach utilizes an Inception-v3 network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is fine-tuned for skin lesion classification using two different scales of input images.
