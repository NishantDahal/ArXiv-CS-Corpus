Algorithms For Longest Chains In Pseudo- Transitive Graphs

A directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) is pseudo-transitive with respect to a given subset of edges E1, if for any edge ab in E1 and any edge bc in E, we have ac in E. We give algorithms for computing longest chains and demonstrate geometric applications that unify and improves some important past results. (For specific applications see the introduction.)
