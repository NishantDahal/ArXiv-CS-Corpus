Recognition of Documents in Braille

Visually impaired people are integral part of the society and it has been a must to provide them with means and system through which they may communicate with the world. In this work, I would like to address how computers can be made useful to read the scripts in Braille. The importance of this work is to reduce communication gap between visually impaired people and the society. Braille remains the most popular tactile reading code even in this century. There are numerous amount of literature locked up in Braille. Braille recognition not only reduces time in reading or extracting information from Braille document but also helps people engaged in special education for correcting papers and other school related works. The availability of such a system will enhance communication and collaboration possibilities with visually impaired people. Existing works supports only documents in white either bright or dull in colour. Hardly any work could be traced on hand printed ordinary documents in Braille.
