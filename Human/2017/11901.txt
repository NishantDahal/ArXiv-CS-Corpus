A Vision System for Multi-View Face Recognition

Multimodal biometric identification has been grown a great attention in the most interests in the security fields. In the real world there exist modern system devices that are able to detect, recognize, and classify the human identities with reliable and fast recognition rates. Unfortunately most of these systems rely on one modality, and the reliability for two or more modalities are further decreased. The variations of face images with respect to different poses are considered as one of the important challenges in face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a multimodal biometric system that able to detect the human face images that are not only one view face image, but also multi-view face images. Each subject entered to the system adjusted their face at front of the three cameras, and then the features of the face images are extracted based on Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm. We utilize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and combined classifiers based on both Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) for classification purposes. The proposed system has been tested using SDUMLA-HMT, and CASIA datasets. Furthermore, we collected a database of multi-view face images by which we take the additive white Gaussian noise into considerations. The results indicated the reliability, robustness of the proposed system with different poses and variations including noise images.
