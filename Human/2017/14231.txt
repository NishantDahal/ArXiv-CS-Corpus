A Projected Inverse Dynamics Approach for Dual-arm Cartesian Impedance Control

We propose a method for dual-arm manipulation of rigid objects, subject to external disturbance. The problem is formulated as a Cartesian impedance controller within a projected inverse dynamics framework. We use the constrained component of the controller to enforce contact and the unconstrained controller to accomplish the task with a desired 6-DOF impedance behaviour. Furthermore, the proposed method optimises the torque required to maintain contact, subject to unknown disturbances, and can do so without direct measurement of external force. The techniques are evaluated on a single-arm wiping a table and a dual-arm platform manipulating a rigid object of unknown mass and with human interaction.
