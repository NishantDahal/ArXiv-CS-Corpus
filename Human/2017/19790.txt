An Energy-Aware WLAN Discovery Scheme for LTE HetNet

Recently, there has been significant interest in the integration and co-existence of Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) with other Radio Access Technologies, like IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Although, the inter-working of IEEE 802.11 WLANs with 3GPP LTE has indicated enhanced network performance in the context of capacity and load balancing, the WLAN discovery scheme implemented in most of the commercially available smartphones is very inefficient and results in high battery drainage. In this paper, we have proposed an energy efficient WLAN discovery scheme for 3GPP LTE and IEEE 802.11 WLAN inter-working scenario. User Equipment (UE), in the proposed scheme, uses 3GPP network assistance along with the results of past channel scans, to optimally select the next channels to scan. Further, we have also developed an algorithm to accurately estimate the UE's mobility state, using 3GPP network signal strength patterns. We have implemented various discovery schemes in Android framework, to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme against other solutions in the literature. Since, Android does not support selective scanning mode, we have implemented modules in Android to enable selective scanning. Further, we have also used simulation studies and justified the results using power consumption modeling. The results from the field experiments and simulations have shown high power savings using the proposed scanning scheme without any discovery performance deterioration.
