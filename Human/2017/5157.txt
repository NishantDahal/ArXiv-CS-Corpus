Automatic Library Version Identification, an Exploration of Techniques

This paper is the result of a two month research internship on the topic of library version identification. In this paper, ideas and techniques from literature in the area of binary comparison and fingerprinting are outlined and applied to the problem of (version) identification of shared libraries and of libraries within statically linked binary executables. Six comparison techniques are chosen and implemented in an open-source tool which in turn makes use of the open-source radare2 framework for signature generation. The effectiveness of the techniques is empirically analyzed by comparing both artificial and real sample files against a reference dataset of multiple versions of dozens of libraries. The results show that out of these techniques, readable string--based techniques perform the best and that one of these techniques correctly identifies multiple libraries contained in a stripped statically linked executable file.
