Proposal for a fully decentralized blockchain and proof-of-work algorithm for solving NP-complete problems

We propose a proof-of-work algorithm that rewards blockchain miners for using computational resources to solve NP-complete puzzles. The resulting blockchain will publicly store and improve solutions to problems with real world applications while maintaining a secure and fully functional transaction ledger.
