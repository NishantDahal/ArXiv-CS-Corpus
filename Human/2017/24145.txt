A lambda calculus for density matrices with classical and probabilistic controls

In this paper we present two flavors of a quantum extension to the lambda calculus. The first one, $λ_ρ$, follows the approach of classical control/quantum data, where the quantum data is represented by density matrices. We provide an interpretation for programs as density matrices and functions upon them. The second one, $λ_ρ^\circ$, take advantage of the density matrices presentation in order to follow the mixed trace of programs in a kind of generalised density matrix. Such a control can be seen as a weaker form of the quantum control and data approach.
