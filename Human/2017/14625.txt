A General Framework for Low-Resolution Receivers for MIMO Channels

The capacity of a discrete-time multi-input multi-output (MIMO) Gaussian channel with output quantization is investigated for different receiver architectures. A general formulation of this problem is proposed in which the antenna outputs are processed by analog combiners while sign quantizers are used for analog-to-digital conversion. To exemplify this approach, four analog receiver architectures of varying generality and complexity are considered: (a) multiple antenna selection and sign quantization of the antenna outputs, (b) single antenna selection and multilevel quantization, (c) multiple antenna selection and multilevel quantization, and (d) linear combining of the antenna outputs and multilevel quantization. Achievable rates are studied as a function of the number of available sign quantizers and compared among different architectures. In particular, it is shown that architecture (a) is sufficient to attain the optimal high signal-to-noise ratio performance for a MIMO receiver in which the number of antennas is larger than the number of sign quantizers. Numerical evaluations of the average performance are presented for the case in which the channel gains are i.i.d. Gaussian.
