Symmetry-guided design of topologies for supercomputer networks

A family of graphs optimized as the topologies for supercomputer interconnection networks is proposed. The special needs of such network topologies, minimal diameter and mean path length, are met by special constructions of the weight vectors in a representation of the symplectic algebra. Such theoretical design of topologies can conveniently reconstruct the mesh and hypercubic graphs, widely used as today's network topologies. Our symplectic algebraic approach helps generate many classes of graphs suitable for network topologies.
