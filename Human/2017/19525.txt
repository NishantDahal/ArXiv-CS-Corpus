Analysis of Framelet Transforms on a Simplex

In this paper, we construct framelets associated with a sequence of quadrature rules on the simplex $T^{2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. We give the framelet transforms -- decomposition and reconstruction of the coefficients for framelets of a function on $T^{2}$. We prove that the reconstruction is exact when the framelets are tight. We give an example of construction of framelets and show that the framelet transforms can be computed as fast as FFT.
