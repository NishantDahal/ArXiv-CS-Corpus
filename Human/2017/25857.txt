Implementation of Multilayer Perceptron Network with Highly Uniform Passive Memristive Crossbar Circuits

The progress in the field of neural computation hinges on the use of hardware more efficient than the conventional microprocessors. Recent works have shown that mixed-signal integrated memristive circuits, especially their passive ('0T1R') variety, may increase the neuromorphic network performance dramatically, leaving far behind their digital counterparts. The major obstacle, however, is relatively immature memristor technology so that only limited functionality has been demonstrated to date. Here we experimentally demonstrate operation of one-hidden layer perceptron classifier entirely in the mixed-signal integrated hardware, comprised of two passive 20x20 metal-oxide memristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with discrete CMOS components. The demonstrated multilayer perceptron network, whose complexity is almost 10x higher as compared to previously reported functional neuromorphic classifiers based on passive memristive circuits, achieves classification fidelity within 3 percent of that obtained in simulations, when using ex-situ training approach. The successful demonstration was facilitated by improvements in fabrication technology of memristors, specifically by lowering variations in their I-V characteristics.
