Learning Invariant Riemannian Geometric Representations Using Deep Nets

Non-Euclidean constraints are inherent in many kinds of data in computer vision and machine learning, typically as a result of specific invariance requirements that need to be respected during high-level inference. Often, these geometric constraints can be expressed in the language of Riemannian geometry, where conventional vector space machine learning does not apply directly. The central question this paper deals with is: How does one train deep neural nets whose final outputs are elements on a Riemannian manifold? To answer this, we propose a general framework for manifold-aware training of deep neural networks -- we utilize tangent spaces and exponential maps in order to convert the proposed problem into a form that allows us to bring current advances in deep learning to bear upon this problem. We describe two specific applications to demonstrate this approach: prediction of probability distributions for multi-class image classification, and prediction of illumination-invariant subspaces from a single face-image via regression on the Grassmannian. These applications show the generality of the proposed framework, and result in improved performance over baselines that ignore the geometry of the output space. In addition to solving this specific problem, we believe this paper opens new lines of enquiry centered on the implications of Riemannian geometry on deep architectures.
