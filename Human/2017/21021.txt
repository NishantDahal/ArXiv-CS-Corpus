Codes Endowed With the Rank Metric

We review the main results of the theory of rank-metric codes, with emphasis on their combinatorial properties. We study their duality theory and MacWilliams identities, comparing in particular rank-metric codes in vector and matrix representation. We then investigate the combinatorial structure of MRD codes and optimal anticodes in the rank metric, describing how they relate to each other.
