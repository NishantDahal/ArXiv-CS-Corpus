Indoor Positioning using Similarity-based Sequence and Dead Reckoning without Training

For the traditional fingerprinting-based positioning approach, it is essential to collect measurements at known locations as reference fingerprints during a training phase, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposes a novel approach to track a user in an indoor environment by integrating similarity-based sequence and dead reckoning. In particular, we represent the fingerprinting map as location sequences based on distance ranking of the APs (access points) whose positions are known. The fingerprint used for online positioning is represented by a ranked sequence of APs based on the measured Received Signal Strength (RSS), which is refereed to as RSS sequence in this paper. Embedded into a particle filter, we achieve the tracking of a mobile user by fusing the sequence-based similarity and dead reckoning. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach.
