Individual and Social Requirement Aspects of Sustainable eLearning Systems

Internationalization of the higher education has created the so-called borderless university, which provides better opportunities for learning and increases the human and social sustainability. eLearning systems are a special kind of software systems, developed to provide a platform for accessible teaching and learning, including also online access to learning materials and online support for learning and teaching. The aim of our current work is to extract, analyse, and combine the results from multiple studies in order to develop an RE framework for sustainable eLearning systems.
  We call a system sustainable, if it has a positive effect on and whose direct and indirect negative impacts resulting from its development, deployment, and usage are minimal. Sustainability has various dimensions. We classify sustainability requirements of eLearning system to five dimensions: individual (human), social, technical, environmental, and economic. In this paper, we focus on human and social aspects (i.e., individual needs the relationship of people within society), as the eLearning systems have a very strong impact on human dimension of sustainability, where their impact on environmental dimension is rather small. This also provides us a basis to identify the corresponding requirements for sustainable eLearning systems. These requirements include collaboration, learner-centred features, leadership development and the reuse of the learning materials. As a result, achieving individual and social requirements for eLearning systems would provide higher quality of leaning and teaching, as well as better opportunities for learning and increasing the human and social sustainability.
