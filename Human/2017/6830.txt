Simply Exponential Approximation of the Permanent of Positive Semidefinite Matrices

We design a deterministic polynomial time $c^n$ approximation algorithm for the permanent of positive semidefinite matrices where $c=e^{Î³+1}\simeq 4.84$. We write a natural convex relaxation and show that its optimum solution gives a $c^n$ approximation of the permanent. We further show that this factor is asymptotically tight by constructing a family of positive semidefinite matrices.
