The Game of Blocking Pebbles

Graph Pebbling is a well-studied single-player game on graphs. We introduce the game of Blocking Pebbles which adapts Graph Pebbling into a two-player strategy game in order to examine it within the context of Combinatorial Game Theory. Positions with game values matching all integers, all nimbers, and many infinitesimals and switches are found.
