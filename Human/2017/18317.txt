A review of approaches to the value of privacy

In this paper we examine information privacy from a value-centered angle. We review and compare different personal data valuation approaches. We consider the value of personal data now and in the near future, and we find that the enduring part of personal data will soon become common knowledge and that their price and value will drop substantially. Therefore the sector that is based on personal data extraction will need to focus on new ways of monetization and on the of the dynamic part of personal information.
