U-BeAS: A Stackelberg Game for Device-to-Device Communications

User-behavior-aware communications will be a key feature of future generation cellular networks, so user experience is enhanced with greater benefit to users. In this paper, a user-behavior-aware Stackelberg (U-BeAS) game for device-to-device (D2D) communications overlaying cellular communications is proposed. Our proposed game provides an optimal trade-off between minimizing transmit power and maximizing packet delivery ratio (PDR), with respect to D2D user-behavior for all D2D pairs. The Stackelberg leader, base station (BS), selects its satisfaction with the social welfare of the D2D followers by considering the reaction of the followers to the price it charges. All followers (D2D pairs) select transmit power so as to guarantee a desired quality-of-experience (QoE), where each follower enacts one of three possible behaviors: (i) casual; (ii) intermediate; or (iii) serious. Analysis shows that there exists a sub-game perfect Stackelberg Equilibrium across all players. Analysis and simulation demonstrates that the BS leader rapidly converges to an optimal satisfaction while guaranteeing social welfare across D2D users, and all D2D followers then rapidly converge to a Pareto-efficient outcome with respect to transmit power and PDR.
