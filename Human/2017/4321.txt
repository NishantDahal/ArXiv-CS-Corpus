Low Complexity Beamforming Training Method for mmWave Communications

This paper introduces a low complexity method for antenna sector selection in mmWave Hybrid MIMO communication systems like the IEEE 802.11ay amendment for Wireless LANs. The method is backwards compatible to the methods already defined for the released mmWave standard IEEE 802.11ad. We introduce an extension of the 802.11ad channel model to support common Hybrid MIMO configurations. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to the theoretical limit of transmission rates found by exhaustive search. In contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, the presented method requires sparse channel information only. Numerical results show a significant complexity reduction in terms of number of necessary trainings, while approaching maximum achievable rate.
