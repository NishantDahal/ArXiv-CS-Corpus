Label Languages of 8-directional Array P System

An 8-directional array P system is one where the rewriting of an array can happen in any 8-directions. The array rules of such a system are labelled thus resulting in a labelled 8-directional array P system. The labelling is not unique and the label language is obtained by recording the strings over the labels used in any terminating derivation of the P system. The system is shown to generate interesting pictures. The label language is compared with Chomsky hierarchy.
