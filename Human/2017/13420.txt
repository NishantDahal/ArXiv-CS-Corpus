Energy-Efficient Strip Monitoring by Identical Devices Directed to One Side Along the Strip and Having a Coverage Area in the Form of a Sector

In this paper, we propose several regular covers with identical sectors that observe the strip in the same direction, and we carried out their analysis, which allows choosing the best coverage model and the best parameters of the sector.
