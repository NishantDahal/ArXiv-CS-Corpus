A Deep Neural Architecture for Sentence-level Sentiment Classification in Twitter Social Networking

This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework including a lexicon-based approach for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label distribution. We propose to first apply semantic rules and then use a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DeepCNN) for character-level embeddings in order to increase information for word-level embedding. After that, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) produces a sentence-wide feature representation from the word-level embedding. We evaluate our approach on three Twitter sentiment classification datasets. Experimental results show that our model can improve the classification accuracy of sentence-level sentiment analysis in Twitter social networking.
