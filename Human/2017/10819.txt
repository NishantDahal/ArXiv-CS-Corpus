Cross-lingual Speaker Verification with Deep Feature Learning

Existing speaker verification (SV) systems often suffer from performance degradation if there is any language mismatch between model training, speaker enrollment, and test. A major cause of this degradation is that most existing SV methods rely on a probabilistic model to infer the speaker factor, so any significant change on the distribution of the speech signal will impact the inference. Recently, we proposed a deep learning model that can learn how to extract the speaker factor by a deep neural network (DNN). By this feature learning, an SV system can be constructed with a very simple back-end model. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the feature-based SV system in situations with language mismatch. Our experiments were conducted on a complex cross-lingual scenario, where the model training was in English, and the enrollment and test were in Chinese or Uyghur. The experiments demonstrated that the feature-based system outperformed the i-vector system with a large margin, particularly with language mismatch between enrollment and test.
