A Large-Scale Exploration of Factors Affecting Hand Hygiene Compliance Using Linear Predictive Models

This large-scale study, consisting of 24.5 million hand hygiene opportunities spanning 19 distinct facilities in 10 different states, uses linear predictive models to expose factors that may affect hand hygiene compliance. We examine the use of features such as temperature, relative humidity, influenza severity, day/night shift, federal holidays and the presence of new residents in predicting daily hand hygiene compliance. The results suggest that colder temperatures and federal holidays have an adverse effect on hand hygiene compliance rates, and that individual cultures and attitudes regarding hand hygiene seem to exist among facilities.
