A New Multiple Access Technique for 5G: Power Domain Sparse Code Multiple Access (PSMA)

In this paper, a new approach for multiple access (MA) in fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks called power domain sparse code multiple access (PSMA) is proposed. In PSMA, we adopt both the power domain and the code domain to transmit multiple users' signals over a subcarrier simultaneously. In such a model, the same SCMA codebook can be used by multiple users where, for these users, power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique is used to send signals non-orthogonally. Although different SCMA codebooks are orthogonal and produce no interference over each other, the same codebook used by multiple users produces interference over these users. We investigate the signal model as well as the receiver and transmitter of the PSMA method. To evaluate the performance of PSMA, we consider a heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet). In this case our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate of the network subject to some system level and QoS constraints such as transmit power constraints. We formulate the proposed resource allocation problem as an optimization problem and solve it by successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Moreover, we compare PSMA with sparse code multiple access (SCMA) and PD-NOMA from the performance and computational complexity perspective. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated using numerical results. We show that by a reasonable increase in complexity, PSMA can improve the spectral efficiency about 50\% compared to SCMA and PD-NOMA.
