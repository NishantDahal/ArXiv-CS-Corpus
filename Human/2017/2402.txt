3DNA Printer: A Tool for Automated DNA Origami

In the last two decades, DNA self-assembly has grown into a major area of research attracting people from diverse background. It has numerous potential applications such as targeted drug delivery, artificial photosynthesis etc. In the last decade, another area received wide attention known as DNA origami, where using M13 virus and carefully designed staple strands one can fold the DNA into desired 2-D and 3-D shapes. In 2016, a group of researchers at MIT have developed an automated DNA nanostructures strategy and an open source software 'daedalus' based on MATLAB for developing the nanostructures. In this work, we present a truly open source software '3dnaprinter' based on Java (without MATLAB) that can do the same work.
