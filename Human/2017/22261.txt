When Do Users Change Their Profile Information on Twitter?

We can see profile information such as name, description and location in order to know the user on social media. However, this profile information is not always fixed. If there is a change in the user's life, the profile information will be changed. In this study, we focus on user's profile information changes and analyze the timing and reasons for these changes on Twitter. The results indicate that the peak of profile information change occurs in April among Japanese users, but there was no such trend observed for English users throughout the year. Our analysis also shows that English users most frequently change their names on their birthdays, while Japanese users change their names as their Twitter engagement and activities decrease over time.
