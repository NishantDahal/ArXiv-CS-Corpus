Predicting the Popularity of Topics based on User Sentiment in Microblogging Websites

Behavioral economics show us that emotions play an important role in individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also affect collective decision making in a community? Here we investigate whether the community sentiment energy of a topic is related to the spreading popularity of the topic. To compute the community sentiment energy of a topic, we first analyze the sentiment of a user on the key phrases of the topic based on the recent tweets of the user. Then we compute the total sentiment energy of all users in the community on the topic based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) model and graph entropy model. Experiments on two communities find the linear correlation between the community sentiment energy and the real spreading popularity of topics. Based on the finding, we proposed two models to predict the popularity of topics. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the two models and the helpful of sentiment in predicting the popularity of topics. Experiments also show that community sentiment affects collective decision making of spreading a topic or not in the community.
