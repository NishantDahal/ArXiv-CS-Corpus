Multipath Multiplexing for Capacity Enhancement in SIMO Wireless Systems

This paper proposes a novel and simple orthogonal faster than Nyquist (OFTN) data transmission and detection approach for a single input multiple output (SIMO) system. It is assumed that the signal having a bandwidth $B$ is transmitted through a wireless channel with $L$ multipath components. Under this assumption, the current paper provides a novel and simple OFTN transmission and symbol-by-symbol detection approach that exploits the multiplexing gain obtained by the multipath characteristic of wideband wireless channels. It is shown that the proposed design can achieve a higher transmission rate than the existing one (i.e., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)). Furthermore, the achievable rate gap between the proposed approach and that of the OFDM increases as the number of receiver antennas increases for a fixed value of $L$. This implies that the performance gain of the proposed approach can be very significant for a large-scale multi-antenna wireless system. The superiority of the proposed approach is shown theoretically and confirmed via numerical simulations. {Specifically, we have found {upper-bound average} rates of 15 bps/Hz and 28 bps/Hz with the OFDM and proposed approaches, respectively, in a Rayleigh fading channel with 32 receive antennas and signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 15.3 dB. The extension of the proposed approach for different system setups and associated research problems is also discussed.
