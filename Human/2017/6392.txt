Modelling information manufacturing systems

The manufacture of an information product (IP) is akin to the manufacture of a physical product. Current approaches to model such information manufacturing systems (IMS), lack the ability to systematically represent the dynamic changes involved in manufacturing (or creating) an IP. They also have limitations to consistently include aspects of process and information management at an organizational level. This paper aims to address these limitations and presents a modelling approach, the IASDO model. Our work also represents a framework to evaluate the quality of the meta-models for IMS modelling which enable us to compare the IASDO model with current approaches.
