Enhancing Multiuser MIMO Through Opportunistic D2D Cooperation

We propose a cellular architecture that combines multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink with opportunistic use of unlicensed ISM bands to establish device-to-device (D2D) cooperation. The architecture consists of a physical-layer cooperation scheme based on forming downlink virtual MIMO channels through D2D relaying, and a novel resource allocation strategy for such D2D-enabled networks. We prove the approximate optimality of the physical-layer scheme, and demonstrate that such cooperation boosts the effective SNR of the weakest user in the system, especially in the many-user regime, due to multiuser diversity. To harness this physical-layer scheme, we formulate the cooperative user scheduling and relay selection problem using the network utility maximization framework. For such a cooperative network, we propose a novel utility metric that jointly captures fairness in throughput and the cost of relaying in the system. We propose a joint user scheduling and relay selection algorithm, which we prove to be asymptotically optimal. We study the architecture through system-level simulations over a wide range of scenarios. The highlight of these simulations is an approximately $6$x improvement in data rate for cell-edge (bottom fifth-percentile) users (over the state-of-the-art SU-MIMO) while still improving the overall throughput, and taking into account various system constraints.
