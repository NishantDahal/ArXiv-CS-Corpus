$δ$-Greedy $t$-spanner

We introduce a new geometric spanner, $δ$-Greedy, whose construction is based on a generalization of the known Path-Greedy and Gap-Greedy spanners. The $δ$-Greedy spanner combines the most desirable properties of geometric spanners both in theory and in practice. More specifically, it has the same theoretical and practical properties as the Path-Greedy spanner: a natural definition, small degree, linear number of edges, low weight, and strong $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for every $\varepsilon>0$. The $δ$-Greedy algorithm is an improvement over the Path-Greedy algorithm with respect to the number of shortest path queries and hence with respect to its construction time. We show how to construct such a spanner for a set of $n$ points in the plane in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
  The $δ$-Greedy spanner has an additional parameter, $δ$, which indicates how close it is to the Path-Greedy spanner on the account of the number of shortest path queries. For $δ= t$ the output spanner is identical to the Path-Greedy spanner, while the number of shortest path queries is, in practice, linear.
  Finally, we show that for a set of $n$ points placed independently at random in a unit square the expected construction time of the $δ$-Greedy algorithm is $O(n \log n)$. Our analysis indicates that the $δ$-Greedy spanner gives the best results among the known spanners of expected $O(n \log n)$ time for random point sets. Moreover, the analysis implies that by setting $δ= t$, the $δ$-Greedy algorithm provides a spanner identical to the Path-Greedy spanner in expected $O(n \log n)$ time.
