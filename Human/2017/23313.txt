Tensor-Generative Adversarial Network with Two-dimensional Sparse Coding: Application to Real-time Indoor Localization

Localization technology is important for the development of indoor location-based services (LBS). Global Positioning System (GPS) becomes invalid in indoor environments due to the non-line-of-sight issue, so it is urgent to develop a real-time high-accuracy localization approach for smartphones. However, accurate localization is challenging due to issues such as real-time response requirements, limited fingerprint samples and mobile device storage. To address these problems, we propose a novel deep learning architecture: Tensor-Generative Adversarial Network (TGAN).
  We first introduce a transform-based 3D tensor to model fingerprint samples. Instead of those passive methods that construct a fingerprint database as a prior, our model applies artificial neural network with deep learning to train network classifiers and then gives out estimations. Then we propose a novel tensor-based super-resolution scheme using the generative adversarial network (GAN) that adopts sparse coding as the generator network and a residual learning network as the discriminator. Further, we analyze the performance of tensor-GAN and implement a trace-based localization experiment, which achieves better performance. Compared to existing methods for smartphones indoor positioning, that are energy-consuming and high demands on devices, TGAN can give out an improved solution in localization accuracy, response time and implementation complexity.
