Recognizing Simple-Triangle Graphs by Restricted 2-Chain Subgraph Cover

A simple-triangle graph (also known as a PI graph) is the intersection graph of a family of triangles defined by a point on a horizontal line and an interval on another horizontal line. The recognition problem for simple-triangle graphs was a longstanding open problem, and recently a polynomial-time algorithm has been given [G. B. Mertzios, The Recognition of Simple-Triangle Graphs and of Linear-Interval Orders is Polynomial, SIAM J. Discrete Math., 29(3):1150--1185, 2015]. Along with the approach of this paper, we show a simpler recognition algorithm for simple-triangle graphs. To do this, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the following problem: Given a bipartite graph $G$ and a set $F$ of edges of $G$, find a 2-chain subgraph cover of $G$ such that one of two chain subgraphs has no edges in $F$.
