Characterizations of idempotent discrete uninorms

In this paper we provide an axiomatic characterization of the idempotent discrete uninorms by means of three conditions only: conservativeness, symmetry, and nondecreasing monotonicity. We also provide an alternative characterization involving the bisymmetry property. Finally, we provide a graphical characterization of these operations in terms of their contour plots, and we mention a few open questions for further research.
