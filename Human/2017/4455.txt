A Quasi-Linear Time Algorithm Deciding Whether Weak B端chi Automata Reading Vectors of Reals Recognize Saturated Languages

This work considers weak deterministic B端chi automata reading encodings of non-negative $d$-vectors of reals in a fixed base. A saturated language is a language which contains all encoding of elements belonging to a set of $d$-vectors of reals. A Real Vector Automaton is an automaton which recognizes a saturated language. It is explained how to decide in quasi-linear time whether a minimal weak deterministic B端chi automaton is a Real Vector Automaton. The problem is solved both for the two standard encodings of vectors of numbers: the sequential encoding and the parallel encoding. This algorithm runs in linear time for minimal weak B端chi automata accepting set of reals. Finally, the same problem is also solved for parallel encoding of automata reading vectors of relative reals.
