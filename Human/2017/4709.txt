New approaches to coding information using inverse scattering transform

Remarkable mathematical properties of the integrable nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE) can offer advanced solutions for the mitigation of nonlinear signal distortions in optical fibre links. Fundamental optical soliton, continuous and discrete eigenvalues of the nonlinear spectrum have already been considered for transmission of information in fibre-optic channels. Here we propose to apply signal modulation to the kernel of the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko equations (GLME) that offers the advantage of a relatively simple decoder design. First, we describe an approach based on exploiting the general N-soliton solution of the NLSE for simultaneous coding of $N$ symbols involving $4\times N$ coding parameters. As a specific elegant sub-class of the general schemes we introduce a soliton orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SOFDM) method. This method is based on the choice of identical imaginary parts of the N-soliton solution eigenvalues, corresponding to equidistant soliton frequencies making it similar to the conventional OFDM scheme, thus, allowing use of the efficient fast Fourier transform algorithm to recover the data. Then, we demonstrate how to use this new approach to control signal parameters in the case of the continuous spectrum.
