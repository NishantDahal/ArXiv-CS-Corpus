Missing measurements on RIPE Atlas

We show that it is common to lose some datapoints for mea-surements scheduled at regular interval on RIPE Atlas. Thetemporal correlation between missing measurements and con-nection events are analyzed, in the pursuit of understandingreasons behind such missings. To our surprise, a big part of measurements are lost while probes are connected.
