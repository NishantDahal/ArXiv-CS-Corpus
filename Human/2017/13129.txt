Gyroscope Calibration via Magnetometer

Magnetometers, gyroscopes and accelerometers are commonly used sensors in a variety of applications. The paper proposes a novel gyroscope calibration method in the homogeneous magnetic field by the help of magnetometer. It is shown that, with sufficient rotation excitation, the homogeneous magnetic field vector can be exploited to serve as a good reference for calibrating low-cost gyroscopes. The calibration parameters include the gyroscope scale factor, non-orthogonal coefficient and bias for three axes, as well as its misalignment to the magnetometer frame. Simulation and field test results demonstrate the method's effectiveness.
