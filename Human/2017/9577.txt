Mechanisms for tuning clustering and degree-correlations in directed networks

With complex networks emerging as an effective tool to tackle multidisciplinary problems, models of network generation have gained an importance of their own. These models allow us to extensively analyze the data obtained from real-world networks, study their relevance and corroborate theoretical results. In this work, we introduce methods, based on degree preserving rewiring, that can be used to tune the clustering and degree-correlations in directed networks with random and scale-free topologies. They provide null-models to investigate the role of the mentioned properties along with their strengths and limitations. We find that in the case of clustering, structural relationships, that are independent of topology and rewiring schemes are revealed, while in the case of degree-correlations, the network topology is found to play an important role in the working of the mechanisms. We also study the effects of link-density on the efficiency of these rewiring mechanisms and find that in the case of clustering, the topology of the network plays an important role in determining how link-density affects the rewiring process, while in the case of degree-correlations, the link-density and topology, play no role for sufficiently large number of rewiring steps. Besides the intended purpose of tuning network properties, the proposed mechanisms can also be used as a tool to reveal structural relationships and topological constraints.
