Performance Evaluation of Distributed Computing Environments with Hadoop and Spark Frameworks

Recently, due to rapid development of information and communication technologies, the data are created and consumed in the avalanche way. Distributed computing create preconditions for analyzing and processing such Big Data by distributing the computations among a number of compute nodes. In this work, performance of distributed computing environments on the basis of Hadoop and Spark frameworks is estimated for real and virtual versions of clusters. As a test task, we chose the classic use case of word counting in texts of various sizes. It was found that the running times grow very fast with the dataset size and faster than a power function even. As to the real and virtual versions of cluster implementations, this tendency is the similar for both Hadoop and Spark frameworks. Moreover, speedup values decrease significantly with the growth of dataset size, especially for virtual version of cluster configuration. The problem of growing data generated by IoT and multimodal (visual, sound, tactile, neuro and brain-computing, muscle and eye tracking, etc.) interaction channels is presented. In the context of this problem, the current observations as to the running times and speedup on Hadoop and Spark frameworks in real and virtual cluster configurations can be very useful for the proper scaling-up and efficient job management, especially for machine learning and Deep Learning applications, where Big Data are widely present.
