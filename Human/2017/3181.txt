Termination of Monotone Programs

We present an efficient approach to prove termination of monotone programs with integer variables, an expressive class of loops that is often encountered in computer programs. Our approach is based on a lightweight static analysis method and takes advantage of simple %nice properties of monotone functions. Our preliminary implementation %beats shows that our tool has an advantage over existing tools and can prove termination for a high percentage of loops for a class of benchmarks.
