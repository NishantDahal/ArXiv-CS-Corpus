On the Capacity of Wireless Powered Cognitive Relay Network with Interference Alignment

In this paper, a two-hop decode-and-forward cognitive radio system with deployed interference alignment is considered. The relay node is energy-constrained and scavenges the energy from the interference signals. In the literature, there are two main energy harvesting protocols, namely, time-switching relaying and power-splitting relaying. We first demonstrate how to design the beamforming matrices for the considered primary and secondary networks. Then, the system capacity under perfect and imperfect channel state information scenarios, considering different portions of time-switching and power-splitting protocols, is estimated.
