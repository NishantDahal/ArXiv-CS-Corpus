Additive cyclic codes over finite commutative chain rings

Additive cyclic codes over Galois rings were investigated in previous works. In this paper, we investigate the same problem but over a more general ring family, finite commutative chain rings. When we focus on non-Galois finite commutative chain rings, we observe two different kinds of additivity. One of them is a natural generalization of the previous studies, whereas the other one has some unusual properties especially while constructing dual codes. We interpret the reasons of such properties and illustrate our results giving concrete examples.
