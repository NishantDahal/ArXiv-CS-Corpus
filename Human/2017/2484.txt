Powering Future Mobile Phones Through RF Energy Harvesting

In this paper we present the preliminary measurement results of harvesting radio frequency(RF) energy from the mobile phones. The aim is to revolutionize the way mobile phones are being charged and paving a way of charging the future mobile phones through RF energy harvesting. In order to measure the amount of energy that can be harvested, mobile phones from two different manufactures namely Asus and Samsung have been used. It was shown that depending on the manufacturer it is possible to harvest 1.53 joules amount of energy per day.
