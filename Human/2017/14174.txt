Identification of non-linear behavior models with restricted or redundant data

This study presents a new strategy for the identification of material parameters in the case of restricted or redundant data, based on a hybrid approach combining a genetic algorithm and the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The proposed methodology consists essentially in a statistically based topological analysis of the search domain, after this one has been reduced by the analysis of the parameters ranges. This is used to identify the parameters of a model representing the behavior of damaged elastic, visco-elastic, plastic and visco-plastic composite laminates. Optimization of the experimental tests on tubular samples leads to the selective identification of these parameters.
