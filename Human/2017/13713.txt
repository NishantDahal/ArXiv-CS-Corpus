Mechanics Automatically Recognized via Interactive Observation: Jumping

Jumping has been an important mechanic since its introduction in Donkey Kong. It has taken a variety of forms and shown up in numerous games, with each jump having a different feel. In this paper, we use a modified Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator to semi-automatically run experiments on a large subset (30%) of NES platform games. We use these experiments to build models of jumps from different developers, series, and games across the history of the console. We then examine these models to gain insights into different forms of jumping and their associated feel.
