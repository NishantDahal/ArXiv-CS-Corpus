Low Cost Monitoring and Intruders Detection using Wireless Video Sensor Networks

There is a growing interest in the use of video sensor networks in surveillance applications in order to detect intruders with low cost. The essential concern of such networks is whether or not a specified target can pass or intrude the monitored region without being detected. This concern forms a serious challenge to wireless video sensor networks of weak computation and battery power.
  In this paper, our aim is to prolong the whole network lifetime while fulfilling the surveillance application needs. We present a novel scheduling algorithm where only a subset of video nodes contribute significantly to detect intruders and prevent malicious attacker to predict the behavior of the network prior to intrusion. Our approach is chaos-based, where every node based on its last detection, a hash value and some pseudo-random numbers easily computes a decision function to go to sleep or active mode. We validate the efficiency of our approach through theoretical analysis and demonstrate the benefits of our scheduling algorithm by simulations. Results show that in addition of being able to increase the whole network lifetime and to present comparable results against random attacks (low stealth time), our scheme is also able to withstand malicious attacks due to its fully unpredictable behavior.
