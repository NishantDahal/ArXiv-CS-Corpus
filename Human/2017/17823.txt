Towards Decentralised Resilient Community Cloud Infrastructures

Recent years have seen a trend towards decentralisation - from initiatives on decentralized web to decentralized network infrastructures (e.g community networks). In this position paper, we present an architectural vision for decentralising cloud service infrastructures. Our vision is on the notion of community cloud infrastructures on top of decentralised access infrastructures i.e. community networks, using resources pooled from the community. Our architectural vision takes into consideration some of the fundamental challenges of integrating the current state of the art virtualisation technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) into community infrastructures which are highly unreliable. Our proposed design goal is to include lightweight virtualization and fault tolerance mechanisms into the architecture to ensure sufficient level of reliability to support critical applications.
