A Simplification Method of Polymorphic Boolean Functions

Polymorphic circuits are a special kind of circuits which possess multiple build-in functions, and these functions are activated by environment parameters, like temperature, light and VDD. The behavior of a polymorphic circuit can be described by a polymorphic Boolean function. For the first time, this brief presents a simplification method of the polymorphic Boolean function.
