Multiclass MinMax Rank Aggregation

We introduce a new family of minmax rank aggregation problems under two distance measures, the Kendall Ï„ and the Spearman footrule. As the problems are NP-hard, we proceed to describe a number of constant-approximation algorithms for solving them. We conclude with illustrative applications of the aggregation methods on the Mallows model and genomic data.
