Cleverarm: A Novel Exoskeleton For Rehabilitation Of Upper Limb Impairments

CLEVERarm (Compact, Low-weight, Ergonomic, Virtual and Augmented Reality Enhanced Rehabilitation arm) is a novel exoskeleton with eight degrees of freedom supporting the motion of shoulder girdle, glenohumeral joint, elbow and wrist. Of the eight degrees of freedom of the exoskeleton, six are active and the two degrees of freedom supporting the motion of wrist are passive. This paper briefly outlines the design of CLEVERarm and its control architectures.
