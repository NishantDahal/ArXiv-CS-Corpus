DLR : Toward a deep learned rhythmic representation for music content analysis

In the use of deep neural networks, it is crucial to provide appropriate input representations for the network to learn from. In this paper, we propose an approach to learn a representation that focus on rhythmic representation which is named as DLR (Deep Learning Rhythmic representation). The proposed approach aims to learn DLR from the raw audio signal and use it for other music informatics tasks. A 1-dimensional convolutional network is utilised in the learning of DLR. In the experiment, we present the results from the source task and the target task as well as visualisations of DLRs. The results reveals that DLR provides compact rhythmic information which can be used on multi-tagging task.
