On the Popularity of GitHub Applications: A Preliminary Note

GitHub is the world's largest collection of open source software. Therefore, it is important both to software developers and users to compare and track the popularity of GitHub repositories. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the popularity of GitHub software, using their number of stars. We also propose a set of popularity growth patterns, which describe the evolution of the number of stars of a system over time. We show that stars tend to correlate with other measures, like forks, and with the effective usage of GitHub software by third-party programs. Throughout the paper we illustrate the application of our framework using real data extracted from GitHub.
