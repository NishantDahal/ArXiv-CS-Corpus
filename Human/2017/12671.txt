A Vision For Continuous Automated Game Design

ANGELINA is an automated game design system which has previously been built as a single software block which designs games from start to finish. In this paper we outline a roadmap for the development of a new version of ANGELINA, designed to iterate on games in different ways to produce a continuous creative process that will improve the quality of its work, but more importantly improve the perception of the software as being an independently creative piece of software. We provide an initial report of the system's structure here as well as results from the first working module of the system.
