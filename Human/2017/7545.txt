Hypothesis Testing under Maximal Leakage Privacy Constraints

The problem of publishing privacy-guaranteed data for hypothesis testing is studied using the maximal leakage (ML) as a metric for privacy and the type-II error exponent as the utility metric. The optimal mechanism (random mapping) that maximizes utility for a bounded leakage guarantee is determined for the entire leakage range for binary datasets. For non-binary datasets, approximations in the high privacy and high utility regimes are developed. The results show that, for any desired leakage level, maximizing utility forces the ML privacy mechanism to reveal partial to complete knowledge about a subset of the source alphabet. The results developed on maximizing a convex function over a polytope may also of an independent interest.
