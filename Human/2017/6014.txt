A Network Perspective on Stratification of Multi-Label Data

In the recent years, we have witnessed the development of multi-label classification methods which utilize the structure of the label space in a divide and conquer approach to improve classification performance and allow large data sets to be classified efficiently. Yet most of the available data sets have been provided in train/test splits that did not account for maintaining a distribution of higher-order relationships between labels among splits or folds. We present a new approach to stratifying multi-label data for classification purposes based on the iterative stratification approach proposed by Sechidis et. al. in an ECML PKDD 2011 paper. Our method extends the iterative approach to take into account second-order relationships between labels. Obtained results are evaluated using statistical properties of obtained strata as presented by Sechidis. We also propose new statistical measures relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution, the percentage of label pairs without positive evidence in folds and label pair - fold pairs that have no positive evidence for the label pair. We verify the impact of new methods on classification performance of Binary Relevance, Label Powerset and a fast greedy community detection based label space partitioning classifier. Random Forests serve as base classifiers. We check the variation of the number of communities obtained per fold, and the stability of their modularity score. Second-Order Iterative Stratification is compared to standard k-fold, label set, and iterative stratification. The proposed approach lowers the variance of classification quality, improves label pair oriented measures and example distribution while maintaining a competitive quality in label-oriented measures. We also witness an increase in stability of network characteristics.
