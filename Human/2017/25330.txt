Throughput Scaling for MMF-Enabled Optical Datacenter Networks by Time-Slicing-Based Crosstalk Mitigation

Modal crosstalk is the main bottleneck in MMF-enabled optical datacenter networks with direct detection. A novel time-slicing-based crosstalk-mitigated MDM scheme is first proposed, then theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated.
