Study of Joint MMSE Consensus and Relay Selection Algorithms for Distributed Beamforming

This work presents joint minimum mean-square error (MMSE) consensus algorithm and relay selection algorithms for distributed beamforming. We propose joint MMSE consensus relay and selection schemes with a total power constraint and local communications among the relays for a network with cooperating sensors. We also devise greedy relay selection algorithms based on the MMSE consensus approach that optimize the network performance. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme and algorithms outperform existing techniques for distributed beamforming.
