Democratizing Design for Future Computing Platforms

Information and communications technology can continue to change our world. These advances will partially depend upon designs that synergistically combine software with specialized hardware. Today open-source software incubates rapid software-only innovation. The government can unleash software-hardware innovation with programs to develop open hardware components, tools, and design flows that simplify and reduce the cost of hardware design. Such programs will speed development for startup companies, established industry leaders, education, scientific research, and for government intelligence and defense platforms.
