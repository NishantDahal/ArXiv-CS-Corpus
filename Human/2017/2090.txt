Toric Codes, Multiplicative Structure and Decoding

Long linear codes constructed from toric varieties over finite fields, their multiplicative structure and decoding. The main theme is the inherent multiplicative structure on toric codes. The multiplicative structure allows for \emph{decoding}, resembling the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes and aligns with decoding by error correcting pairs. We have used the multiplicative structure on toric codes to construct linear secret sharing schemes with \emph{strong multiplication} via Massey's construction generalizing the Shamir Linear secret sharing shemes constructed from Reed-Solomon codes. We have constructed quantum error correcting codes from toric surfaces by the Calderbank-Shor-Steane method.
