Hybrid Precoding for Massive MIMO Systems in Cloud RAN Architecture with Capacity-Limited Fronthauls

Cloud RAN (C-RAN) is a promising enabler for distributed massive MIMO systems, yet is vulnerable to its fronthaul congestion. To cope with the limited fronthaul capacity, this paper proposes a hybrid analog-digital precoding design that adaptively adjusts fronthaul compression levels and the number of active radio-frequency (RF) chains out of the entire RF chains in a downlink distributed massive MIMO system based on C-RAN architecture. Following this structure, we propose an analog beamformer design in pursuit of maximizing multi-user sum average data rate (sum-rate). Each element of the analog beamformer is constructed based on a weighted sum of spatial channel covariance matrices, while the size of the analog beamformer, i.e. the number of active RF chains, is optimized so as to maximize the large-scale approximated sum-rate. With these analog beamformer and RF chain activation, a regularized zero- forcing (RZF) digital beamformer is jointly optimized based on the instantaneous effective channel information observed through the given analog beamformer. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding algorithm is validated by simulation, and its design criterion is clarified by analysis.
