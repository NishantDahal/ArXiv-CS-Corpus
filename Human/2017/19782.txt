Improved Algorithm for Reconstructing Singular Connection in Multi-Block CFD Applications

An improved algorithm is proposed for the reconstruction of singular connectivity from the available pairwise connections during preprocessing phase. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, an in-house computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code is used in which high-order finite-difference method for spatial discretization running on the Tianhe-1A supercomputer is employed. Test cases with a varied amount of mesh points are chosen, and the test results indicate that the improved singular connection reconstruction algorithm can achieve a speedup factor of 1000X or more when compared with the naive search method adopted in the former version of our code. Moreover, the parallel efficiency can benefit from the strategy of local communication based on the algorithm.
