Towards seamless multi-view scene analysis from satellite to street-level

In this paper, we discuss and review how combined multi-view imagery from satellite to street-level can benefit scene analysis. Numerous works exist that merge information from remote sensing and images acquired from the ground for tasks like land cover mapping, object detection, or scene understanding. What makes the combination of overhead and street-level images challenging, is the strongly varying viewpoint, different scale, illumination, sensor modality and time of acquisition. Direct (dense) matching of images on a per-pixel basis is thus often impossible, and one has to resort to alternative strategies that will be discussed in this paper. We review recent works that attempt to combine images taken from the ground and overhead views for purposes like scene registration, reconstruction, or classification. Three methods that represent the wide range of potential methods and applications (change detection, image orientation, and tree cataloging) are described in detail. We show that cross-fertilization between remote sensing, computer vision and machine learning is very valuable to make the best of geographic data available from Earth Observation sensors and ground imagery. Despite its challenges, we believe that integrating these complementary data sources will lead to major breakthroughs in Big GeoData.
