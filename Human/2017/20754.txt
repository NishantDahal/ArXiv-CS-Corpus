A batching and scheduling optimisation for a cutting work-center: Acta-Mobilier case study

The purpose of this study is to investigate an approach to group lots in batches and to schedule these batches on Acta-Mobilier cutting work-center while taking into account numerous constraints and objectives. The specific batching method was proposed to handle the Acta-Mobilier problem and a mathematical formalisation and genetic algorithm were proposed to deal with the scheduling problem. The proposed algorithm has been embedded in software to optimise production costs and emphasis the visual management on the production line. The application is currently being used in Acta-Mobilier plant and shows significant results
