Linear Discriminant Generative Adversarial Networks

We develop a novel method for training of GANs for unsupervised and class conditional generation of images, called Linear Discriminant GAN (LD-GAN). The discriminator of an LD-GAN is trained to maximize the linear separability between distributions of hidden representations of generated and targeted samples, while the generator is updated based on the decision hyper-planes computed by performing LDA over the hidden representations. LD-GAN provides a concrete metric of separation capacity for the discriminator, and we experimentally show that it is possible to stabilize the training of LD-GAN simply by calibrating the update frequencies between generators and discriminators in the unsupervised case, without employment of normalization methods and constraints on weights. In the class conditional generation tasks, the proposed method shows improved training stability together with better generalization performance compared to WGAN that employs an auxiliary classifier.
