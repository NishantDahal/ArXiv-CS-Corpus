The Complexity of Probabilistic Justification Logic

Probabilistic justification logic is a modal logic with two kind of modalities: probability measures and explicit justification terms. We present a tableau procedure that can be used to decide the satisfiability problem for this logic in polynomial space. We show that this upper complexity bound is tight.
