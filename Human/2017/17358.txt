Algebraic Message Authentication Codes

This paper suggests a message authentication scheme, which can be efficiently used for secure digital signature creation. The algorithm used here is an adjusted union of the concepts which underlie projective geometry and group structure on circles. The authentication is done through a key, which iterates over the complete message string to produce the signature. The iteration is not only based on the frequency distribution of the message string alphabet, but also on the probability of occurrence of another given reference string in the message. The complete process can be easily computed in a small time, producing signatures which are highly dependent on the message string. Consequently, the odds in favor of existence of a forgery are highly reduced.
