How long delays impact TCP performance for a connectivity from Reunion Island ?

TCP is the protocol of transport the most used in the Internet and have a heavy-dependence on delay. Reunion Island have a specific Internet connection, based on main links to France, located 10.000 km away. As a result, the minimal delay between Reunion Island and France is around 180 ms. In this paper, we will study TCP traces collected in Reunion Island University. The goal is to determine the metrics to study the impacts of long delays on TCP performance.
