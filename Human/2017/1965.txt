Streaming supercomputing needs workflow-enabled programming-in-the-large

This is a position paper, submitted to the Future Online Analysis Platform Workshop (https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/futureplatform/), which argues that simple data analysis applications are common today, but future online supercomputing workloads will need to couple multiple advanced technologies (streams, caches, analysis, and simulations) to rapidly deliver scientific results. Each of these technologies are active research areas when integrated with high-performance computing. These components will interact in complex ways, therefore coupling them needs to be programmed. Programming in the large, on top of existing applications, enables us to build much more capable applications and to productively manage this complexity.
