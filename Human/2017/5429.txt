Finding Mirror Symmetry via Registration

Symmetry is prevalent in nature and a common theme in man-made designs. Both the human visual system and computer vision algorithms can use symmetry to facilitate object recognition and other tasks. Detecting mirror symmetry in images and data is, therefore, useful for a number of applications. Here, we demonstrate that the problem of fitting a plane of mirror symmetry to data in any Euclidian space can be reduced to the problem of registering two datasets. The exactness of the resulting solution depends entirely on the registration accuracy. This new Mirror Symmetry via Registration (MSR) framework involves (1) data reflection with respect to an arbitrary plane, (2) registration of original and reflected datasets, and (3) calculation of the eigenvector of eigenvalue -1 for the transformation matrix representing the reflection and registration mappings. To support MSR, we also introduce a novel 2D registration method based on random sample consensus of an ensemble of normalized cross-correlation matches. With this as its registration back-end, MSR achieves state-of-the-art performance for symmetry line detection in two independent 2D testing databases. We further demonstrate the generality of MSR by testing it on a database of 3D shapes with an iterative closest point registration back-end. Finally, we explore its applicability to examining symmetry in natural systems by assessing the degree of symmetry present in myelinated axon reconstructions from a larval zebrafish.
