Process Description, Behavior, and Control

Modeling processes are the activities of capturing and representing processes and control of their dynamic behavior. Desired features of the model include capture of relevant aspects of a real phenomenon, understandability, and completeness of static and dynamic specifications. This paper proposes a diagrammatic language for engineering process modeling that provides an integration tool for capturing the static description of processes, framing their behaviors in terms of events, and utilizing the resultant model for controlling processes. Without loss of generality, the focus of the paper is on process modeling in the area of computer engineering, and specifically, on modeling of computer services. To demonstrate the viability of the method, the proposed model is applied to depicting flow of services in the Information Technology department of a government ministry.
