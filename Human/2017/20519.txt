LDPC Code Design for Distributed Storage: Balancing Repair Bandwidth, Reliability and Storage Overhead

Distributed storage systems suffer from significant repair traffic generated due to frequent storage node failures. This paper shows that properly designed low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can substantially reduce the amount of required block downloads for repair thanks to the sparse nature of their factor graph representation. In particular, with a careful construction of the factor graph, both low repair-bandwidth and high reliability can be achieved for a given code rate. First, a formula for the average repair bandwidth of LDPC codes is developed. This formula is then used to establish that the minimum repair bandwidth can be achieved by forcing a regular check node degree in the factor graph. Moreover, it is shown that given a fixed code rate, the variable node degree should also be regular to yield minimum repair bandwidth, under some reasonable minimum variable node degree constraint. It is also shown that for a given repair-bandwidth requirement, LDPC codes can yield substantially higher reliability than currently utilized Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Our reliability analysis is based on a formulation of the general equation for the mean-time-to-data-loss (MTTDL) associated with LDPC codes. The formulation reveals that the stopping number is closely related to the MTTDL. It is further shown that LDPC codes can be designed such that a small loss of repair-bandwidth optimality may be traded for a large improvement in erasure-correction capability and thus the MTTDL.
