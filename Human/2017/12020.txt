On the expressive power of quasiperiodic SFT

In this paper we study the shifts, which are the shift-invariant and topologically closed sets of configurations over a finite alphabet in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The minimal shifts are those shifts in which all configurations contain exactly the same patterns. Two classes of shifts play a prominent role in symbolic dynamics, in language theory and in the theory of computability: the shifts of finite type (obtained by forbidding a finite number of finite patterns) and the effective shifts (obtained by forbidding a computably enumerable set of finite patterns). We prove that every effective minimal shift can be represented as a factor of a projective subdynamics on a minimal shift of finite type in a bigger (by $1$) dimension. This result transfers to the class of minimal shifts a theorem by M.Hochman known for the class of all effective shifts and thus answers an open question by E.Jeandel. We prove a similar result for quasiperiodic shifts and also show that there exists a quasiperiodic shift of finite type for which Kolmogorov complexity of all patterns of size $n\times n$ is $Î©(n)$.
