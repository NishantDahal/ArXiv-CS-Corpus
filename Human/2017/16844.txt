Applications of some special numbers obtained from a difference equation of degree three

In this paper we present applications of some special numbers obtained from a difference equation of degree three, especially in the Coding Theory. As a particular case, we obtain the generalized Pell-Fibonacci-Lucas numbers, which were extended to the generalized quaternions.
