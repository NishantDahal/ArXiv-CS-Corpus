A novel type of Automata for dynamic, heterogeneous and random architectures

In this paper, the author aims to establish a mathematical model for a mimic computer. To this end, a novel automaton is proposed. First, a one-dimensional cellular automaton is used for expressing some dynamic changes in the structure of a computing unit, a sequential automaton is employed to describe some state transitions, a hierarchical automaton is employed to express the different granularities of some computing units, and a probabilistic automaton is used to depict some random changes of a computing unit. Second, the new automaton is obtained by combining the various types of automata mentioned above in the certain logical relationship. To the best of our knowledge, the new automaton model is the first automaton which can portray the operation semantics for a mimic computing system, and it can directly describe some behaviors of a mimic computer.
