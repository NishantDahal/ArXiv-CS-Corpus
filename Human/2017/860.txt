Colored Image Encryption and Decryption Using Chaotic Lorenz System and DCT2

In this paper, a scheme for the encryption and decryption of colored images by using the Lorenz system and the discrete cosine transform in two dimensions (DCT2) is proposed. Although chaos is random, it has deterministic features that can be used for encryption; further, the same sequences can be produced at the transmitter and receiver under the same initial conditions. Another property of DCT2 is that the energy is concentrated in some elements of the coefficients. These two properties are used to efficiently encrypt and recover the image at the receiver by using three different keys with three different predefined number of shifts for each instance of key usage. Simulation results and statistical analysis show that the scheme high performance in weakening the correlation between the pixels of the image that resulted from the inverse of highest energy values of DCT2 that form 99.9 % of the energy as well as those of the difference image.
