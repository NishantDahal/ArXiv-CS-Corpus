Fast Encoding and Decoding of Flexible-Rate and Flexible-Length Polar Codes

This work is on fast encoding and decoding of polar codes. We propose and detail 8-bit and 16-bit parallel decoders that can be used to reduce the decoding latency of the successive-cancellation decoder. These decoders are universal and can decode flexible-rate and flexible-length polar codes. We also present fast encoders that can be used to increase the throughput of serially-implemented polar encoders.
