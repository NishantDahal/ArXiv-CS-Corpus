Convex programming in optimal control and information theory

The main theme of this thesis is the development of computational methods for classes of infinite-dimensional optimization problems arising in optimal control and information theory. The first part of the thesis is concerned with the optimal control of discrete-time continuous space Markov decision processes (MDP). The second part is centred around two fundamental problems in information theory that can be expressed as optimization problems: the channel capacity problem as well as the entropy maximization subject to moment constraints.
