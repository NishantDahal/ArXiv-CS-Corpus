CIM compliant multiplatform approach for cyber-physical energy system assessment

With high penetration of distributed renewable energy resources along with sophisticated automation and information technology, cyber-physical energy systems (CPES, i.e. Smart Grids here) requires a holistic approach to evaluate the integration at a system level, addressing all relevant domains. Hybrid cloud SCADA (Supervisory, Control And Data Acquisition), allowing laboratories to be linked in a consistent infrastructure can provide the support for such multi-platform experiments. This paper presents the procedure to implement a CIM (Common Information Model) compliant hybrid cloud SCADA, with database and client adaptive to change in system topology, as well as CIM library update. This innovative way ensures interoperability among the partner platforms and provides support to multi-platform holistic approach for CPES assessment.
