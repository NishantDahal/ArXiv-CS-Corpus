Implementing NB-IoT in Software - Experiences Using the srsLTE Library

NB-IoT is the 3GPP standard for machine-to-machine communications, recently finalized within LTE release 13. This article gives a brief overview about this new LTE-based radio access technology and presents a implementation developed using the srsLTE software radio suite. We also carry out a performance study in which we compare a theoretical analysis with experimental results obtained in our testbed. Furthermore, we provide some interesting details and share our experience in exploring one of the worldwide first commercial NB-IoT deployments.
