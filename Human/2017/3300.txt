Parameters of two classes of LCD BCH codes

Historically, LCD cyclic codes were referred to as reversible cyclic codes, which had application in data storage. Due to a newly discovered application in cryptography, there has been renewed interest on LCD codes. In this paper, we explore two special families of LCD cyclic codes, which are both BCH codes. The dimensions and the minimum distances of these LCD BCH codes are investigated. As a byproduct, the parameters of some primitive BCH codes are also obtained.
