Two-Dimensional Indirect Binary Search for the Positive One-in-Three Satisfiability Problem

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the positive one-in-three satisfiability problem (Pos1in3SAT). The proposed algorithm can efficiently decide the existence of a satisfying assignment in all assignments for a given formula by using a 2-dimensional binary search method without constructing an exponential number of assignments.
