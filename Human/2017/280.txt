Interactive Proof Presentations with Cobra

We present Cobra, a modern proof presentation framework, leveraging cutting-edge presentation technology together with a state of the art interactive theorem prover to present formalized mathematics as active documents. Cobra provides both an easy way to present proofs and a novel approach to auditorium interaction. The presentation is checked live by the theorem prover, and moreover allows for live changes both by the presenter and the audience.
