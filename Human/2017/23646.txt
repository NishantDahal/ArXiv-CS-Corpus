Robust Saliency Detection via Fusing Foreground and Background Priors

Automatic Salient object detection has received tremendous attention from research community and has been an increasingly important tool in many computer vision tasks. This paper proposes a novel bottom-up salient object detection framework which considers both foreground and background cues. First, A series of background and foreground seeds are selected from an image reliably, and then used for calculation of saliency map separately. Next, a combination of foreground and background saliency map is performed. Last, a refinement step based on geodesic distance is utilized to enhance salient regions, thus deriving the final saliency map. Particularly we provide a robust scheme for seeds selection which contributes a lot to accuracy improvement in saliency detection. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against other outstanding methods.
