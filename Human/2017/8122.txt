Orthogonal Ramanujan Sums, its properties and Applications in Multiresolution Analysis

Signal processing community has recently shown interest in Ramanujan sums which was defined by S.Ramanujan in 1918. In this paper we have proposed Orthog- onal Ramanujan Sums (ORS) based on Ramanujan sums. In this paper we present two novel application of ORS. Firstly a new representation of a finite length signal is given using ORS which is defined as Orthogonal Ramanujan Periodic Transform.Secondly ORS has been applied to multiresolution analysis and it is shown that Haar transform is a spe- cial case.
