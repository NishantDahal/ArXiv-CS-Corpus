Study Morphology of Minimum Spanning Tree Problem and Generalized Algorithms

In this paper, we study the form over the minimum spanning tree problem (MST) from which we will derive an intuitively generalized model and new methods with the upper bound of runtimes of logarithm. The new pattern we made has taken successful to better equilibrium the benefits of local and global when we employ the strategy of divide and conquer to optimize solutions on problem. Under new model, we let the course of clustering become more transparent with many details, so that the whole solution may be featured of much reasonable, flexibility, efficiency and approach to reveal or reflect the reality. There are some important methods and avenues as fruits derived from discussions or trial which can be broad usefulness in the fields of graphic analysis, data mining, k-means clustering problem and so forth.
