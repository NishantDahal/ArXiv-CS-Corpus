Binary Images of Z2Z4-Additive Cyclic Codes

A Z2Z4-additive code C is called cyclic if the set of coordinates can be partitioned into two subsets, the set of Z_2 and the set of Z_4 coordinates, such that any cyclic shift of the coordinates of both subsets leaves the code invariant. We study the binary images of Z2Z4-additive cyclic codes. We determine all Z2Z4-additive cyclic codes with odd beta whose Gray images are linear binary codes.
