On some difficulties in the addition of trapezoidal ordered fuzzy numbers

At the first, we revise the Kosinski definition of the sum of ordered fuzzy numbers. The associativity of revised sum is investigated here. In addition, we show that the multiple revised sum of finite sequence of trapezoidal ordered fuzzy numbers depends on its summands ordering.
