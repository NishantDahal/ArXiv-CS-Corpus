Summary of Topological Study of Chaotic CBC Mode of Operation

In cryptography, block ciphers are the most fundamental elements in many symmetric-key encryption systems. The Cipher Block Chaining, denoted CBC, presents one of the most famous mode of operation that uses a block cipher to provide confidentiality or authenticity. In this research work, we intend to summarize our results that have been detailed in our previous series of articles. The goal of this series has been to obtain a complete topological study of the CBC block cipher mode of operation after proving his chaotic behavior according to the reputed definition of Devaney.
