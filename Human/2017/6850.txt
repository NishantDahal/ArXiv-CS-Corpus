Beliefs and Probability in Bacchus' l.p. Logic: A~3-Valued Logic Solution to Apparent Counter-intuition

Fundamental discrepancy between first order logic and statistical inference (global versus local properties of universe) is shown to be the obstacle for integration of logic and probability in L.p. logic of Bacchus. To overcome the counterintuitiveness of L.p. behaviour, a 3-valued logic is proposed.
