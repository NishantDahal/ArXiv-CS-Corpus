Neural Translation of Musical Style

Music is an expressive form of communication often used to convey emotion in scenarios where "words are not enough". Part of this information lies in the musical composition where well-defined language exists. However, a significant amount of information is added during a performance as the musician interprets the composition. The performer injects expressiveness into the written score through variations of different musical properties such as dynamics and tempo. In this paper, we describe a model that can learn to perform sheet music. Our research concludes that the generated performances are indistinguishable from a human performance, thereby passing a test in the spirit of a "musical Turing test".
