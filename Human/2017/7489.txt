An Online Secretary Framework for Fog Network Formation with Minimal Latency

Fog computing is seen as a promising approach to perform distributed, low-latency computation for supporting Internet of Things applications. However, due to the unpredictable arrival of available neighboring fog nodes, the dynamic formation of a fog network can be challenging. In essence, a given fog node must smartly select the set of neighboring fog nodes that can provide low-latency computations. In this paper, this problem of fog network formation and task distribution is studied considering a hybrid cloud-fog architecture. The goal of the proposed framework is to minimize the maximum computational latency by enabling a given fog node to form a suitable fog network, under uncertainty on the arrival process of neighboring fog nodes. To solve this problem, a novel approach based on the online secretary framework is proposed. To find the desired set of neighboring fog nodes, an online algorithm is developed to enable a task initiating fog node to decide on which other nodes can be used as part of its fog network, to offload computational tasks, without knowing any prior information on the future arrivals of those other nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online algorithm can successfully select an optimal set of neighboring fog nodes while achieving a latency that is as small as the one resulting from an ideal, offline scheme that has complete knowledge of the system. The results also show how, using the proposed approach, the computational tasks can be properly distributed between the fog network and a remote cloud server.
