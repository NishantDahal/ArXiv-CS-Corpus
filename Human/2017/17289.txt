Latent common manifold learning with alternating diffusion: analysis and applications

The analysis of data sets arising from multiple sensors has drawn significant research attention over the years. Traditional methods, including kernel-based methods, are typically incapable of capturing nonlinear geometric structures. We introduce a latent common manifold model underlying multiple sensor observations for the purpose of multimodal data fusion. A method based on alternating diffusion is presented and analyzed; we provide theoretical analysis of the method under the latent common manifold model. To exemplify the power of the proposed framework, experimental results in several applications are reported.
