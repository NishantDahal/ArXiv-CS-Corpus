Machine-Translation History and Evolution: Survey for Arabic-English Translations

As a result of the rapid changes in information and communication technology (ICT), the world has become a small village where people from all over the world connect with each other in dialogue and communication via the Internet. Also, communications have become a daily routine activity due to the new globalization where companies and even universities become global residing cross countries borders. As a result, translation becomes a needed activity in this connected world. ICT made it possible to have a student in one country take a course or even a degree from a different country anytime anywhere easily. The resulted communication still needs a language as a means that helps the receiver understands the contents of the sent message. People need an automated translation application because human translators are hard to find all the times, and the human translations are very expensive comparing to the translations automated process. Several types of research describe the electronic process of the Machine-Translation. In this paper, the authors are going to study some of these previous researches, and they will explore some of the needed tools for the Machine-Translation. This research is going to contribute to the Machine-Translation area by helping future researchers to have a summary for the Machine-Translation groups of research and to let lights on the importance of the translation mechanism.
