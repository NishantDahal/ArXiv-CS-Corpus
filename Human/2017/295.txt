Privacy Protection for Mobile Cloud Data: A Network Coding Approach

Taking into account of both the huge computing power of intruders and untrusted cloud servers, we develop an enhanced secure pseudonym scheme to protect the privacy of mobile cloud data. To face the huge computing power challenge, we develop an unconditionally secure lightweight network coding pseudonym scheme. For the privacy issue of untrusted cloud server, we further design a two tier network coding to decouple the stored mobile cloud data from the owner pseudonyms. Therefore, our proposed network coding based pseudonym scheme can simultaneously defend against attackers from both outside and inside. We implement our proposed two-tier light-weight network coding mechanism in a group location based service (LBS) using untrusted cloud database. Compared to computationally secure Hash-based pseudonym, our proposed scheme is not only unconditionally secure, but also can reduce more than 90 percent of processing time as well as 10 percent of energy consumption.
