One-Class Semi-Supervised Learning: Detecting Linearly Separable Class by its Mean

In this paper, we presented a novel semi-supervised one-class classification algorithm which assumes that class is linearly separable from other elements. We proved theoretically that class is linearly separable if and only if it is maximal by probability within the sets with the same mean. Furthermore, we presented an algorithm for identifying such linearly separable class utilizing linear programming. We described three application cases including an assumption of linear separability, Gaussian distribution, and the case of linear separability in transformed space of kernel functions. Finally, we demonstrated the work of the proposed algorithm on the USPS dataset and analyzed the relationship of the performance of the algorithm and the size of the initially labeled sample.
