Conformal k-NN Anomaly Detector for Univariate Data Streams

Anomalies in time-series data give essential and often actionable information in many applications. In this paper we consider a model-free anomaly detection method for univariate time-series which adapts to non-stationarity in the data stream and provides probabilistic abnormality scores based on the conformal prediction paradigm. Despite its simplicity the method performs on par with complex prediction-based models on the Numenta Anomaly Detection benchmark and the Yahoo! S5 dataset.
