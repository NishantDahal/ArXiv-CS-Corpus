A Distributed Auction Policy for User Association in Device-to-Device Caching Networks

We propose a distributed bidding-aided Matern carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) policy for device-to-device (D2D) content distribution. The network is composed of D2D receivers and potential D2D transmitters, i.e., transmitters are turned on or off by the scheduling algorithm. Each D2D receiver determines the value of its request, by bidding on the set of potential transmitters in its communication range. Given a medium access probability, a fraction of the potential transmitters are jointly scheduled, i.e., turned on, determined jointly by the auction policy and the power control scheme. The bidding-aided scheduling algorithm exploits (i) the local demand distribution, (ii) spatial distribution of D2D node locations, and (iii) the cache configurations of the potential transmitters. We contrast the performance of the bidding-aided CSMA policy with other well-known CSMA schemes that do not take into account (i)-(iii), demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a higher spectral efficiency in terms of the number of bits transmitted per unit time per unit bandwidth per user. The gain becomes even more visible under randomized configurations and requests rather than more skewed placement configurations and deterministic demand distributions.
