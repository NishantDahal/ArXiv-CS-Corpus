Adaptation des r{Ã©}seaux sociaux d'entreprise pour favoriser l'apprentissage informel sur le lieu de travail

The informal learning in the workplace is realized during daily collaborators' activities and represent more than 75 % of the learning occurring in a company. Enterprise social networks are currently massively used to promote this type of learning. From a pilot study, we show that they are actually adapted concerning the social aspects, but that the design must be rethought to consider user contextual needs linked to the content and access to informational corpus, the information quality indicators and the forms of moderation and control.
