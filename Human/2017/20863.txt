Random Projection and Its Applications

Random Projection is a foundational research topic that connects a bunch of machine learning algorithms under a similar mathematical basis. It is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by projecting the data points efficiently to a smaller dimensions while preserving the original relative distance between the data points. In this paper, we are intended to explain random projection method, by explaining its mathematical background and foundation, the applications that are currently adopting it, and an overview on its current research perspective.
