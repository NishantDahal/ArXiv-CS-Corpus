Interpretation of Mammogram and Chest X-Ray Reports Using Deep Neural Networks - Preliminary Results

Radiology reports are an important means of communication between radiologists and other physicians. These reports express a radiologist's interpretation of a medical imaging examination and are critical in establishing a diagnosis and formulating a treatment plan. In this paper, we propose a Bi-directional convolutional neural network (Bi-CNN) model for the interpretation and classification of mammograms based on breast density and chest radiographic radiology reports based on the basis of chest pathology. The proposed approach helps to organize databases of radiology reports, retrieve them expeditiously, and evaluate the radiology report that could be used in an auditing system to decrease incorrect diagnoses. Our study revealed that the proposed Bi-CNN outperforms the random forest and the support vector machine methods.
