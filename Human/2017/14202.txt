Polar Codes for SCMA Systems

In this paper, we design and compare multilevel polar coding (MLPC) and bit-interleaved polar coded modulation (BIPCM) for uplink sparse code multiple access (SCMA) systems that operate over fast and block fading channels. Both successive cancellation (SC) and successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are considered. Simulation results show that, with either decoder, BIPCM performs better than its MLPC counterpart. Also, both BIPCM and MLPC exhibit a performance advantage over LTE turbo-coded and WiMAX LDPC SCMA systems when the SCL technique is used for decoding.
