Wireless Sensor Network based System for the Prevention of Hospital Acquired Infections

Hospital acquired infections are a serious threat to the health and well-being of patients and medical staff within clinical units. Many of these infections arise as a consequence of medical personnel that come into contact with contaminated persons, surfaces or equipment and then with patients, without following proper hygiene procedures. In this paper we present our ongoing efforts in the development of a wireless sensor network based cyber-physical system which aims to prevent hospital infections by increasing compliance to established hygiene guidelines. The solution, currently developed under European Union funding integrates a network of sensors for monitoring clinical workflows and ambient conditions, a workflow engine that executes encoded workflow instances and monitoring software that provides real-time information in case of infection risk detection. As a motivating example, we employ the workflow in the general practitioner's office in order to comprehensively present types of sensors and their positioning in the monitored location. Using the information collected by deployed sensors, the system is capable of immediately detecting infection risks and taking action to prevent the spread of infections.
