Frequency Offset Estimation and Training Sequence Design for MIMO OFDM

This paper addresses carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation and training sequence design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over frequency selective fading channels. By exploiting the orthogonality of the training sequences in the frequency domain, integer CFO (ICFO) is estimated. {With the uniformly spaced non-zero pilots in the training sequences} and the corresponding geometric mapping, fractional CFO (FCFO) is estimated through the roots of a real polynomial. Furthermore, the condition for the training sequences to guarantee estimation identifiability is developed. Through the analysis of the correlation property of the training sequences, two types of sub-optimal training sequences generated from the Chu sequence are constructed. Simulation results verify the good performance of the CFO estimator assisted by the proposed training sequences.
