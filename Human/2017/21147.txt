Supervised Q-walk for Learning Vector Representation of Nodes in Networks

Automatic feature learning algorithms are at the forefront of modern day machine learning research. We present a novel algorithm, supervised Q-walk, which applies Q-learning to generate random walks on graphs such that the walks prove to be useful for learning node features suitable for tackling with the node classification problem. We present another novel algorithm, k-hops neighborhood based confidence values learner, which learns confidence values of labels for unlabelled nodes in the network without first learning the node embedding. These confidence values aid in learning an apt reward function for Q-learning.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of supervised Q-walk approach over existing state-of-the-art random walk based node embedding learners in solving the single / multi-label multi-class node classification problem using several real world datasets.
  Summarising, our approach represents a novel state-of-the-art technique to learn features, for nodes in networks, tailor-made for dealing with the node classification problem.
