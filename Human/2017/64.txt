ICT Green Governance: new generation model based on Corporate Social Responsibility and Green IT

The strategy of sustainable development in the governance of information and communication technology (ICT) is a sector of advanced research that leads to rising challenges posed by social and environmental requirements in the implementation and establishment of the governance strategy. This paper offers new generation governance model that we call "ICT Green Governance". The proposed framework provides an original model based on the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) concept and Green IT strategy. Facing increasing pressure from stakeholders, the model offers a new vision of ICT governance to ensure effective and efficient use of ICT in enabling an enterprise to achieve its goals. We present here the relevance of our model, on the basis of a literature review, and provide guidelines and principles for effective ICT governance in the way of sustainable development, in order to improve the economic, social and environmental performance of companies.
