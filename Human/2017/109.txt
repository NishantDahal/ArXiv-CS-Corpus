Integer-Forcing Message Recovering in Interference Channels

In this paper, we propose a scheme referred to as integer-forcing message recovering (IFMR) to enable receivers to recover their desirable messages in interference channels. Compared to the state-of-the- art integer-forcing linear receiver (IFLR), our proposed IFMR approach needs to decode considerably less number of messages. In our method, each receiver recovers independent linear integer combinations of the desirable messages each from two independent equations. We propose an efficient algorithm to sequentially find the equations and integer combinations with maximum rates. We evaluate the performance of our scheme and compare the results with the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and zero-forcing (ZF), as well as the IFLR schemes. The results indicate that our IFMR scheme outperforms the MMSE and ZF schemes, in terms of achievable rate, considerably. Also, compared to IFLR, the IFMR scheme achieves slightly less rates in moderate signal-to-noise ratios, with significantly less implementation complexity.
