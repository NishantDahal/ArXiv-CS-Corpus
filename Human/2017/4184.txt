Modelling and Verification of a Cluster-tree Formation Protocol Implementation for the IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH MAC Operation Mode

Correct and efficient initialization of wireless sensor networks can be challenging in the face of many uncertainties present in ad hoc wireless networks. In this paper we examine an implementation for the formation of a cluster-tree topology in a network which operates on top of the TSCH MAC operation mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and investigate it using formal methods. We show how both the mCRL2 language and toolset help us in identifying  scenarios where the implementation does not form a proper topology. More importantly, our analysis leads to the conclusion that the cluster-tree formation algorithm has a super linear time complexity. So, it does not scale to large networks.
