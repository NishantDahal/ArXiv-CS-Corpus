Predicting Discharge Medications at Admission Time Based on Deep Learning

Predicting discharge medications right after a patient being admitted is an important clinical decision, which provides physicians with guidance on what type of medication regimen to plan for and what possible changes on initial medication may occur during an inpatient stay. It also facilitates medication reconciliation process with easy detection of medication discrepancy at discharge time to improve patient safety. However, since the information available upon admission is limited and patients' condition may evolve during an inpatient stay, these predictions could be a difficult decision for physicians to make. In this work, we investigate how to leverage deep learning technologies to assist physicians in predicting discharge medications based on information documented in the admission note. We build a convolutional neural network which takes an admission note as input and predicts the medications placed on the patient at discharge time. Our method is able to distill semantic patterns from unstructured and noisy texts, and is capable of capturing the pharmacological correlations among medications. We evaluate our method on 25K patient visits and compare with 4 strong baselines. Our methods demonstrate a 20% increase in macro-averaged F1 score than the best baseline.
