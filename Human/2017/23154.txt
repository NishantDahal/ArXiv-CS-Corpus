Judgment aggregation in non-classical logics

This work contributes to the theory of judgment aggregation by discussing a number of significant non-classical logics. After adapting the standard framework of judgment aggregation to cope with non-classical logics, we discuss in particular results for the case of Intuitionistic Logic, the Lambek calculus, Linear Logic and Relevant Logics. The motivation for studying judgment aggregation in non-classical logics is that they offer a number of modelling choices to represent agents' reasoning in aggregation problems. By studying judgment aggregation in logics that are weaker than classical logic, we investigate whether some well-known impossibility results, that were tailored for classical logic, still apply to those weak systems.
