Speaker Identification by GMM based i Vector

Speaker Identification process is to identify a particular vocal cord from a set of existing speakers. In the speaker identification processes, unknown speaker voice sample targets each of the existing speakers present in the system and gives a predication. The predication may be more than one existing known speaker voice and is very close to the unknown speaker voice. The model is a Gaussian mixture model built by the extracted acoustic feature vectors from voice. The i-vector based dimension compression mapping function of the channel depended speaker, and super vector give better predicted scores according to cosine distance scoring associated with the order pair of speakers. In the order pair, the first coordinate is the unknown speaker i.e. test speaker, and the second coordinates is the existing known speaker i.e. target speaker. This paper presents the enhancement of the prediction based on i- vector in compare to the normalized set of predicted score. In the simulation, known speaker voices are collected through different channels and in different languages. In the testing, the GMM voice models, and GMM based i-Vector speaker voice models of the known speakers are used among the numbers of clusters in the test data set.
