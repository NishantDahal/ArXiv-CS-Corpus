Molecular Model Checking a Temporal Logic

The molecular computing has been successfully employed to solve more and more complex computation problems. However, as an important complex problem, the model checking are still far from fully resolved under the circumstance of molecular computing, since it is still a lack of method. To address this issue, a model checking method is presented for checking the basic constructs in a given temporal logic using molecular computing. Through the design of the new encoding and calling this process, we get a molecule-based approach for checking all of the basic constructs of this logic.
