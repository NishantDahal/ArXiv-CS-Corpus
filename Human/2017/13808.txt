Synthesis of Optimal Resilient Control Strategies

Repair mechanisms are important within resilient systems to maintain the system in an operational state after an error occurred. Usually, constraints on the repair mechanisms are imposed, e.g., concerning the time or resources required (such as energy consumption or other kinds of costs). For systems modeled by Markov decision processes (MDPs), we introduce the concept of resilient schedulers, which represent control strategies guaranteeing that these constraints are always met within some given probability. Assigning rewards to the operational states of the system, we then aim towards resilient schedulers which maximize the long-run average reward, i.e., the expected mean payoff. We present a pseudo-polynomial algorithm that decides whether a resilient scheduler exists and if so, yields an optimal resilient scheduler. We show also that already the decision problem asking whether there exists a resilient scheduler is PSPACE-hard.
