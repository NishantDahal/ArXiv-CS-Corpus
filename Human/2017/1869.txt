Approval Voting with Intransitive Preferences

We extend Approval voting to the settings where voters may have intransitive preferences. The major obstacle to applying Approval voting in these settings is that voters are not able to clearly determine who they should approve or disapprove, due to the intransitivity of their preferences. An approach to address this issue is to apply tournament solutions to help voters make the decision. We study a class of voting systems where first each voter casts a vote defined as a tournament, then a well-defined tournament solution is applied to select the candidates who are assumed to be approved by the voter. Winners are the ones receiving the most approvals. We study axiomatic properties of this class of voting systems and complexity of control and bribery problems for these voting systems.
