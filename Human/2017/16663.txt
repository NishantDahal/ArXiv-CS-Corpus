Joint Sum Rate And Error Probability Optimization: Finite Blocklength Analysis

We study the tradeoff between the sum rate and the error probability in downlink of wireless networks. Using the recent results on the achievable rates of finite-length codewords, the problem is cast as a joint optimization of the network sum rate and the per-user error probability. Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer technique to simultaneously maximize the network sum rate and minimize the maximum users' error probability and to evaluate the effect of the codewords length on the system performance. The results show that, in delay-constrained scenarios, optimizing the per-user error probability plays a key role in achieving high throughput.
