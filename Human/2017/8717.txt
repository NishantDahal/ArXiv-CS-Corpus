End-to-end Planning of Fixed Millimeter-Wave Networks

This article discusses a framework to support the design and end-to-end planning of fixed millimeter-wave networks. Compared to traditional techniques, the framework allows an organization to quickly plan a deployment in a cost-effective way. We start by using LiDAR data---basically, a 3D point cloud captured from a city---to estimate potential sites to deploy antennas and whether there is line-of-sight between them. With that data on hand, we use combinatorial optimization techniques to determine the optimal set of locations and how they should communicate with each other, to satisfy engineering (e.g., latency, polarity), design (e.g., reliability) and financial (e.g., total cost of operation) constraints. The primary goal is to connect as many people as possible to the network. Our methodology can be used for strategic planning when an organization is in the process of deciding whether to adopt a millimeter-wave technology or choosing between locations, or for operational planning when conducting a detailed design of the actual network to be deployed in a selected location.
