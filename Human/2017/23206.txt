IP Video Conferencing: A Tutorial

Video conferencing is a well-established area of communications, which have been studied for decades. Recently this area has received a new impulse due to significantly increased bandwidth of Local and Wide area networks, appearance of low-priced video equipment and development of web based media technologies. This paper presents the main techniques behind the modern IP-based videoconferencing services, with a particular focus on codecs, network protocols, architectures and standardization efforts. Questions of security and topologies are also tackled. A description of a typical video conference scenario is provided, demonstrating how the technologies, responsible for different conference aspects, are working together. Traditional industrial disposition as well as modern innovative approaches are both addressed. Current industry trends are highlighted in respect to the topics, described in the tutorial. Legacy analog/digital technologies, together with the gateways between the traditional and the IP videoconferencing systems, are not considered.
