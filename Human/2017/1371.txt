Determination of Bond Wire Failure Probabilities in Microelectronic Packages

This work deals with the computation of industry-relevant bond wire failure probabilities in microelectronic packages. Under operating conditions, a package is subject to Joule heating that can lead to electrothermally induced failures. Manufacturing tolerances result, e.g., in uncertain bond wire geometries that often induce very small failure probabilities requiring a high number of Monte Carlo (MC) samples to be computed. Therefore, a hybrid MC sampling scheme that combines the use of an expensive computer model with a cheap surrogate is used. The fraction of surrogate evaluations is maximized using an iterative procedure, yielding accurate results at reduced cost. Moreover, the scheme is non-intrusive, i.e., existing code can be reused. The algorithm is used to compute the failure probability for an example package and the computational savings are assessed by performing a surrogate efficiency study.
