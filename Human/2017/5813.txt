Characterization of metrics induced by hierarchical posets

In this paper we consider metrics determined by hierarchical posets and give explicit formulae for the main parameters of a linear code: the minimum distance and the packing, covering and Chebyshev radii of a code. We also present ten characterizations of hierarchical poset metrics, including new characterizations and simple new proofs to the known ones.
