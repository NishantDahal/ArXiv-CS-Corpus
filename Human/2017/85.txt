Self-Adaptation of Activity Recognition Systems to New Sensors

Traditional activity recognition systems work on the basis of training, taking a fixed set of sensors into account. In this article, we focus on the question how pattern recognition can leverage new information sources without any, or with minimal user input. Thus, we present an approach for opportunistic activity recognition, where ubiquitous sensors lead to dynamically changing input spaces. Our method is a variation of well-established principles of machine learning, relying on unsupervised clustering to discover structure in data and inferring cluster labels from a small number of labeled dates in a semi-supervised manner. Elaborating the challenges, evaluations of over 3000 sensor combinations from three multi-user experiments are presented in detail and show the potential benefit of our approach.
