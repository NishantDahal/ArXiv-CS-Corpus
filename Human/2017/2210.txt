Fast, Warped Graph Embedding: Unifying Framework and One-Click Algorithm

What is the best way to describe a user in a social network with just a few numbers? Mathematically, this is equivalent to assigning a vector representation to each node in a graph, a process called graph embedding. We propose a novel framework, GEM-D that unifies most of the past algorithms such as LapEigs, DeepWalk and node2vec. GEM-D achieves its goal by decomposing any graph embedding algorithm into three building blocks: node proximity function, warping function and loss function. Based on thorough analysis of GEM-D, we propose a novel algorithm, called UltimateWalk, which outperforms the most-recently proposed state-of-the-art DeepWalk and node2vec. The contributions of this work are: (1) The proposed framework, GEM-D unifies the past graph embedding algorithms and provides a general recipe of how to design a graph embedding; (2) the nonlinearlity in the warping function contributes significantly to the quality of embedding and the exponential function is empirically optimal; (3) the proposed algorithm, UltimateWalk is one-click (no user-defined parameters), scalable and has a closed-form solution.
