Who Will Win Practical Artificial Intelligence? AI Engineerings in China

Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has won unprecedented attention and is becoming the increasingly popular focus in China. This change can be judged by the impressive record of academic publications, the amount of state-level investment and the presence of nation-wide participation and devotion. In this paper, we place emphasis on discussing the progress of artificial intelligence engineerings in China. We first introduce the focus on AI in Chinese academia, including the supercomputing brain system, Cambrian Period supercomputer of neural networks, and biometric systems. Then, the development of AI in industrial circles and the latest layout of AI products in companies, such as Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba, are introduced. Last, we bring in the opinions and arguments of the main intelligentsia of China about the future development of AI, including how to examine the relationship between humanity on one side and science and technology on the other.
