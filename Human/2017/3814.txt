Speech Enhancement using a Deep Mixture of Experts

In this study we present a Deep Mixture of Experts (DMoE) neural-network architecture for single microphone speech enhancement. By contrast to most speech enhancement algorithms that overlook the speech variability mainly caused by phoneme structure, our framework comprises a set of deep neural networks (DNNs), each one of which is an 'expert' in enhancing a given speech type corresponding to a phoneme. A gating DNN determines which expert is assigned to a given speech segment. A speech presence probability (SPP) is then obtained as a weighted average of the expert SPP decisions, with the weights determined by the gating DNN. A soft spectral attenuation, based on the SPP, is then applied to enhance the noisy speech signal. The experts and the gating components of the DMoE network are trained jointly. As part of the training, speech clustering into different subsets is performed in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, unlike previous methods, a phoneme-labeled database is not required for the training procedure. A series of experiments with different noise types verified the applicability of the new algorithm to the task of speech enhancement. The proposed scheme outperforms other schemes that either do not consider phoneme structure or use a simpler training methodology.
