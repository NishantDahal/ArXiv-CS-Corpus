MIS: Multimodal Interaction Services in a cloud perspective

The Web is becoming more and more a wide software framework on which each one can compose and use contents, software applications and services. It can offer adequate computational resources to manage the complexity implied by the use of the five senses when involved in human machine interaction. The core of the paper describes how SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) can support multimodal interaction by pushing the I/O processing and reasoning to the cloud, improving naturalness. The benefits of cloud computing for multimodal interaction have been identified by emphasizing the flexibility and scalability of a SOA, and its characteristics to provide a more holistic view of interaction according to the variety of situations and users.
