The method of artificial systems

This document is written with the intention to describe in detail a method and means by which a computer program can reason about the world and in so doing, increase its analogue to a living system. As the literature is rife and it is apparent we, as scientists and engineers, have not found the solution, this document will attempt the solution by grounding its intellectual arguments within tenets of human cognition in Western philosophy. The result will be a characteristic description of a method to describe an artificial system analogous to that performed for a human. The approach was the substance of my Master's thesis, explored more deeply during the course of my postdoc research. It focuses primarily on context awareness and choice set within a boundary of available epistemology, which serves to describe it. Expanded upon, such a description strives to discover agreement with Kant's critique of reason to understand how it could be applied to define the architecture of its design. The intention has never been to mimic human or biological systems, rather, to understand the profoundly fundamental rules, when leveraged correctly, results in an artificial consciousness as noumenon while in keeping with the perception of it as phenomenon.
