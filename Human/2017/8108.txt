The finite-state character of physical dynamics

Finite physical systems have only a finite amount of distinct state. This finiteness is fundamental in statistical mechanics, where the maximum number of distinct states compatible with macroscopic constraints defines entropy. Here we show that finiteness of distinct state is similarly fundamental in ordinary mechanics: energy and momentum are defined by the maximum number of distinct states possible in a given time or distance. More generally, any moment of energy or momentum bounds distinct states in time or space. These results generalize both the Nyquist bandwidth-bound on distinct values in classical signals, and quantum uncertainty bounds. The new certainty bounds are achieved by finite-bandwidth evolutions in which time and space are effectively discrete, including quantum evolutions that are effectively classical. Since energy and momentum count distinct states, they are defined in finite-state dynamics, and they relate classical mechanics to finite-state evolution.
