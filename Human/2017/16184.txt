Analysis of Analog Network Coding noise in Multiuser Cooperative Relaying for Spatially Correlated Environment

Analog Network Coding (ANC) is proposed in literature to improve the network throughput by exploiting channel diversity. In practical scenarios, due to the difference in channel characteristics, an extra residual component, termed as ANC noise, appears during the processing of the received signal. This ANC noise component may suppress the ANC gain. None of the existing literature to our knowledge considers the effect of spatial correlation among channels on ANC noise. This paper develops a generic framework to investigate the effect of channel characteristics on ANC noise. We have modelled the channels as spatially correlated to take the (dis)similarity among them into account. Per node power constraint is also taken into consideration. In this work, we have characterized the behaviour of ANC noise and presented the results to analyze the network performance in terms of outage probability. Outcomes of our investigation show that spatial correlation among channels significantly affects the variance of ANC noise as well as the outage performance of the system. The proposed framework can provide better insights while selecting the system parameters in a correlated environment.
