A decoding algorithm for Twisted Gabidulin codes

In this work, we modify the decoding algorithm for subspace codes by Koetter and Kschischang to get a decoding algorithm for (generalized) twisted Gabidulin codes. The decoding algorithm we present applies to cases where the code is linear over the base field $\mathbb{F}_q$ but not linear over $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$.
