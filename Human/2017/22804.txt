Bounding the convergence time of local probabilistic evolution

Isoperimetric inequalities form a very intuitive yet powerful characterization of the connectedness of a state space, that has proven successful in obtaining convergence bounds. Since the seventies they form an essential tool in differential geometry, graph theory and Markov chain analysis. In this paper we use isoperimetric inequalities to construct a bound on the convergence time of any local probabilistic evolution that leaves its limit distribution invariant. We illustrate how this general result leads to new bounds on convergence times beyond the explicit Markovian setting, among others on quantum dynamics.
