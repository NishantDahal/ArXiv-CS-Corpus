A One-Field Energy-conserving Monolithic Fictitious Domain Method for Fluid-Structure Interactions

In this article, we analyze and numerically assess a new fictitious domain method for fluid-structure interactions in two and three dimensions. The distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that it only solves for one velocity field for the whole fluid-structure domain; the interactions remain decoupled until solving the final linear algebraic equations. To achieve this the finite element procedures are carried out separately on two different meshes for the fluid and solid respectively, and the assembly of the final linear system brings the fluid and solid parts together via an isoparametric interpolation matrix between the two meshes. In this article, an implicit version of this approach is introduced. The property of energy conservation is proved, which is a strong indication of stability. The solvability and error estimate for the corresponding stationary problem (one time step of the transient problem) are analyzed. Finally, 2D and 3D numerical examples are presented to validate the conservation properties.
