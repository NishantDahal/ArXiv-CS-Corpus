Optimisation de la QoS dans un r{é}seau de radio cognitive en utilisant la m{é}taheuristique SFLA (Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm)

This work proposes a study of quality of service (QoS) in cognitive radio networks. This study is based on a stochastic optimization method called shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA). The interest of the SFLA algorithm is to guarantee a better solution in a multi-carrier context in order to satisfy the requirements of the secondary user (SU).
