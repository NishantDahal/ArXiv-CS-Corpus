Performance of Android Forensics Data Recovery Tools

Recovering deleted or hidden data is among most important duties of forensics investigators. Extensive utilisation of smartphones as subject, objects or tools of crime made them an important part of residual forensics. This chapter investigates the effectiveness of mobile forensic data recovery tools in recovering evidences from a Samsung Galaxy S2 i9100 Android phone. We seek to determine the amount of data that could be recovered using Phone image carver, Access data FTK, Foremost, Diskdigger, and Recover My File forensic tools. The findings reflected the difference between recovery capacities of studied tools showing their suitability in their specialised contexts only.
