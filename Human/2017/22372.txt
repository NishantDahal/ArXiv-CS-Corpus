Robust Beamforming for Physical Layer Security in BDMA Massive MIMO

In this paper, we design robust beamforming to guarantee the physical layer security for a multiuser beam division multiple access (BDMA) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, when the channel estimation errors are taken into consideration. With the aid of artificial noise (AN), the proposed design are formulated as minimizing the transmit power of the base station (BS), while providing legal users and the eavesdropper (Eve) with different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). It is strictly proved that, under BDMA massive MIMO scheme, the initial non-convex optimization can be equivalently converted to a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem and the optimal rank-one beamforming solutions can be guaranteed. In stead of directly resorting to the convex tool, we make one step further by deriving the optimal beamforming direction and the optimal beamforming power allocation in closed-form, which greatly reduces the computational complexity and makes the proposed design practical for real world applications. Simulation results are then provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
