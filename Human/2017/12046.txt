Initial steps towards assessing the usability of a verification tool

In this paper we report the experience of using AutoProof to statically verify a small object oriented program. We identified the problems that emerged by this activity and we classified them according to their nature. In particular, we distinguish between tool-related and methodology-related issues, and propose necessary changes to simplify both tool and method.
