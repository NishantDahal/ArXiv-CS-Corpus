BFR: a Bloom Filter-based Routing Approach for Information-Centric Networks

Locating the demanded content is one of the major challenges in Information-Centric Networking (ICN). This process is known as content discovery. To facilitate content discovery, in this paper we focus on Named Data Networking (NDN) and propose a novel routing scheme for content discovery, called Bloom Filter-based Routing (BFR), which is fully distributed, content oriented, and topology agnostic at the intra-domain level. In BFR, origin servers advertise their content objects using Bloom filters. We compare the performance of the proposed BFR with flooding and shortest path content discovery approaches. BFR outperforms its counterparts in terms of the average round-trip delay, while it is shown to be very robust to false positive reports from Bloom filters. Also, BFR is much more robust than shortest path routing to topology changes. BFR strongly outperforms flooding and performs almost equal with shortest path routing with respect to the normalized communication costs for data retrieval and total communication overhead for forwarding Interests. All the three approaches achieve similar mean hit distance. The signalling overhead for content advertisement in BFR is much lower than the signalling overhead for calculating shortest paths in the shortest path approach. Finally, BFR requires small storage overhead for maintaining content advertisements.
