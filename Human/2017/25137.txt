Crack detection in beam structures with a novel Laplace based Wavelet Finite Element method

Beam structure is one of the most widely used structures in mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Ultrasonic guided wave based crack identification is one of the most important and accepted approaches applied to detect unseen small flaws in structures. Numerical simulations of ultrasonic guided wave propagation have caught more and more attention due to the fast development of hardware and software in the last few years. From all the numerical simulation methods, wavelet based finite element method has been proved to be one of the most efficient methods due to its better spatial resolution, which means it needs fewer elements to get the same accuracy and it can improve the calculation cost significantly. However, it needs a very small time interval. Laplace transform can easily convert the time domain into a frequency domain and then revert it back to a time domain. Laplace transform has thus the advantage of finding better results with a very large time interval. which can save a lot of time cost. This paper will present an innovative method combining Laplace transform and the B-spline wavelet on interval (BSWI) finite element method. This novel method allows to get results with the same accuracy and with a significantly lower time cost, which would not only decrease the total number of elements in the structure but also increase the time integration interval. The numerical Laplace transform and BSWI finite element will be introduced. Moreover, this innovative method is applied to simulate the ultrasonic wave propagation in a beam structure in different materials. Numerical examples for crack identification in beam structures have been studied for verification.
