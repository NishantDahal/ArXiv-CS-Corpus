Learning Deep Architectures for Interaction Prediction in Structure-based Virtual Screening

We introduce a deep learning architecture for structure-based virtual screening that generates fixed-sized fingerprints of proteins and small molecules by applying learnable atom convolution and softmax operations to each compound separately. These fingerprints are further transformed non-linearly, their inner-product is calculated and used to predict the binding potential. Moreover, we show that widely used benchmark datasets may be insufficient for testing structure-based virtual screening methods that utilize machine learning. Therefore, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, which we constructed based on DUD-E and PDBBind databases.
