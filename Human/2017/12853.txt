A Note on IC-Planar Graphs

A graph is IC-planar if it admits a drawing in the plane with at most one crossing per edge and such that two pairs of crossing edges share no common end vertex. IC-planarity specializes both NIC-planarity, which allows a pair of crossing edges to share at most one vertex, and 1-planarity, where each edge may be crossed at most once. We show that there are infinitely maximal IC-planar graphs with n vertices and 3n-5 edges and thereby prove a tight lower bound on the density of this class of graphs.
