Performance Overhead Comparison between Hypervisor and Container based Virtualization

The current virtualization solution in the Cloud widely relies on hypervisor-based technologies. Along with the recent popularity of Docker, the container-based virtualization starts receiving more attention for being a promising alternative. Since both of the virtualization solutions are not resource-free, their performance overheads would lead to negative impacts on the quality of Cloud services. To help fundamentally understand the performance difference between these two types of virtualization solutions, we use a physical machine with "just-enough" resource as a baseline to investigate the performance overhead of a standalone Docker container against a standalone virtual machine (VM). With findings contrary to the related work, our evaluation results show that the virtualization's performance overhead could vary not only on a feature-by-feature basis but also on a job-to-job basis. Although the container-based solution is undoubtedly lightweight, the hypervisor-based technology does not come with higher performance overhead in every case. For example, Docker containers particularly exhibit lower QoS in terms of storage transaction speed.
