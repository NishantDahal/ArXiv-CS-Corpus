A Content-based Centrality Metric for Collaborative Caching in Information-Centric Fogs

Information-Centric Fog Computing enables a multitude of nodes near the end-users to provide storage, communication, and computing, rather than in the cloud. In a fog network, nodes connect with each other directly to get content locally whenever possible. As the topology of the network directly influences the nodes' connectivity, there has been some work to compute the graph centrality of each node within that network topology. The centrality is then used to distinguish nodes in the fog network, or to prioritize some nodes over others to participate in the caching fog. We argue that, for an Information-Centric Fog Computing approach, graph centrality is not an appropriate metric. Indeed, a node with low connectivity that caches a lot of content may provide a very valuable role in the network.
  To capture this, we introduce acontent-based centrality (CBC) metric which takes into account how well a node is connected to the content the network is delivering, rather than to the other nodes in the network. To illustrate the validity of considering content-based centrality, we use this new metric for a collaborative caching algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed collaborative caching with typical centrality based, non-centrality based, and non-collaborative caching mechanisms. Our simulation implements CBC on three instances of large scale realistic network topology comprising 2,896 nodes with three content replication levels. Results shows that CBC outperforms benchmark caching schemes and yields a roughly 3x improvement for the average cache hit rate.
