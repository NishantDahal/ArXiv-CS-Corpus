A Topological proof that $O_2$ is $2$-MCFL

We give a new proof of Salvati's theorem that the group language $O_2$ is $2$ multiple context free. Unlike Salvati's proof, our arguments do not use any idea specific to two-dimensions. This raises the possibility that the argument might generalize to $O_n$.
