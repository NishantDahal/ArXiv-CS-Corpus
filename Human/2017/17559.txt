Introducing machine learning for power system operation support

We address the problem of assisting human dispatchers in operating power grids in today's changing  context  using machine learning,  with  theaim of increasing security and reducing costs. Power networks  are  highly  regulated  systems,  which  at  all times must meet varying demands of electricity with a complex production system, including conventional power   plants,   less   predictable   renewable   energies (such as wind or solar power), and the possibility of buying/selling electricity on the international market with  more  and  more  actors  involved  at  a  Europeanscale. This problem is becoming ever more challenging  in  an  aging  network  infrastructure.  One  of  the primary goals of dispatchers is to protect equipment (e.g.   avoid   that   transmission   lines   overheat)   with few  degrees  of  freedom:  we  are  considering  in  this paper  solely  modifications  in  network  topology,  i.e. re-configuring  the  way  in  which  lines,  transformers,  productions  and  loads  are  connected  in  sub-stations.  Using  years  of  historical  data  collected  by the  French  Transmission  Service  Operator  (TSO) "Réseau  de  Transport  d'Electricité"  (RTE),  we  develop novel machine learning techniques (drawing on "deep learning") to mimic human decisions to devise "remedial  actions"  to  prevent  any  line  to  violate power  flow  limits  (so-called  "thermal  limits").  The proposed technique is hybrid. It does not rely purely on   machine   learning:   every   action   will   be   tested with  actual  simulators  before  being  proposed  to  the dispatchers  or  implemented  on  the  grid.
