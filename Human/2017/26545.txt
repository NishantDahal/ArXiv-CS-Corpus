Mismatched Multi-Letter Successive Decoding for the Multiple-Access Channel

This paper studies channel coding for the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel with a given (possibly suboptimal) decoding rule. A multi-letter successive decoding rule depending on an arbitrary non-negative decoding metric is considered, and achievable rate regions and error exponents are derived both for the standard MAC (independent codebooks), and for the cognitive MAC (one user knows both messages) with superposition coding. In the cognitive case, the rate region and error exponent are shown to be tight with respect to the ensemble average. The rate regions are compared with those of the commonly-considered decoder that chooses the message pair maximizing the decoding metric, and numerical examples are given for which successive decoding yields a strictly higher sum rate for a given pair of input distributions.
