Latent Gaussian Process Regression

We introduce Latent Gaussian Process Regression which is a latent variable extension allowing modelling of non-stationary multi-modal processes using GPs. The approach is built on extending the input space of a regression problem with a latent variable that is used to modulate the covariance function over the training data. We show how our approach can be used to model multi-modal and non-stationary processes. We exemplify the approach on a set of synthetic data and provide results on real data from motion capture and geostatistics.
