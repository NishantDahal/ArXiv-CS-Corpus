Recovering Homography from Camera Captured Documents using Convolutional Neural Networks

Removing perspective distortion from hand held camera captured document images is one of the primitive tasks in document analysis, but unfortunately, no such method exists that can reliably remove the perspective distortion from document images automatically. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network based method for recovering homography from hand-held camera captured documents.
  Our proposed method works independent of document's underlying content and is trained end-to-end in a fully automatic way. Specifically, this paper makes following three contributions: Firstly, we introduce a large scale synthetic dataset for recovering homography from documents images captured under different geometric and photometric transformations; secondly, we show that a generic convolutional neural network based architecture can be successfully used for regressing the corners positions of documents captured under wild settings; thirdly, we show that L1 loss can be reliably used for corners regression. Our proposed method gives state-of-the-art performance on the tested datasets, and has potential to become an integral part of document analysis pipeline.
