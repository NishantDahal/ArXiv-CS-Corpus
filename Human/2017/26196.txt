OSU Multimodal Machine Translation System Report

This paper describes Oregon State University's submissions to the shared WMT'17 task "multimodal translation task I". In this task, all the sentence pairs are image captions in different languages. The key difference between this task and conventional machine translation is that we have corresponding images as additional information for each sentence pair. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective system which takes an image shared between different languages, feeding it into the both encoding and decoding side. We report our system's performance for English-French and English-German with Flickr30K (in-domain) and MSCOCO (out-of-domain) datasets. Our system achieves the best performance in TER for English-German for MSCOCO dataset.
