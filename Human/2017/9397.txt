The Blank Stare: Retrieving Unique Eye Tracking Signatures Independent of Visual Stimuli

Using Low Cost Portable Eye Tracking for Biometric Identification Or Verification: Eye tracking technologies have in recent years become available outside of specialised labs, and are starting to become integrated in tablets and virtual reality headsets. This offers new opportunities for use in common office- and home environments, such as for biometric recognition (identification or verification), alone or in combination with other technologies. This paper exposes two fundamentally different approaches that have been suggested, based on spatial and temporal signatures respectively. While deploying different stimulation paradigms for recording, it also proposes an alternative way to analyze spatial domain signatures using Fourier transformation. Empirical data recorded from two subjects over two weeks, three months apart, are found to support previous results. Further, variations and stability of some of the proposed signatures are analyzed over the extended timeframe and under slightly varying conditions.
