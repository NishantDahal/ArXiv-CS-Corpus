A Time Localization System in Smart Home Using Hierarchical Structure and Dynamic Frequency

Both GPS and WiFi based localization have been exploited in recent years, yet most researches focus on localizing at home without environment context. Besides, the near home or workplace area is complex and has little attention in smart home or IOT. Therefore, after exploring the realistic route in and out of building, we conducted a time localization system (TLS) based on off-the-shelf smart phones with WiFi identification. TLS can identify the received signal strength indication (RSSI) of home and construct radio map of users' time route without site survey. As designed to service the smart devices in home, TLS applies the time interval as the distance of positions and as the variables of WiFi environment to mark time points. Experimental results with real users show that TLS as a service system for timeline localization achieves a median accuracy of 70 seconds and is more robust compared with nearest neighbor localization approach.
