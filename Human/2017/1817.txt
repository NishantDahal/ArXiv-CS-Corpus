Lattice Coding and Decoding for Multiple-Antenna Ergodic Fading Channels

For ergodic fading, a lattice coding and decoding strategy is proposed and its performance is analyzed for the single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) point-to-point channel as well as the multiple-access channel (MAC), with channel state information available only at the receiver (CSIR). At the decoder a novel strategy is proposed consisting of a time-varying equalization matrix followed by decision regions that depend only on channel statistics, not individual realizations. Our encoder has a similar structure to that of Erez and Zamir. For the SISO channel, the gap to capacity is bounded by a constant under a wide range of fading distributions. For the MIMO channel under Rayleigh fading, the rate achieved is within a gap to capacity that does not depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and diminishes with the number of receive antennas. The analysis is extended to the K-user MAC where similar results hold. Achieving a small gap to capacity while limiting the use of CSIR to the equalizer highlights the scope for efficient decoder implementations, since decision regions are fixed, i.e., independent of channel realizations.
