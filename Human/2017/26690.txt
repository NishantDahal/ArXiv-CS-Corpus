Density decompositions of networks

We introduce a new topological descriptor of a network called the density decomposition which is a partition of the nodes of a network into regions of uniform density. The decomposition we define is unique in the sense that a given network has exactly one density decomposition. The number of nodes in each partition defines a density distribution which we find is measurably similar to the degree distribution of given real networks (social, internet, etc.) and measurably dissimilar in synthetic networks (preferential attachment, small world, etc.).
