A Model-Theoretic Characterization of Constant-Depth Arithmetic Circuits

We study the class $\textrm{AC}^0$ of functions computed by constant-depth polynomial-size arithmetic circuits of unbounded fan-in addition and multiplication gates. No model-theoretic characterization for arithmetic circuit classes is known so far. Inspired by Immerman's characterization of the Boolean class $\textrm{AC}^0$, we remedy this situation and develop such a characterization of $\textrm{AC}^0$. Our characterization can be interpreted as follows: Functions in $\textrm{AC}^0$ are exactly those functions counting winning strategies in first-order model checking games. A consequence of our results is a new model-theoretic characterization of $\textrm{TC}^0$, the class of languages accepted by constant-depth polynomial-size majority circuits.
