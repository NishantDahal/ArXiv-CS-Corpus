Coverage and Rate Analysis for Co-Existing RF/VLC Downlink Cellular Networks

This paper provides a stochastic geometry framework to perform the coverage and rate analysis of a typical user in co-existing VLC and RF networks covering a large indoor area. The developed framework can be customized to capture the performance of a typical user in various network configurations such as (i) RF-only, in which only small base-stations (SBSs) are available to provide the coverage to a user, (ii) VLC-only, in which only optical BSs (OBSs) are available to provide the coverage to a user, (iii) opportunistic RF/VLC, where a user selects the network with maximum received signal power, and (iv) hybrid RF/VLC, where a user can simultaneously utilize the available resources from both RF and VLC networks. The developed model for VLC network precisely captures the impact of the field-of-view (FOV) of the photo-detector (PD) receiver on the number of interferers, distribution of the aggregate interference, association probability, and the coverage of a typical user. Closed-form approximations are presented for special cases of practical interest and for asymptotic scenarios such as when the intensity of SBSs becomes very low. The derived expressions enable us to obtain closed-form solutions for various network design parameters (such as intensity of OBSs and SBSs, transmit power, and/or FOV) such that the number of active users can be distributed optimally among RF and VLC networks. Also, we optimize the network parameters in order to prioritize the association of users to VLC network. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the derived analytical solutions. Important trade-offs between height and intensity of OBSs are highlighted to optimize the performance of a user in VLC networks.
