Von Neumann Regular Cellular Automata

For any group $G$ and any set $A$, a cellular automaton (CA) is a transformation of the configuration space $A^G$ defined via a finite memory set and a local function. Let $\text{CA}(G;A)$ be the monoid of all CA over $A^G$. In this paper, we investigate a generalisation of the inverse of a CA from the semigroup-theoretic perspective. An element $τ\in \text{CA}(G;A)$ is von Neumann regular (or simply regular) if there exists $σ\in \text{CA}(G;A)$ such that $τ\circ σ\circ τ= τ$ and $σ\circ τ\circ σ= σ$, where $\circ$ is the composition of functions. Such an element $σ$ is called a generalised inverse of $τ$. The monoid $\text{CA}(G;A)$ itself is regular if all its elements are regular. We establish that $\text{CA}(G;A)$ is regular if and only if $\vert G \vert = 1$ or $\vert A \vert = 1$, and we characterise all regular elements in $\text{CA}(G;A)$ when $G$ and $A$ are both finite. Furthermore, we study regular linear CA when $A= V$ is a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$; in particular, we show that every regular linear CA is invertible when $G$ is torsion-free elementary amenable (e.g. when $G=\mathbb{Z}^d, \ d \in \mathbb{N}$) and $V=\mathbb{F}$, and that every linear CA is regular when $V$ is finite-dimensional and $G$ is locally finite with $\text{Char}(\mathbb{F}) \nmid o(g)$ for all $g \in G$.
