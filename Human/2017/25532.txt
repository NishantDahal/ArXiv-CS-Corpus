Modulating and attending the source image during encoding improves Multimodal Translation

We propose a new and fully end-to-end approach for multimodal translation where the source text encoder modulates the entire visual input processing using conditional batch normalization, in order to compute the most informative image features for our task. Additionally, we propose a new attention mechanism derived from this original idea, where the attention model for the visual input is conditioned on the source text encoder representations. In the paper, we detail our models as well as the image analysis pipeline. Finally, we report experimental results. They are, as far as we know, the new state of the art on three different test sets.
