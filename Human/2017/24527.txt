A Resilient Image Matching Method with an Affine Invariant Feature Detector and Descriptor

Image feature matching is to seek, localize and identify the similarities across the images. The matched local features between different images can indicate the similarities of their content. Resilience of image feature matching to large view point changes is challenging for a lot of applications such as 3D object reconstruction, object recognition and navigation, etc, which need accurate and robust feature matching from quite different view points. In this paper we propose a novel image feature matching algorithm, integrating our previous proposed Affine Invariant Feature Detector (AIFD) and new proposed Affine Invariant Feature Descriptor (AIFDd). Both stages of this new proposed algorithm can provide sufficient resilience to view point changes. With systematic experiments, we can prove that the proposed method of feature detector and descriptor outperforms other state-of-the-art feature matching algorithms especially on view points robustness. It also performs well under other conditions such as the change of illumination, rotation and compression, etc.
