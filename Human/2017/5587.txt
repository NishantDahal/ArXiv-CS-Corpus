Bulk-synchronous pseudo-streaming algorithms for many-core accelerators

The bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model provides a framework for writing parallel programs with predictable performance. In this paper we extend the BSP model to support what we will call pseudo-streaming algorithms for accelerators. We also generalize the BSP cost function to these algorithms, so that it is possible to predict the running time for programs targeting many-core accelerators and to identify possible bottlenecks. Several examples of algorithms within this new framework will be explored. We extend the BSPlib standard by proposing a small number of new BSP primitives to create and use streams in a portable way. We will introduce a software library called Epiphany BSP that implements these ideas for the Parallella development board. Finally we will give experimental results for pseudo-streaming algorithms on the Parallella platform.
