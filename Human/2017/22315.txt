Improving Reliability of Service Function Chains with Combined VNF Migrations and Replications

The Network Function Virtualization (NFV) paradigm is enabling flexibility, programmability and implementation of traditional network functions into generic hardware, in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). To provide services, the VNFs are commonly concatenated in a certain ordered sequence, known as Service Function Chains (SFCs). SFCs are usually required to meeting a certain level of reliability. This creates the need to place the VNFs while optimizing reliability jointly with other objectives, such as network and server load balancing. Traditional migration and replication mechanisms, commonly used for Virtual Machines (VM) in data centers, can be used to improve SFC reliability. We study how to improve service reliability using jointly replications and migrations, considering the chaining problem inherent in NFV. While replications provide reliability, performing migrations to more reliable servers decreases the resource overhead. A Linear Programming (LP) model is presented to study the impact of active-active configurations on the network and server resources. Additionally, to provide a fast recovery from server failures, we consider N-to-N configurations in NFV networks and study its impact on server resources. The results show that replications do not only improve reliability, but can also be used to achieving a better server and network load balancing, and when used jointly with migrations can improve resource utilization without degrading reliability.
