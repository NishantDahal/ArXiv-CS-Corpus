A new family of one-coincidence sets of sequences with dispersed elements for frequency hopping CDMA systems

We present a new family of one-coincidence sequence sets suitable for frequency hopping code division multiple access (FH-CDMA) systems with dispersed (low density) sequence elements. These sets are derived from one-coincidence prime sequence sets, such that for each one-coincidence prime sequence set there is a new one-coincidence set comprised of sequences with dispersed sequence elements, required in some circumstances, for FH-CDMA systems. Getting rid of crowdedness of sequence elements is achieved by doubling the size of the sequence element alphabet. In addition, this doubling process eases control over the distance between adjacent sequence elements. Properties of the new sets are discussed.
