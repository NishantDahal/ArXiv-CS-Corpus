Graphcut Texture Synthesis for Single-Image Superresolution

Texture synthesis has proven successful at imitating a wide variety of textures. Adding additional constraints (in the form of a low-resolution version of the texture to be synthesized) makes it possible to use texture synthesis methods for texture superresolution.
