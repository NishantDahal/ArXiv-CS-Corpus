OneDataShare: A Vision for Cloud-hosted Data Transfer Scheduling and Optimization as a Service

Fast, reliable, and efficient data transmission across wide-area networks is a predominant bottleneck for data-intensive cloud applications. This paper introduces OneDataShare, which is designed to eliminate the issues plaguing effective cloud-based data transfers of varying file sizes and across incompatible transfer end-points. The vision of OneDataShare is to achieve high-speed data communication, interoperability between multiple transfer protocols, and accurate estimation of delivery time for advance planning, thereby maximizing user-profit through improved and faster data analysis for business intelligence. The paper elaborates on the desirable features of OneDataShare as a cloud-hosted data transfer scheduling and optimization service, and how it is aligned with the vision of harnessing the power of the cloud and distributed computing. Experimental evaluation and comparison with existing real-life file transfer services show that the transfer throughout achieved by OneDataShare is 6.5 times greater.
