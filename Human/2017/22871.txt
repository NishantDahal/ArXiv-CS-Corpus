Dialogue Act Recognition via CRF-Attentive Structured Network

Dialogue Act Recognition (DAR) is a challenging problem in dialogue interpretation, which aims to attach semantic labels to utterances and characterize the speaker's intention. Currently, many existing approaches formulate the DAR problem ranging from multi-classification to structured prediction, which suffer from handcrafted feature extensions and attentive contextual structural dependencies. In this paper, we consider the problem of DAR from the viewpoint of extending richer Conditional Random Field (CRF) structural dependencies without abandoning end-to-end training. We incorporate hierarchical semantic inference with memory mechanism on the utterance modeling. We then extend structured attention network to the linear-chain conditional random field layer which takes into account both contextual utterances and corresponding dialogue acts. The extensive experiments on two major benchmark datasets Switchboard Dialogue Act (SWDA) and Meeting Recorder Dialogue Act (MRDA) datasets show that our method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art solutions to the problem. It is a remarkable fact that our method is nearly close to the human annotator's performance on SWDA within 2% gap.
