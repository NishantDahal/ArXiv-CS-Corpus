The Role of Big Data on Smart Grid Transition

Despite being popularly referred to as the ultimate solution for all problems of our current electric power system, smart grid is still a growing and unstable concept. It is usually considered as a set of advanced features powered by promising technological solutions. In this paper, we describe smart grid as a socio-technical transition and illustrate the evolutionary path on which a smart grid can be realized. Through this conceptual lens, we reveal the role of big data, and how it can fuel the organic growth of smart grid. We also provide a rough estimate of how much data will be potentially generated from different data sources, which helps clarify the big data challenges during the evolutionary process.
