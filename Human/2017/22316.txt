Random Words in a (Weighted) Regular Language: a Free Energy Approach

We study random words in a weighted regular language that achieve the maximal free energy using thermodynamics formalism. In particular, typical words in the language are algorithmically generated which have applications in computer security (anomaly detection) and software enegineering (test case generation).
