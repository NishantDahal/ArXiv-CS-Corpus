It is undecidable if two regular tree languages can be separated by a deterministic tree-walking automaton

The following problem is shown undecidable: given regular languages L,K of finite trees, decide if there exists a deterministic tree-walking automaton which accepts all trees in L and rejects all trees in K. The proof uses a technique of Kopczy≈Ñski from LICS 2016.
