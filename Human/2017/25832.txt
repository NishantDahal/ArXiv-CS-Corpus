Sequence Mining and Pattern Analysis in Drilling Reports with Deep Natural Language Processing

Drilling activities in the oil and gas industry have been reported over decades for thousands of wells on a daily basis, yet the analysis of this text at large-scale for information retrieval, sequence mining, and pattern analysis is very challenging. Drilling reports contain interpretations written by drillers from noting measurements in downhole sensors and surface equipment, and can be used for operation optimization and accident mitigation. In this initial work, a methodology is proposed for automatic classification of sentences written in drilling reports into three relevant labels (EVENT, SYMPTOM and ACTION) for hundreds of wells in an actual field. Some of the main challenges in the text corpus were overcome, which include the high frequency of technical symbols, mistyping/abbreviation of technical terms, and the presence of incomplete sentences in the drilling reports. We obtain state-of-the-art classification accuracy within this technical language and illustrate advanced queries enabled by the tool.
