Variable-to-Fixed Length Homophonic Coding Suitable for Asymmetric Channel Coding

In communication through asymmetric channels the capacity-achieving input distribution is not uniform in general. Homophonic coding is a framework to invertibly convert a (usually uniform) message into a sequence with some target distribution, and is a promising candidate to generate codewords with the nonuniform target distribution for asymmetric channels. In particular, a Variable-to-Fixed length (VF) homophonic code can be used as a suitable component for channel codes to avoid decoding error propagation. However, the existing VF homophonic code requires the knowledge of the maximum relative gap of probabilities between two adjacent sequences beforehand, which is an unrealistic assumption for long block codes. In this paper we propose a new VF homophonic code without such a requirement by allowing one-symbol decoding delay. We evaluate this code theoretically and experimentally to verify its asymptotic optimality.
