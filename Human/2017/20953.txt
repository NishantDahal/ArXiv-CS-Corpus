High-Speed Data Dissemination over Device-to-Device Millimeter-Wave Networks for Highway Vehicular Communication

Gigabit-per-second connectivity among vehicles is expected to be a key enabling technology for sensor information sharing, in turn, resulting in safer Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). Recently proposed millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems appear to be the only solution capable of meeting the data rate demand imposed by future ITS services. In this poster, we assess the performance of a mmWave device-to-device (D2D) vehicular network by investigating the impact of system and communication parameters on end-users.
