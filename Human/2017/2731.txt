Massive MIMO Beam-forming for High Speed Train Communication: Directivity vs Beamwidth

High-mobility adaption and massive Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) application are two primary evolving objectives for the next generation high speed train communication system. In this paper, we consider how to design a location-aware beam-forming for the massive MIMO system.We first analyze the tradeoff between beam directivity and beamwidth, based on which we present the sensitivity analysis of positioning accuracy. Then, we derive the maximum beam directivity and corresponding beamwidth under the restriction of diverse positioning accuracies to guarantee a high efficient transmission. Finally, we present a low-complexity beam-forming design with positioning robustness utilizing location information, which requires neither eigen-decomposing (ED) the uplink channel covariance matrix (CCM) nor ED the downlink CCM (DCCM). Numerical simulation indicates that a massive MIMO system with less than a certain positioning error can guarantee a required performance with satisfying transmission efficiency in the high-mobility scenario.
