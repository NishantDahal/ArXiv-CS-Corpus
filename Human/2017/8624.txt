Nucleus: A Pilot Project

Early in 2016, an environmental scan was conducted by the Research Library Data Working Group for three purposes:
  1.) Perform a survey of the data management landscape at Los Alamos National Laboratory in order to identify local gaps in data management services.
  2.) Conduct an environmental scan of external institutions to benchmark budgets, infrastructure, and personnel dedicated to data management.
  3.) Draft a research data infrastructure model that aligns with the current workflow and classification restrictions at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
  This report is a summary of those activities and the draft for a pilot data management project.
