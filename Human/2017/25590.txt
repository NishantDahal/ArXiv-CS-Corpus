Exploring the outsourcing relationship in software startups: A multiple case study

Software startups are becoming increasingly popular in software industry as well as other sectors of economy. Startups that lack necessary competences often seek for external resources from outsourcing partners. Little is known how this outsourcing relationship works and whether it makes sense to outsource the technical competence to an external party. This is among the first investigations on the outsourcing relationships in software startups. By conducting exploratory case studies at six startups, we found a mixed experience with outsourcing. The experimental nature of an early product development makes outsourcing a feasible option, although startups often suffer from its uncertainty and managing commitments from partners. Results further propose that early contract-based activities could be transformed into a long-term partnership by adopting a startup boundary spanner s role, establishing an inter-personal relationship and maintaining a mutual commitment.
