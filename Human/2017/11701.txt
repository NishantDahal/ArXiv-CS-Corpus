Privacy in Information-Rich Intelligent Infrastructure

Intelligent infrastructure will critically rely on the dense instrumentation of sensors and actuators that constantly transmit streaming data to cloud-based analytics for real-time monitoring. For example, driverless cars communicate real-time location and other data to companies like Google, which aggregate regional data in order to provide real-time traffic maps. Such traffic maps can be extremely useful to the driver (for optimal travel routing), as well as to city transportation administrators for real-time accident response that can have an impact on traffic capacity. Intelligent infrastructure monitoring compromises the privacy of drivers who continuously share their location to cloud aggregators, with unpredictable consequences.
  Without a framework for protecting the privacy of the driver's data, drivers may be very conservative about sharing their data with cloud-based analytics that will be responsible for adding the intelligence to intelligent infrastructure. In the energy sector, the Smart Grid revolution relies critically on real-time metering of energy supply and demand with very high granularity. This is turn enables real-time demand response and creates a new energy market that can incorporate unpredictable renewable energy sources while ensuring grid stability and reliability. However, real-time streaming data captured by smart meters contain a lot of private information, such as our home activities or lack of, which can be easily inferred by anyone that has access to the smart meter data, resulting not only in loss of privacy but potentially also putting us at risk.
