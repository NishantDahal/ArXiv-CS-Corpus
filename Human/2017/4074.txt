Comment on the Equality Condition for the I-MMSE Proof of Entropy Power Inequality

The paper establishes the equality condition in the I-MMSE proof of the entropy power inequality (EPI). This is done by establishing an exact expression for the deficit between the two sides of the EPI. Interestingly, a necessary condition for the equality is established by making a connection to the famous Cauchy functional equation.
