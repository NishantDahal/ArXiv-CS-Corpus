The Reachability of Computer Programs

Would it be possible to explain the emergence of new computational ideas using the computation itself? Would it be feasible to describe the discovery process of new algorithmic solutions using only mathematics? This study is the first effort to analyze the nature of such inquiry from the viewpoint of effort to find a new algorithmic solution to a given problem. We define program reachability as a probability function whose argument is a form of the energetic cost (algorithmic entropy) of the problem.
