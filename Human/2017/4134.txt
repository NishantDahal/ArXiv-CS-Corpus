Model-based Testing of the Java Network API

Testing networked systems is challenging. The client or server side cannot be tested by itself. We present a solution using tool "Modbat" that generates test cases for Java's network library java.nio, where we test both blocking and non-blocking network functions. Our test model can dynamically simulate actions in multiple worker and client threads, thanks to a carefully orchestrated design that covers non-determinism while ensuring progress.
