PunFields at SemEval-2017 Task 7: Employing Roget's Thesaurus in Automatic Pun Recognition and Interpretation

The article describes a model of automatic interpretation of English puns, based on Roget's Thesaurus, and its implementation, PunFields. In a pun, the algorithm discovers two groups of words that belong to two main semantic fields. The fields become a semantic vector based on which an SVM classifier learns to recognize puns. A rule-based model is then applied for recognition of intentionally ambiguous (target) words and their definitions. In SemEval Task 7 PunFields shows a considerably good result in pun classification, but requires improvement in searching for the target word and its definition.
