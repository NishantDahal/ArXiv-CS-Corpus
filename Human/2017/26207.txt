A Variational Approach to Shape-from-shading Under Natural Illumination

A numerical solution to shape-from-shading under natural illumination is presented. It builds upon an augmented Lagrangian approach for solving a generic PDE-based shape-from-shading model which handles directional or spherical harmonic lighting, orthographic or perspective projection, and greylevel or multi-channel images. Real-world applications to shading-aware depth map denoising, refinement and completion are presented.
