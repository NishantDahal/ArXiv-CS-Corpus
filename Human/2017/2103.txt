3-Dimensional Optical Orthogonal Codes with Ideal Autocorrelation-Bounds and Optimal Constructions

Several new constructions of 3-dimensional optical orthogonal codes are presented here. In each case the codes have ideal autocorrelation $\mathbf{ λ_a=0} $, and in all but one case a cross correlation of $ \mathbf{λ_c=1} $. All codes produced are optimal with respect to the applicable Johnson bound either presented or developed here. Thus, on one hand the codes are as large as possible, and on the other, the bound(s) are shown to be tight. All codes are constructed by using a particular automorphism (a Singer cycle) of $ \mathbf{ PG(k,q)} $, the finite projective geometry of dimension $ k $ over the field of order $ \mathbf{q} $, or by using an affine analogue in $ AG(k,q) $.
