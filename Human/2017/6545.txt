A Comment on "Analysis of Video Image Sequences Using Point and Line Correspondences"

In this paper we would like to deny the results of Wang et al. raising two fundamental claims:
  * A line does not contribute anything to recognition of motion parameters from two images
  * Four traceable points are not sufficient to recover motion parameters from two perspective
  To be constructive, however, we show that four traceable points are sufficient to recover motion parameters from two frames under orthogonal projection and that five points are sufficient to simplify the solution of the two-frame problem under orthogonal projection to solving a linear equation system.
