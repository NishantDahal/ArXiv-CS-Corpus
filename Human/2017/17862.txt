Disseminando a Aprendizagem Colaborativa atraves do Ambiente Canvas

Virtual learning environments are actual solutions that facilitate collaborative learning, both in classroom and distance education. However, such environments are not yet fully disseminated in Brazilian universities. This work reports a learning experience designed as a workshop that aims to popularize the use of the Canvas virtual learning environment in an university. The workshop emphasizes the support to collaborative learning through resources of the environment. Learned lessons include: the value of adequate planning of workshop activities; the potential of the environment regarding various uses by instructors; and the relevance of collaborative learning for instructors.
