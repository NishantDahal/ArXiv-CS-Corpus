TruSDN: Bootstrapping Trust in Cloud Network Infrastructure

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel architectural model for cloud network infrastructure, improving resource utilization, scalability and administration. SDN deployments increasingly rely on virtual switches executing on commodity operating systems with large code bases, which are prime targets for adversaries attacking the net- work infrastructure. We describe and implement TruSDN, a framework for bootstrapping trust in SDN infrastructure using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), allowing to securely deploy SDN components and protect communication between network endpoints. We introduce ephemeral flow-specific pre-shared keys and propose a novel defense against cuckoo attacks on SGX enclaves. TruSDN is secure under a powerful adversary model, with a minor performance overhead.
