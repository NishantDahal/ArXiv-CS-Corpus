Cloudroid: A Cloud Framework for Transparent and QoS-aware Robotic Computation Outsourcing

Many robotic tasks require heavy computation, which can easily exceed the robot's onboard computer capability. A promising solution to address this challenge is outsourcing the computation to the cloud. However, exploiting the potential of cloud resources in robotic software is difficult, because it involves complex code modification and extensive (re)configuration procedures. Moreover, quality of service (QoS) such as timeliness, which is critical to robot's behavior, have to be considered. In this paper, we propose a transparent and QoS-aware software framework called Cloudroid for cloud robotic applications. This framework supports direct deployment of existing robotic software packages to the cloud, transparently transforming them into Internet-accessible cloud services. And with the automatically generated service stubs, robotic applications can outsource their computation to the cloud without any code modification. Furthermore, the robot and the cloud can cooperate to maintain the specific QoS property such as request response time, even in a highly dynamic and resource-competitive environment. We evaluated Cloudroid based on a group of typical robotic scenarios and a set of software packages widely adopted in real-world robot practices. Results show that robot's capability can be enhanced significantly without code modification and specific QoS objectives can be guaranteed. In certain tasks, the "cloud + robot" setup shows improved performance in orders of magnitude compared with the robot native setup.
