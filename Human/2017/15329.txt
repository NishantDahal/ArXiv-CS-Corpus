Exploit imaging through opaque wall via deep learning

Imaging through scattering media is encountered in many disciplines or sciences, ranging from biology, mesescopic physics and astronomy. But it is still a big challenge because light suffers from multiple scattering is such media and can be totally decorrelated. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based method that can retrieve the image of a target behind a thick scattering medium. The method uses a trained deep neural network to fit the way of mapping of objects at one side of a thick scattering medium to the corresponding speckle patterns observed at the other side. For demonstration, we retrieve the images of a set of objects hidden behind a 3mm thick white polystyrene slab, the optical depth of which is 13.4 times of the scattering mean free path. Our work opens up a new way to tackle the longstanding challenge by using the technique of deep learning.
