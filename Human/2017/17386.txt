Resource Scheduling for Mixed Traffic Types with Scalable TTI in Dynamic TDD Systems

This paper analyses the performance benefits of a user-centric scheduling approach, exploiting the flexibility of both dynamic time division duplex (TDD) and a variable transmission time interval (TTI), where the downlink to uplink ratio and TTI duration can be adapted to the traffic load. The formulation of the joint optimisation problem takes into consideration the individual requirements of each single user in terms of sustainable latency and desired throughput, thus implementing a real user-centric scheduling approach. Moreover, the developed solution is evaluated in a scenario with mixed traffic types, mobile broadband (MBB) and mission critical communications (MCC), showing remarkable performance enhancement of the proposed scheme over baseline dynamic TDD schemes with a fixed TTI in terms of both achievable throughput of the MBB users and guaranteed latency for the MCC users.
