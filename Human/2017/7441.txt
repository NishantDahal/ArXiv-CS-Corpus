Analytical Model of Wireless Cell with Superposition Coding

Focusing on the downlink, we consider a base station (BS) and the cell it covers. The Superposition Coding (SC), also referred to as Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), is implemented. We propose an analytical model of the wireless cell covered by the BS. Based on this model, we establish a closed form expression of the minimum transmit power of the base station, needed to achieve a given SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio), whatever the users locations, on the area covered by the base station. The closed form expression of the BS transmit power allows to establish quality of service (QoS) and coverage values, in a simple and quick way.
