Derivative Based Focal Plane Array Nonuniformity Correction

This paper presents a fast and robust method for fixed pattern noise nonuniformity correction of infrared focal plane arrays. The proposed method requires neither shutter nor elaborate calibrations and therefore enables a real time correction with no interruptions. Based on derivative estimation of the fixed pattern noise from pixel sized translations of the focal plane array, the proposed method has the advantages of being invariant to the noise magnitude and robust to unknown camera and inter-scene movements while being virtually transparent to the end-user.
