Improving the Accuracy of an Adiabatic Quantum Computer

The purpose of the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer is to find a set of qubit values that minimize its objective function. For various reasons, the set of qubit values returned by the D-Wave has errors. This paper presents a method of improving the results returned by the D-Wave. The method individually modifies the qubit values returned by the D-Wave to find a set of values which is a minimum of the objective function. That set however is not necessarily guaranteed to be a global minimum. The method is simple and easily incorporated into any algorithm that has direct access to the sets of values returned by the D-Wave. Examples are also presented that demonstrate the merit of using such a sample improvement method.
