The ACCompanion v0.1: An Expressive Accompaniment System

In this paper we present a preliminary version of the ACCompanion, an expressive accompaniment system for MIDI input. The system uses a probabilistic monophonic score follower to track the position of the soloist in the score, and a linear Gaussian model to compute tempo updates. The expressiveness of the system is powered by the Basis-Mixer, a state-of-the-art computational model of expressive music performance. The system allows for expressive dynamics, timing and articulation.
