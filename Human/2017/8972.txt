Automated Body Structure Extraction from Arbitrary 3D Mesh

This paper presents an automated method for 3D character skeleton extraction that can be applied for generic 3D shapes. Our work is motivated by the skeleton-based prior work on automatic rigging focused on skeleton extraction and can automatically aligns the extracted structure to fit the 3D shape of the given 3D mesh. The body mesh can be subsequently skinned based on the extracted skeleton and thus enables rigging process. In the experiment, we apply public dataset to drive the estimated skeleton from different body shapes, as well as the real data obtained from 3D scanning systems. Satisfactory results are obtained compared to the existing approaches.
