Steady-state analysis of single exponential vacation in a $PH/MSP/1/\infty$ queue using roots

We consider an infinite-buffer single-server queue where inter-arrival times are phase-type ($PH$), the service is provided according to Markovian service process $(MSP)$, and the server may take single, exponentially distributed vacations when the queue is empty. The proposed analysis is based on roots of the associated characteristic equation of the vector-generating function (VGF) of system-length distribution at a pre-arrival epoch. Also, we obtain the steady-state system-length distribution at an arbitrary epoch along with some important performance measures such as the mean number of customers in the system and the mean system sojourn time of a customer. Later, we have established heavy- and light-traffic approximations as well as an approximation for the tail probabilities at pre-arrival epoch based on one root of the characteristic equation. At the end, we present numerical results in the form of tables to show the effect of model parameters on the performance measures.
