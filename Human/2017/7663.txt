Bounding the Dimension of Points on a Line

We use Kolmogorov complexity methods to give a lower bound on the effective Hausdorff dimension of the point (x, ax+b), given real numbers a, b, and x. We apply our main theorem to a problem in fractal geometry, giving an improved lower bound on the (classical) Hausdorff dimension of generalized sets of Furstenberg type.
