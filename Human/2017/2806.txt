Conceptual and algorithmic development of Pseudo 3D Graphics and Video Content Visualization

The article presents a general concept of the organization of pseudo three dimension visualization of graphics and video content for three dimension visualization systems. The steps of algorithms for solving the problem of synthesis of three dimension stereo images based on two dimension images are introduced. The features of synthesis organization of standard format of three dimension stereo frame are presented. Moreover, the performed experimental simulation for generating complete stereoframes and the results of its time complexity are shown. Keywords:Three dimension visualization, pseudo three dimension stereo, a stereo pair, three dimension stereo format, algorithm, modeling, time complexity.
