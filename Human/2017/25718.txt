Android Multi-Level System Permission Management Approach

With the expansion of the market share occupied by the Android platform, security issues (especially application security) have become attention focus of researchers. In fact, the existing methods lack the capabilities to manage application permissions without root privilege. This study proposes a dynamic management mechanism of Android application permissions based on security policies. The paper first describes the permissions by security policies, then implementes permission checking code and request evaluation algorithm in Android framework layer. Experimental results indicate that the presented approach succeeds in permission management of Android applications, and its system overhead is low, which makes it an effective method for Android permission management.
