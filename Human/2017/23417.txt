Deformable Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network in Microwave Based Hand Gesture Recognition System

Traditional vision-based hand gesture recognition systems is limited under dark circumstances. In this paper, we build a hand gesture recognition system based on microwave transceiver and deep learning algorithm. A Doppler radar sensor with dual receiving channels at 5.8GHz is used to acquire a big database of hand gestures signals. The received hand gesture signals are then processed with time-frequency analysis. Based on these big databases of hand gesture, we propose a new machine learning architecture called deformable deep convolutional generative adversarial network. Experimental results show the new architecture can upgrade the recognition rate by 10% and the deformable kernel can reduce the testing time cost by 30%.
