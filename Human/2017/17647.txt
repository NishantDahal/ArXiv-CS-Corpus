Active Learning amidst Logical Knowledge

Structured prediction is ubiquitous in applications of machine learning such as knowledge extraction and natural language processing. Structure often can be formulated in terms of logical constraints. We consider the question of how to perform efficient active learning in the presence of logical constraints among variables inferred by different classifiers. We propose several methods and provide theoretical results that demonstrate the inappropriateness of employing uncertainty guided sampling, a commonly used active learning method. Furthermore, experiments on ten different datasets demonstrate that the methods significantly outperform alternatives in practice. The results are of practical significance in situations where labeled data is scarce.
