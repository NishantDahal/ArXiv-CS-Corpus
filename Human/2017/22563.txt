Identification of potential Music Information Retrieval technologies for computer-aided jingju singing training

Music Information Retrieval (MIR) technologies have been proven useful in assisting western classical singing training. Jingju (also known as Beijing or Peking opera) singing is different from western singing in terms of most of the perceptual dimensions, and the trainees are taught by using mouth/heart method. In this paper, we first present the training method used in the professional jingju training classroom scenario and show the potential benefits of introducing the MIR technologies into the training process. The main part of this paper dedicates to identify the potential MIR technologies for jingju singing training. To this intent, we answer the question: how the jingju singing tutors and trainees value the importance of each jingju musical dimension-intonation, rhythm, loudness, tone quality and pronunciation? This is done by (i) classifying the classroom singing practices, tutor's verbal feedbacks into these 5 dimensions, (ii) surveying the trainees. Then, with the help of the music signal analysis, a finer inspection on the classroom practice recording examples reveals the detailed elements in the training process. Finally, based on the above analysis, several potential MIR technologies are identified and would be useful for the jingju singing training.
