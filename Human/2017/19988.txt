Impact of Coreference Resolution on Slot Filling

In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of coreference resolution for natural language processing on the example of the TAC Slot Filling shared task. We illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of automatic coreference resolution systems and provide experimental results to show that they improve performance in the slot filling end-to-end setting. Finally, we publish KBPchains, a resource containing automatically extracted coreference chains from the TAC source corpus in order to support other researchers working on this topic.
