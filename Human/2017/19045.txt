Gaussian Filter in CRF Based Semantic Segmentation

Artificial intelligence is making great changes in academy and industry with the fast development of deep learning, which is a branch of machine learning and statistical learning. Fully convolutional network [1] is the standard model for semantic segmentation. Conditional random fields coded as CNN [2] or RNN [3] and connected with FCN has been successfully applied in object detection [4]. In this paper, we introduce a multi-resolution neural network for FCN and apply Gaussian filter to the extended CRF kernel neighborhood and the label image to reduce the oscillating effect of CRF neural network segmentation, thus achieve higher precision and faster training speed.
