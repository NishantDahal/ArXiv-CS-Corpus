Better Protocol for XOR Game using Communication Protocol and Nonlocal Boxes

Buhrman showed that an efficient communication protocol implies a reliable XOR game protocol. This idea rederives Linial and Shraibman's lower bounds of communication complexity, which was derived by using factorization norms, with worse constant factor in much more intuitive way. In this work, we improve and generalize Buhrman's idea, and obtain a class of lower bounds for classical communication complexity including an exact Linial and Shraibman's lower bound as a special case. In the proof, we explicitly construct a protocol for XOR game from a classical communication protocol by using a concept of nonlocal boxes and Paw≈Çowski et al.'s elegant protocol, which was used for showing the violation of information causality in superquantum theories.
