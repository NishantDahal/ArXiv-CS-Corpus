Time-Invariant LDPC Convolutional Codes

Spatially coupled codes have been shown to universally achieve the capacity for a large class of channels. Many variants of such codes have been introduced to date. We discuss a further such variant that is particularly simple and is determined by a very small number of parameters. More precisely, we consider time-invariant low-density convolutional codes with very large constraint lengths.
  We show via simulations that, despite their extreme simplicity, such codes still show the threshold saturation behavior known from the spatially coupled codes discussed in the literature. Further, we show how the size of the typical minimum stopping set is related to basic parameters of the code. Due to their simplicity and good performance, these codes might be attractive from an implementation perspective.
