Developing a concept-level knowledge base for sentiment analysis in Singlish

In this paper, we present Singlish sentiment lexicon, a concept-level knowledge base for sentiment analysis that associates multiword expressions to a set of emotion labels and a polarity value. Unlike many other sentiment analysis resources, this lexicon is not built by manually labeling pieces of knowledge coming from general NLP resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. Instead, it is automatically constructed by applying graph-mining and multi-dimensional scaling techniques on the affective common-sense knowledge collected from three different sources. This knowledge is represented redundantly at three levels: semantic network, matrix, and vector space. Subsequently, the concepts are labeled by emotions and polarity through the ensemble application of spreading activation, neural networks and an emotion categorization model.
