Ultrametrics in the genetic code and the genome

Ultrametric approach to the genetic code and the genome is considered and developed. $p$-Adic degeneracy of the genetic code is pointed out. Ultrametric tree of the codon space is presented. It is shown that codons and amino acids can be treated as $p$-adic ultrametric networks. Ultrametric modification of the Hamming distance is defined and noted how it can be useful. Ultrametric approach with $p$-adic distance is an attractive and promising trend towards investigation of bioinformation.
