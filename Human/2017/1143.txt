On Upper Bounds on the Church-Rosser Theorem

The Church-Rosser theorem in the type-free lambda-calculus is well investigated both for beta-equality and beta-reduction.  We provide a new proof of the theorem for beta-equality  with no use of parallel reductions, but simply with Takahashi's translation  (Gross-Knuth strategy). Based on this,   upper bounds for reduction sequences on the theorem are obtained as  the fourth level of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy.
