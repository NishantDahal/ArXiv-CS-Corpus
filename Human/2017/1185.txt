Evaluating the Dynamic Behavior of Database Applications

This paper explores the effect that changing access patterns has on the performance of database management systems. Changes in access patterns play an important role in determining  the  efficiency  of  key  performance  optimization  techniques,  such  as  dynamic  clustering, prefetching,  and  buffer  replacement.  However,  all  existing  benchmarks  or  evaluation  frameworks  produce  static  access  patterns  in  which  objects  are  always  accessed  in  the  same  order repeatedly. Hence, we have proposed the Dynamic Evaluation Framework (DEF) that simulates access pattern changes using configurable styles of change. DEF has been designed to be open and fully extensible (e.g., new access pattern change models can be added easily). In this paper,  we  instantiate  DEF  into  the  Dynamic  object  Evaluation  Framework  (DoEF)  which  is designed for object databases, i.e., object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multi-media databases or most XML databases.The  capabilities  of  DoEF  have  been  evaluated  by  simulating  the  execution  of  four  different dynamic  clustering  algorithms.  The results confirm our  analysis  that  flexible  conservative  re-clustering is the key in determining a clustering algorithm's ability to adapt to changes in access pattern.  These  results  show  the  effectiveness  of  DoEF  at  determining  the  adaptability  of  each dynamic  clustering  algorithm  to  changes  in  access  pattern  in  a  simulation  environment.  In  a second  set  of  experiments,  we have used  DoEF  to  compare  the  performance  of  two  real-life  object stores  :  Platypus  and  SHORE.  DoEF has  helped  to  reveal  the  poor  swapping  performance  of Platypus.
