Code review and cooperative pair programming best practice

We need ways to improve the code quality. Programmers have different level of tenure and experience. Standard and programming languages change and we are forced to re-use legacy code with minimum revision. Programmers develop their habits and can be slow to incorporate new technologies to simplify the code or improve the performance. We rolled out our customized code review and pair programming process to address these issues. The paper discusses the about the improvement of mandatory code review and pair programming practiced in the commercial software development, and also proposes effective approaches to customize the code review and pair programming to avoid the pitfalls and keep the benefits.
