The Mutual information of LDGM codes

We provide matching upper and lower bounds on the mutual information in noisy reconstruction of parity check codes and thereby prove a long-standing conjecture by Montanari [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 2005]. Besides extending a prior concentration result of Abbe and Montanari [Theory of Computing 2015] to the case of odd check degrees, we precisely determine the conjectured formula for code ensembles of arbitrary degree distribution, thus capturing a broad class of capacity approaching codes.
