Diffusion and confusion of chaotic iteration based hash functions

To guarantee the integrity and security of data transmitted through the Internet, hash functions are fundamental tools. But recent researches have shown that security flaws exist in the most widely used hash functions. So a new way to improve their security performance is urgently demanded. In this article, we propose new hash functions based on chaotic iterations, which have chaotic properties as defined by Devaney. The corresponding diffusion and confusion analyzes are provided and a comparative study between the proposed hash functions is carried out, to make their use more applicable in any security context.
