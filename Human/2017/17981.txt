Linear Computer-Music through Sequences over Galois Fields

It is shown how binary sequences can be associated with automatic composition of monophonic pieces. We are concerned with the composition of e-music from finite field structures. The information at the input may be either random or information from a black-and-white, grayscale or color picture. New e-compositions and music score are made available, including a new piece from the famous Lenna picture: the score of the e-music <<Between Lenna's eyes in C major.>> The corresponding stretch of music score are presented. Some particular structures, including clock arithmetic (mod 12), GF(7), GF(8), GF(13) and GF(17) are addressed. Further, multilevel block-codes are also used in a new approach of e-music composition, engendering a particular style as an e-composer. As an example, Pascal multilevel block codes recently introduced are handled to generate a new style of electronic music over GF(13).
