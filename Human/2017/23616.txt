A Bio-Inspired Multi-Exposure Fusion Framework for Low-light Image Enhancement

Low-light images are not conducive to human observation and computer vision algorithms due to their low visibility. Although many image enhancement techniques have been proposed to solve this problem, existing methods inevitably introduce contrast under- and over-enhancement. Inspired by human visual system, we design a multi-exposure fusion framework for low-light image enhancement. Based on the framework, we propose a dual-exposure fusion algorithm to provide an accurate contrast and lightness enhancement. Specifically, we first design the weight matrix for image fusion using illumination estimation techniques. Then we introduce our camera response model to synthesize multi-exposure images. Next, we find the best exposure ratio so that the synthetic image is well-exposed in the regions where the original image is under-exposed. Finally, the enhanced result is obtained by fusing the input image and the synthetic image according to the weight matrix. Experiments show that our method can obtain results with less contrast and lightness distortion compared to that of several state-of-the-art methods.
