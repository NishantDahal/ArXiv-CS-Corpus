The Velocity of the Decoding Wave for Spatially Coupled Codes on BMS Channels

We consider the dynamics of belief propagation decoding of spatially coupled Low-Density Parity-Check codes. It has been conjectured that after a short transient phase, the profile of "error probabilities" along the spatial direction of a spatially coupled code develops a uniquely-shaped wave-like solution that propagates with constant velocity v. Under this assumption, and for transmission over general Binary Memoryless Symmetric channels, we derive a formula for v. We also propose approximations that are simpler to compute and support our findings using numerical data.
