This article describes a method of getting a harmonious combination of colors, developed by us on the basis of the relationship of color and acoustic waves. Presents a parallel between harmoniously matched colors and the concept of harmony in music theory (consonance). Describes the physical assumption of the essence of the phenomenon of harmony (consonance). The article also provides algorithm of implementation wave method for the sRGB color model.
