Computation of Controllable and Coobservable Sublanguages in Decentralized Supervisory Control via Communication

In decentralized supervisory control, several local supervisors cooperate to accomplish a common goal (specification). Controllability and coobservability are the key conditions to achieve a specification in the controlled system. We construct a controllable and coobservable sublanguage of the specification by using additional communications between supervisors. Namely, we extend observable events of local supervisors via communication and apply a fully decentralized computation of local supervisors. Coobservability is then guaranteed by construction. Sufficient conditions to achieve the centralized optimal solution are discussed. Our approach can be used for both prefix-closed and non-prefix-closed specifications.
