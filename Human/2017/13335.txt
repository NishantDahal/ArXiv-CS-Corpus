On recent advances in 2D Constrained Delaunay triangulation algorithms

In this article, recent works on 2D Constrained Delaunay triangulation(CDT) algorithms have been reported. Since the review of CDT algorithms presented by de Floriani(Issues on Machine Vision, Springer Vienna, pg. 95--104, 1989), different algorithms for construction and applications of CDT have appeared in literature each concerned with different aspects of computation and different suitabilities. Therefore, objective of this work is to report an update over that review article considering contemporary prominent algorithms and generalizations for the problem of two dimensional Constrained Delaunay triangulation.
