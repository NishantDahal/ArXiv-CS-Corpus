Characterizing and Enumerating Walsh-Hadamard Transform Algorithms

We propose a way of characterizing the algorithms computing a Walsh-Hadamard transform that consist of a sequence of arrays of butterflies ($I_{2^{n-1}}\otimes \text{DFT}_2$) interleaved by linear permutations. Linear permutations are those that map linearly the binary representation of its element indices. We also propose a method to enumerate these algorithms.
