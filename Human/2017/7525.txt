Inconsistency in the ordinal pairwise comparisons method with and without ties

Comparing alternatives in pairs is a well-known method of ranking creation. Experts are asked to perform a series of binary comparisons and then, using mathematical methods, the final ranking is prepared. As experts conduct the individual assessments, they may not always be consistent. The level of inconsistency among individual assessments is widely accepted as a measure of the ranking quality. The higher the ranking quality, the greater its credibility. One way to determine the level of inconsistency among the paired comparisons is to calculate the value of the inconsistency index. One of the earliest and most widespread inconsistency indexes is the consistency coefficient defined by Kendall and Babington Smith. In their work, the authors consider binary pairwise comparisons, i.e., those where the result of an individual comparison can only be: better or worse. The presented work extends the Kendall and Babington Smith index to sets of paired comparisons with ties. Hence, this extension allows the decision makers to determine the inconsistency for sets of paired comparisons, where the result may also be "equal." The article contains a definition and analysis of the most inconsistent set of pairwise comparisons with and without ties. It is also shown that the most inconsistent set of pairwise comparisons with ties represents a special case of the more general set cover problem.
