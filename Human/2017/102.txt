Communication Cost of Transforming a Nearest Plane Partition to the Voronoi Partition

We consider the problem of distributed computation of the nearest lattice point for a two dimensional lattice. An interactive model of communication is considered. We address the problem of reconfiguring a specific rectangular partition, a nearest plane, or Babai, partition, into the Voronoi partition. Expressions are derived for the error probability as a function of the total number of communicated bits. With an infinite number of allowed communication rounds, the average cost of achieving zero error probability is shown to be finite. For the interactive model, with a single round of communication, expressions are obtained for the error probability as a function of the bits exchanged. We observe that the error exponent depends on the lattice.
