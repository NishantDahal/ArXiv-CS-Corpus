Joint Backhaul-Access Analysis of Full Duplex Self-Backhauling Heterogeneous Networks

With the successful demonstration of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) transceivers, a new research dimension has been added to wireless networks. This paper proposes an interesting use case of this capability for IBFD self-backhauling heterogeneous networks (HetNet). IBFD self-backhauling in a HetNet refers to IBFD-enabled small cells backhauling themselves with macro cells over the wireless channel. Owing to their IBFD capability, the small cells simultaneously communicate over the access and backhaul links, using the same frequency band. The idea is doubly advantageous, as it obviates the need for fiber backhauling small cells every hundred meters and allows the access spectrum to be reused for backhauling at no extra cost. This work considers the case of a two-tier cellular network with IBFD-enabled small cells, wirelessly backhauling themselves with conventional macro cells. For clear exposition, the case considered is that of FDD network, where within access and backhaul links, the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) are frequency duplexed ($f1$, $f2$ respectively), while the total frequency spectrum used at access and backhaul ($f1+f2$) is the same. Analytical expressions for coverage and average downlink (DL) rate in such a network are derived using tools from the field of stochastic geometry. It is shown that DL rate in such networks could be close to double that of a conventional TDD/FDD self-backhauling network, at the expense of reduced coverage due to higher interference in IBFD networks. For the proposed IBFD network, the conflicting aspects of increased interference on one side and high spectral efficiency on the other are captured into a mathematical model. The mathematical model introduces an end-to-end joint analysis of backhaul (or fronthaul) and access links, in contrast to the largely available access-centric studies.
