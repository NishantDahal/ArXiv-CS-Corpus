Extension complexities of Cartesian products involving a pyramid

It is an open question whether the linear extension complexity of the Cartesian product of two polytopes P, Q is the sum of the extension complexities of P and Q. We give an affirmative answer to this question for the case that one of the two polytopes is a pyramid.
