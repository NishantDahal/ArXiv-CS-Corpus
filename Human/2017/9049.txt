A Correspondence Relaxation Approach for 3D Shape Reconstruction

This paper presents a new method for 3D shape reconstruction based on two existing methods. A 3D reconstruction from a single photograph is introduced by both papers: the first one uses a photograph and a set of existing 3D model to generate the 3D object in the photograph, while the second one uses a photograph and a selected similar model to create the 3D object in the photograph. According to their difference, we propose a relaxation based method for more accurate correspondence establishment and shape recovery. The experiment demonstrates promising results compared to the state-of-the-art work on 3D shape estimation.
