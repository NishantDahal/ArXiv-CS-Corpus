eLinda: Explorer for Linked Data

To realize the premise of the Semantic Web towards knowledgeable machines, one might often integrate an application with emerging RDF graphs. Nevertheless, capturing the content of a rich and open RDF graph by existing tools requires both time and expertise. We demonstrate eLinda - an explorer for Linked Data. The challenge addressed by eLinda is that of understanding the rich content of a given RDF graph. The core functionality is an exploration path, where each step produces a bar chart (histogram) that visualizes the distribution of classes in a set of nodes (URIs). In turn, each bar represents a set of nodes that can be further expanded through the bar chart in the path. We allow three types of explorations: subclass distribution, property distribution, and object distribution for a property of choice.
