A Complete Year of User Retrieval Sessions in a Social Sciences Academic Search Engine

In this paper, we present an open data set extracted from the transaction log of the social sciences academic search engine sowiport. The data set includes a filtered set of 484,449 retrieval sessions which have been carried out by sowiport users in the period from April 2014 to April 2015. We propose a description of interactions performed by the academic search engine users that can be used in different applications such as result ranking improvement, user modeling, query reformulation analysis, search pattern recognition.
