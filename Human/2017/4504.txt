Computer of Things a Proposal to Speed up IoT Development

This paper propose and predict the need for a new line of computer production that can facilitate and accelerate the improvements of things and systems towards IoT networks. The proposed computer that is named Computer of Thing, CoT, will speed up the establishment of smart world in a synchronized way with similar standards, communication protocols, and hardware and software. Also, the need for a new standardization body in addition to those who exist is stated that will motivate governments to invest more on IoT development. However, to show the importance of proposed CoT, a brief review on IoT present status is performed and then some terminologies and classification of IoT networks is presented. This classification helps manufacturers to gain a proper view for their future products development. Then, observing from production point of view the need for CoT is highlighted. Finally, as smart systems may work in different dimensions of applications via internet or intranet connectivity, the basic specifications of proposed CoT are presented. Consequently, due to nature of CoTs, a new multi- dimension multi-hierarchy control strategy is proposed.
