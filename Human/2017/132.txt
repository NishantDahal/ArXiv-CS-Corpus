Detection of Face using Viola Jones and Recognition using Back Propagation Neural Network

Detection and recognition of the facial images of people is an intricate problem which has garnered much attention during recent years due to its ever increasing applications in numerous fields. It continues to pose a challenge in finding a robust solution to it. Its scope extends to catering the security, commercial and law enforcement applications. Research for moreover a decade on this subject has brought about remarkable development with the modus operandi like human computer interaction, biometric analysis and content based coding of images, videos and surveillance. A trivial task for brain but cumbersome to be imitated artificially. The commonalities in faces does pose a problem on various grounds but features such as skin color, gender differentiate a person from the other. In this paper the facial detection has been carried out using Viola-Jones algorithm and recognition of face has been done using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN).
