Verification of Design Decisions in Communication Protocol by Evaluation of Temporal Logic Formulas

During the project of a communication protocol, many design decisions influence the behavior of the protocol and its correctness. Formal specification and verification of the protocol may prove its correctness. In this paper, an example of a verification of design decision using formal specification in CSM automata and verification in temporal logic is presented.
