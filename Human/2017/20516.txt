Symmetric Synthesis

We study the problem of determining whether a given temporal specification can be implemented by a symmetric system, i.e., a system composed from identical components. Symmetry is an important goal in the design of distributed systems, because systems that are composed from identical components are easier to build and maintain. We show that for the class of rotation-symmetric architectures, i.e., multi-process architectures where all processes have access to all system inputs, but see different rotations of the inputs, the symmetric synthesis problem is EXPTIME-complete in the number of processes. In architectures where the processes do not have access to all input variables, the symmetric synthesis problem becomes undecidable, even in cases where the standard distributed synthesis problem is decidable.
