Comparison of Uniform and Random Sampling for Speech and Music Signals

In this paper, we will provide a comparison between uniform and random sampling for speech and music signals. There are various sampling and recovery methods for audio signals. Here, we only investigate uniform and random schemes for sampling and basic low-pass filtering and iterative method with adaptive thresholding for recovery. The simulation results indicate that uniform sampling with cubic spline interpolation outperforms other sampling and recovery methods.
