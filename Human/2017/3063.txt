Exponent for classical-quantum multiple access channel

In this paper we obtain a lower bound of exponent of average probability of error for classical quantum multiple access channel, which implies that for all rate pairs in the capacity region is achievable by a code with exponential probability of error. Thus we re-obtain the direct coding theorem.
