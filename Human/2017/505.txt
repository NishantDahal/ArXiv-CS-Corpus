Higher-order Pooling of CNN Features via Kernel Linearization for Action Recognition

Most successful deep learning algorithms for action recognition extend models designed for image-based tasks such as object recognition to video. Such extensions are typically trained for actions on single video frames or very short clips, and then their predictions from sliding-windows over the video sequence are pooled for recognizing the action at the sequence level. Usually this pooling step uses the first-order statistics of frame-level action predictions. In this paper, we explore the advantages of using higher-order correlations; specifically, we introduce Higher-order Kernel (HOK) descriptors generated from the late fusion of CNN classifier scores from all the frames in a sequence. To generate these descriptors, we use the idea of kernel linearization. Specifically, a similarity kernel matrix, which captures the temporal evolution of deep classifier scores, is first linearized into kernel feature maps. The HOK descriptors are then generated from the higher-order co-occurrences of these feature maps, and are then used as input to a video-level classifier. We provide experiments on two fine-grained action recognition datasets and show that our scheme leads to state-of-the-art results.
