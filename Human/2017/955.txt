The Flow of Information in Interactive Quantum Protocols: the Cost of Forgetting

In the context of two-party interactive quantum communication protocols, we study a recently defined notion of quantum information cost (QIC), which possesses most of the important properties of its classical analogue. Although this definition has the advantage to be valid for fully quantum inputs and tasks, its interpretation for classical tasks remained rather obscure. Also, the link between this new notion and other notions of information cost for quantum protocols that had previously appeared in the literature was not clear, if existent at all.
  We settle both these issues: for quantum communication with classical inputs, we provide an alternate characterization of QIC in terms of information about the input registers, avoiding any reference to the notion of a purification of the classical input state. We provide an exact operational interpretation of this alternative characterization as the sum of the cost of transmitting information about the classical inputs and the cost of forgetting information about these inputs. To obtain this characterization, we prove a general lemma, the Information Flow Lemma, assessing exactly the transfer of information in general interactive quantum processes. Furthermore, we clarify the link between QIC and IC of classical protocols by simulating quantumly classical protocols.
  Finally, we apply these concepts to argue that any quantum protocol that does not forget information solves Disjointness on n-bits in Omega (n) communication, completely losing the quadratic quantum speedup. This provides a specific sense in which forgetting information is a necessary feature of interactive quantum protocols. We also apply these concepts to prove that QIC at zero-error is exactly n for the Inner Product function, and n (1 - o(1)) for a random Boolean function on n+n bits.
