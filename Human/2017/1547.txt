The parameterized space complexity of embedding along a path

The embedding problem is to decide, given an ordered pair of structures, whether or not there is an injective homomorphism from the first structure to the second. We study this problem using an established perspective in parameterized complexity theory: the universe size of the first structure is taken to be the parameter, and we define the embedding problem relative to a class ${\cl A}$ of structures to be the restricted version of the general problem where the first structure must come from ${\cl A}$. We initiate a systematic complexity study of this problem family, by considering classes whose structures are what we call rooted path structures; these structures have paths as Gaifman graphs. Our main theorem is a dichotomy theorem on classes of rooted path structures.
