Mitigation of Phase Noise in Massive MIMO Systems: A Rate-Splitting Approach

This work encompasses Rate-Splitting (RS), providing significant benefits in multi-user settings in the context of huge degrees of freedom promised by massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). However, the requirement of massive MIMO for cost-efficient implementation makes them more prone to hardware imperfections such as phase noise (PN). As a result, we focus on a realistic broadcast channel with a large number of antennas and hampered by the unavoidable PN. Moreover, we employ the RS transmission strategy, and we show its robustness against PN, since the sum-rate does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although, the analytical results are obtained by means of the deterministic equivalent analysis, they coincide with simulation results even for finite system dimensions.
