On the Complexity of Instationary Gas Flows

We study a simplistic model of instationary gas flows consisting of a sequence of k stationary gas flows. We present efficiently solvable cases and NP-hardness results, establishing complexity gaps between stationary and instationary gas flows (already for k=2) as well as between instationary gas s-t-flows and instationary gas b-flows.
