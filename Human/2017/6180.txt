Popular Matching with Lower Quotas

We consider the well-studied Hospital Residents (HR) problem in the presence of lower quotas (LQ). The input instance consists of a bipartite graph $G = (\mathcal{R} \cup \mathcal{H}, E)$ where $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ denote sets of residents and hospitals respectively. Every vertex has a preference list that imposes a strict ordering on its neighbors. In addition, each hospital $h$ has an associated upper-quota $q^+(h)$ and lower-quota $q^-(h)$. A matching $M$ in $G$ is an assignment of residents to hospitals, and $M$ is said to be feasible if every resident is assigned to at most one hospital and a hospital $h$ is assigned at least $q^-(h)$ and at most $q^+(h)$ residents.
  Stability is a de-facto notion of optimality in a model where both sets of vertices have preferences. A matching is stable if no unassigned pair has an incentive to deviate from it. It is well-known that an instance of the HRLQ problem need not admit a feasible stable matching. In this paper, we consider the notion of popularity for the HRLQ problem. A matching $M$ is popular if no other matching $M'$ gets more votes than $M$ when vertices vote between $M$ and $M'$. When there are no lower quotas, there always exists a stable matching and it is known that every stable matching is popular.
  We show that in an HRLQ instance, although a feasible stable matching need not exist, there is always a matching that is popular in the set of feasible matchings. We give an efficient algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality matching that is popular amongst all the feasible matchings in an HRLQ instance.
