Quantum oblivious transfer and bit commitment protocols based on two non-orthogonal states coding

Oblivious transfer protocols (R-OT and OT$_{1}^{2}$) are presented based on non-orthogonal states transmission, and the bit commitment protocols on the top of OT$_{1}^{2}$ are constructed. Although these OT protocols are all unconditional secure, the bit commitment protocols based on OT protocols are not secure against attack similar to that presented by no-go theorem.
