An Efficient Framework for Information Security in Cloud Computing Using Auditing Algorithm Shell (AAS)

There is a dynamic escalation and extension in the new infrastructure, educating personnel and licensing new computer programs in the field of IT, due to the emergence of Cloud Computing (CC) paradigm. It has become a quick growing segment of IT business in last couple of years. However, due to the rapid growth of data, people and IT firms, the issue of information security is getting more complex. One of the major concerns of the user is, at what degree the data is safe on Cloud? In spite of all promotional material encompassing the cloud, consortium customers are not willing to shift their business on the cloud. Data security is the major problem which has limited the scope of cloud computing. In new cloud computing infrastructure, the techniques such as the Strong Secure Shell and Encryption are deployed to guarantee the authenticity of the user through logs systems. The vendors utilize these logs to analyze and view their data. Therefore, this implementation is not enough to ensure security, privacy and authoritative use of the data. This paper introduces quad layered framework for data security, data privacy, data breaches and process associated aspects. Using this layered architecture we have preserved the secrecy of confidential information and tried to build the trust of user on cloud computing. This layered framework prevents the confidential information by multiple means i.e. Secure Transmission of Data, Encrypted Data and its Processing, Database Secure Shell and Internal/external log Auditing.
