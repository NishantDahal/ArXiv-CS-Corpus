On the Fusion of Compton Scatter and Attenuation Data for Limited-view X-ray Tomographic Applications

In this paper we demonstrate the utility of fusing energy-resolved observations of Compton scattered photons with traditional attenuation data for the joint recovery of mass density and photoelectric absorption in the context of limited view tomographic imaging applications. We begin with the development of a physical and associated numerical model for the Compton scatter process. Using this model, we propose a variational approach recovering these two material properties. In addition to the typical data-fidelity terms, the optimization functional includes regularization for both the mass density and photoelectric coefficients. We consider a novel edge-preserving method in the case of mass density. To aid in the recovery of the photoelectric information, we draw on our recent method in \cite{r15} and employ a non-local regularization scheme that builds on the fact that mass density is more stably imaged. Simulation results demonstrate clear advantages associated with the use of both scattered photon data and energy resolved information in mapping the two material properties of interest. Specifically, comparing images obtained using only conventional attenuation data with those where we employ only Compton scatter photons and images formed from the combination of the two, shows that taking advantage of both types of data for reconstruction provides far more accurate results.
