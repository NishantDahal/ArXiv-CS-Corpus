Proceedings 14th International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and its Applications

This volume contains the proceedings of the Fourteenth International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and Its Applications, ACL2 2017, a two-day workshop held in Austin, Texas, USA, on May 22-23, 2017. ACL2 workshops occur at approximately 18-month intervals, and they provide a technical forum for researchers to present and discuss improvements and extensions to the theorem prover, comparisons of ACL2 with other systems, and applications of ACL2 in formal verification.
  ACL2 is a state-of-the-art automated reasoning system that has been successfully applied in academia, government, and industry for specification and verification of computing systems and in teaching computer science courses. Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore were awarded the 2005 ACM Software System Award for their work on ACL2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore theorem-prover family.
  The proceedings of ACL2 2017 include the seven technical papers and two extended abstracts that were presented at the workshop. Each submission received two or three reviews. The workshop also included three invited talks: "Using Mechanized Mathematics in an Organization with a Simulation-Based Mentality", by Glenn Henry of Centaur Technology, Inc.; "Formal Verification of Financial Algorithms, Progress and Prospects", by Grant Passmore of Aesthetic Integration; and "Verifying Oracle's SPARC Processors with ACL2" by Greg Grohoski of Oracle. The workshop also included several rump sessions discussing ongoing research and the use of ACL2 within industry.
