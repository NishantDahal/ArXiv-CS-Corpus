Partition-based Caching in Large-Scale SIC-Enabled Wireless Networks

Existing designs for content dissemination do not fully explore and exploit potential caching and computation capabilities in advanced wireless networks. In this paper, we propose two partition-based caching designs, i.e., a coded caching design based on Random Linear Network Coding and an uncoded caching design. We consider the analysis and optimization of the two caching designs in a large-scale successive interference cancelation (SIC)-enabled wireless network. First, under each caching design, by utilizing tools from stochastic geometry and adopting appropriate approximations, we derive a tractable expression for the successful transmission probability in the general file size regime. To further obtain design insights, we also derive closed-form expressions for the successful transmission probability in the small and large file size regimes, respectively. Then, under each caching design, we consider the successful transmission probability maximization in the general file size regime, which is an NP-hard problem. By exploring structural properties, we successfully transform the original optimization problem into a Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP), and obtain a near optimal solution with 1/2 approximation guarantee and polynomial complexity. We also obtain closed-form asymptotically optimal solutions. The analysis and optimization results show the advantage of the coded caching design over the uncoded caching design, and reveal the impact of caching and SIC capabilities. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the two proposed caching designs achieve significant performance gains over some baseline caching designs.
