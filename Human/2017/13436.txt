Study and Analysis of MAC/IPAD Lab Configuration

This paper is about three virtualization modes: VMware, Parallels, and Boot Camping. The trade off of their testing is the hardware requirements. The main question is, among the three, which is the most suitable? The answer actually varies from user to user. It depends on the user needs. Moreover, it is necessary to consider its performance, graphics, efficiency and reliability, and interoperability, and that is our major scope. In order to take the final decision in choosing one of the modes it is important to run some tests, which costs a lot in terms of money, complexity, and time consumption. Therefore, in order to overcome this trade off, most of the research has been done through online benchmarking and my own anticipation. The final solution was extracted after comparing all previously mentioned above and after rigorous testing made which will be introduced later in this document.
