Fuzzy Authentication using Rank Distance

Fuzzy authentication allows authentication based on the fuzzy matching of two objects, for example based on the similarity of two strings in the Hamming metric, or on the similiarity of two sets in the set difference metric. Aim of this paper is to show other models and algorithms of secure fuzzy authentication, which can be performed using the rank metric. A few schemes are presented which can then be applied in different scenarios and applications.
