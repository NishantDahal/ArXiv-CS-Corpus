Locally Differentially Private Heavy Hitter Identification

The notion of Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables users to answer sensitive questions while preserving their privacy. The basic LDP frequent oracle protocol enables the aggregator to estimate the frequency of any value. But when the domain of input values is large, finding the most frequent values, also known as the heavy hitters, by estimating the frequencies of all possible values, is computationally infeasible. In this paper, we propose an LDP protocol for identifying heavy hitters. In our proposed protocol, which we call Prefix Extending Method (PEM), users are divided into groups, with each group reporting a prefix of her value. We analyze how to choose optimal parameters for the protocol and identify two design principles for designing LDP protocols with high utility. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of our proposed protocol.
