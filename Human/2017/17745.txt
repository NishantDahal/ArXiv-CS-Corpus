Memristive System Design for Variable Pixel G-Neighbor Denoising Filter

Image blurring artifact is the main challenge to any spatial, denoising filters. This artifact is contributed by the heterogeneous intensities within the given neighborhood or window of fixed size. Selection of most similar intensities (G-Neighbors) helps to adapt the window shape which is of edge-aware nature and subsequently reduce this blurring artifact. The paper presents a memristive circuit design to implement this variable pixel G-Neighbor filter. The memristive circuits exhibits parallel processing capabilities (near real-time) and neuromorphic architectures. The proposed design is demonstrated as simulations of both algorithm (MATLAB) and circuit (SPICE). Circuit design is evaluated for various parameters such as processing time, fabrication area used, and power consumption. Denoising performance is demonstrated using image quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean square error (MSE), and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Combining adaptive filtering method with mean filter resulted in average improvement of MSE to about 65\% reduction, increase of PSNR and SSIM to nearly 18\% and 12\% correspondingly.
