Some New Permutation Polynomials over Finite Fields

In this paper, we construct a new class of complete permutation monomials and several classes of permutation polynomials. Further, by giving another characterization of o-polynomials, we obtain a class of permutation polynomials of the form $G(x)+ γTr(H(x))$, where G(X) is neither a permutation nor a linearized polynomial. This is an answer to the open problem 1 of Charpin and Kyureghyan in [P. Charpin and G. Kyureghyan, When does $G(x)+ γTr(H(x))$ permute $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$?, Finite Fields and Their Applications 15 (2009) 615--632].
