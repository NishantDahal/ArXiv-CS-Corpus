An Upper Bound of 7n/6 for the Minimum Size 2EC on Cubic 3-Edge Connected Graphs

In this paper, we study the minimum size 2-edge connected spanning subgraph problem (henceforth 2EC) and show that every 3-edge connected cubic graph G=(V, E), with n=|V| allows a 2EC solution for G of size at most 7n/6, which improves upon Boyd, Iwata and Takazawa's guarantee of 6n/5.
