Two-weight codes and second order recurrences

Cyclic codes of dimension $2$ over a finite field are shown to have at most two nonzero weights. This extends a construction of Rao et al (2010) and disproves a conjecture of Schmidt-White (2002). We compute their weight distribution, and give a condition on the roots of their check polynomials for them to be MDS.
