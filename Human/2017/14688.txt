Second Order Analysis for Joint Source-Channel Coding with Markovian Source

We derive the second order rates of joint source-channel coding, whose source obeys an irreducible and ergodic Markov process when the channel is a discrete memoryless, while a previous study solved it only in a special case. We also compare the joint source-channel scheme with the separation scheme in the second order regime while a previous study made a notable comparison only with numerical calculation. To make these two notable progress, we introduce two kinds of new distribution families, switched Gaussian convolution distribution and *-product distribution, which are defined by modifying the Gaussian distribution.
