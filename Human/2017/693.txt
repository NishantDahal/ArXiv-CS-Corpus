Optimal Elephant Flow Detection

Monitoring the traffic volumes of elephant flows, including the total byte count per flow, is a fundamental capability for online network measurements. We present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for solving this problem in terms of both space and time complexity. This improves on previous approaches, which can only count the number of packets in constant time. We evaluate our work on real packet traces, demonstrating an up to X2.5 speedup compared to the best alternative.
