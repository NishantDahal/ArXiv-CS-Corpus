Fast generalized Bruhat decomposition

The deterministic recursive pivot-free algorithms for the computation of generalized Bruhat decomposition of the matrix in the field and for the computation of the inverse matrix are presented. This method has the same complexity as algorithm of matrix multiplication and it is suitable for the parallel computer systems.
