A Novel Detection Strategy for Nonlinear Frequency-Division Multiplexing

A novel decision feedback detection strategy exploiting a causality property of the nonlinear Fourier transform is introduced. The novel strategy achieves a considerable performance improvement compared to previously adopted strategies in terms of Q-factor.
