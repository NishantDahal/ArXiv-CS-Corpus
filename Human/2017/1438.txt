On QoS-assured degraded provisioning in service-differentiated multi-layer elastic optical networks

The emergence of new network applications is driving network operators to not only fulfill dynamic bandwidth requirements, but offer various grades of service. Degraded provisioning provides an effective solution to flexibly allocate resources in various dimensions to reduce blocking for differentiated demands when network congestion occurs. In this work, we investigate the novel problem of online degraded provisioning in service-differentiated multi-layer networks with optical elasticity. Quality of Service (QoS) is assured by service-holding-time prolongation and immediate access as soon as the service arrives without set-up delay. We decompose the problem into degraded routing and degraded resource allocation stages, and design polynomial-time algorithms with the enhanced multi-layer architecture to increase the network flexibility in temporal and spectral dimensions. Illustrative results verify that we can achieve significant reduction of network service failures, especially for requests with higher priorities. The results also indicate that degradation in optical layer can increase the network capacity, while the degradation in electric layer provides flexible time-bandwidth exchange.
