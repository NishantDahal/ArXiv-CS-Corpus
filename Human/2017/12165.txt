Lensless computational imaging through deep learning

Deep learning has been proven to yield reliably generalizable answers to numerous classification and decision tasks. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be trained to solve inverse problems in computational imaging. We experimentally demonstrate a lens-less imaging system where a DNN was trained to recover a phase object given a raw intensity image recorded some distance away.
