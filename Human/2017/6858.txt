Uplink Multiuser Massive MIMO Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs: A Coding-Theoretic Approach

This paper considers an uplink multiuser massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), in which K users with a single-antenna communicate with one base station (BS) with Nr antennas. In this system, we present a novel multiuser MIMO detection framework that is inspired by coding theory. The key idea of the proposed framework is to create a code C of length 2Nr over a spatial domain. This code is constructed by a so-called auto-encoding function that is not designable but is completely described by a channel transformation followed by a quantization function of the ADCs. From this point of view, we convert a multiuser MIMO detection problem into an equivalent channel coding problem, in which a codeword of C corresponding to users' messages is sent over 2Nr parallel channels, each with different channel reliability. To the resulting problem, we propose a novel weighted minimum distance decoding (wMDD) that appropriately exploits the unequal channel reliabilities. It is shown that the proposed wMDD yields a non-trivial gain over the conventional minimum distance decoding (MDD). From coding-theoretic viewpoint, we identify that bit-error-rate (BER) exponentially decreases with the minimum distance of the code C, which plays a similar role with a condition number in conventional MIMO systems. Furthermore, we develop the communication method that uses the wMDD for practical scenarios where the BS has no knowledge of channel state information. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the superiority of the proposed method.
