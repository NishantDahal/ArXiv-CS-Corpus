Optimized Secure Position Sharing with Non-trusted Servers

Today, location-based applications and services such as friend finders and geo-social networks are very popular. However, storing private position information on third-party location servers leads to privacy problems. In our previous work, we proposed a position sharing approach for secure management of positions on non-trusted servers, which distributes position shares of limited precision among servers of several providers. In this paper, we propose two novel contributions to improve the original approach. First, we optimize the placement of shares among servers by taking their trustworthiness into account. Second, we optimize the location update protocols to minimize the number of messages between mobile device and location servers.
