Auto-clustering Output Layer: Automatic Learning of Latent Annotations in Neural Networks

In this paper, we discuss a different type of semi-supervised setting: a coarse level of labeling is available for all observations but the model has to learn a fine level of latent annotation for each one of them. Problems in this setting are likely to be encountered in many domains such as text categorization, protein function prediction, image classification as well as in exploratory scientific studies such as medical and genomics research. We consider this setting as simultaneously performed supervised classification (per the available coarse labels) and unsupervised clustering (within each one of the coarse labels) and propose a novel output layer modification called auto-clustering output layer (ACOL) that allows concurrent classification and clustering based on Graph-based Activity Regularization (GAR) technique. As the proposed output layer modification duplicates the softmax nodes at the output layer for each class, GAR allows for competitive learning between these duplicates on a traditional error-correction learning framework to ultimately enable a neural network to learn the latent annotations in this partially supervised setup. We demonstrate how the coarse label supervision impacts performance and helps propagate useful clustering information between sub-classes. Comparative tests on three of the most popular image datasets MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-100 rigorously demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed approach.
