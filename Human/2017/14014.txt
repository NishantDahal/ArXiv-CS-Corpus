Let's hear it from RETTA: A Requirements Elicitation Tool for TrAffic management systems

The area of Traffic Management (TM) is characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and imprecision. The complexity of software systems in the TM domain which contributes to a more challenging Requirements Engineering (RE) job mainly stems from the diversity of stakeholders and complexity of requirements elicitation in this domain. This work brings an interactive solution for exploring functional and non-functional requirements of software-reliant systems in the area of traffic management. We prototyped the RETTA tool which leverages the wisdom of the crowd and combines it with machine learning approaches such as Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes to help with the requirements elicitation and classification task in the TM domain. This bridges the gap among stakeholders from both areas of software development and transportation engineering. The RETTA prototype is mainly designed for requirements engineers and software developers in the area of TM and can be used on Android-based devices.
