Automatic Organisation, Segmentation, and Filtering of User-Generated Audio Content

Using solely the information retrieved by audio fingerprinting techniques, we propose methods to treat a possibly large dataset of user-generated audio content, that (1) enable the grouping of several audio files that contain a common audio excerpt (i.e., are relative to the same event), and (2) give information about how those files are correlated in terms of time and quality inside each event. Furthermore, we use supervised learning to detect incorrect matches that may arise from the audio fingerprinting algorithm itself, whilst ensuring our model learns with previous predictions. All the presented methods were further validated by user-generated recordings of several different concerts manually crawled from YouTube.
