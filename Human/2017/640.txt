Automatic Knot Adjustment Using Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm for B-Spline Curve Approximation

In this paper, a new approach to solve the cubic B-spline curve fitting problem is presented based on a meta-heuristic algorithm called " dolphin echolocation ". The method minimizes the proximity error value of the selected nodes that measured using the least squares method and the Euclidean distance method of the new curve generated by the reverse engineering. The results of the proposed method are compared with the genetic algorithm. As a result, this new method seems to be successful.
