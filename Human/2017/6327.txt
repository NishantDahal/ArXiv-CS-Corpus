Complexity Analysis of the Parallel Guided Ejection Search for the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows

This paper presents the pessimistic time complexity analysis of the parallel algorithm for minimizing the fleet size in the pickup and delivery problem with time windows. We show how to estimate the pessimistic complexity step by step. This approach can be easily adopted to other parallel algorithms for solving complex transportation problems.
