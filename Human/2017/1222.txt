Pornography consumption in Social Media

The structure of a social network is fundamentally related to the interests of its members. People assort spontaneously based on the topics that are relevant to them, forming social groups that revolve around different subjects. Online social media are also favorable ecosystems for the formation of topical communities centered on matters that are not commonly taken up by the general public because of the embarrassment, discomfort, or shock they may cause. Those are communities that depict or discuss what are usually referred to as deviant behaviors, conducts that are commonly considered inappropriate because they are somehow violative of society's norms or moral standards that are shared among the majority of the members of society. Pornography consumption, drug use, excessive drinking, illegal hunting, eating disorders, or any self-harming or addictive practice are all examples of deviant behaviors.
