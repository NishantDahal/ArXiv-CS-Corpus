Machine learning application in the life time of materials

Materials design and development typically takes several decades from the initial discovery to commercialization with the traditional trial and error development approach. With the accumulation of data from both experimental and computational results, data based machine learning becomes an emerging field in materials discovery, design and property prediction. This manuscript reviews the history of materials science as a disciplinary the most common machine learning method used in materials science, and specifically how they are used in materials discovery, design, synthesis and even failure detection and analysis after materials are deployed in real application. Finally, the limitations of machine learning for application in materials science and challenges in this emerging field is discussed.
