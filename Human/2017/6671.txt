RaPro: A Novel 5G Rapid Prototyping System Architecture

We propose a novel fifth-generation (5G) rapid prototyping (RaPro) system architecture by combining FPGA-privileged modules from a software defined radio (or FPGA-coprocessor) and high-level programming language for advanced algorithms from multi-core general purpose processors. The proposed system architecture exhibits excellent flexibility and scalability in the development of a 5G prototyping system. As a proof of concept, a multi-user full-dimension multiple-input and multiple-output system is established based on the proposed architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed architecture in large-scale antenna and wideband communication systems.
