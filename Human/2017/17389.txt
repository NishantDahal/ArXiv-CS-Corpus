Model-free prediction of noisy chaotic time series by deep learning

We present a deep neural network for a model-free prediction of a chaotic dynamical system from noisy observations. The proposed deep learning model aims to predict the conditional probability distribution of a state variable. The Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is employed to model the nonlinear dynamics and a softmax layer is used to approximate a probability distribution. The LSTM model is trained by minimizing a regularized cross-entropy function. The LSTM model is validated against delay-time chaotic dynamical systems, Mackey-Glass and Ikeda equations. It is shown that the present LSTM makes a good prediction of the nonlinear dynamics by effectively filtering out the noise. It is found that the prediction uncertainty of a multiple-step forecast of the LSTM model is not a monotonic function of time; the predicted standard deviation may increase or decrease dynamically in time.
