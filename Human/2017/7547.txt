Correcting Two Deletions and Insertions in Racetrack Memory

Racetrack memory is a non-volatile memory engineered to provide both high density and low latency, that is subject to synchronization or shift errors. This paper describes a fast coding solution, in which delimiter bits assist in identifying the type of shift error, and easily implementable graph-based codes are used to correct the error, once identified. A code that is able to detect and correct double shift errors is described in detail.
