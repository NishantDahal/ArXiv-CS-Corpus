Personalized Ranking for Context-Aware Venue Suggestion

Making personalized and context-aware suggestions of venues to the users is very crucial in venue recommendation. These suggestions are often based on matching the venues' features with the users' preferences, which can be collected from previously visited locations. In this paper we present a novel user-modeling approach which relies on a set of scoring functions for making personalized suggestions of venues based on venues content and reviews as well as users context. Our experiments, conducted on the dataset of the TREC Contextual Suggestion Track, prove that our methodology outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.
