Learning Entrepreneurship with Serious Games - A Classroom Approach

The use of educational games for pedagogical practice can provide new conceptions of teaching-learning in an interactive environment stimulating the acquisition of new knowledge. The so-called serious games are focused on the goal of transmitting educational content or training to the user. In the context of entrepreneurship, serious games appear to have greater importance due to the multidisciplinary of the knowledge needed. Therefore, we propose the adoption of the Entrexplorer game in the context of a university classroom. The game is a cloud-based serious game about the theme of entrepreneurship where users can access learning contents that will assist them in the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills. The organization of the game in eight levels with six additional floors let students learn the different dimensions of an entrepreneurship project while progressing during the gameplay.
