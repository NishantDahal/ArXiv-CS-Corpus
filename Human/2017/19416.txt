Bundle Optimization for Multi-aspect Embedding

Understanding semantic similarity among images is the core of a wide range of computer vision applications. An important step towards this goal is to collect and learn human perceptions. Interestingly, the semantic context of images is often ambiguous as images can be perceived with emphasis on different aspects, which may be contradictory to each other.
  In this paper, we present a method for learning the semantic similarity among images, inferring their latent aspects and embedding them into multi-spaces corresponding to their semantic aspects.
  We consider the multi-embedding problem as an optimization function that evaluates the embedded distances with respect to the qualitative clustering queries. The key idea of our approach is to collect and embed qualitative measures that share the same aspects in bundles. To ensure similarity aspect sharing among multiple measures, image classification queries are presented to, and solved by users. The collected image clusters are then converted into bundles of tuples, which are fed into our bundle optimization algorithm that jointly infers the aspect similarity and multi-aspect embedding. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-embedding approaches on various datasets, and scales well for large multi-aspect similarity measures.
