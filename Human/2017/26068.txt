DeepRadiologyNet: Radiologist Level Pathology Detection in CT Head Images

We describe a system to automatically filter clinically significant findings from computerized tomography (CT) head scans, operating at performance levels exceeding that of practicing radiologists. Our system, named DeepRadiologyNet, builds on top of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained using approximately 3.5 million CT head images gathered from over 24,000 studies taken from January 1, 2015 to August 31, 2015 and January 1, 2016 to April 30 2016 in over 80 clinical sites. For our initial system, we identified 30 phenomenological traits to be recognized in the CT scans. To test the system, we designed a clinical trial using over 4.8 million CT head images (29,925 studies), completely disjoint from the training and validation set, interpreted by 35 US Board Certified radiologists with specialized CT head experience. We measured clinically significant error rates to ascertain whether the performance of DeepRadiologyNet was comparable to or better than that of US Board Certified radiologists. DeepRadiologyNet achieved a clinically significant miss rate of 0.0367% on automatically selected high-confidence studies. Thus, DeepRadiologyNet enables significant reduction in the workload of human radiologists by automatically filtering studies and reporting on the high-confidence ones at an operating point well below the literal error rate for US Board Certified radiologists, estimated at 0.82%.
