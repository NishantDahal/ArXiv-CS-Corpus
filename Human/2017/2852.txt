2-subcoloring is NP-complete for planar comparability graphs

A $k$-subcoloring of a graph is a partition of the vertex set into at most $k$ cluster graphs, that is, graphs with no induced $P_3$. 2-subcoloring is known to be NP-complete for comparability graphs and three subclasses of planar graphs, namely triangle-free planar graphs with maximum degree 4, planar perfect graphs with maximum degree 4, and planar graphs with girth 5. We show that 2-subcoloring is also NP-complete for planar comparability graphs with maximum degree 4.
