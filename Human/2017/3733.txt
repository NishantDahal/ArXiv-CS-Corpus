Handover Analysis on High Speed Train with Doppler Frequency Spread

This paper investigates the handover performance on high speed train (HST) via different speed under three scenarios, which are viaduct environment, cutting environment and urban area. To provide stable wireless service, we adopt Long Term Evolution (LTE) for high speed railway (HST) system. Moreover, we consider the effect of speed on handover procedure. Interchannel interference (ICI) caused by the Doppler frequency spread is related to the speed of HST, which is considered into the proposed system to evaluate the system handover performance including handover starting time and handover delay. Numerical results show the parameters in the system including SNR, throughput, handover starting time and handover delay. The proposed system provides some insights for practical railway system.
