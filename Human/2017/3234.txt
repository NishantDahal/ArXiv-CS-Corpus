Algebraic and algorithmic aspects of radical parametrizations

In this article algebraic constructions are introduced in order to study the variety defined by a radical parametrization (a tuple of functions involving complex numbers, $n$ variables, the four field operations and radical extractions). We provide algorithms to implicitize radical parametrizations and to check whether a radical parametrization can be reparametrized into a rational parametrization.
