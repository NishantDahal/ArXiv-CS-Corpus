Continuity of Channel Parameters and Operations under Various DMC Topologies

We study the continuity of many channel parameters and operations under various topologies on the space of equivalent discrete memoryless channels (DMC). We show that mutual information, channel capacity, Bhattacharyya parameter, probability of error of a fixed code, and optimal probability of error for a given code rate and blocklength, are continuous under various DMC topologies. We also show that channel operations such as sums, products, interpolations, and ArÄ±kan-style transformations are continuous.
