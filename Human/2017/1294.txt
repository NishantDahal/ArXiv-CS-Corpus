Uniform s-cross-intersecting families

In this paper we study a question related to the classical Erd≈ës-Ko-Rado theorem, which states that any family of $k$-element subsets of the set $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$ in which any two sets intersect, has cardinality at most ${n-1\choose k-1}$.
  We say that two non-empty families are $\mathcal A, \mathcal B\subset {[n]\choose k}$ are {\it $s$-cross-intersecting}, if for any $A\in\mathcal A,B\in \mathcal B$ we have $|A\cap B|\ge s$. In this paper we determine the maximum of $|\mathcal A|+|\mathcal B|$ for all $n$. This generalizes a result of Hilton and Milner, who determined the maximum of $|\mathcal A|+|\mathcal B|$ for nonempty $1$-cross-intersecting families.
