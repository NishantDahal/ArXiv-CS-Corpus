To Bond or not to Bond: An Optimal Channel Allocation Algorithm For Flexible Dynamic Channel Bonding in WLANs

IEEE 802.11 has evolved from 802.11a/b/g/n to 802.11ac to meet rapidly increasing data rate requirements in WLANs. One important technique adopted in 802.11ac is the channel bonding (CB) scheme that combines multiple 20MHz channels for a single transmission in 5GHz band. In order to effectively access channel after a series of contention operations, 802.11ac specifies two different CB operations: Dynamic Channel Bonding (DCB) and Static Channel Bonding (SCB). This paper proposes an optimal channel allocation algorithm to achieve maximal throughputs in DCB WLANs. Specifically, we first adopt a continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to analyze the equilibrium throughputs. Based on the throughput analysis, we then construct an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) model with the target of maximizing system throughputs. By solving the INLP model, we then propose an optimal channel allocation algorithm based on the Branch-and-Bound Method (BBM). It turns out that the maximal throughput performance can be achieved under the channel allocation scheme with the least overlapped channels among WLANs. Simulations show that the proposed channel allocation algorithm can achieve the maximal system throughput under various network settings. Our analysis on the optimal channel allocation schemes brings new insights into the design and optimization of future WLANs, especially for those adopting channel bonding technique.
