Compact Descriptors for Video Analysis: the Emerging MPEG Standard

This paper provides an overview of the on-going compact descriptors for video analysis standard (CDVA) from the ISO/IEC moving pictures experts group (MPEG). MPEG-CDVA targets at defining a standardized bitstream syntax to enable interoperability in the context of video analysis applications. During the developments of MPEGCDVA, a series of techniques aiming to reduce the descriptor size and improve the video representation ability have been proposed. This article describes the new standard that is being developed and reports the performance of these key technical contributions.
