pch2csd: an application for converting Nord Modular G2 patches into Csound code

The paper presents the pch2csd project, focused on converting patches of popular Clavia Nord Modular G2 synthesizer into code of Csound language. Now discontinued, Nord Modular G2 left a lot of interesting patches for sound synthesis and algorithmic composition. To give this heritage a new life, we created our project with the hope for being able to simulate the original sound and behavior of Nord Modular.
