Joint Spectrum Reuse and Power Control for Multi-Sharing Device-to-Device Communication

Compared to current mobile networks, next-generation mobile networks are expected to support higher numbers of simultaneously connected devices and to achieve higher system spectrum efficiency and lower power consumption. To achieve these goals, we study the multi-sharing device-to-device (D2D) communication, which allows any cellular user equipment to share its radio resource with multiple D2D devices. We jointly consider resource block reuse and power control and then develop the MISS algorithm. Simulation results show that MISS performs very well in terms of transmission power consumption, system throughput, and the number of permitted D2D devices.
