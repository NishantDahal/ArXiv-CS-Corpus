DDoS Attacks: Tools, Mitigation Approaches, and Probable Impact on Private Cloud Environment

The future of the Internet is predicted to be on the cloud, resulting in more complex and more intensive computing, but possibly also a more insecure digital world.

This paper discusses several prominent approaches introduced to counter DDoS attacks in private clouds. We also discuss issues and challenges to mitigate DDoS attacks in private clouds.
