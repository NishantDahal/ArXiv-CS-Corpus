Optimal Synthesis of Overconstrained 6R Linkages by Curve Evolution

The paper presents an optimal synthesis of overconstrained linkages, based on the factorization of rational curves (representing one parametric motions) contained in Study's quadric. The group of Euclidean displacements is embedded in a affine space where a metric between motions based on the homogeneous mass distribution of the end effector is used to evolve the curves such that they are fitted to a set of target poses. The metric will measure the distance (in Euclidean sense) between the two resulting vectors of the feature points displaced by the two motions. The evolution is driven by the normal velocity of the curve projected in the direction of the target points. In the end we present an example for the optimal synthesis of an overconstrained $6R$ linkage by choosing a set of target poses and explaining in steps how this approach is implemented.
