Investigating the Best Radio Propagation Model for 4G - WiMAX Networks Deployment in 2530MHz Band in Sub- Saharan Africa

One of the salient factors to look at during wireless network planning is developing a modified path loss prediction models to suit a new environment other than the one it was originally designed for. This helps to give accurate predictive outcomes. This paper seeks to demonstrate the effects of applying correction factors on radio propagation model used in planning for 4G-WiMAX network through a comparative analysis between estimated and field data collected on received power for a 4G-WiMAX site. Four existing models were considered for this research; COST 231 Hata, Extended COST 231 Hata, SUI (Stanford University Interim) and Ericsson models. In order to optimize and validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, the mean square error (MSE) and correlation co-efficient were calculated for each model between the predicted and the measured received power for the selected area before and after applying an appropriate correction factor. Based on this, the Extended COST-231 Hata prediction model proved to correlate well with the measured values since it showed least Mean Square Error (MSE) but with highest correlation co-efficient. Through comparative analysis of the corrected models, the Extended COST-231 Hata model could be applied for effective planning of the radio systems in Ghana and the subregion at large.
