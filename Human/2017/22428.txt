Two-Dimensional Super-Resolution via Convex Relaxation

In this paper, we address the problem of recovering point sources from two dimensional low-pass measurements, which is known as super-resolution problem. This is the fundamental concern of many applications such as electronic imaging, optics, microscopy, and line spectral estimation. We assume that the point sources are located in the square $[0,1]^2$ with unknown locations and complex amplitudes. The only available information is low-pass Fourier measurements band-limited to integer square $[-f_c,f_c]^2$. The signal is estimated by minimizing Total Variation $(\mathrm{TV})$ norm, which leads to a convex optimization problem. It is shown that if the sources are separated by at least $1.68/f_c$, there exist a dual certificate that is sufficient for exact recovery.
