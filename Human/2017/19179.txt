Guiding Reinforcement Learning Exploration Using Natural Language

In this work we present a technique to use natural language to help reinforcement learning generalize to unseen environments. This technique uses neural machine translation, specifically the use of encoder-decoder networks, to learn associations between natural language behavior descriptions and state-action information. We then use this learned model to guide agent exploration using a modified version of policy shaping to make it more effective at learning in unseen environments. We evaluate this technique using the popular arcade game, Frogger, under ideal and non-ideal conditions. This evaluation shows that our modified policy shaping algorithm improves over a Q-learning agent as well as a baseline version of policy shaping.
