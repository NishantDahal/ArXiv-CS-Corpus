Capacity Results on Multiple-Input Single-Output Wireless Optical Channels

This paper derives upper and lower bounds on the capacity of the multiple-input single-output free-space optical intensity channel with signal-independent additive Gaussian noise subject to both an average-intensity and a peak-intensity constraint. In the limit where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to infinity, the asymptotic capacity is specified, while in the limit where the SNR tends to zero, the exact slope of the capacity is also given.
