Architectural Challenges and Solutions for Collocated LWIP - A Network Layer Perspective

Achieving a tighter level of aggregation between LTE and Wi-Fi networks at the radio access network (a.k.a. LTE-Wi-Fi Aggregation or LWA) has become one of the most prominent solutions in the era of 5G to boost network capacity and improve end user's quality of experience. LWA offers flexible resource scheduling decisions for steering user traffic via LTE and Wi-Fi links. In this work, we propose a Collocated LTE/WLAN Radio Level Integration architecture at IP layer (C-LWIP), an enhancement over 3GPP non-collocated LWIP architecture. We have evaluated C-LWIP performance in various link aggregation strategies (LASs). A C-LWIP node (i.e., the node having collocated, aggregated LTE eNodeB and Wi-Fi access point functionalities) is implemented in NS-3 which introduces a traffic steering layer (i.e., Link Aggregation Layer) for efficient integration of LTE and Wi-Fi. Using extensive simulations, we verified the correctness of C-LWIP module in NS-3 and evaluated the aggregation benefits over standalone LTE and Wi-Fi networks with respect to varying number of users and traffic types. We found that split bearer performs equivalently to switched bearer for UDP flows and switched bearer outperforms split bearer in the case of TCP flows. Also, we have enumerated the potential challenges to be addressed for unleashing C-LWIP capabilities. Our findings also include WoD-Link Aggregation Strategy which is shown to improve system throughput by 50% as compared to Naive-LAS in a densely populated indoor stadium environment.
