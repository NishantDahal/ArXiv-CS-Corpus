Software Development Under Stringent Hardware Constraints: Do Agile Methods Have a Chance?

Agile software development methods have been suggested as useful in many situations and contexts. However, only few (if any) experiences are available regarding the use of agile methods in embedded domain where the hardware sets tight requirements for the software. This development domain is arguably far away from the agile home ground. This paper explores the possibility of using agile development techniques in this environment and defines the requirements for new agile methods targeted to facilitate the development of embedded software. The findings are based on an empirical study over a period 12 months in the development of low-level telecommunications software. We maintain that by addressing the requirements we discovered, agile methods can be successful also in the embedded software domain.
