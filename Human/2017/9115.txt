Model Checking in The COSMA Environment as a Support for The Design of Pipelined Processing

The case study analyzed in the report involves the behavioral specification and verification of a three-stage pipeline consisting of mutually concurrent modules which also compete for a shared resource. The system components are specified in terms of Concurrent State Machines (CSM) and the verification technique used is the temporal model checking in the COSMA environment.
