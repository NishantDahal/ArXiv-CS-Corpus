Probability Prediction based Reliable Opportunistic (PRO) Routing Algorithm for VANETs

In the Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), due to the high mobility of vehicles, the network parameters change frequently and the information which the sender maintains may outdate when it wants to transmit data packet to the receiver, so for improving the routing effective, we propose the probability prediction based reliable (PRO) opportunistic routing for VANETs. The PRO routing algorithm can predict the variation of Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and packet queue length (PQL) in the receiver. The prediction results are used to determine the utility of each relaying vehicle in the candidate set. The calculation of the vehicle utility is weight based algorithm and the weights are the variances of SINR and PQL of the candidate relaying vehicles. The relaying priority of each relaying vehicle is determined by the value of the utility. By these innovations, the PRO can achieve better routing performance (such as the packet delivery ratio, the end-to-end delay, and the network throughput) than the SRPE, ExOR (street-centric), and GPSR routing algorithms.
