Data Access for LIGO on the OSG

During 2015 and 2016, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) conducted a three-month observing campaign. These observations delivered the first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. To search for these signals, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration uses the PyCBC search pipeline. To deliver science results in a timely manner, LIGO collaborated with the Open Science Grid (OSG) to distribute the required computation across a series of dedicated, opportunistic, and allocated resources. To deliver the petabytes necessary for such a large-scale computation, our team deployed a distributed data access infrastructure based on the XRootD server suite and the CernVM File System (CVMFS). This data access strategy grew from simply accessing remote storage to a POSIX-based interface underpinned by distributed, secure caches across the OSG.
