Low-Rank Hidden State Embeddings for Viterbi Sequence Labeling

In textual information extraction and other sequence labeling tasks it is now common to use recurrent neural networks (such as LSTM) to form rich embedded representations of long-term input co-occurrence patterns. Representation of output co-occurrence patterns is typically limited to a hand-designed graphical model, such as a linear-chain CRF representing short-term Markov dependencies among successive labels. This paper presents a method that learns embedded representations of latent output structure in sequence data. Our model takes the form of a finite-state machine with a large number of latent states per label (a latent variable CRF), where the state-transition matrix is factorized---effectively forming an embedded representation of state-transitions capable of enforcing long-term label dependencies, while supporting exact Viterbi inference over output labels. We demonstrate accuracy improvements and interpretable latent structure in a synthetic but complex task based on CoNLL named entity recognition.
