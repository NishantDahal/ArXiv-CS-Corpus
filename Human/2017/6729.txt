Seamless Requirements

Popular notations for functional requirements specifications frequently ignore developers' needs, target specific development models, or require translation of requirements into tests for verification; the results can give out-of-sync or downright incompatible artifacts. Seamless Requirements, a new approach to specifying functional requirements, contributes to developers' understanding of requirements and to software quality regardless of the process, while the process itself becomes lighter due to the absence of tests in the presence of formal verification. A development case illustrates these benefits, and a discussion compares seamless requirements to other approaches.
