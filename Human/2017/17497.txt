Notes on rate equations in nonlinear continuum mechanics

The paper gives an introduction to rate equations in nonlinear continuum mechanics which should obey specific transformation rules. Emphasis is placed on the geometrical nature of the operations involved in order to clarify the different concepts. The paper is particularly concerned with common classes of constitutive equations based on corotational stress rates and their proper implementation in time for solving initial boundary value problems. Hypoelastic simple shear is considered as an example application for the derived theory and algorithms.
