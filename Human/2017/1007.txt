Newswire and Social Media are the major sources of information in our time. While the topical demographic of Western Media was subjects of studies in the past, less is known about Chinese Media.

Our experiments reveal a biased interest of China towards the West, which becomes particularly apparent when comparing the interest in celebrities.
