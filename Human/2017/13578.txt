Simplified Long Short-term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks: part II

This is part II of three-part work. Here, we present a second set of inter-related five variants of simplified Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks by further reducing adaptive parameters. Two of these models have been introduced in part I of this work. We evaluate and verify our model variants on the benchmark MNIST dataset and assert that these models are comparable to the base LSTM model while use progressively less number of parameters. Moreover, we observe that in case of using the ReLU activation, the test accuracy performance of the standard LSTM will drop after a number of epochs when learning parameter become larger. However all of the new model variants sustain their performance.
