Adaptive Traffic Signal Control: Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Experience Replay and Target Network

Adaptive traffic signal control, which adjusts traffic signal timing according to real-time traffic, has been shown to be an effective method to reduce traffic congestion. Available works on adaptive traffic signal control make responsive traffic signal control decisions based on human-crafted features (e.g. vehicle queue length). However, human-crafted features are abstractions of raw traffic data (e.g., position and speed of vehicles), which ignore some useful traffic information and lead to suboptimal traffic signal controls. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that automatically extracts all useful features (machine-crafted features) from raw real-time traffic data and learns the optimal policy for adaptive traffic signal control. To improve algorithm stability, we adopt experience replay and target network mechanisms. Simulation results show that our algorithm reduces vehicle delay by up to 47% and 86% when compared to another two popular traffic signal control algorithms, longest queue first algorithm and fixed time control algorithm, respectively.
