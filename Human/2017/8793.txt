Interference Alignment with Power Splitting Relays in Multi-User Multi-Relay Networks

In this paper, we study a multi-user multi-relay interference-channel network, where energy-constrained relays harvest energy from sources' radio frequency (RF) signals and use the harvested energy to forward the information to destinations. We adopt the interference alignment (IA) technique to address the issue of interference, and propose a novel transmission scheme with the IA at sources and the power splitting (PS) at relays. A distributed and iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal PS ratios is further proposed, aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the network. The analysis is then validated by simulation results. Our results show that the proposed scheme with the optimal design significantly improves the performance of the network.
