LiftUpp: Support to develop learner performance

Various motivations exist to move away from the simple assessment of knowledge towards the more complex assessment and development of competence. However, to accommodate such a change, high demands are put on the supporting e-infrastructure in terms of intelligently collecting and analysing data. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and how they are being addressed by LiftUpp, a system that is now used in 70% of UK dental schools, and is finding wider applications in physiotherapy, medicine and veterinary science. We describe how data is collected for workplace-based development in dentistry using a dedicated iPad app, which enables an integrated approach to linking and assessing work flows, skills and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we detail how the various forms of collected data can be fused, visualized and integrated with conventional forms of assessment. This enables curriculum integration, improved real-time student feedback, support for administration, and informed instructional planning. Together these facets contribute to better support for the development of learners' competence in situated learning setting, as well as an improved experience. Finally, we discuss several directions for future research on intelligent teaching systems that are afforded by using the design present within LiftUpp.
