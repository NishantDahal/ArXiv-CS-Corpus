The Snow Team Problem (Clearing Directed Subgraphs by Mobile Agents)

We study several problems of clearing subgraphs by mobile agents in digraphs. The agents can move only along directed walks of a digraph and, depending on the variant, their initial positions may be pre-specified. In general, for a given subset~$\mathcal{S}$ of vertices of a digraph $D$ and a positive integer $k$, the objective is to determine whether there is a subgraph $H=(\mathcal{V}_H,\mathcal{A}_H)$ of $D$ such that (a) $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{V}_H$, (b) $H$ is the union of $k$ directed walks in $D$, and (c) the underlying graph of $H$ includes a Steiner tree for $\mathcal{S}$ in $D$. We provide several results on the polynomial time tractability, hardness, and parameterized complexity of the problem.
