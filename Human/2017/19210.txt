MAC Resolvability: First And Second Order Results

Building upon previous work on the relation between secrecy and channel resolvability, we revisit a secrecy proof for the multiple-access channel from the perspective of resolvability. We then refine the approach in order to obtain some novel results on the second-order achievable rates.
