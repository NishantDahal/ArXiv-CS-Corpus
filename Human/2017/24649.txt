Sadly enough, with online communication getting embedded into our daily communication, incivility and misbehaviour has taken on many nuances from professional misbehaviour to professional decay. Generally flaming starts with the exchange of rude messages and comments, which in turn triggers to higher scale of flaming. To prevent online communication from getting downgraded, it is essential to keep away the hostile users from communication platforms.
