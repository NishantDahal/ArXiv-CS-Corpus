Domain-Sharding for Faster HTTP/2 in Lossy Cellular Networks

HTTP/2 (h2) is a new standard for Web communications that already delivers a large share of Web traffic. Unlike HTTP/1, h2 uses only one underlying TCP connection. In a cellular network with high loss and sudden spikes in latency, which the TCP stack might interpret as loss, using a single TCP connection can negatively impact Web performance. In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis of real world cellular network traffic and design a testbed to emulate loss characteristics in cellular networks. We use the emulated cellular network to measure h2 performance in comparison to HTTP/1.1, for webpages synthesized from HTTP Archive repository data.
  Our results show that, in lossy conditions, h2 achieves faster page load times (PLTs) for webpages with small objects. For webpages with large objects, h2 degrades the PLT. We devise a new domain-sharding technique that isolates large and small object downloads on separate connections. Using sharding, we show that under lossy cellular conditions, h2 over multiple connections improves the PLT compared to h2 with one connection and HTTP/1.1 with six connections. Finally, we recommend content providers and content delivery networks to apply h2-aware domain-sharding on webpages currently served over h2 for improved mobile Web performance.
