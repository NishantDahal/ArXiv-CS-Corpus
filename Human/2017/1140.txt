An Environment for Analyzing Space Optimizations in Call-by-Need Functional Languages

We present an implementation of an interpreter LRPi for the call-by-need calculus LRP, based on a variant of Sestoft's abstract machine Mark 1, extended with an eager garbage collector.  It is used as a tool for exact space usage analyses as a support for our investigations into  space improvements of call-by-need calculi.
