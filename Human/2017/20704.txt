Algebraic Image Processing

We propose an approach to image processing related to algebraic operators acting in the space of images. In view of the interest in the applications in optics and computer science, mathematical aspects of the paper have been simplified as much as possible. Underlying theory, related to rigged Hilbert spaces and Lie algebras, is discussed elsewhere
