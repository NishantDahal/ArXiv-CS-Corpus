Optimal Longest Paths by Dynamic Programming

We propose an optimal algorithm for solving the longest path problem in undirected weighted graphs. By using graph partitioning and dynamic programming, we obtain an algorithm that is significantly faster than other state-of-the-art methods. This enables us to solve instances that have previously been unsolved.
