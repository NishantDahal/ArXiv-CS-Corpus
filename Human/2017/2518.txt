System Modeling in the COSMA Environment

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the COSMA environment can be used for system modeling. This environment is a set of tools based on Concurrent State Machines paradigm and is developed in the Institute of Computer Science at the Warsaw University of Technology. Our demonstration example is a distributed brake control system dedicated for a railway transport. The paper shortly introduces COSMA. Next it shows how the example model can be validated by our temporal logic analyzer.
