HLinear: Exact Dense Linear Algebra in Haskell

We present an implementation in the functional programming language Haskell of the PLE decomposition of matrices over division rings. Our benchmarks indicate that it is competitive with the C-based implementation provided in Flint. Describing the guiding principles of our work, we introduce the reader to basic ideas from high-performance functional programming.
