Estimation of Sparsity via Simple Measurements

We consider several related problems of estimating the 'sparsity' or number of nonzero elements $d$ in a length $n$ vector $\mathbf{x}$ by observing only $\mathbf{b} = M \odot \mathbf{x}$, where $M$ is a predesigned test matrix independent of $\mathbf{x}$, and the operation $\odot$ varies between problems. We aim to provide a $Δ$-approximation of sparsity for some constant $Δ$ with a minimal number of measurements (rows of $M$). This framework generalizes multiple problems, such as estimation of sparsity in group testing and compressed sensing. We use techniques from coding theory as well as probabilistic methods to show that $O(D \log D \log n)$ rows are sufficient when the operation $\odot$ is logical OR (i.e., group testing), and nearly this many are necessary, where $D$ is a known upper bound on $d$. When instead the operation $\odot$ is multiplication over $\mathbb{R}$ or a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, we show that respectively $Θ(D)$ and $Θ(D \log_q \frac{n}{D})$ measurements are necessary and sufficient.
