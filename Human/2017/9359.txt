Requirements Model for Cyber-Physical System

The development of cyber-physical system (CPS) is a big challenge because of its complexity and its complex requirements. Especially in Requirements Engineering (RE), there exist many redundant and conflict requirements. Eliminating conflict requirements and merged redundant/common requirements lead a challenging task at the elicitation phase in the requirements engineering process for CPS. Collecting and optimizing requirements through appropriate process reduce both development time and cost as every functional requirement gets refined and optimized at very first stage (requirements elicitation phase) of the whole development process. Existing researches have focused on requirements those have already been collected. However, none of the researches have worked on how the requirements are collected and refined. This paper provides a requirements model for CPS that gives a direction about the requirements be gathered, refined and cluster in order to developing the CPS independently. The paper also shows a case study about the application of the proposed model to transport system.
