Forensic Investigation of Social Media and Instant Messaging Services in Firefox OS: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Telegram, OpenWapp and Line as Case Studies

Mobile devices are increasingly utilized to access social media and instant messaging services, which allow users to communicate with others easily and quickly. However, the misuse of social media and instant messaging services facilitated conducting different cybercrimes such as cyber stalking, cyber bullying, slander spreading and sexual harassment. Therefore, mobile devices are an important evidentiary piece in digital investigation. In this chapter, we report the results of our investigation and analysis of social media and instant messaging services in Firefox OS. We examined three social media services (Facebook, Twitter and Google+) as well as three instant messaging services (Telegram, OpenWapp and Line). Our analysis may pave the way for future forensic investigators to trace and examine residual remnants of forensics value in FireFox OS.
