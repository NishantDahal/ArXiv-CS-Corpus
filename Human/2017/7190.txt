Outage Analysis for SWIPT-Enabled Two-Way Cognitive Cooperative Communications

In this paper, we study a cooperative cognitive radio network (CCRN) where the secondary user-transmitter (SU-Tx) assists bi-directional communication between a pair of primary users (PUs) following the principle of two-way relaying. In return, it gets access to the spectrum of the PUs to enable its own transmission to SU-receiver (SU-Rx). Further, in order to support sustainable operation of the network, SU-Tx is assumed to harvest energy from the RF signals received from the PUs, using the technique of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Assuming a decode-and-forward behaviour and power-splitting based relaying protocol at SU-Tx, closed form expressions for outage probability of PU and SU are obtained. Simulation results validate our analytical results and illustrate spectrum-efficiency and energy-efficiency advantages of the proposed system over one-way relaying.
