Results of the Survey: Failures in Robotics and Intelligent Systems

In January 2015 we distributed an online survey about failures in robotics and intelligent systems across robotics researchers. The aim of this survey was to find out which types of failures currently exist, what their origins are, and how systems are monitored and debugged - with a special focus on performance bugs. This report summarizes the findings of the survey.
