Hierarchical Convolutional-Deconvolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Liver and Tumor Segmentation

Automatic segmentation of liver and its tumors is an essential step for extracting quantitative imaging biomarkers for accurate tumor detection, diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of tumor response to treatment. MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) provides a common platform for comparing different automatic algorithms on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT images in tasks including 1) liver segmentation, 2) liver tumor segmentation, and 3) tumor burden estimation. We participate this challenge by developing a hierarchical framework based on deep fully convolutional-deconvolutional neural networks (CDNN). A simple CDNN model is firstly trained to provide a quick but coarse segmentation of the liver on the entire CT volume, then another CDNN is applied to the liver region for fine liver segmentation. At last, the segmented liver region, which is enhanced by histogram equalization, is employed as an additional input to the third CDNN for tumor segmentation. Jaccard distance is used as loss function when training CDNN models to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting. Our framework is trained using the 130 challenge training cases provided by LiTS. The evaluation on the 70 challenge testing cases resulted in a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.963 for liver segmentation, a mean DSC of 0.657 for tumor segmentation, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.017 for tumor burden estimation, which ranked our method in the first, fifth and third place, respectively
