Multi-Kernel Polar Codes: Proof of Polarization and Error Exponents

In this paper, we investigate a novel family of polar codes based on multi-kernel constructions, proving that this construction actually polarizes. To this end, we derive a new and more general proof of polarization, which gives sufficient conditions for kernels to polarize. Finally, we derive the convergence rate of the multi-kernel construction and relate it to the convergence rate of each of the constituent kernels.
