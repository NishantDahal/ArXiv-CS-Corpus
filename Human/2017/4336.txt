Concatenated LDPC-Polar Codes Decoding Through Belief Propagation

Owing to their capacity-achieving performance and low encoding and decoding complexity, polar codes have drawn much research interests recently. Successive cancellation decoding (SCD) and belief propagation decoding (BPD) are two common approaches for decoding polar codes. SCD is sequential in nature while BPD can run in parallel. Thus BPD is more attractive for low latency applications. However BPD has some performance degradation at higher SNR when compared with SCD. Concatenating LDPC with Polar codes is one popular approach to enhance the performance of BPD , where a short LDPC code is used as an outer code and Polar code is used as an inner code. In this work we propose a new way to construct concatenated LDPC-Polar code, which not only outperforms conventional BPD and existing concatenated LDPC-Polar code but also shows a performance improvement of 0.5 dB at higher SNR regime when compared with SCD.
