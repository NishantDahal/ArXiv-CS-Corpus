On Low Complexity Detection for QAM Isomorphic Constellations

Despite of the known gap from the Shannon's capacity, several standards are still employing QAM or star shape constellations, mainly due to the existing low complexity detectors. In this paper, we investigate the low complexity detection for a family of QAM isomorphic constellations. These constellations are known to perform very close to the peak-power limited capacity, outperforming the DVB-S2X standard constellations. The proposed strategy is to first remap the received signals to the QAM constellation using the existing isomorphism and then break the log likelihood ratio computations to two one dimensional PAM constellations. Gains larger than 0.6 dB with respect to QAM can be obtained over the peak power limited channels without any increase in detection complexity. Our scheme also provides a systematic way to design constellations with low complexity one dimensional detectors. Several open problems are discussed at the end of the paper.
