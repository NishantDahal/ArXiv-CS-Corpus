Space-Time Channel Modulation

In this paper, we introduce the concept of space-time channel modulation (STCM), which extends the classical space-time block codes into a new third dimension: channel states (transmission media) dimension. Three novel STCM schemes, which provide interesting trade-offs among decoding complexity, error performance and data rate, are proposed. It is shown via computer simulations that the proposed STCM schemes achieve considerably better error performance than the existing media-based modulation (MBM) and classical systems.
