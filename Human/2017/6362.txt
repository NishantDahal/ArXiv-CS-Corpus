Massive MIMO Downlink 1-Bit Precoding with Linear Programming for PSK Signaling

Quantized massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems are gaining more interest due to their power efficiency. We present a new precoding technique to mitigate the multi-user interference and the quantization distortions in a downlink multi-user (MU) multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system with 1-bit quantization at the transmitter. This work is restricted to PSK modulation schemes. The transmit signal vector is optimized for every desired received vector taking into account the 1-bit quantization. The optimization is based on maximizing the safety margin to the decision thresholds of the PSK modulation. Simulation results show a significant gain in terms of the uncoded bit-error-ratio (BER) compared to the existing linear precoding techniques.
