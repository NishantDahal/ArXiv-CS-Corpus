Discrete Dynamic Causal Modeling and Its Relationship with Directed Information

This paper explores the discrete Dynamic Causal Modeling (DDCM) and its relationship with Directed Information (DI). We prove the conditional equivalence between DDCM and DI in characterizing the causal relationship between two brain regions. The theoretical results are demonstrated using fMRI data obtained under both resting state and stimulus based state. Our numerical analysis is consistent with that reported in previous study.
