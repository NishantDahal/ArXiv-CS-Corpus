Parallel implementation of the coupled harmonic oscillator

This article presents the parallel implementation of the coupled harmonic oscillator. From the analytical solution of the coupled harmonic oscillator, the design parameters are obtained. After that, a numerical integration of the system with MATLAB, which is used as a tool of benchmark evaluation, is performed. Next, parallel implementation is performed using a well-known approach like OpenMP and WinAPI. Taking into account the errors of basic parameters of the simulated process, the generated oscillations of the proposed parallel realization are almost identical to the actual solution of the harmonic oscillator model. Test ways to optimize the parallel architecture of computing processes for software implementations of the considered application is carried out. The developed model is used to study a fixed priority scheduling algorithm for real-time parallel threads execution. The proposed parallel implementation of the considered dynamic system has an independent value and can be considered as a test for determining the characteristics of multi-core systems for time-critical simulation problems.
