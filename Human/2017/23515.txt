A Study of Optimizing Heterogeneous Resources for Open IoT

Recently, IoT technologies have been progressed, and many sensors and actuators are connected to networks. Previously, IoT services were developed by vertical integration style. But now Open IoT concept has attracted attentions which achieves various IoT services by integrating horizontal separated devices and services. For Open IoT era, we have proposed the Tacit Computing technology to discover the devices with necessary data for users on demand and use them dynamically. We also implemented elemental technologies of Tacit Computing. In this paper, we propose three layers optimizations to reduce operation cost and improve performance of Tacit computing service, in order to make as a continuous service of discovered devices by Tacit Computing. In optimization process, appropriate function allocations are calculated for device, network and cloud layer before full-scale operation.
