Polylogarithmic Approximation Algorithms for Weighted-$\mathcal{F}$-Deletion Problems

For a family of graphs $\cal F$, the canonical Weighted $\cal F$ Vertex Deletion problem is defined as follows: given an $n$-vertex undirected graph $G$ and a weight function $w: V(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, find a minimum weight subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G-S$ belongs to $\cal F$. We devise a recursive scheme to obtain $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$-approximation algorithms for such problems, building upon the classic technique of finding balanced separators in a graph. Roughly speaking, our scheme applies to problems where an optimum solution $S$, together with a well-structured set $X$, form a balanced separator of $G$. We obtain the first $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$-approximation algorithms for the following problems.
  * We give an $O(\log^2n)$-factor approximation algorithm for Weighted Chordal Vertex Deletion (WCVD), the vertex deletion problem to the family of chordal graphs. On the way, we also obtain a constant factor approximation algorithm for Multicut on chordal graphs.
  * We give an $O(\log^3n)$-factor approximation algorithm for Weighted Distance Hereditary Vertex Deletion (WDHVD). This is the vertex deletion problem to the family of distance hereditary graphs, or equivalently, the family of graphs of rankwidth 1.
  Our methods also allow us to obtain in a clean fashion a $O(\log^{1.5}n)$-approximation algorithm for the Weighted $\cal F$ Vertex Deletion problem when $\cal F$ is a minor closed family excluding at least one planar graph. For the unweighted version of the problem constant factor approximation algorithms are were known~[Fomin et al., FOCS~2012], while for the weighted version considered here an $O(\log n \log\log n)$-approximation algorithm follows from~[Bansal et al., SODA~2017]. We believe that our recursive scheme can be applied to obtain $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$-approximation algorithms for many other problems as well.
