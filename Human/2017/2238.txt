Power Allocation for Secure SWIPT Systems with Wireless-Powered Cooperative Jamming

This paper considers wireless-powered cooperative jamming (CJ) to secure communication between a transmitter (Tx) and an information receiver (IR), in the presence of an energy receiver (ER) which is termed as a potential eavesdropper. The full-duplex jammer harvests energy from the Tx's information signal and transmits jamming signal at the same time, where the jamming signal not only confounds the ER (potential eavesdropper) but also charges the ER. Our goal is to maximize the secrecy information rate by jointly optimizing the power allocation at the Tx and jammer while maintaining the harvested energy requirement of the ER. The studied problem is non-convex and we propose the optimal solution based on the Lagrange method. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes.
