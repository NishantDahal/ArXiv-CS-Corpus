External Evaluation of Event Extraction Classifiers for Automatic Pathway Curation: An extended study of the mTOR pathway

This paper evaluates the impact of various event extraction systems on automatic pathway curation using the popular mTOR pathway. We quantify the impact of training data sets as well as different machine learning classifiers and show that some improve the quality of automatically extracted pathways.
