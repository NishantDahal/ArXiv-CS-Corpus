Kaggle Competition: Expedia Hotel Recommendations

With hundreds, even thousands, of hotels to choose from at every destination, it's difficult to know which will suit your personal preferences. Expedia wants to take the proverbial rabbit hole out of hotel search by providing personalized hotel recommendations to their users. This is no small task for a site with hundreds of millions of visitors every month! Currently, Expedia uses search parameters to adjust their hotel recommendations, but there aren't enough customer specific data to personalize them for each user. In this project, we have taken up the challenge to contextualize customer data and predict the likelihood a user will stay at 100 different hotel groups.
