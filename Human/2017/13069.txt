Grant-Free Massive NOMA: Outage Probability and Throughput

In this paper, we consider a massive uncoordinated non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme where devices have strict latency requirements and no retransmission opportunities are available. Each device chooses a pilot sequence from a predetermined set as its signature and transmits its selected pilot and data simultaneously. A collision occurs when two or more devices choose the same pilot sequence. Collisions are treated as interference to the remaining received signals. We consider successive joint decoding (SJD) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) under a Rayleigh fading and path loss channel model. We first derive the expression for the outage probability for the case where devices transmit at the same fixed rate. Then, we derive the expression for the maximum achievable throughput for the case where devices transmit with rateless codes. Thus, their code rate is adaptive to the system conditions, i.e., load, received powers, and interference. Numerical results verify the accuracy of our analytical expressions. For low data rate transmissions, results show that SIC performs close to that of SJD in terms of outage probability for packet arrival rates up to 10 packets per slot. However, SJD can achieve almost double the throughput of SIC and is, thus, far more superior.
