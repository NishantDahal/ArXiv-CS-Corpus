Multilayer Spectral Graph Clustering via Convex Layer Aggregation: Theory and Algorithms

Multilayer graphs are commonly used for representing different relations between entities and handling heterogeneous data processing tasks. Non-standard multilayer graph clustering methods are needed for assigning clusters to a common multilayer node set and for combining information from each layer. This paper presents a multilayer spectral graph clustering (SGC) framework that performs convex layer aggregation. Under a multilayer signal plus noise model, we provide a phase transition analysis of clustering reliability. Moreover, we use the phase transition criterion to propose a multilayer iterative model order selection algorithm (MIMOSA) for multilayer SGC, which features automated cluster assignment and layer weight adaptation, and provides statistical clustering reliability guarantees. Numerical simulations on synthetic multilayer graphs verify the phase transition analysis, and experiments on real-world multilayer graphs show that MIMOSA is competitive or better than other clustering methods.
