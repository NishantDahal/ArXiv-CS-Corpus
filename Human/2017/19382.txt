Throughput and Robustness Guaranteed Beam Tracking for mmWave Wireless Networks

With the increasing demand of ultra-high-speed wireless communications and the existing low frequency band (e.g., sub-6GHz) becomes more and more crowded, millimeter-wave (mmWave) with large spectra available is considered as the most promising frequency band for future wireless communications. Since the mmWave suffers a serious path-loss, beamforming techniques shall be adopted to concentrate the transmit power and receive region on a narrow beam for achieving long distance communications. However, the mobility of users will bring frequent beam handoff, which will decrease the quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, efficient beam tracking mechanism should be carefully researched. However, the existing beam tracking mechanisms concentrate on system throughput maximization without considering beam handoff and link robustness. This paper proposes a throughput and robustness guaranteed beam tracking mechanism for mobile mmWave communication systems which takes account of both system throughput and handoff probability. Simulation results show that the proposed throughput and robustness guaranteed beam tracking mechanism can provide better performance than the other beam tracking mechanisms.
