Untangling Planar Curves

Any generic closed curve in the plane can be transformed into a simple closed curve by a finite sequence of local transformations called homotopy moves. We prove that simplifying a planar closed curve with $n$ self-crossings requires $Θ(n^{3/2})$ homotopy moves in the worst case. Our algorithm improves the best previous upper bound $O(n^2)$, which is already implicit in the classical work of Steinitz; the matching lower bound follows from the construction of closed curves with large defect, a topological invariant of generic closed curves introduced by Aicardi and Arnold. Our lower bound also implies that $Ω(n^{3/2})$ facial electrical transformations are required to reduce any plane graph with treewidth $Ω(\sqrt{n})$ to a single vertex, matching known upper bounds for rectangular and cylindrical grid graphs. More generally, we prove that transforming one immersion of $k$ circles with at most $n$ self-crossings into another requires $Θ(n^{3/2} + nk + k^2)$ homotopy moves in the worst case. Finally, we prove that transforming one noncontractible closed curve to another on any orientable surface requires $Ω(n^2)$ homotopy moves in the worst case; this lower bound is tight if the curve is homotopic to a simple closed curve.
