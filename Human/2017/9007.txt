Proof Tree Preserving Interpolation

Craig interpolation in SMT is difficult because, e. g., theory combination and integer cuts introduce mixed literals, i. e., literals containing local symbols from both input formulae. In this paper, we present a scheme to compute Craig interpolants in the presence of mixed literals. Contrary to existing approaches, this scheme neither limits the inferences done by the SMT solver, nor does it transform the proof tree before extracting interpolants. Our scheme works for the combination of uninterpreted functions and linear arithmetic but is extendable to other theories. The scheme is implemented in the interpolating SMT solver SMTInterpol.
