Defining Domain-Independent Discovery Informatics

This paper presents a personal account of the early legacy of discovery informatics, especially surrounding the first published definition of domain-independent DI. The state of DI is traced across various reference sources and the literature on the fourth paradigm of the scientific method. Observations are offered on DI, concluding that it will retain its appeal as a highly apt descriptor for research and practice activities that are inherent in our human nature.
