Publish/subscribe-enabled software defined networking for efficient and scalable IoT communications

- The Internet of Things (IoT) is the result of many different enabling technologies such as embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, big-data, etc. used to gather, process, infer, and transmit data. Integrating all these technologies requires a comprehensive and holistic research effort to address all the challenges imposed by these technologies, especially for sensing and delivering information from physical world to cloud-hosted services. In this paper, we outline the most important issues related to standardization efforts, mobility of objects, networking and gateway access, and QoS support. In particular, we describe a novel IoT network architecture that integrates Software Defined Networking (SDN) and the Object Management Group's Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware. The proposed architecture will improve service delivery of IoT system and will bring flexibility to the network.
