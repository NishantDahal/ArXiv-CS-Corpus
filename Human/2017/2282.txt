ARTEMIS: Real-Time Detection and Automatic Mitigation for BGP Prefix Hijacking

Prefix hijacking is a common phenomenon in the Internet that often causes routing problems and economic losses. In this demo, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables network administrators to detect and mitigate prefix hijacking incidents, against their own prefixes. ARTEMIS is based on the real-time monitoring of BGP data in the Internet, and software-defined networking (SDN) principles, and can completely mitigate a prefix hijacking within a few minutes (e.g., 5-6 mins in our experiments) after it has been launched.
