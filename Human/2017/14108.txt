Compositions of Functions and Permutations Specified by Minimal Reaction Systems

This paper studies mathematical properties of reaction systems that was introduced by Enrenfeucht and Rozenberg as computational models inspired by biochemical reaction in the living cells. In particular, we continue the study on the generative power of functions specified by minimal reaction systems under composition initiated by Salomaa. Allowing degenerate reaction systems, functions specified by minimal reaction systems over a quarternary alphabet that are permutations generate the alternating group on the power set of the background set.
