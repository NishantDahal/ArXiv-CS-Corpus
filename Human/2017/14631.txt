Self-synchronization and Self-stabilization of 3D Bipedal Walking Gaits

This paper seeks insight into stabilization mechanisms for periodic walking gaits in 3D bipedal robots. Based on this insight, a control strategy based on virtual constraints, which imposes coordination between joints rather than a temporal evolution, will be proposed for achieving asymptotic convergence toward a periodic motion. For planar bipeds with one degree of underactuation, it is known that a vertical displacement of the center of mass---with downward velocity at the step transition---induces stability of a walking gait. This paper concerns the qualitative extension of this type of property to 3D walking with two degrees of underactuation. It is shown that a condition on the position of the center of mass in the horizontal plane at the transition between steps induces synchronization between the motions in the sagittal and frontal planes. A combination of the conditions for self-synchronization and vertical oscillations leads to stable gaits. The algorithm for self-stabilization of 3D walking gaits is first developed for a simplified model of a walking robot (an inverted pendulum with variable length legs), and then it is extended to a complex model of the humanoid robot Romeo using the notion of Hybrid Zero Dynamics. Simulations of the model of the robot illustrate the efficacy of the method and its robustness.
