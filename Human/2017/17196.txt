An algorithm to estimate the vertices of a tetrahedron from uniform random points inside

In this paper, we give an algorithm to infer the positions of the vertices of an unknown tetrahedron, given a sample of points which are uniformly distributed within the tetrahedron. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated using some numerical experiments.
