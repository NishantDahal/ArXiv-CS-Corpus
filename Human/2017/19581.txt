What Is the True Value of Dynamic TDD: A MAC Layer Perspective

Small cell networks (SCNs) are envisioned to embrace dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) in order to tailor downlink (DL)/uplink (UL) subframe resources to quick variations and burstiness of DL/UL traffic. The study of dynamic TDD is particularly important because it provides valuable insights on the full duplex transmission technology, which has been identified as one of the candidate technologies for the 5th-generation (5G) networks. Up to now, the existing works on dynamic TDD have shown that the UL of dynamic TDD suffers from severe performance degradation due to the strong DL-to-UL interference in the physical (PHY) layer. This conclusion raises a fundamental question: Despite such obvious technology disadvantage, what is the true value of dynamic TDD? In this paper, we answer this question from a media access control (MAC) layer viewpoint and present analytical results on the DL/UL time resource utilization (TRU) of synchronous dynamic TDD, which has been widely adopted in the existing 4th-generation (4G) systems. Our analytical results shed new light on the dynamic TDD in future synchronous 5G networks.
