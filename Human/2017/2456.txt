Scheduling Algorithms for Asymmetric Multi-core Processors

Growing power dissipation due to high performance requirement of processor suggests multicore processor technology, which has become the technology for present and next decade. Research advocates asymmetric multi-core processor system for better utilization of chip real state. However, asymmetric multi core architecture poses a new challenge to operating system scheduler, which traditionally assumes homogeneous hardware. So, scheduling threads to core has become a major issue to operating system kernel. In this paper, proposed scheduling algorithms for asymmetric multicore processors have been categorized. This paper explores some representative algorithms of these classes to get an overview of scheduling algorithms for asymmetric multicore system.
