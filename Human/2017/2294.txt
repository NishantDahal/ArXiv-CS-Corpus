Student's opinions about System for automatic assessment of programming tasks Projekt Tomo

In a previous paper a web service called Projekt Tomo intended to ease the process of learning programming for teachers and students has been described. Since the service received a very warm welcome from teachers and students alike we decided to collect additional information on the students' view of the service in order to improve it even further.
  In the paper we briefly present our web service and a detailed analysis of the questionnaire handed out to the students of the highschool level programming course in Python.
