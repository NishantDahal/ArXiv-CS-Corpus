A Cloud-based Service for Real-Time Performance Evaluation of NoSQL Databases

We have created a cloud-based service that allows the end users to run tests on multiple different databases to find which databases are most suitable for their project. From our research, we could not find another application that enables the user to test several databases to gauge the difference between them. This application allows the user to choose which type of test to perform and which databases to target. The application also displays the results of different tests that were run by other users previously. There is also a map to show the location where all the tests are run to give the user an estimate of the location. Unlike the orthodox static tests and reports conducted to evaluate NoSQL databases, we have created a web application to run and analyze these tests in real time. This web application evaluates the performance of several NoSQL databases. The databases covered are MongoDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB, and Firebase. The web service is accessible from: nosqldb.nextproject.ca.
