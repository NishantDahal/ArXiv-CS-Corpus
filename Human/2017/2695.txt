Cooperative Coded Data Dissemination for Wireless Sensor Networks

In this poster paper we present a data dissemination transmission abstraction for over the air programming (OAP) protocol which is fundamentally different from the previous hop by hop transmission protocols. Instead of imposing the greedy requirement that at least one node in the ith hop receives all packets before transmitting packets to the next hop and its neighbours, we take advantage of the spatial diversity and broadcast nature of wireless transmission to adopt a cooperative approach in which node broadcast whatever packets it has received with the expectation that it will recover the lost packets with high probability by overhearing the broadcast transmissions of its neighbours. The use of coded transmissions ensures that this does not lead to the broadcast storm problem. We validate the improved performance our of proposed transmission scheme with respect to the previous state of the art OAP protocols on a proof-of-concept two-hops TelosB wireless sensor network testbed.
