The Eigenvalue Distribution of Discrete Periodic Time-Frequency Limiting Operators

Bandlimiting and timelimiting operators play a fundamental role in analyzing bandlimited signals that are approximately timelimited (or vice versa). In this paper, we consider a time-frequency (in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain) limiting operator whose eigenvectors are known as the periodic discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (PDPSSs). We establish new nonasymptotic results on the eigenvalue distribution of this operator. As a byproduct, we also characterize the eigenvalue distribution of a set of submatrices of the DFT matrix, which is of independent interest.
