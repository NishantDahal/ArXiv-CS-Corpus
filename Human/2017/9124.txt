Atypical Stable Multipath Routing Strategy in MANET

MANET is a collection of mobile nodes operated by battery source with limited energy reservoir. The dynamic topology and absence of pre-existing infrastructure in MANET makes routing technique more thought-provoking. The arbitrary movement of nodes may lead towards more packet drop, routing overhead and end-to-end delay. Moreover power deficiency in nodes affects the packet forwarding ability and thus reduces network lifetime. So a power aware stable routing strategy is in demand in MANET. In this manuscript we have proposed a novel multipath routing strategy that could select multiple stable routes between source and destination during data transmission depending on two factors residual energy and link expiration time (LET) of nodes. Our proposed energy aware stable multipath routing strategy could attain the reliability, load balancing, and bandwidth aggregation in order to increase the network lifetime.
