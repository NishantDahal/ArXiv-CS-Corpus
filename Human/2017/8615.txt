Universal 3D Wearable Fingerprint Targets: Advancing Fingerprint Reader Evaluations

We present the design and manufacturing of high fidelity universal 3D fingerprint targets, which can be imaged on a variety of fingerprint sensing technologies, namely capacitive, contact-optical, and contactless-optical. Universal 3D fingerprint targets enable, for the first time, not only a repeatable and controlled evaluation of fingerprint readers, but also the ability to conduct fingerprint reader interoperability studies. Fingerprint reader interoperability refers to how robust fingerprint recognition systems are to variations in the images acquired by different types of fingerprint readers. To build universal 3D fingerprint targets, we adopt a molding and casting framework consisting of (i) digital mapping of fingerprint images to a negative mold, (ii) CAD modeling a scaffolding system to hold the negative mold, (iii) fabricating the mold and scaffolding system with a high resolution 3D printer, (iv) producing or mixing a material with similar electrical, optical, and mechanical properties to that of the human finger, and (v) fabricating a 3D fingerprint target using controlled casting. Our experiments conducted with PIV and Appendix F certified optical (contact and contactless) and capacitive fingerprint readers demonstrate the usefulness of universal 3D fingerprint targets for controlled and repeatable fingerprint reader evaluations and also fingerprint reader interoperability studies.
