FPGA implementation of the procedures for video quality assessment

Video resolutions used in variety of media are constantly rising. While manufacturers struggle to perfect their screens it is also important to ensure high quality of displayed image. Overall quality can be measured using Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Video quality can be affected by miscellaneous artifacts, appearing at every stage of video creation and transmission. In this paper, we present a solution to calculate four distinct video quality metrics that can be applied to a real time video quality assessment system. Our assessment module is capable of processing 8K resolution in real time set at the level of 30 frames per second. Throughput of 2.19 GB/s surpasses performance of pure software solutions. To concentrate on architectural optimization, the module was created using high level language.
