Economic Design of Memory-Type Control Charts: The Fallacy of the Formula Proposed by Lorenzen and Vance (1986)

The memory-type control charts, such as EWMA and CUSUM, are powerful tools for detecting small quality changes in univariate and multivariate processes. Many papers on economic design of these control charts use the formula proposed by Lorenzen and Vance (1986) [Lorenzen, T. J., & Vance, L. C. (1986). The economic design of control charts: A unified approach. Technometrics, 28(1), 3-10, DOI: 10.2307/1269598]. This paper shows that this formula is not correct for memory-type control charts and its values can significantly deviate from the original values even if the ARL values used in this formula are accurately computed. Consequently, the use of this formula can result in charts that are not economically optimal. The formula is corrected for memory-type control charts, but unfortunately the modified formula is not a helpful tool from a computational perspective. We show that simulation-based optimization is a possible alternative method.
