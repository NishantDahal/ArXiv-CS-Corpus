Co-Clustering for Multitask Learning

This paper presents a new multitask learning framework that learns a shared representation among the tasks, incorporating both task and feature clusters. The jointly-induced clusters yield a shared latent subspace where task relationships are learned more effectively and more generally than in state-of-the-art multitask learning methods. The proposed general framework enables the derivation of more specific or restricted state-of-the-art multitask methods. The paper also proposes a highly-scalable multitask learning algorithm, based on the new framework, using conjugate gradient descent and generalized \textit{Sylvester equations}. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that the proposed method systematically outperforms several state-of-the-art multitask learning methods.
