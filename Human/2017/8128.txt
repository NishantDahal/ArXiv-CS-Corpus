Multiband NFC for High-Throughput Wireless Computer Vision Sensor Network

Vision sensors lie in the heart of computer vision. In many computer vision applications, such as AR/VR, non-contacting near-field communication (NFC) with high throughput is required to transfer information to algorithms. In this work, we proposed a novel NFC system which utilizes multiple frequency bands to achieve high throughput.
