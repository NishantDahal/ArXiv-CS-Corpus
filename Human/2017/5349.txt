HRTF-based two-dimensional robust least-squares frequency-invariant beamformer design for robot audition

In this work, we propose a two-dimensional Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF)-based robust beamformer design for robot audition, which allows for explicit control of the beamformer response for the entire three-dimensional sound field surrounding a humanoid robot. We evaluate the proposed method by means of both signal-independent and signal-dependent measures in a robot audition scenario. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed two-dimensional HRTF-based beamformer design, compared to our previously published one-dimensional HRTF-based beamformer design, which was carried out for a fixed elevation angle only.
