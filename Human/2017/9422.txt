On Time-Reversal Imaging by Statistical Testing

This letter is focused on the design and analysis of computational wideband time-reversal imaging algorithms, designed to be adaptive with respect to the noise levels pertaining to the frequencies being employed for scene probing. These algorithms are based on the concept of cell-by-cell processing and are obtained as theoretically-founded decision statistics for testing the hypothesis of single-scatterer presence (absence) at a specific location. These statistics are also validated in comparison with the maximal invariant statistic for the proposed problem.
