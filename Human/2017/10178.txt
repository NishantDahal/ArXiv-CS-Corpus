Mobile Edge Computing via a UAV-Mounted Cloudlet: Optimization of Bit Allocation and Path Planning

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been recently considered as means to provide enhanced coverage or relaying services to mobile users (MUs) in wireless systems with limited or no infrastructure. In this paper, a UAV-based mobile cloud computing system is studied in which a moving UAV is endowed with computing capabilities to offer computation offloading opportunities to MUs with limited local processing capabilities. The system aims at minimizing the total mobile energy consumption while satisfying quality of service requirements of the offloaded mobile application. Offloading is enabled by uplink and downlink communications between the mobile devices and the UAV that take place by means of frequency division duplex (FDD) via orthogonal or non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. The problem of jointly optimizing the bit allocation for uplink and downlink communication as well as for computing at the UAV, along with the cloudlet's trajectory under latency and UAV's energy budget constraints is formulated and addressed by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Numerical results demonstrate the significant energy savings that can be accrued by means of the proposed joint optimization of bit allocation and cloudlet's trajectory as compared to local mobile execution as well as to partial optimization approaches that design only the bit allocation or the cloudlet's trajectory.
