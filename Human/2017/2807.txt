Semiempirical Modeling of Reset Transitions in Unipolar Resistive-Switching Based Memristors

We have measured the transition process from the high to low resistivity states, i.e., the reset process of resistive switching based memristors based on Ni/HfO2/Si-n+ structures, and have also developed an analytical model for their electrical characteristics. When the characteristic curves are plotted in the current-voltage (I-V) domain a high variability is observed. In spite of that, when the same curves are plotted in the charge-flux domain (Q-f), they can be described by a simple model containing only three parameters: the charge (Qrst) and the flux (frst) at the reset point, and an exponent, n, relating the charge and the flux before the reset transition. The three parameters can be easily extracted from the Q-f plots. There is a strong correlation between these three parameters, the origin of which is still under study.
