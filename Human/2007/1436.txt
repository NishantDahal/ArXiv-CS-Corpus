On a constructive characterization of a class of trees related to pairs of disjoint matchings

For a graph consider the pairs of disjoint matchings which union contains as many edges as possible, and define a parameter $α$ which eqauls the cardinality of the largest matching in those pairs. Also, define $\betta$ to be the cardinality of a maximum matching of the graph.
  We give a constructive characterization of trees which satisfy the $α$=$\betta$ equality. The proof of our main theorem is based on a new decomposition algorithm obtained for trees.
