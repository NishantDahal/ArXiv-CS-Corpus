Minimal Polynomials for the Coordinates of the Harborth Graph

The Harborth graph is the smallest known example of a 4-regular planar unit-distance graph. In this paper we give an analytical description of the coordinates of its vertices for a particular embedding in the Euclidean plane. More precisely, we show, how to calculate the minimal polynomials of the coordinates of its vertices (with the help of a computer algebra system), and list those. Furthermore some algebraic properties of these polynomials, and consequences to the structure of the Harborth graph are determined.
