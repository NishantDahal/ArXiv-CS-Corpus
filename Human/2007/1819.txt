RTK-Spec TRON: A Simulation Model of an ITRON Based RTOS Kernel in SystemC

This paper presents the methodology and the modeling constructs we have developed to capture the real time aspects of RTOS simulation models in a System Level Design Language (SLDL) like SystemC. We describe these constructs and show how they are used to build a simulation model of an RTOS kernel targeting the $μ$-ITRON OS specification standard.
