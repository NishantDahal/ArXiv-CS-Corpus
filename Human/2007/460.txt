The problem determination of Functional Dependencies between attributes Relation Scheme in the Relational Data Model. El problema de determinar Dependencias Funcionales entre atributos en los esquemas en el Modelo Relacional

An alternative definition of the concept is given of functional dependence among the attributes of the relational schema in the Relational Model, this definition is obtained in terms of the set theory. For that which a theorem is demonstrated that establishes equivalence and on the basis theorem an algorithm is built for the search of the functional dependences among the attributes. The algorithm is illustrated by a concrete example
