Chain of Separable Binary Goppa Codes and their Minimal Distance

It is shown that subclasses of separable binary Goppa codes, $Γ(L,G)$ - codes, with $L=\{α\in GF(2^{2l}):G(α)\neq 0 \}$ and special Goppa polynomials G(x) can be presented as a chain of embedded codes. The true minimal distance has been obtained for all codes of the chain.
