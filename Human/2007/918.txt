A Virtual Logo Keyboard for People with Motor Disabilities

In our society, people with motor impairments are oftentimes socially excluded from their environment. This is unfortunate because every human being should have the possibility to obtain the necessary conditions to live a normal life. Although there is technology to assist people with motor impairments, few systems are targeted for programming environments. We have created a system, called Logo Keyboard, to assist people with motor disabilities to program with the Logo programming language. With this special keyboard we can help more people to get involved into computer programming and to develop projects in different areas.
