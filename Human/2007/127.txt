New Constructions of a Family of 2-Generator Quasi-Cyclic Two-Weight Codes and Related Codes

Based on cyclic simplex codes, a new construction of a family of 2-generator quasi-cyclic two-weight codes is given. New optimal binary quasi-cyclic [195, 8, 96], [210, 8, 104] and [240, 8, 120] codes, good QC ternary [195, 6, 126], [208, 6, 135], [221, 6, 144] codes are thus obtained. Furthermre, binary quasi-cyclic self-complementary codes are also constructed.
