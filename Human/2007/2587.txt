Asynchronous Implementation of Failure Detectors with partial connectivity and unknown participants

We consider the problem of failure detection in dynamic networks such as MANETs. Unreliable failure detectors are classical mechanisms which provide information about process failures. However, most of current implementations consider that the network is fully connected and that the initial number of nodes of the system is known. This assumption is not applicable to dynamic environments. Furthermore, such implementations are usually timer-based while in dynamic networks there is no upper bound for communication delays since nodes can move. This paper presents an asynchronous implementation of a failure detector for unknown and mobile networks. Our approach does not rely on timers and neither the composition nor the number of nodes in the system are known. We prove that our algorithm can implement failure detectors of class <>S when behavioral properties and connectivity conditions are satisfied by the underlying system.
