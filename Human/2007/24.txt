On the Software and Knowledge Engineering Aspects of the Educational Process

The Hellenic Open University has embarked on a large-scale effort to enhance its textbook-based material with content that demonstrably supports the basic tenets of distance learning. The challenge is to set up a framework that allows for the production-level creation, distribution and consumption of content, and at the same time, evaluate the effort in terms of technological, educational and organizational knowledge gained. This paper presents a model of the educational process that is used as a development backbone and argues about its conceptual and technical practicality at large.
