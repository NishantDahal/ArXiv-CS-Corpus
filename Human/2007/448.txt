Graph representation of context-free grammars

In modern mathematics, graphs figure as one of the better-investigated class of mathematical objects. Various properties of graphs, as well as graph-processing algorithms, can be useful if graphs of a certain kind are used as denotations for CF-grammars. Furthermore, graph are well adapted to various extensions (one kind of such extensions being attributes).
