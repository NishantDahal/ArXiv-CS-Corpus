AMIEDoT: An annotation model for document tracking and recommendation service

The primary objective of document annotation in whatever form, manual or electronic is to allow those who may not have control to original document to provide personal view on information source. Beyond providing personal assessment to original information sources, we are looking at a situation where annotation made can be used as additional source of information for document tracking and recommendation service. Most of the annotation tools existing today were conceived for their independent use with no reference to the creator of the annotation. We propose AMIEDoT (Annotation Model for Information Exchange and Document Tracking) an annotation model that can assist in document tracking and recommendation service. The model is based on three parameters in the acts of annotation. We believe that introducing document parameters, time and the parameters of the creator of annotation into an annotation process can be a dependable source to know, who used a document, when a document was used and for what a document was used for. Beyond document tracking, our model can be used in not only for selective dissemination of information but for recommendation services. AMIEDoT can also be used for information sharing and information reuse.
