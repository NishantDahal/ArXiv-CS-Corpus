A Typed Hybrid Description Logic Programming Language with Polymorphic Order-Sorted DL-Typed Unification for Semantic Web Type Systems

In this paper we elaborate on a specific application in the context of hybrid description logic programs (hybrid DLPs), namely description logic Semantic Web type systems (DL-types) which are used for term typing of LP rules based on a polymorphic, order-sorted, hybrid DL-typed unification as procedural semantics of hybrid DLPs. Using Semantic Web ontologies as type systems facilitates interchange of domain-independent rules over domain boundaries via dynamically typing and mapping of explicitly defined type ontologies.
