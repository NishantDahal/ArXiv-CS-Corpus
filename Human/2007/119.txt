New ID Based Multi-Proxy Multi-Signcryption Scheme from Pairings

This paper presents an identity based multi-proxy multi-signcryption scheme from pairings. In this scheme a proxy signcrypter group could authorized as a proxy agent by the coopration of all members in the original signcryption group. Then the proxy signcryption can be generated by the cooperation of all the signcrypters in the authorized proxy signcrypter group on the behalf of the original signcrypter group. As compared to the scheme of Liu and Xiao, the proposed scheme provides public verifiability of the signature along with simplified key management.
