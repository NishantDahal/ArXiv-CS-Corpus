Security Implications of Converged Networks and Protecting Them, without Compromising Efficiency

This dissertation has extensively looked into all aspects of VoIP commu-nications technology, and information presented in preceding chapters, which build up a solid framework to discuss the conceptual design model, and investigate features that could be incorporated for actual Pro-jects, with parameters that are tested on field values. The dissertation follows a five-course model, for answering different questions, both tech-nical and businesslike, around central issues, that have been crucial to explanation of the topic; starting with a general overview of VoIP tech-nology, analyzing current VoIP encryption methods, identifying security threats, designing a robust VoIP system based on particulars discussed in preceding chapters, and finally, a VoIP simulation.
