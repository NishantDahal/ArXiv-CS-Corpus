User-level DSM System for Modern High-Performance Interconnection Networks

In this paper, we introduce a new user-level DSM system which has the ability to directly interact with underlying interconnection networks. The DSM system provides the application programmer a flexible API to program parallel applications either using shared memory semantics over physically distributed memory or to use an efficient remote memory demand paging technique. We also introduce a new time slice based memory consistency protocol which is used by the DSM system. We present preliminary results from our implementation on a small Opteron Linux cluster interconnected over Myrinet.
