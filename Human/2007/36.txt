A Measure of Transaction Processing 20 Years Later

This provides a retrospective of the paper "A Measure of Transaction Processing" published in 1985. It shows that transaction processing peak performance and price-peformance have improved about 100,000x respectively and that sort/sequential performance has approximately doubled each year (so a million fold improvement) even though processor performance plateaued in 1995.
