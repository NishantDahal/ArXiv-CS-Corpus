Quantum Convolutional Codes Derived From Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller Codes

Convolutional stabilizer codes promise to make quantum communication more reliable with attractive online encoding and decoding algorithms. This paper introduces a new approach to convolutional stabilizer codes based on direct limit constructions. Two families of quantum convolutional codes are derived from generalized Reed-Solomon codes and from Reed- Muller codes. A Singleton bound for pure convolutional stabilizer codes is given.
