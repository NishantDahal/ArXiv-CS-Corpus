Guessing based on length functions

A guessing wiretapper's performance on a Shannon cipher system is analyzed for a source with memory. Close relationships between guessing functions and length functions are first established. Subsequently, asymptotically optimal encryption and attack strategies are identified and their performances analyzed for sources with memory. The performance metrics are exponents of guessing moments and probability of large deviations. The metrics are then characterized for unifilar sources. Universal asymptotically optimal encryption and attack strategies are also identified for unifilar sources. Guessing in the increasing order of Lempel-Ziv coding lengths is proposed for finite-state sources, and shown to be asymptotically optimal. Finally, competitive optimality properties of guessing in the increasing order of description lengths and Lempel-Ziv coding lengths are demonstrated.
