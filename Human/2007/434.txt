Comparing Architectures of Mobile Applications

This article describes various advantages and disadvantages of SMS, WAP, J2ME and Windows CE technologies in designing mobile applications. In defining the architecture of any software application it is important to get the best trade-off between platform's possibilities and design requirements. Achieving optimum software design is even more important with mobile applications where all computer resources are limited. Therefore, it is important to have a comparative analysis of all relevant contemporary approaches in designing mobile applications. As always, the choice between these technologies is determined by application requirements and system capabilities.
