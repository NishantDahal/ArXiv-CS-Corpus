An Example of Pi^0_3-complete Infinitary Rational Relation

We give in this paper an example of infinitary rational relation, accepted by a 2-tape BÃ¼chi automaton, which is Pi^0_3-complete in the Borel hierarchy. Moreover the example of infinitary rational relation given in this paper has a very simple structure and can be easily described by its sections.
