Sufficient set of integrability conditions of an orthonomic system

Every orthonomic system of partial differential equations is known to possess a finite number of integrability conditions sufficient to ensure the validity of all. Herewith we offer an efficient algorithm to construct a sufficient set of integrability conditions free of redundancies.
