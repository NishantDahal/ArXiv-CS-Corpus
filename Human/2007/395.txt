Comparing BB84 and Authentication-Aided Kak's Three-Stage Quantum Protocol

This paper compares the popular quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol BB84 with the more recent Kak's three-stage protocol and the latter is shown to be more secure. A theoretical representation of an authentication-aided version of Kak's three-stage protocol is provided that makes it possible to deal with the man-in-the-middle attack.
