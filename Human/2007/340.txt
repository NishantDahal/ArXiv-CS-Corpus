Graphs, Quadratic Forms, and Quantum Codes

We show that any stabilizer code over a finite field is equivalent to a graphical quantum code. Furthermore we prove that a graphical quantum code over a finite field is a stabilizer code. The technique used in the proof establishes a new connection between quantum codes and quadratic forms. We provide some simple examples to illustrate our results.
