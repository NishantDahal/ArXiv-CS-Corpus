Logic Programming with Satisfiability

This paper presents a Prolog interface to the MiniSat satisfiability solver. Logic program- ming with satisfiability combines the strengths of the two paradigms: logic programming for encoding search problems into satisfiability on the one hand and efficient SAT solving on the other. This synergy between these two exposes a programming paradigm which we propose here as a logic programming pearl. To illustrate logic programming with SAT solving we give an example Prolog program which solves instances of Partial MAXSAT.
