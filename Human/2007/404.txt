A Systematic Approach to Web-Application Development

Designing a web-application from a specification involves a series of well-planned and well executed steps leading to the final product. This often involves critical changes in design while testing the application, which itself is slow and cumbersome. Traditional approaches either fully automate the web-application development process, or let developers write everything from scratch. Our approach is based on a middle-ground, with precise control on the workflow and usage of a set of custom-made software tools to automate a significant part of code generation.
