About the domino problem in the hyperbolic plane, a new solution: complement

In this paper, we complete the construction of paper arXiv:cs.CG/0701096v2. Together with the proof contained in arXiv:cs.CG/0701096v2, this paper definitely proves that the general problem of tiling the hyperbolic plane with {\it Ã  la} Wang tiles is undecidable.
