A study of fuzzy and many-valued logics in cellular automata

In this paper we provide an analytical study of the theory of multi-valued and fuzzy cellular automata where the fuzziness appears as the result of the application of an underlying multi-valued or continuous logic as opposed to standard logic as used conventionally. Using the disjunctive normal form of any one of the 255 ECA's so defined, we modify the underlying logic structure and redefine the ECA within the framework of this new logic. The idea here is to show that the evolution of space-time diagrams of ECA's under even a probabilistic logic can exhibit non-chaotic behavior. This is looked at specifically for Probabilistic Rule 110, in contrast with Boolean Rule 110 which is known to be capable of universal computation.
