Finding long cycles in graphs

We analyze the problem of discovering long cycles inside a graph. We propose and test two algorithms for this task. The first one is based on recent advances in statistical mechanics and relies on a message passing procedure. The second follows a more standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain strategy. Special attention is devoted to Hamiltonian cycles of (non-regular) random graphs of minimal connectivity equal to three.
