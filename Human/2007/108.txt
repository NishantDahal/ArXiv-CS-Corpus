Duadic Group Algebra Codes

Duadic group algebra codes are a generalization of quadratic residue codes. This paper settles an open problem raised by Zhu concerning the existence of duadic group algebra codes. These codes can be used to construct degenerate quantum stabilizer codes that have the nice feature that many errors of small weight do not need error correction; this fact is illustrated by an example.
