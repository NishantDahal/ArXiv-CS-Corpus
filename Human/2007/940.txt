A simple generalization of El-Gamal cryptosystem to non-abelian groups

In this paper we study the MOR cryptosystem. We use the group of unitriangular matrices over a finite field as the non-abelian group in the MOR cryptosystem. We show that a cryptosystem similar to the El-Gamal cryptosystem over finite fields can be built using the proposed groups and a set of automorphisms of these groups. We also show that the security of this proposed MOR cryptosystem is equivalent to the El-Gamal cryptosystem over finite fields.
