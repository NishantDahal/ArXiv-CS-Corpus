Menzerath-Altmann Law for Syntactic Structures in Ukrainian

In the paper, the definition of clause suitable for an automated processing of a Ukrainian text is proposed. The Menzerath-Altmann law is verified on the sentence level and the parameters for the dependences of the clause length counted in words and syllables on the sentence length counted in clauses are calculated for "Perekhresni Stezhky" ("The Cross-Paths"), a novel by Ivan Franko.
