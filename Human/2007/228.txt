A Sum-Product Model as a Physical Basis for Shadow Fading

Shadow fading (slow fading) effects play a central role in mobile communication system design and analysis. Experimental evidence indicates that shadow fading exhibits log-normal power distribution almost universally, and yet it is still not well understood what causes this. In this paper, we propose a versatile sum-product signal model as a physical basis for shadow fading. Simulation results imply that the proposed model results in log-normally distributed local mean power regardless of the distributions of the interactions in the radio channel, and hence it is capable of explaining the log-normality in a wide variety of propagation scenarios. The sum-product model also includes as its special cases the conventional product model as well as the recently proposed sum model, and improves upon these by: a) being applicable in both global and local distance scales; b) being more plausible from physical point of view; c) providing better goodness-of-fit to log-normal distribution than either of these models.
