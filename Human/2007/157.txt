Analysis of CDMA systems that are characterized by eigenvalue spectrum

An approach by which to analyze the performance of the code division multiple access (CDMA) scheme, which is a core technology used in modern wireless communication systems, is provided. The approach characterizes the objective system by the eigenvalue spectrum of a cross-correlation matrix composed of signature sequences used in CDMA communication, which enables us to handle a wider class of CDMA systems beyond the basic model reported by Tanaka. The utility of the novel scheme is shown by analyzing a system in which the generation of signature sequences is designed for enhancing the orthogonality.
