Articulation entre composantes verbale et graphico-gestuelle de l'interaction dans des r√©unions de conception architecturale

This study is focused on the role of external representations, e.g., skteches, in collaborative architectural design. In particular, we analyse (1) the use of graphico-gestural modalities and, (2) the articulation modes between graphico-gestural and verbal modalities in design interaction. We have elaborated a first classification which distinguishes between two modes of articulation, articulation in integrated activities versus articulation in parallel activities.
