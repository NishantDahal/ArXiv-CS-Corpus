Efficient Quantum Algorithms for the Hidden Subgroup Problem over a Class of Semi-direct Product Groups

In this paper, we consider the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over the class of semi-direct product groups $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_q$, for p and q prime. We first present a classification of these groups in five classes. Then, we describe a polynomial-time quantum algorithm solving the HSP over all the groups of one of these classes: the groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_p$, where p is an odd prime. Our algorithm works even in the most general case where the group is presented as a black-box group with not necessarily unique encoding. Finally, we extend this result and present an efficient algorithm solving the HSP over the groups $\mathbb{Z}^m_{p^r}\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_p$.
