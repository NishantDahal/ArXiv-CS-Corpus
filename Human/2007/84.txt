About the domino problem in the hyperbolic plane, a new solution

In this paper we improve the approach of a previous paper about the domino problem in the hyperbolic plane, see arXiv.cs.CG/0603093. This time, we prove that the general problem of the hyperbolic plane with Ã  la Wang tiles is undecidable.
