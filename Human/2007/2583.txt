Error Correction and Digitalization Concepts in Biochemical Computing

We offer a theoretical design of new systems that show promise for digital biochemical computing, including realizations of error correction by utilizing redundancy, as well as signal rectification. The approach includes information processing using encoded DNA sequences, DNAzyme biocatalyzed reactions and the use of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. Digital XOR and NAND logic gates and copying (fanout) are designed using the same components.
