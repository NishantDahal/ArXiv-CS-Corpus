Quantum Lambda Calculi with Classical Control: Syntax and Expressive Power

We study an untyped lambda calculus with quantum data and classical control. This work stems from previous proposals by Selinger and Valiron and by Van Tonder. We focus on syntax and expressiveness, rather than (denotational) semantics. We prove subject reduction, confluence and a standardization theorem. Moreover, we prove the computational equivalence of the proposed calculus with a suitable class of quantum circuit families.
