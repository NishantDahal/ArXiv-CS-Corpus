On the dimensions of certain LDPC codes based on q-regular bipartite graphs

An explicit construction of a family of binary LDPC codes called LU(3,q), where q is a power of a prime, was recently given. A conjecture was made for the dimensions of these codes when q is odd. The conjecture is proved in this note. The proof involves the geometry of a 4-dimensional symplectic vector space and the action of the symplectic group and its subgroups.
