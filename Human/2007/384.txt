Wireless Lan to Support Multimedia Communication Using Spread Spectrum Technology

Wireless LAN is currently enjoying rapid deployment in University departments, business offices, hospitals and homes. It becomes an inexpensive technology and allows multiple numbers of the households to simultaneously access the internet while roaming about the house. In the present work, the design and development of a wireless LAN is highlighted which utilizes direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology at 900MHz RF carrier frequency in its physical layer. This provides enormous security in the physical layer and hence it is very difficult to hack or jam the network. The installation cost is also less due to the use of 900 MHz RF carrier frequency..
