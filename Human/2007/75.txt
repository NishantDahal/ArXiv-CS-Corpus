JavaTA: A Logic-based Debugger for Java

This paper presents a logic based approach to debugging Java programs. In contrast with traditional debugging we propose a debugging methodology for Java programs using logical queries on individual execution states and also over the history of execution. These queries were arrived at by a systematic study of errors in object-oriented programs in our earlier research. We represent the salient events during the execution of a Java program by a logic database, and implement the queries as logic programs. Such an approach allows us to answer a number of useful and interesting queries about a Java program, such as the calling sequence that results in a certain outcome, the state of an object at a particular execution point, etc. Our system also provides the ability to compose new queries during a debugging session. We believe that logic programming offers a significant contribution to the art of object-oriented programs debugging.
