Space Program Language (SPL/SQL) for the Relational Approach of the Spatial Databases

In this project we are presenting a grammar which unify the design and development of spatial databases. In order to make it, we combine nominal and spatial information, the former is represented by the relational model and latter by a modification of the same model. The modification lets to represent spatial data structures (as Quadtrees, Octrees, etc.) in a integrated way. This grammar is important because with it we can create tools to build systems that combine spatial-nominal characteristics such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Hypermedia Systems, Computed Aided Design Systems (CAD), and so on
