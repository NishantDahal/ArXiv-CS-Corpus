Generalized Statistics Framework for Rate Distortion Theory with Bregman Divergences

A variational principle for the rate distortion (RD) theory with Bregman divergences is formulated within the ambit of the generalized (nonextensive) statistics of Tsallis. The Tsallis-Bregman RD lower bound is established. Alternate minimization schemes for the generalized Bregman RD (GBRD) theory are derived. A computational strategy to implement the GBRD model is presented. The efficacy of the GBRD model is exemplified with the aid of numerical simulations.
