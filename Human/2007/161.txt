Imagination as Holographic Processor for Text Animation

Imagination is the critical point in developing of realistic artificial intelligence (AI) systems. One way to approach imagination would be simulation of its properties and operations. We developed two models: AI-Brain Network Hierarchy of Languages and Semantical Holographic Calculus as well as simulation system ScriptWriter that emulate the process of imagination through an automatic animation of English texts. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the model and to present ScriptWriter system http://nvo.sdsc.edu/NVO/JCSG/get_SRB_mime_file2.cgi//home/tamara.sdsc/test/demo.zip?F=/home/tamara.sdsc/test/demo.zip&M=application/x-gtar for simulation of the imagination.
