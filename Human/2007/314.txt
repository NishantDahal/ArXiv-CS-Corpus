Articulation entre Ã©laboration de solutions et argumentation polyphonique

In this paper, we propose an analytical framework that aims to bring out the nature of participants' contributions to co-design meetings, in a way that synthesises content and function dimensions, together with the dimension of dialogicality. We term the resulting global vision of contribution, the "interactive profile".
