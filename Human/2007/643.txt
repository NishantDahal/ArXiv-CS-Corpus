Reconstructing the Nonlinear Filter Function of LILI-128 Stream Cipher Based on Complexity

In this letter we assert that we have reconstructed the nonlinear filter function of LILI-128 stream cipher on IBM notebook PC using MATLAB. Our reconstruction need approximately 2^12~2^13 and the attack consumes 5825.016 sec (using tic and toc sentences of MATLAB) or 5825.016/3600=1.6181hours. We got the expression of the nonlinear filter function fd of Lili-128 which has 46 items from liner items to nonlinear items based on complexity, the phase space reconstruction, Clustering and nonlinear prediction. We have verified our reconstruction result correctness by simulating the overview of Lili-128 keystream generators using our getting fd and implement designers reference module of the Lili-128 stream cipher, and two methods produce the same synchronous keystream sequence on same initial state, so that our research work proves that the nonlinear filter function of LILI-128 stream cipher is successfully reconstructed.
