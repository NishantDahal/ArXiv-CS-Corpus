On the Accepting Power of 2-Tape Büchi Automata

We show that, from a topological point of view, 2-tape Büchi automata have the same accepting power than Turing machines equipped with a Büchi acceptance condition. In particular, we show that for every non null recursive ordinal alpha, there exist some Sigma^0_alpha-complete and some Pi^0_alpha-complete infinitary rational relations accepted by 2-tape Büchi automata. This very surprising result gives answers to questions of W. Thomas [Automata and Quantifier Hierarchies, in: Formal Properties of Finite automata and Applications, Ramatuelle, 1988, LNCS 386, Springer, 1989, p.104-119], of P. Simonnet [Automates et Théorie Descriptive, Ph. D. Thesis, Université Paris 7, March 1992], and of H. Lescow and W. Thomas [Logical Specifications of Infinite Computations, In: "A Decade of Concurrency", LNCS 803, Springer, 1994, p. 583-621].
