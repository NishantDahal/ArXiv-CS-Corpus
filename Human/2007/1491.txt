A Portal Analysis for the Design of a Collaborative Research Environment for Students and Supervisors (CRESS) within the CSCR Domain

Following the CSCR structure a preliminary design for CRESS has been established and a portal framework analysis is undertaken in order to determine the most appropriate set of tools for its implementation.
