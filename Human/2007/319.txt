The Implications of Network-Centric Software Systems on Software Architecture: A Critical Evaluation

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of emerging network-centric software systems on the field of software architecture. We first develop an insight concerning the term "network-centric" by presenting its origin and its implications within the context of software architecture. On the basis of this insight, we present our definition of a network-centric framework and its distinguishing characteristics. We then enumerate the challenges that face the field of software architecture as software development shifts from a platform-centric to a network-centric model. In order to face these challenges, we propose a formal approach embodied in a new architectural style that supports overcoming these challenges at the architectural level. Finally, we conclude by presenting an illustrative example to demonstrate the usefulness of the concepts of network centricity, summarizing our contributions, and linking our approach to future work that needs to be done in this area.
