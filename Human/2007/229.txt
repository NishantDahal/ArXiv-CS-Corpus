Avoiding bias in cards cryptography

We outline the need for stricter requirements for unconditionally secure cryptographic protocols inspired by the Russian Cards problem. A new requirement CA4 is proposed that checks for bias in single card occurrence in announcements consisting of alternatives for players' holdings of cards. This requirement CA4 is shown to be equivalent to an alternative requirement CA5. All announcements found to satisfy CA4 are 2-designs. We also show that all binary designs are 3-designs. Instead of avoiding bias in announcements produced by such protocols, one may as well apply unbiased protocols such that patterns in announcements become meaningless. We gave two examples of such protocols for card deal parameters (3,3,1), i.e. two of the players hold three cards, and the remaining player, playing the role of eavesdropper, holds a single card.
