Redesigning Decision Matrix Method with an indeterminacy-based inference process

For academics and practitioners concerned with computers, business and mathematics, one central issue is supporting decision makers. In this paper, we propose a generalization of Decision Matrix Method (DMM), using Neutrosophic logic. It emerges as an alternative to the existing logics and it represents a mathematical model of uncertainty and indeterminacy. This paper proposes the Neutrosophic Decision Matrix Method as a more realistic tool for decision making. In addition, a de-neutrosophication process is included.
