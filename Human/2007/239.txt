Protection of DVB Systems by Trusted Computing

We describe a concept to employ Trusted Computing technology to secure Conditional Access Systems (CAS) for DVB. Central is the embedding of a trusted platform module (TPM) into the set-top-box or residential home gateway. Various deployment scenarios exhibit possibilities of charging co-operation with mobile network operators (MNO), or other payment providers.
