The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol and non-abelian nilpotent groups

In this paper we study a key exchange protocol similar to Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol using abelian subgroups of the automorphism group of a non-abelian nilpotent group. We also generalize group no.92 of Hall-Senior table \cite{halltable}, for arbitrary prime $p$ and show that for those groups, the group of central automorphisms commute. We use these for the key exchange we are studying.
