Interval Neutrosophic Logics: Theory and Applications

In this paper, we present the interval neutrosophic logics which generalizes the fuzzy logic, paraconsistent logic, intuitionistic fuzzy logic and many other non-classical and non-standard logics. We will give the formal definition of interval neutrosophic propositional calculus and interval neutrosophic predicate calculus. Then we give one application of interval neutrosophic logics to do approximate reasoning.
