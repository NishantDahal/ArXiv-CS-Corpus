A Situation Calculus-based Approach To Model Ubiquitous Information Services

This paper presents an augmented situation calculus-based approach to model autonomous computing paradigm in ubiquitous information services. To make it practical for commercial development and easier to support autonomous paradigm imposed by ubiquitous information services, we made improvements based on Reiter's standard situation calculus. First we explore the inherent relationship between fluents and evolution: since not all fluents contribute to systems' evolution and some fluents can be derived from some others, we define those fluents that are sufficient and necessary to determine evolutional potential as decisive fluents, and then we prove that their successor states wrt to deterministic complex actions satisfy Markov property. Then, within the calculus framework we build, we introduce validity theory to model the autonomous services with application-specific validity requirements, including: validity fluents to axiomatize validity requirements, heuristic multiple alternative service choices ranging from complete acceptance, partial acceptance, to complete rejection, and validity-ensured policy to comprise such alternative service choices into organic, autonomously-computable services. Our approach is demonstrated by a ubiquitous calendaring service, ACS, throughout the paper.
