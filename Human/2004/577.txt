Securing Data in Storage: A Review of Current Research

Protecting data from malicious computer users continues to grow in importance. Whether preventing unauthorized access to personal photographs, ensuring compliance with federal regulations, or ensuring the integrity of corporate secrets, all applications require increased security to protect data from talented intruders. Specifically, as more and more files are preserved on disk the requirement to provide secure storage has increased in importance. This paper presents a survey of techniques for securely storing data, including theoretical approaches, prototype systems, and existing systems currently available. Due to the wide variety of potential solutions available and the variety of techniques to arrive at a particular solution, it is important to review the entire field prior to selecting an implementation that satisfies particular requirements. This paper provides an overview of the prominent characteristics of several systems to provide a foundation for making an informed decision. Initially, the paper establishes a set of criteria for evaluating a storage solution based on confidentiality, integrity, availability, and performance. Then, using these criteria, the paper explains the relevant characteristics of select storage systems and provides a comparison of the major differences.
