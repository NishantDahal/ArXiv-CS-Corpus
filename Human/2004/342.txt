On Quantum Cellular Automata

In recent work [quant-ph/0405174] by Schumacher and Werner was discussed an abstract algebraic approach to a model of reversible quantum cellular automata (CA) on a lattice. It was used special model of CA based on partitioning scheme and so there is a question about quantum CA derived from more general, standard model of classical CA. In present work is considered an approach to definition of a scheme with "history", valid for quantization both irreversible and reversible classical CA directly using local transition rules. It is used language of vectors in Hilbert spaces instead of C*-algebras, but results may be compared in some cases. Finally, the quantum lattice gases, quantum walk and "bots" are also discussed briefly.
