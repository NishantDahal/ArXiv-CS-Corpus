The Gridbus Toolkit for Service Oriented Grid and Utility Computing: An Overview and Status Report

Grids aim at exploiting synergies that result from cooperation of autonomous distributed entities. The synergies that result from grid cooperation include the sharing, exchange, selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed resources such as computers, data bases, software, and scientific instruments for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. For this cooperation to be sustainable, participants need to have economic incentive. Therefore, "incentive" mechanisms should be considered as one of key design parameters of Grid architectures. In this article, we present an overview and status of an open source Grid toolkit, called Gridbus, whose architecture is fundamentally driven by the requirements of Grid economy. Gridbus technologies provide services for both computational and data grids that power the emerging eScience and eBusiness applications.
