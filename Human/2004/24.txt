Unifying Computing and Cognition: The SP Theory and its Applications

This book develops the conjecture that all kinds of information processing in computers and in brains may usefully be understood as "information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search". This "SP theory", which has been under development since 1987, provides a unified view of such things as the workings of a universal Turing machine, the nature of 'knowledge', the interpretation and production of natural language, pattern recognition and best-match information retrieval, several kinds of probabilistic reasoning, planning and problem solving, unsupervised learning, and a range of concepts in mathematics and logic. The theory also provides a basis for the design of an 'SP' computer with several potential advantages compared with traditional digital computers.
