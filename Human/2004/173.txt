Exploiting Cross-Document Relations for Multi-document Evolving Summarization

This paper presents a methodology for summarization from multiple documents which are about a specific topic. It is based on the specification and identification of the cross-document relations that occur among textual elements within those documents. Our methodology involves the specification of the topic-specific entities, the messages conveyed for the specific entities by certain textual elements and the specification of the relations that can hold among these messages. The above resources are necessary for setting up a specific topic for our query-based summarization approach which uses these resources to identify the query-specific messages within the documents and the query-specific relations that connect these messages across documents.
