Computational Unification: a Vision for Connecting Researchers

The extent to which the benefits of science can be fully realized depends critically upon the quality of the connection between researchers themselves and between researchers and members of the public. We believe that it is now possible to improve these connections on a community-wide and even world-wide basis through the use of an appropriate information management system. In this paper we explore the concepts and challenges, and propose an architecture for the implementation of such a system.
  "One of the greatest visions for science is a computational unification in which every researcher can interact with all other researchers through use of their own research system."
  "These features not only enable research collaboration on a scale never previously envisaged, they also enable sharing and dissemination of scientific knowledge to the public at large with a sophistication unparalleled in history."
