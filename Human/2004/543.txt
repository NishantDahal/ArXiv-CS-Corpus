Educational Content Management - A Cellular Approach

In recent times online educational applications more and more are requested to provide self-consistent learning offers for students at the university level. Consequently they need to cope with the wide range of complexity and interrelations university course teaching brings along. An urgent need to overcome simplistically linked HTMLc ontent pages becomes apparent. In the present paper we discuss a schematic concept of educational content construction from information cells and introduce its implementation on the storage and runtime layer. Starting from cells content is annotated according to didactic needs, structured for dynamic arrangement, dynamically decorated with hyperlinks and, as all works are based on XML, open to any presentation layer. Data can be variably accessed through URIs built on semantic path-names and edited via an adaptive authoring toolbox. Our content management approach is based on the more general Multimedia Information Repository MIR. and allows for personalisation, as well. MIR is an open system supporting the standards XML, Corba and JNDI.
