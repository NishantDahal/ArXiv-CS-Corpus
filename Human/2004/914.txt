An algorithm for two-dimensional mesh generation based on the pinwheel tiling

We propose a new two-dimensional meshing algorithm called PINW able to generate meshes that accurately approximate the distance between any two domain points by paths composed only of cell edges. This technique is based on an extension of pinwheel tilings proposed by Radin and Conway. We prove that the algorithm produces triangles of bounded aspect ratio. This kind of mesh would be useful in cohesive interface finite element modeling when the crack propagation pathis an outcome of a simulation process.
