Contractualisation des ressources pour le deploiement des composants logiciels

Software deployment can turn into a baffling problem when the components being deployed exhibit non-functional requirements. If the platform on which such components are deployed cannot satisfy their non-functional requirements, then they may in turn fail to perform satisfactorily. In this paper, we present a contract-based approach to take a specific category of non-functional properties specified by components into account, that is those that pertain to the resources that are necessary for their execution.
