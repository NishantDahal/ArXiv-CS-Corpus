Towards a Mathematical Theory of the Delays of the Asynchronous Circuits

The inequations of the delays of the asynchronous circuits are written, by making use of pseudo-Boolean differential calculus. We consider these efforts to be a possible starting point in the semi-formalized reconstruction of the digital electrical engineering (which is a non-formalized theory).
