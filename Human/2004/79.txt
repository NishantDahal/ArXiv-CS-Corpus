Automatically Generating Interfaces for Personalized Interaction with Digital Libraries

We present an approach to automatically generate interfaces supporting personalized interaction with digital libraries; these interfaces augment the user-DL dialog by empowering the user to (optionally) supply out-of-turn information during an interaction, flatten or restructure the dialog, and enquire about dialog options. Interfaces generated using this approach for CITIDEL are described.
