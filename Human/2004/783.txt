A Digital Signature with Threshold Generation and Verification

This paper proposes a signature scheme where the signatures are generated by the cooperation of a number of people from a given group of senders and the signatures are verified by a certain number of people from the group of recipients. Shamir's threshold scheme and Schnorr's signature scheme are used to realize the proposed scheme.
