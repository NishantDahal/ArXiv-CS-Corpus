Redundancy and Robustness of the AS-level Internet topology and its models

A comparison between the topological properties of the measured Internet topology, at the autonomous system level (AS graph), and the equivalent graphs generated by two different power law topology generators is presented. Only one of the synthetic generators reproduces the tier connectivity of the AS graph.
