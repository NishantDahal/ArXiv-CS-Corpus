Business Process Measures

The paper proposes a new methodology for defining business process measures and their computation. The approach is based on metamodeling according to MOF. Especially, a metamodel providing precise definitions of typical process measures for UML activity diagram-like notation is proposed, including precise definitions how measures should be aggregated for composite process elements. The proposed approach allows defining values in a natural way, and measurement of data, which are of interest to business, without deep investigation into specific technical solutions. This provides new possibilities for business process measurement, decreasing the gap between technical solutions and asset management methodologies.
