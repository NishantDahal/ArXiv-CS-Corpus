More on combinatorial interpretation of the fibonomial coefficients

Combinatorial interpretation of the fibonomial coefficients as a number of choices of specific finite subsets of an infinite partially ordered set of not binomial type is proposed. This partially ordered set is here defined via characteristic matrix of the corresponding partial order relation . Relevance of the proposal to more general unification treatment is indicated.
