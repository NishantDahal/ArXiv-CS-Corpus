How to achieve various gait patterns from single nominal

In this paper is presented an approach to achieving on-line modification of nominal biped gait without recomputing entire dynamics when steady motion is performed. Straight, dynamically balanced walk was used as a nominal gait, and applied modifications were speed-up and slow-down walk and turning left and right. It is shown that the disturbances caused by these modifications jeopardize dynamic stability, but they can be simply compensated to enable walk continuation.
