The model of the tables in design documentation for operating with the electronic catalogs and for specifications making in a CAD system

The hierarchic block model of the tables in design documentation as a part of a CAD system is described, intended for automatic specifications making of elements of the drawings, with usage of the electronic catalogs. The model is created for needs of a CAD system of reconstruction of the industrial plants, where the result of designing are the drawings, which include the specifications of different types. The adequate simulation of the specification tables is ensured with technology of storing in the drawing of the visible geometric elements and invisible parametric representation, sufficient for generation of this elements.
