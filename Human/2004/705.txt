Gestion Dynamique des Services Techniques pour Modele a Composants

The new applications being intended for more and more heterogeneous environments, it is necessary to propose solutions of development which answer in best the necessities of adaptation of new services. Component-based programming partially answers this aim, allowing easy replacement of software blocks in order to provide the most adapted version of a component. Nevertheless, most of the industrial component-based model implementations do not allow to provide to components the most adapted technical services (naming, trading, security, transaction, etc.). In this paper, we suggest defining technical services themselves under the shape of components. We shall detail our proposition, by basing it on the Fractal component model of Objectweb. Then, we shall bring solutions for the use of these new component-based technical services and shall propose a set of management components which allow to administer in a dynamic and stand-alone way the obtained components. Finally we present the prototype of the proposed solution.
