On rational definite summation

We present a partial proof of van Hoeij-Abramov conjecture about the algorithmic possibility of computation of finite sums of rational functions. The theoretical results proved in this paper provide an algorithm for computation of a large class of sums $ S(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}R(k,n)$.
