Signals for Cellular Automata in dimension 2 or higher

We investigate how increasing the dimension of the array can help to draw signals on cellular automata.We show the existence of a gap of constructible signals in any dimension. We exhibit two cellular automata in dimension 2 to show that increasing the dimension allows to reduce the number of states required for some constructions.
