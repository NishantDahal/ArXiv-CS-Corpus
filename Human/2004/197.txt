NLML--a Markup Language to Describe the Unlimited English Grammar

In this paper we present NLML (Natural Language Markup Language), a markup language to describe the syntactic and semantic structure of any grammatically correct English expression. At first the related works are analyzed to demonstrate the necessity of the NLML: simple form, easy management and direct storage. Then the description of the English grammar with NLML is introduced in details in three levels: sentences (with different complexities, voices, moods, and tenses), clause (relative clause and noun clause) and phrase (noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional phrase, adjective phrase, adverb phrase and predicate phrase). At last the application fields of the NLML in NLP are shown with two typical examples: NLOJM (Natural Language Object Modal in Java) and NLDB (Natural Language Database).
