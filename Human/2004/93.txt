An Integrated Approach for Extraction of Objects from XML and Transformation to Heterogeneous Object Oriented Databases

CERN's (European Organization for Nuclear Research) WISDOM project uses XML for the replication of data between different data repositories in a heterogeneous operating system environment. For exchanging data from Web-resident databases, the data needs to be transformed into XML and back to the database format. Many different approaches are employed to do this transformation. This paper addresses issues that make this job more efficient and robust than existing approaches. It incorporates the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XML Schema specification in the database-XML relationship. Incorporation of the XML Schema exhibits significant improvements in XML content usage and reduces the limitations of DTD-based database XML services. Secondly the paper explores the possibility of database independent transformation of data between XML and different databases. It proposes a standard XML format that every serialized object should follow. This makes it possible to use objects of heterogeneous database seamlessly using XML.
