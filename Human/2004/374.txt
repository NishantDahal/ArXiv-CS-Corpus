Subset Queries in Relational Databases

In this paper, we motivated the need for relational database systems to support subset query processing. We defined new operators in relational algebra, and new constructs in SQL for expressing subset queries. We also illustrated the applicability of subset queries through different examples expressed using extended SQL statements and relational algebra expressions. Our aim is to show the utility of subset queries for next generation applications.
