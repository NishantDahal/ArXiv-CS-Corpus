Generative Programming of Graphical User Interfaces

Generative Programming (GP) is a computing paradigm allowing automatic creation of entire software families utilizing the configuration of elementary and reusable components. GP can be projected on different technologies, e.g. C++-templates, Java-Beans, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), or Frame technology. This paper focuses on Frame Technology, which aids the possible implementation and completion of software components. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the GP paradigm in the area of GUI application generation. It demonstrates how automatically customized executable applications with GUI parts can be generated from an abstract specification.
