Free quasi-symmetric functions, product actions and quantum field theory of partitions

We examine two associative products over the ring of symmetric functions related to the intransitive and Cartesian products of permutation groups. As an application, we give an enumeration of some Feynman type diagrams arising in Bender's QFT of partitions. We end by exploring possibilities to construct noncommutative analogues.
