A High-Level Reconfigurable Computing Platform Software Frameworks

Reconfigurable computing refers to the use of processors, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), that can be modified at the hardware level to take on different processing tasks. A reconfigurable computing platform describes the hardware and software base on top of which modular extensions can be created, depending on the desired application. Such reconfigurable computing platforms can take on varied designs and implementations, according to the constraints imposed and features desired by the scope of applications. This paper introduces a PC-based reconfigurable computing platform software frameworks that is flexible and extensible enough to abstract the different hardware types and functionality that different PCs may have. The requirements of the software platform, architectural issues addressed, rationale behind the decisions made, and frameworks design implemented are discussed.
