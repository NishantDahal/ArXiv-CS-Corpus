The Features of the Complex CAD system of Reconstruction of the Industrial Plants

The features of designing of reconstruction of the acting plant by its design department are considered: the results of work are drawings corresponding with the national standards; large number of the small projects for different acting objects; variety of the types of the drawings in one project; large paper archive. The models and methods of developing of the complex CAD system with friend uniform environment of designing, with setting a profile of operations, with usage of the general parts of the project, with a series of problem-oriented subsystems are described on an example of a CAD system TechnoCAD GlassX
