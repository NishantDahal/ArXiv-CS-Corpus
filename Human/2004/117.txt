Combinatorial interpretation of the recurrence relation for fibonomial coefficients

Combinatorial interpretation of the fibonomial coefficients recently proposed by the present author results here in combinatorial interpretation of the recurrence relation for fibonomial coefficients . The presentation is provided with quite an exhaustive context where apart from plane grid coordinate system used several figures illustrate the exposition of statements and the derivation of the recurrence itself.
