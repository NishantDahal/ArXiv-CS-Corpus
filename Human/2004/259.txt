Higher-Order Concurrent Win32 Programming

We present a concurrent framework for Win32 programming based on Concurrent ML, a concurrent language with higher-order functions, static typing, lightweight threads and synchronous communication channels. The key points of the framework are the move from an event loop model to a threaded model for the processing of window messages, and the decoupling of controls notifications from the system messages. This last point allows us to derive a general way of writing controls that leads to easy composition, and can accommodate ActiveX Controls in a transparent way.
