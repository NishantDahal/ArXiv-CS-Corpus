RRL: A Rich Representation Language for the Description of Agent Behaviour in NECA

In this paper, we describe the Rich Representation Language (RRL) which is used in the NECA system. The NECA system generates interactions between two or more animated characters. The RRL is an XML compliant framework for representing the information that is exchanged at the interfaces between the various NECA system modules. The full XML Schemas for the RRL are available at http://www.ai.univie.ac.at/NECA/RRL
