Efficient dot product over word-size finite fields

We want to achieve efficiency for the exact computation of the dot product of two vectors over word-size finite fields. We therefore compare the practical behaviors of a wide range of implementation techniques using different representations. The techniques used include oating point representations, discrete logarithms, tabulations, Montgomery reduction, delayed modulus.
