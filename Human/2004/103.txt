Quantum Aspects of Semantic Analysis and Symbolic Artificial Intelligence

Modern approaches to semanic analysis if reformulated as Hilbert-space problems reveal formal structures known from quantum mechanics. Similar situation is found in distributed representations of cognitive structures developed for the purposes of neural networks. We take a closer look at similarites and differences between the above two fields and quantum information theory.
