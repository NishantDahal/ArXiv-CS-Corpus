ScotGrid: A Prototype Tier 2 Centre

ScotGrid is a prototype regional computing centre formed as a collaboration between the universities of Durham, Edinburgh and Glasgow as part of the UK's national particle physics grid, GridPP. We outline the resources available at the three core sites and our optimisation efforts for our user communities. We discuss the work which has been conducted in extending the centre to embrace new projects both from particle physics and new user communities and explain our methodology for doing this.
