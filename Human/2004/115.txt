Cauchy type identities and corresponding fermatian matrices via non-comuting variables of extended finite operator calculus

New family of extended Cauchy type identities is found and related Fermat type matrices are provided ready for applications in extended scope. This is achieved due to the use specifically non-commuting variables of extended finite operator calculus introduced by the author few years ago.
