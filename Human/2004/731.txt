OpenCCM : une infrastructure a composants pour le deploiement d'applications a base de composants CORBA

Deployment of software components for building distributed applications consists of the coordination of a set of basic tasks like uploading component binaries to the execution sites, loading them in memory, instantiating components, interconnecting their ports, setting their business and technical attributes. The automation of the deployment process then requires the presence of a software infrastructure distributed itself on the different execution sites. This paper presents the characteristics of such an infrastructure for the deployment of CORBA component-based applications. This latter is designed and implemented in the context of our OpenCCM platform, an open source implementation of the CORBA Component Model. The main characteristic lays on the fact that this infrastructure is itself designed as a set of CORBA component assemblies. This allows its dynamic assembly during its deployment over the execution sites
