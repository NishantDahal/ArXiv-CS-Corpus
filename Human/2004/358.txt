Finite-Length Scaling for Iteratively Decoded LDPC Ensembles

In this paper we investigate the behavior of iteratively decoded low-density parity-check codes over the binary erasure channel in the so-called ``waterfall region." We show that the performance curves in this region follow a very basic scaling law. We conjecture that essentially the same scaling behavior applies in a much more general setting and we provide some empirical evidence to support this conjecture. The scaling law, together with the error floor expressions developed previously, can be used for fast finite-length optimization.
