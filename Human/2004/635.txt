An Extended Generalized Disjunctive Paraconsistent Data Model for Disjunctive Information

This paper presents an extension of generalized disjunctive paraconsistent relational data model in which pure disjunctive positive and negative information as well as mixed disjunctive positive and negative information can be represented explicitly and manipulated. We consider explicit mixed disjunctive information in the context of disjunctive databases as there is an interesting interplay between these two types of information. Extended generalized disjunctive paraconsistent relation is introduced as the main structure in this model. The relational algebra is appropriately generalized to work on extended generalized disjunctive paraconsistent relations and their correctness is established.
