Conversation Analysis and the User Experience

We provide two case studies in the application of ideas drawn from conversation analysis to the design of technologies that enhance the experience of human conversation. We first present a case study of the design of an electronic guidebook, focusing on how conversation analytic principles played a role in the design process. We then discuss how the guidebook project has inspired our continuing work in social, mobile audio spaces. In particular, we describe some as yet unrealized concepts for adaptive audio spaces.
