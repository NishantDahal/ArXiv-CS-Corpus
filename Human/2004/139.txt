Belle Computing System

We describe the present status of the computing system in the Belle experiment at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ asymmetric-energy collider. So far, we have logged more than 160 fb$^{-1}$ of data, corresponding to the world's largest data sample of 170M $B\bar{B}$ pairs at the $Î¥(4S)$ energy region. A large amount of event data has to be processed to produce an analysis event sample in a timely fashion. In addition, Monte Carlo events have to be created to control systematic errors accurately. This requires stable and efficient usage of computing resources. Here we review our computing model and then describe how we efficiently proceed DST/MC productions in our system.
