DiPerF: an automated DIstributed PERformance testing Framework

We present DiPerF, a distributed performance testing framework, aimed at simplifying and automating service performance evaluation. DiPerF coordinates a pool of machines that test a target service, collects and aggregates performance metrics, and generates performance statistics. The aggregate data collected provide information on service throughput, on service "fairness" when serving multiple clients concurrently, and on the impact of network latency on service performance. Furthermore, using this data, it is possible to build predictive models that estimate a service performance given the service load. We have tested DiPerF on 100+ machines on two testbeds, Grid3 and PlanetLab, and explored the performance of job submission services (pre WS GRAM and WS GRAM) included with Globus Toolkit 3.2.
