Quantum Watermarking by Frequency of Error when Observing Qubits in Dissimilar Bases

We present a so-called fuzzy watermarking scheme based on the relative frequency of error in observing qubits in a dissimilar basis from the one in which they were written. Then we discuss possible attacks on the system and speculate on how to implement this watermarking scheme for particular kinds of messages (images, formated text, etc.).
