Combinatorial Approaches in Quantum Information Theory

We investigate the exploitation of various combinatorial properties of graphs and set systems to study several issues in quantum information theory. We characterize the combinatorics of distributed EPR pairs for preparing multi-partite entanglement in a real communication network. This combinatorics helps in the study of various problems in multi-party case by just reducing to the two-party case. Particularly, we use this combinatorics to (1) study various possible and impossible transformations of multi-partite states under LOCC, thus presenting an entirely new approach, not based on entropic criterion, to study such state transformations. (2) present a protocol and proof of its unconditional security for quantum key distribution amongst several trusted parties. (3) propose an idea to combine the features of quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing. We investigate all the above issues in great detail and finally conclude briefly with some open research directions based on our research.
