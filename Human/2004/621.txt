Using image partitions in 4th Dimension

I have plotted an image by using mathematical functions in the Database "4th Dimension". I'm going to show an alternative method to: detect which sector has been clicked; highlight it and combine it with other sectors already highlighted; store the graph information in an efficient way; load and splat image layers to reconstruct the stored graph.
