On the expressive power of semijoin queries

The semijoin algebra is the variant of the relational algebra obtained by replacing the join operator by the semijoin operator. We provide an Ehrenfeucht-Fraiss√© game, characterizing the discerning power of the semijoin algebra. This game gives a method for showing that queries are not expressible in the semijoin algebra.
