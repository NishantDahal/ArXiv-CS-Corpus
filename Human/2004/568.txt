Augmenting ALC(D) (atemporal) roles and (aspatial) concrete domain with temporal roles and a spatial concrete domain -first results

We consider the well-known family ALC(D) of description logics with a concrete domain, and provide first results on a framework obtained by augmenting ALC(D) atemporal roles and aspatial concrete domain with temporal roles and a spatial concrete domain.
