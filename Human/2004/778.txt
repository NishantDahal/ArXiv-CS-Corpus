ReCord: A Distributed Hash Table with Recursive Structure

We propose a simple distributed hash table called ReCord, which is a generalized version of Randomized-Chord and offers improved tradeoffs in performance and topology maintenance over existing P2P systems. ReCord is scalable and can be easily implemented as an overlay network, and offers a good tradeoff between the node degree and query latency. For instance, an $n$-node ReCord with $O(\log n)$ node degree has an expected latency of $Θ(\log n)$ hops. Alternatively, it can also offer $Θ(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ hops latency at a higher cost of $O(\frac{\log^2 n}{\log
 \log n})$ node degree. Meanwhile, simulations of the dynamic behaviors of ReCord are studied.
