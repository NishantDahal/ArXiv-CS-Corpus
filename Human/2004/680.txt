Computerized Face Detection and Recognition

This publication presents methods for face detection, analysis and recognition: fast normalized cross-correlation (fast correlation coefficient) between multiple templates based face pre-detection method, method for detection of exact face contour based on snakes and Generalized Gradient Vector Flow field, method for combining recognition algorithms based on Cumulative Match Characteristics in order to increase recognition speed and accuracy, and face recognition method based on Principal Component Analysis of the Wavelet Packet Decomposition allowing to use PCA - based recognition method with large number of training images. For all the methods are presented experimental results and comparisons of speed and accuracy with large face databases.
