Polarity sensitivity and evaluation order in type-logical grammar

We present a novel, type-logical analysis of_polarity sensitivity_: how negative polarity items (like "any" and "ever") or positive ones (like "some") are licensed or prohibited. It takes not just scopal relations but also linear order into account, using the programming-language notions of delimited continuations and evaluation order, respectively. It thus achieves greater empirical coverage than previous proposals.
