On the Implicit and on the Artificial - Morphogenesis and Emergent Aesthetics in Autonomous Collective Systems

Imagine a "machine" where there is no pre-commitment to any particular representational scheme: the desired behaviour is distributed and roughly specified simultaneously among many parts, but there is minimal specification of the mechanism required to generate that behaviour, i.e. the global behaviour evolves from the many relations of multiple simple behaviours. A machine that lives to and from/with Synergy. An artificial super-organism that avoids specific constraints and emerges within multiple low-level implicit bio-inspired mechanisms.
