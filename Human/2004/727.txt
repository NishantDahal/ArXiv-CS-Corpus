From Tensor Equations to Numerical Code -- Computer Algebra Tools for Numerical Relativity

In this paper we present our recent work in developing a computer-algebra tool for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs), termed "Kranc". Our work is motivated by the problem of finding solutions of the Einstein equations through numerical simulations. Kranc consists of Mathematica based computer-algebra packages, that facilitate the task of dealing with symbolic tensorial calculations and realize the conversion of systems of partial differential evolution equations into parallelized C or Fortran code.
