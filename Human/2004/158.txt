Adaptive Quantum Computation, Constant Depth Quantum Circuits and Arthur-Merlin Games

We present evidence that there exist quantum computations that can be carried out in constant depth, using 2-qubit gates, that cannot be simulated classically with high accuracy. We prove that if one can simulate these circuits classically efficiently then the complexity class BQP is contained in AM.
