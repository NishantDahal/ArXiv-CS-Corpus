Algorithms for Drawing Media

We describe algorithms for drawing media, systems of states, tokens and actions that have state transition graphs in the form of partial cubes. Our algorithms are based on two principles: embedding the state transition graph in a low-dimensional integer lattice and projecting the lattice onto the plane, or drawing the medium as a planar graph with centrally symmetric faces.
