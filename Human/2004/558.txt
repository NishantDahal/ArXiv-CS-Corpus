Using sparse matrices and splines-based interpolation in computational fluid dynamics simulations

In this relation I present a technique of construction and fast evaluation of a family of cubic polynomials for analytic smoothing and graphical rendering of particles trajectories for flows in a generic geometry. The principal result of the work was implementation and test of a method for interpolating 3D points by regular parametric curves and their fast and efficient evaluation for a good resolution of rendering. For the purpose a parallel environment using a multiprocessor cluster architecture has been used. This work has been developed for the Research and Development Department of my company for planning advanced customized models of industrial burners.
