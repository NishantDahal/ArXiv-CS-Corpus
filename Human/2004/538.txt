The asymptotic number of binary codes and binary matroids

The asyptotic number of nonequivalent binary n-codes is determined. This is also the asymptotic number of nonisomorphic binary n-matroids. The connection to a result of Lefmann, Roedl, Phelps is explored. The latter states that almost all binary n-codes have a trivial automorphism group.
