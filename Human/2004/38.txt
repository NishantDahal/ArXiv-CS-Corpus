Nondeterministic Quantum Query and Quantum Communication Complexities

We study nondeterministic quantum algorithms for Boolean functions f. Such algorithms have positive acceptance probability on input x iff f(x)=1. In the setting of query complexity, we show that the nondeterministic quantum complexity of a Boolean function is equal to its ``nondeterministic polynomial'' degree. We also prove a quantum-vs-classical gap of 1 vs n for nondeterministic query complexity for a total function. In the setting of communication complexity, we show that the nondeterministic quantum complexity of a two-party function is equal to the logarithm of the rank of a nondeterministic version of the communication matrix. This implies that the quantum communication complexities of the equality and disjointness functions are n+1 if we do not allow any error probability. We also exhibit a total function in which the nondeterministic quantum communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its classical counterpart.
