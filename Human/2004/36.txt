Comment on "Probabilistic Quantum Memories"

This is a comment on two wrong Phys. Rev. Letters papers by C.A. Trugenberger. Trugenberger claimed that quantum registers could be used as exponentially large "associative" memories. We show that his scheme is no better than one where the quantum register is replaced with a classical one of equal size.
  We also point out that the Holevo bound and more recent bounds on "quantum random access codes" pretty much rule out powerful memories (for classical information) based on quantum states.
