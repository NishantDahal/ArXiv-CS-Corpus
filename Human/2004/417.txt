Application of Artificial Neural Network in Jitter Analysis of Dispersion-Managed Communication System

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used as numerical methode in solving modified Nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation with Dispersion Managed System (DMS) for jitter analysis. We take the optical axis z and the time t as input, and then some relevant values such as the change of position and the center frequency of the pulse, and further the mean square time of incoming pulse which are needed for jitter analysis. It shows that ANN yields numerical solutions which are adaptive with respect to the numerical errors and also verifies the previous numerical results using conventional numerical method. Our result indicates that DMS can minimize the timing jitter induced by some amplifiers.
