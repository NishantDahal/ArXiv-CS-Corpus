CDTP Chain Distributed Transfer Protocol

The rapid growth of the internet in general and of bandwidth capacity at internet clients in particular poses increasing computation and bandwidth demands on internet servers. Internet access technologies like ADSL [DSL], Cable Modem and Wireless modem allow internet clients to access the internet with orders of magnitude more bandwidth than using traditional modems. We present CDTP a distributed transfer protocol that allows clients to cooperate and therefore remove the strain from the internet server thus achieving much better performance than traditional transfer protocols (e.g. FTP [FTP]). The CDTP server and client tools are presented also as well as results of experiments. Finally a bandwidth measurement technique is presented. CDTP tools use this technique to differentiate between slow and fast clients.
