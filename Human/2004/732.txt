Deployment in dynamic environments

Information and communication technologies are moving towards a new stage where applications will be dynamically deployed, uninstalled, updated and (re)configured. Several approaches have been followed with the goal of creating a fully automated and context-aware deployment system. Ideally, this system should be capable of handling the dynamics of this new situation, without losing sight of other factors, such as performance, security, availability or scalability. We will take some of the technologies that follow the principles of Service Oriented Architectures, SOA, as a paradigm of dynamic environments. SOA promote the breaking down of applications into sets of loosely coupled elements, called services. Services can be dynamically bound, deployed, reconfigured, uninstalled and updated. First of all, we will try to offer a broad view on the specific deployment issues that arise in these environments. Later on, we will present our approach to the problem. One of the essential points that has to be tackled to develop an automated deployment engine will be to have enough information to carry out tasks without human intervention. In the article we will focus on the format and contents of deployment descriptors. Additionally, we will go into the details of the deployment framework for OSGi enabled gateways that has been developed by our research group. Finally we will give some concluding remarks and some ideas for future work
