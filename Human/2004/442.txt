Generalized Evolutionary Algorithm based on Tsallis Statistics

Generalized evolutionary algorithm based on Tsallis canonical distribution is proposed. The algorithm uses Tsallis generalized canonical distribution to weigh the configurations for `selection' instead of Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. Our simulation results show that for an appropriate choice of non-extensive index that is offered by Tsallis statistics, evolutionary algorithms based on this generalization outperform algorithms based on Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution.
