Design of a Community-based Translation Center

Interfaces that support multi-lingual content can reach a broader community. We wish to extend the reach of CITIDEL, a digital library for computing education materials, to support multiple languages. By doing so, we hope that it will increase the number of users, and in turn the number of resources. This paper discusses three approaches to translation (automated translation, developer-based, and community-based), and a brief evaluation of these approaches. It proposes a design for an online community translation center where volunteers help translate interface components and educational materials available in CITIDEL.
