Kolmogorov complexity and symmetric relational structures

We study partitions of Fraïssé limits of classes of finite relational structures where the partitions are encoded by infinite binary sequences which are random in the sense of Kolmogorov, Chaitin and Solomonoff. It is shown that partition by a random sequence of a Fraïssé limit preserves the limit property of the object.
