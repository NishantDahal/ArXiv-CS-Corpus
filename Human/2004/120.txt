A Flexible Rule Compiler for Speech Synthesis

We present a flexible rule compiler developed for a text-to-speech (TTS) system. The compiler converts a set of rules into a finite-state transducer (FST). The input and output of the FST are subject to parameterization, so that the system can be applied to strings and sequences of feature-structures. The resulting transducer is guaranteed to realize a function (as opposed to a relation), and therefore can be implemented as a deterministic device (either a deterministic FST or a bimachine).
