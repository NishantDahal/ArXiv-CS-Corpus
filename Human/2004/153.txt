A Cartography for 2x2 Symmetric Games

A bidimensional representation of the space of 2x2 Symmetric Games in the strategic representation is proposed. This representation provides a tool for the classification of 2x2 symmetric games, quantification of the fraction of them having a certain feature, and predictions of changes in the characteristics of a game when a change in done on the payoff matrix that defines it.
