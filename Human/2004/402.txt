A proposal to design expert system for the calculations in the domain of QFT

Main purposes of the paper are followings: 1) To show examples of the calculations in domain of QFT via ``derivative rules'' of an expert system; 2) To consider advantages and disadvantage that technology of the calculations; 3) To reflect about how one would develop new physical theories, what knowledge would be useful in their investigations and how this problem can be connected with designing an expert system.
