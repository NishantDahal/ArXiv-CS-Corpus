EURYDICE : A platform for unified access to documents

In this paper we present Eurydice, a platform dedicated to provide a unified gateway to documents. Its basic functionalities about collecting documents have been designed based on a long experience about the management of scientific documentation among large and demanding academic communities such as IMAG and INRIA. Besides the basic problem of accessing documents - which was of course the original and main motivation of the project - a great effort has been dedicated to the development of management functionalities which could help institutions to control, analyse the current situation about the use of the documentation, and finally to set a better ground for a documentation policy. Finally a great emphasis - and corresponding technical investment - has been put on the protection of property and reproduction rights both from the users' intitution side and from the editors' side.
