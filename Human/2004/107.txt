Semiclassical Quantum Computation Solutions to the Count to Infinity Problem: A Brief Discussion

In this paper we briefly define distance vector routing algorithms, their advantages and possible drawbacks. On these possible drawbacks, currently widely used methods split horizon and poisoned reverse are defined and compared. The count to infinity problem is specified and it is classified to be a halting problem and a proposition stating that entangled states used in quantum computation can be used to handle this problem is examined. Several solutions to this problem by using entangled states are proposed and a very brief introduction to entangled states is presented.
