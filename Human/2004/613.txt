Further developements in finite fibonomial calculus

Primary definitions, notation and general observations of finite fibonomial operator calculus (ffoc) are presented. Kwasniewski's combinatorial interpretation of fibonomial coefficients by the use of fibonacci cobweb poset is given. Some elements of incidence algebra of fibonacci cobweb poset are defined.
