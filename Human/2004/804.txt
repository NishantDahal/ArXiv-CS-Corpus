Extended finite operator calculus as an example of algebraization of analysis

A wardian calculus of sequences started almost seventy years ago constitutes the general scheme for extensions of the classical umbral operator calculus considered by many afterwards . At the same time this calculus is an example of the algebraization of the analysis here restricted to the algebra of formal series. This is a review article based on the recent first author contributions. As the survey article it is supplemented by the short indicatory glossaries of notation and terms used by prominent contributors to the domain.
