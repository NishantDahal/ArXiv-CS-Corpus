Bug shallowness in open-source, Macintosh software

Central to the power of open-source software is bug shallowness, the relative ease of finding and fixing bugs. The open-source movement began with Unix software, so many users were also programmers capable of finding and fixing bugs given the source code. But as the open-source movement reaches the Macintosh platform, bugs may not be shallow because few Macintosh users are programmers. Based on reports from open-source developers, I, however, conclude that that bugs are as shallow in open-source, Macintosh software as in any other open-source software.
