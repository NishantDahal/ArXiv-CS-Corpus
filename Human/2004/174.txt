Using matrices in post-processing phase of CFD simulations

In this work I present a technique of construction and fast evaluation of a family of cubic polynomials for analytic smoothing and graphical rendering of particles trajectories for flows in a generic geometry. The principal result of the work was implementation and test of a method for interpolating 3D points by regular parametric curves and their fast and efficient evaluation for a good resolution of rendering. For the purpose I have used a parallel environment using a multiprocessor cluster architecture. The efficiency of the used method is good, mainly reducing the number of floating-points computations by caching the numerical values of some line-parameter's powers, and reducing the necessity of communication among processes. This work has been developed for the Research and Development Department of my company for planning advanced customized models of industrial burners.
