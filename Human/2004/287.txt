Interactive visualization of higher dimensional data in a multiview environment

We develop multiple view visualization of higher dimensional data. Our work was chiefly motivated by the need to extract insight from four dimensional Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) data. We develop visualization where multiple views, generally views of 3D projections or slices of a higher dimensional data, are tightly coupled not only by their specific order but also by a view synchronizing interaction style, and an internally defined interaction language. The tight coupling of the different views allows a fast and well-coordinated exploration of the data. In particular, the visualization allowed us to easily make consistency checks of the 4D QCD data and to infer the correctness of particle properties calculations. The software developed was also successfully applied in material studies, in particular studies of meteorite properties. Our implementation uses the VTK API. To handle a large number of views (slices/projections) and to still maintain good resolution, we use IBM T221 display (3840 X 2400 pixels).
