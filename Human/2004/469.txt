Annotating Predicate-Argument Structure for a Parallel Treebank

We report on a recently initiated project which aims at building a multi-layered parallel treebank of English and German. Particular attention is devoted to a dedicated predicate-argument layer which is used for aligning translationally equivalent sentences of the two languages. We describe both our conceptual decisions and aspects of their technical realisation. We discuss some selected problems and conclude with a few remarks on how this project relates to similar projects in the field.
