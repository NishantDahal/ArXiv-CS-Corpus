Embeddings into the Pancake Interconnection Network

Owing to its nice properties, the pancake is one of the Cayley graphs that were proposed as alternatives to the hypercube for interconnecting processors in parallel computers. In this paper, we present embeddings of rings, grids and hypercubes into the pancake with constant dilation and congestion. We also extend the results to similar efficient embeddings into the star graph.
