The Building of Online Communities: An approach for learning organizations, with a particular focus on the museum sector

This paper considers the move toward and potential of building online communities, with a particular focus on the museum sector. For instance, the increase in the use of `personalized' toolkits that are becoming an integral part of the online presence for learning organizations, like museums, can provide a basis for creating and sustaining communities. A set of case studies further illustrates working examples of the ways in which personalization and specific tools are developing collaborative spaces, community channels and group interactions.
