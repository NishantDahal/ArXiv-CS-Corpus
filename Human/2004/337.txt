Cyborg Systems as Platforms for Computer-Vision Algorithm-Development for Astrobiology

Employing the allegorical imagery from the film "The Matrix", we motivate and discuss our `Cyborg Astrobiologist' research program. In this research program, we are using a wearable computer and video camcorder in order to test and train a computer-vision system to be a field-geologist and field-astrobiologist.
