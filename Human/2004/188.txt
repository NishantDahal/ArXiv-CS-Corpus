XML framework for concept description and knowledge representation

An XML framework for concept description is given, based upon the fact that the tree structure of XML implies the logical structure of concepts as defined by attributional calculus. Especially, the attribute-value representation is implementable in the XML framework. Since the attribute-value representation is an important way to represent knowledge in AI, the framework offers a further and simpler way than the powerful RDF technology.
