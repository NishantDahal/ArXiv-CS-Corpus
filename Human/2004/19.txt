Query Answering in Peer-to-Peer Data Exchange Systems

The problem of answering queries posed to a peer who is a member of a peer-to-peer data exchange system is studied. The answers have to be consistent wrt to both the local semantic constraints and the data exchange constraints with other peers; and must also respect certain trust relationships between peers. A semantics for peer consistent answers under exchange constraints and trust relationships is introduced and some techniques for obtaining those answers are presented.
