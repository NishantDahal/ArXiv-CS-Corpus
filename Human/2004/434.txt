A Bimachine Compiler for Ranked Tagging Rules

This paper describes a novel method of compiling ranked tagging rules into a deterministic finite-state device called a bimachine. The rules are formulated in the framework of regular rewrite operations and allow unrestricted regular expressions in both left and right rule contexts. The compiler is illustrated by an application within a speech synthesis system.
