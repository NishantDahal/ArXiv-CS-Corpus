Neural Networks with c-NOT Gated Nodes

We try to design a quantum neural network with qubits instead of classical neurons with deterministic states, and also with quantum operators replacing teh classical action potentials. With our choice of gates interconnecting teh neural lattice, it appears that the state of the system behaves in ways reflecting both the strengths of coupling between neurons as well as initial conditions. We find that depending whether there is a threshold for emission from excited to ground state, the system shows either aperiodic oscillations or coherent ones with periodicity depending on the strength of coupling.
