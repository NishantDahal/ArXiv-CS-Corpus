Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Automated Debugging (AADEBUG 2003)

Over the past decades automated debugging has seen major achievements. However, as debugging is by necessity attached to particular programming paradigms, the results are scattered. To alleviate this problem, the Automated and Algorithmic Debugging workshop (AADEBUG for short) was organised in 1993 in Link"oping (Sweden). As this workshop proved to be successful, subsequent workshops have been organised in 1995 (Saint-Malo, France), 1997 (again in Link"oping, Sweden) and 2000 (Munich, Germany). In 2003, the workshop is organised in Ghent, Belgium, the proceedings of which you are reading right now.
