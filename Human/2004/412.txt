Semiclassical Neural Network

We have constructed a simple semiclassical model of neural network where neurons have quantum links with one another in a chosen way and affect one another in a fashion analogous to action potentials. We have examined the role of stochasticity introduced by the quantum potential and compare the system with the classical system of an integrate-and-fire model by Hopfield. Average periodicity and short term retentivity of input memory are noted.
