Bounded Input Bounded Predefined Control Bounded Output

The paper is an attempt to generalize a methodology, which is similar to the bounded-input bounded-output method currently widely used for the system stability studies. The presented earlier methodology allows decomposition of input space into bounded subspaces and defining for each subspace its bounding surface. It also defines a corresponding predefined control, which maps any point of a bounded input into a desired bounded output subspace. This methodology was improved by providing a mechanism for the fast defining a bounded surface. This paper presents enhanced bounded-input bounded-predefined-control bounded-output approach, which provides adaptability feature to the control and allows transferring of a controlled system along a suboptimal trajectory.
