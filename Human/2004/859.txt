One-Chip Solution to Intelligent Robot Control: Implementing Hexapod Subsumption Architecture Using a Contemporary Microprocessor

This paper introduces a six-legged autonomous robot managed by a single controller and a software core modeled on subsumption architecture. We begin by discussing the features and capabilities of IsoPod, a new processor for robotics which has enabled a streamlined implementation of our project. We argue that this processor offers a unique set of hardware and software features, making it a practical development platform for robotics in general and for subsumption-based control architectures in particular. Next, we summarize original ideas on subsumption architecture implementation for a six-legged robot, as presented by its inventor Rodney Brooks in 1980s. A comparison is then made to a more recent example of a hexapod control architecture based on subsumption. The merits of both systems are analyzed and a new subsumption architecture layout is formulated as a response. We conclude with some remarks regarding the development of this project as a hint at new potentials for intelligent robot design, opened by a recent development in embedded controller market.
