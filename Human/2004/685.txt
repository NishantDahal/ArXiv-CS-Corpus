A Comparison of Secret Sharing Schemes Based on Latin Squares and RSA

In recent years there has been a great deal of work done on secret sharing scehemes. Secret Sharing Schemes allow for the division of keys so that an authorised set of users may access information. In this paper we wish to present a critical comparison of two of these schemes based on Latin Squares, [Cooper et., al.] and RSA [Shoup]. These two protocols will be examined in terms of their positive and negative aspects of their secuirty.
