An Algorithm for Quasi-Associative and Quasi-Markovian Rules of Combination in Information Fusion

In this paper one proposes a simple algorithm of combining the fusion rules, those rules which first use the conjunctive rule and then the transfer of conflicting mass to the non-empty sets, in such a way that they gain the property of associativity and fulfill the Markovian requirement for dynamic fusion. Also, a new rule, SDL-improved, is presented.
