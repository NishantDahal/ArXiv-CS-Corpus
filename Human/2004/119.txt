Generating connected acyclic digraphs uniformly at random

We describe a simple algorithm based on a Markov chain process to generate simply connected acyclic directed graphs over a fixed set of vertices. This algorithm is an extension of a previous one, designed to generate acyclic digraphs, non necessarily connected.
