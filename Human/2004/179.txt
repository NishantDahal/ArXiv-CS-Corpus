Extraction of topological features from communication network topological patterns using self-organizing feature maps

Different classes of communication network topologies and their representation in the form of adjacency matrix and its eigenvalues are presented. A self-organizing feature map neural network is used to map different classes of communication network topological patterns. The neural network simulation results are reported.
