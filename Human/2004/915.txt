Computability Logic: a formal theory of interaction

Computability logic is a formal theory of (interactive) computability in the same sense as classical logic is a formal theory of truth. This approach was initiated very recently in "Introduction to computability logic" (Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 123 (2003), pp.1-99). The present paper reintroduces computability logic in a more compact and less technical way. It is written in a semitutorial style with a general computer science, logic or mathematics audience in mind. An Internet source on the subject is available at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html, and additional material at http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~japaridz/CL/gsoll.html .
