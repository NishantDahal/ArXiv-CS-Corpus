A knowledge-based approach to semi-automatic annotation of multimedia documents via user adaptation

Current approaches to the annotation process focus on annotation schemas, languages for annotation, or are very application driven. In this paper it is proposed that a more flexible architecture for annotation requires a knowledge component to allow for flexible search and navigation of the annotated material. In particular, it is claimed that a general approach must take into account the needs, competencies, and goals of the producers, annotators, and consumers of the annotated material. We propose that a user-model based approach is, therefore, necessary.
