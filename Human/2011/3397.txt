An Evolutionary Algorithm with Advanced Goal and Priority Specification for Multi-objective Optimization

This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm with a new    goal-sequence domination scheme for better decision support in    multi-objective optimization. The approach allows the inclusion of    advanced hard/soft priority and constraint information on each    objective component, and is capable of incorporating multiple    specifications with overlapping or non-overlapping objective functions    via logical 'OR' and 'AND' connectives to drive the search    towards multiple regions of trade-off. In addition, we propose a    dynamic sharing scheme that is simple and adaptively estimated    according to the on-line population distribution without needing any a    priori parameter setting. Each feature in the proposed algorithm is    examined to show its respective contribution, and the performance of    the algorithm is compared with other evolutionary optimization    methods. It is shown that the proposed algorithm has performed well in    the diversity of evolutionary search and uniform distribution of    non-dominated individuals along the final trade-offs, without    significant computational effort. The algorithm is also applied to the    design optimization of a practical servo control system for hard disk    drives with a single voice-coil-motor actuator. Results of the    evolutionary designed servo control system show a superior closed-loop    performance compared to classical PID or RPT approaches.
