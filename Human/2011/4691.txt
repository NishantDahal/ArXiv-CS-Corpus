Security Model For Service-Oriented Architecture

In this article, we examine how security applies to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Before we discuss security for SOA, lets take a step back and examine what SOA is. SOA is an architectural approach which involves applications being exposed as "services". Originally, services in SOA were associated with a stack of technologies which included SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI. This article addresses the defects of traditional enterprise application integration by combining service oriented-architecture and web service technology. Application integration is then simplified to development and integration of services to tackle connectivity of isomerous enterprise application integration, security, loose coupling between systems and process refactoring and optimization.
