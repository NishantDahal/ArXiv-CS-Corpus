The Grid: Prospects for Application in Metrology

Global system of distributing computing - Grid - created as reply for challenges, connected with the qualitative progress of complexity of experimental physical assemblies and information systems, is presented as optimal IT platform for assurance of measurement traceability in geographically remote regions and measurement data protection in global networks. The new component grid - Instrument Element (IE) - is intended for secure, remote, joint team work on monitoring and managing instruments generated and stored on distributed scientific equipment using conventional grid resources. The article describes the variety of all possible IE applications within grid technology for the tasks of metrology demanding IT support. Expanded by the new component IE grid becomes an optimal environment for effective monitoring, management and servicing of measuring resources which has the highest level of measurement data transfer, storage and processing safety and reveals new opportunities to track measurement procedures and assure a high level of confidence to these measurements.
