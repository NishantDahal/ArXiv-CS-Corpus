Completion Time in Broadcast Channel and Interference Channel

In a multi-user channel, completion time refers to the number of channel uses required for users, each with some given fixed bit pool, to complete the transmission of all their data bits. This paper extends the information theoretic formulation of multi-access completion time to broadcast channel and interference channel, enabling us to obtain the so-called completion time region (CTR), which, analogous to capacity region, characterizes all possible trade-offs between users' completion times. Specifically, for Gaussian broadcast channel (GBC) and Gaussian interference channel (GIC) in the strong/very strong regime, the exact CTR is obtained. For GIC in the weak/mixed regime, an achievable CTR based on the Etkin-Tse-Wang scheme and an outer-bound are obtained.
