An Alternative Interpretation of Linguistic Variables as Linguistic Finite Automata

Linguistic variables represent crisp information in a form and precision appropriate for the problem. For example, to answer the question "How are you?" one may say "I am fine." the linguistic variables like "fine", so common in everyday speech. In this paper an alternative interpretation of linguistic variables is introduced with the notion of a linguistic description of a value or set of values. The use of linguistic variables in many applications reduces the overall computation complexity of the application. Linguistic variables have been shown to be particularly useful in complex non-linear applications. Here we are applying the concept of reasoning with Linguistic Quantifiers to define the Linguistic Finite Automata along with the expansion of δ^{\box} and λ^{\box} over δand λ.
