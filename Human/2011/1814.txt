General Iteration graphs and Boolean automata circuits

This article is set in the field of regulation networks modeled by discrete dynamical systems. It focuses on Boolean automata networks. In such networks, there are many ways to update the states of every element. When this is done deterministically, at each time step of a discretised time flow and according to a predefined order, we say that the network is updated according to block-sequential update schedule (blocks of elements are updated sequentially while, within each block, the elements are updated synchronously). Many studies, for the sake of simplicity and with some biologically motivated reasons, have concentrated on networks updated with one particular block-sequential update schedule (more often the synchronous/parallel update schedule or the sequential update schedules). The aim of this paper is to give an argument formally proven and inspired by biological considerations in favour of the fact that the choice of a particular update schedule does not matter so much in terms of the possible and likely dynamical behaviours that networks may display.
