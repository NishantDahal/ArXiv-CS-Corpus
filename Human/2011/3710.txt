Mobile Cloud Computing: A Comparison of Application Models

Cloud computing is an emerging concept combining many fields of computing. The foundation of cloud computing is the delivery of services, software and processing capacity over the Internet, reducing cost, increasing storage, automating systems, decoupling of service delivery from underlying technology, and providing flexibility and mobility of information. However, the actual realization of these benefits is far from being achieved for mobile applications and open many new research questions. In order to better understand how to facilitate the building of mobile cloud-based applications, we have surveyed existing work in mobile computing through the prism of cloud computing principles. We give a definition of mobile cloud coputing and provide an overview of the results from this review, in particular, models of mobile cloud applications. We also highlight research challenges in the area of mobile cloud computing. We conclude with recommendations for how this better understanding of mobile cloud computing can help building more powerful mobile applications.
