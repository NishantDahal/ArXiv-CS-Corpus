The study of distributed computing algorithms by multithread applications

The material in this note is used as an introduction to distributed algorithms in a four year course on software and automatic control system in the computer technology department of the Komsomolsk-on-Amur state technical university. All our the program examples are written in Borland C/C++ 5.02 for Windows 95/98/2000/NT/XP, and hence suit to compile and execute by Visual C/C++. We consider the following approaches of the distributed computing: the conversion of recursive algorithms to multithread applications, a realization of the pairing algorithm, the building of wave systems by Petri nets and object oriented programming.
