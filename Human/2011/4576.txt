Tensor-Based Link Prediction in Intermittently Connected Wireless Networks

Through several studies, it has been highlighted that mobility patterns in mobile networks are driven by human behaviors. This effect has been particularly observed in intermittently connected networks like DTN (Delay Tolerant Networks). Given that common social intentions generate similar human behavior, it is relevant to exploit this knowledge in the network protocols design, e.g. to identify the closeness degree between two nodes. In this paper, we propose a temporal link prediction technique for DTN which quantifies the behavior similarity between each pair of nodes and makes use of it to predict future links. Our prediction method keeps track of the spatio-temporal aspects of nodes behaviors organized as a third-order tensor that aims to records the evolution of the network topology. After collapsing the tensor information, we compute the degree of similarity for each pair of nodes using the Katz measure. This metric gives us an indication on the link occurrence between two nodes relying on their closeness. We show the efficiency of this method by applying it on three mobility traces: two real traces and one synthetic trace. Through several simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique regarding another approach based on a similarity metric used in DTN. The validity of this method is proven when the computation of score is made in a distributed way (i.e. with local information). We attest that the tensor-based technique is effective for temporal link prediction applied to the intermittently connected networks. Furthermore, we think that this technique can go beyond the realm of DTN and we believe this can be further applied on every case of figure in which there is a need to derive the underlying social structure of a network of mobile users.
