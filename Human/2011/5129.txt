Online Robust Subspace Tracking from Partial Information

This paper presents GRASTA (Grassmannian Robust Adaptive Subspace Tracking Algorithm), an efficient and robust online algorithm for tracking subspaces from highly incomplete information. The algorithm uses a robust $l^1$-norm cost function in order to estimate and track non-stationary subspaces when the streaming data vectors are corrupted with outliers. We apply GRASTA to the problems of robust matrix completion and real-time separation of background from foreground in video. In this second application, we show that GRASTA performs high-quality separation of moving objects from background at exceptional speeds: In one popular benchmark video example, GRASTA achieves a rate of 57 frames per second, even when run in MATLAB on a personal laptop.
