SOAP vs REST: Comparing a master-slave GA implementation

In this paper, a high-level comparison of both SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) is made. These are the two main approaches for interfacing to the web with web services. Both approaches are different and present some advantages and disadvantages for interfacing to web services: SOAP is conceptually more difficult (has a steeper learning curve) and more "heavy-weight" than REST, although it lacks of standards support for security. In order to test their eficiency (in time), two experiments have been performed using both technologies: a client-server model implementation and a master-slave based genetic algorithm (GA). The results obtained show clear differences in time between SOAP and REST implementations. Although both techniques are suitable for developing parallel systems, SOAP is heavier than REST, mainly due to the verbosity of SOAP communications (XML increases the time taken to parse the messages).
