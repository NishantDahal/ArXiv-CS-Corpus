Semantic-ontological combination of Business Rules and Business Processes in IT Service Management

IT Service Management deals with managing a broad range of items related to complex system environments. As there is both, a close connection to business interests and IT infrastructure, the application of semantic expressions which are seamlessly integrated within applications for managing ITSM environments, can help to improve transparency and profitability. This paper focuses on the challenges regarding the integration of semantics and ontologies within ITSM environments. It will describe the paradigm of relationships and inheritance within complex service trees and will present an approach of ontologically expressing them. Furthermore, the application of SBVR-based rules as executable SQL triggers will be discussed. Finally, the broad range of topics for further research, derived from the findings, will be presented.
