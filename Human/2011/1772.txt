Aperiodic logarithmic signatures

In this paper we propose a method to construct logarithmic signatures which are not amalgamated transversal and further do not even have a periodic block. The latter property was crucial for the successful attack on the system MST3 by Blackburn et al. [1]. The idea for our construction is based on the theory in Szab√≥'s book about group factorizations [12].
