Teaching Introductory Electrical Engineering Course to CS Students in a Russian University

This article is about the author's experience with developing and teaching an introductory electrical engineering course for students of Faculty (department) of Information Technology of a Russian university. The curriculum of this department conforms to typical computer science curricula of US engineering schools with a noticeable omission of comparable electrical engineering courses. When developing the course, I did my best to pay attention to learning preferences of the department's student body. I also hoped to contribute to a degree to meeting labor market demands for developers of electrical engineering CAD software. As for inspiration, I was enchanted with ideas of the Mead & Conway revolution, albeit indirectly related to my enterprise.
