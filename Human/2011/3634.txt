On the Throughput-Delay Trade-off in Georouting Networks

We study the scaling properties of a georouting scheme in a wireless multi-hop network of $n$ mobile nodes. Our aim is to increase the network capacity quasi linearly with $n$ while keeping the average delay bounded. In our model, mobile nodes move according to an i.i.d. random walk with velocity $v$ and transmit packets to randomly chosen destinations. The average packet delivery delay of our scheme is of order $1/v$ and it achieves the network capacity of order $\frac{n}{\log n\log\log n}$. This shows a practical throughput-delay trade-off, in particular when compared with the seminal result of Gupta and Kumar which shows network capacity of order $\sqrt{n/\log n}$ and negligible delay and the groundbreaking result of Grossglausser and Tse which achieves network capacity of order $n$ but with an average delay of order $\sqrt{n}/v$. We confirm the generality of our analytical results using simulations under various interference models.
