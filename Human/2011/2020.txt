On the geometry of small weight codewords of dual algebraic geometric codes

We investigate the geometry of the support of small weight codewords of dual algebraic geometric codes on smooth complete intersections by applying the powerful tools recently developed by Alain Couvreur. In particular, by restricting ourselves to the case of Hermitian codes, we recover and extend previous results obtained by the second named author joint with Marco Pellegrini and Massimiliano Sala.
