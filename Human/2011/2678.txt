Model Checking of Boolean Process Models

In the field of Business Process Management formal models for the control flow of business processes have been designed since more than 15 years. Which methods are best suited to verify the bulk of these models? The first step is to select a formal language which fixes the semantics of the models. We adopt the language of Boolean systems as reference language for Boolean process models. Boolean systems form a simple subclass of coloured Petri nets. Their characteristics are low tokens to model explicitly states with a subsequent skipping of activations and arbitrary logical rules of type AND, XOR, OR etc. to model the split and join of the control flow. We apply model checking as a verification method for the safeness and liveness of Boolean systems. Model checking of Boolean systems uses the elementary theory of propositional logic, no modal operators are needed. Our verification builds on a finite complete prefix of a certain T-system attached to the Boolean system. It splits the processes of the Boolean system into a finite set of base processes of bounded length. Their behaviour translates to formulas from propositional logic. Our verification task consists in checking the satisfiability of these formulas. In addition we have implemented our model checking algorithm as a java program. The time needed to verify a given Boolean system depends critically on the number of initial tokens. Because the algorithm has to solve certain SAT-problems, polynomial complexity cannot be expected. The paper closes with the model checking of some Boolean process models which have been designed as Event-driven Process Chains.
