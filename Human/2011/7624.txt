On Measurement and Computation

Inspired by the work of Feynman, Deutsch, We formally propose the theory of physical computability and accordingly, the physical complexity theory. To achieve this, a framework that can evaluate almost all forms of computation using various physical mechanisms is discussed. Here, we focus on using it to review the theory of Quantum Computation. As a preliminary study on more general problems, some examples of other physical mechanism are also given in this paper.
