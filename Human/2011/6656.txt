Construction du lexique LGLex Ã  partir des tables du Lexique-Grammaire des verbes du grec moderne

In this paper, we summerize the work done on the resources of Modern Greek on the Lexicon-Grammar of verbs. We detail the definitional features of each table, and all changes made to the names of features to make them consistent. Through the development of the table of classes, including all the features, we have considered the conversion of tables in a syntactic lexicon: LGLex. The lexicon, in plain text format or XML, is generated by the LGExtract tool (Constant & Tolone, 2010). This format is directly usable in applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
