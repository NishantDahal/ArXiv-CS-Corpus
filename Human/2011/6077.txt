Standard Quantum Teleportation of an Arbitrary N-Qubit State, Non-Existence of Magic Basis and Existence of Magic Partial Bases for 2N Entangled Qubit States with N>1

We present a simple and precise protocol for standard quantum teleportation of N-qubit state, considering the most general resource q-channel and Bell states. We find condition on these states for perfect teleportation and give explicitly the unitary transformation required to be done by Bob for achieving perfect teleportation. We discuss connection of our simple theory with the complicated related work on this subject and with character matrix, transformation, judgment and kernel operators defined in this context. We also prove that the magic basis discussed by Hill and Wootters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997) 5022] does not exist for entangled 2N-qubit states with N > 1 but magic partial bases, similar to those discussed recently by Prakash and Maurya [Optics Commun. 284 (2011) 5024] do exist. We give explicitly all magic partial bases for N = 2.
