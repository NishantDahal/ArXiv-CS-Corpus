Alignment of Microtubule Imagery

This work discusses preliminary work aimed at simulating and visualizing the growth process of a tiny structure inside the cell---the microtubule. Difficulty of recording the process lies in the fact that the tissue preparation method for electronic microscopes is highly destructive to live cells. Here in this paper, our approach is to take pictures of microtubules at different time slots and then appropriately combine these images into a coherent video. Experimental results are given on real data.
