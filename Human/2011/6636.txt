Upper bounds on the smallest size of a complete arc in the plane PG(2,q)

New upper bounds on the smallest size t_{2}(2,q) of a complete arc in the projective plane PG(2,q) are obtained for q <= 9109. From these new bounds it follows that for q <= 2621 and q = 2659,2663,2683,2693,2753,2801, the relation t_{2}(2,q) < 4.5\sqrt{q} holds. Also, for q <= 5399 and q = 5413,5417,5419,5441,5443,5471,5483,5501,5521, we have t_{2}(2,q) < 4.8\sqrt{q}. Finally, for q <= 9067 it holds that t_{2}(2,q) < 5\sqrt{q}. The new upper bounds are obtained by finding new small complete arcs with the help of a computer search using randomized greedy algorithms.
