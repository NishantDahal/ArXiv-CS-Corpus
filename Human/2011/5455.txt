Tropical Algebraic approach to Consensus over Networks

In this paper we study the convergence of the max-consensus protocol. Tropical algebra is used to formulate the problem. Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of the max-consensus protocol over fixed as well as switching topology networks are given.
