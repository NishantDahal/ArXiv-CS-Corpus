Virtual Worlds as a Support to Engineering Teaching

Virtual Worlds (VWs) are an emerging technology used by a growing number of educational institutions around the world. It is an environment, a way of learning and an educational tool that allows different levels of online interaction. In the course "Programming I", of the career Informatics Engineering at Universidad de Valpara√≠so, we conducted a pilot experience with the VW of Second Life, in order to evaluate the potential of using VWs in the teaching practice.
