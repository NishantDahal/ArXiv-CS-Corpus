Optimal Bounds in Parametric LTL Games

We consider graph games of infinite duration with winning conditions in parameterized linear temporal logic, where the temporal operators are equipped  with variables for time bounds. In model checking such specifications were introduced as "PLTL" by Alur et al. and (in a different version called "PROMPT-LTL") by Kupferman et al..
  We present an algorithm to determine optimal variable valuations that allow a player to win a game. Furthermore, we show how to determine whether a player wins a game with respect to some, infinitely many, or all valuations. All our algorithms run in doubly-exponential time; so, adding bounded temporal operators does not increase the complexity compared to solving plain LTL games.
