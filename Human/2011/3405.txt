Planning by Rewriting

Domain-independent planning is a hard combinatorial    problem. Taking into account plan quality makes the task even more    difficult. This article introduces Planning by Rewriting (PbR), a new    paradigm for efficient high-quality domain-independent planning. PbR    exploits declarative plan-rewriting rules and efficient local search    techniques to transform an easy-to-generate, but possibly suboptimal,    initial plan into a high-quality plan. In addition to addressing the    issues of planning efficiency and plan quality, this framework offers    a new anytime planning algorithm. We have implemented this planner and    applied it to several existing domains. The experimental results show    that the PbR approach provides significant savings in planning effort    while generating high-quality plans.
