About a conjectured basis for Multiple Zeta Values

We confirm a conjecture about the construction of basis elements for the multiple zeta values (MZVs) at weight 27 and weight 28. Both show as expected one element that is twofold extended. This is done with some lengthy computer algebra calculations using TFORM to determine explicit bases for the MZVs at these weights.
