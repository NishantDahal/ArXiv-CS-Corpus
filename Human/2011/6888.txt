Storage Balancing in Self-organizing Multimedia Delivery Systems

Many of the current bio-inspired delivery networks set their focus on search, e.g., by using artificial ants. If the network size and, therefore, the search space gets too large, the users experience high delays until the requested content can be consumed. In previous work, we proposed different replication strategies to reduce the search space. In this report we further evaluate measures for storage load balancing, because peers are most likely limited in space. We periodically apply clean-ups if a certain storage level is reached. For our evaluations we combine the already introduced replication measures with least recently used (LRU), least frequently used (LFU) and a hormone-based clean-up. The goal is to elaborate a combination that leads to low delays while the replica utilization is high.
