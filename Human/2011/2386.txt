Realization and Properties of Biochemical-Computing Biocatalytic XOR Gate Based on Enzyme Inhibition by a Substrate

We consider a realization of the XOR logic gate in a process biocatalyzed by an enzyme (here horseradish peroxidase: HRP), the function of which can be inhibited by a substrate (hydrogen peroxide for HRP), when the latter is inputted at large enough concentrations. A model is developed for describing such systems in an approach suitable for evaluation of the analog noise amplification properties of the gate. The obtained data are fitted for gate quality evaluation within the developed model, and we discuss aspects of devising XOR gates for functioning in "biocomputing" systems utilizing biomolecules for information processing.
