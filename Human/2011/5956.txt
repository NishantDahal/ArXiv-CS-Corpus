The CHRONIOUS Ontology-Driven Search Tool: Enabling Access to Focused and Up-to-Date Healthcare Literature

This paper presents an advanced search engine prototype for bibliography retrieval developed within the CHRONIOUS European IP project of the seventh Framework Program (FP7). This search engine is specifically targeted to clinicians and healthcare practitioners searching for documents related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). To this aim, the presented tool exploits two pathology-specific ontologies that allow focused document indexing and retrieval. These ontologies have been developed on the top of the Middle Layer Ontology for Clinical Care (MLOCC), which provides a link with the Basic Formal Ontology, a foundational ontology used in the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry. In addition link with the terms of the MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) thesaurus has been provided to guarantee the coverage with the general certified medical terms and multilingual capabilities.
