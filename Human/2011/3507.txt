Network connectivity during mergers and growth: optimizing the addition of a module

The principal eigenvalue $λ$ of a network's adjacency matrix often determines dynamics on the network (e.g., in synchronization and spreading processes) and some of its structural properties (e.g., robustness against failure or attack) and is therefore a good indicator for how ``strongly'' a network is connected. We study how $λ$ is modified by the addition of a module, or community, which has broad applications, ranging from those involving a single modification (e.g., introduction of a drug into a biological process) to those involving repeated additions (e.g., power-grid and transit development). We describe how to optimally connect the module to the network to either maximize or minimize the shift in $λ$, noting several applications of directing dynamics on networks.
