The Performance of PCM Quantization Under Tight Frame Representations

In this paper, we study the performance of the PCM scheme with linear quantization rule for quantizing finite unit-norm tight frame expansions for $\R^d$ and derive the PCM quantization error without the White Noise Hypothesis. We prove that for the class of unit norm tight frames derived from uniform frame paths the quantization error has an upper bound of $O(δ^{3/2})$ regardless of the frame redundancy. This is achieved using some of the techniques developed by Güntürk in his study of Sigma-Delta quantization. Using tools of harmonic analysis we show that this upper bound is sharp for $d=2$. A consequence of this result is that, unlike with Sigma-Delta quantization, the error for PCM quantization in general does not diminish to zero as one increases the frame redundancy. We extend the result to high dimension and show that the PCM quantization error has an upper bound $O(δ^{(d+1)/2})$ for asymptopitcally equidistributed unit-norm tight frame of $\R^{d}$.
