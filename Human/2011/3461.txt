Some Aspects of Quantum Cryptography and Network Security

Quantum mechanics is the current best description of the world as we know it. Experiments have shown that quantum predictions are accurate up ten places of decimal. In quantum cryptography much work has been devoted to the study of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The purpose of QKD is to securely distribute secret keys between the users in a network. As a result, several quantum cryptographic protocols have been implemented and tested after the advent of quantum computing. In this paper, we have given a brief overview of QKD, and some practical networks that integrate QKD in the current Internet security architecture. We have also discussed some aspects of quantum network security with particular attention to Byzantine Agreement Protocol.
