A novel methodology for antenna design and optimization: Variable Zo

This paper describes "Variable Zo," a novel and proprietary approach to antenna design and optimization. The new methodology is illustrated by applying it to the design of a resistively-loaded bowtie antenna and to two broadband Yagi-Uda arrays. Variable Zo is applicable to any antenna design or optimization methodology. Using it will result in generally better antenna designs across any user-specified set of performance objectives.
