Using Automated Dependency Analysis To Generate Representation Information

To preserve access to digital content, we must preserve the representation information that captures the intended interpretation of the data. In particular, we must be able to capture performance dependency requirements, i.e. to identify the other resources that are required in order for the intended interpretation to be constructed successfully. Critically, we must identify the digital objects that are only referenced in the source data, but are embedded in the performance, such as fonts. This paper describes a new technique for analysing the dynamic dependencies of digital media, focussing on analysing the process that underlies the performance, rather than parsing and deconstructing the source data. This allows the results of format-specific characterisation tools to be verified independently, and facilitates the generation of representation information for any digital media format, even when no suitable characterisation tool exists.
