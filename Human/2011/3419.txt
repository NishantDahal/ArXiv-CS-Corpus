Robust Agent Teams via Socially-Attentive Monitoring

Agents in dynamic multi-agent environments must monitor    their peers to execute individual and group plans. A key open question    is how much monitoring of other agents' states is required to be    effective: The Monitoring Selectivity Problem.  We investigate this    question in the context of detecting failures in teams of cooperating    agents, via Socially-Attentive Monitoring, which focuses on monitoring    for failures in the social relationships between the agents. We    empirically and analytically explore a family of socially-attentive    teamwork monitoring algorithms in two dynamic, complex, multi-agent    domains, under varying conditions of task distribution and    uncertainty. We show that a centralized scheme using a complex    algorithm trades correctness for completeness and requires monitoring    all teammates. In contrast, a simple distributed teamwork monitoring    algorithm results in correct and complete detection of teamwork    failures, despite relying on limited, uncertain knowledge, and    monitoring only key agents in a team.  In addition, we report on the    design of a socially-attentive monitoring system and demonstrate its    generality in monitoring several coordination relationships,    diagnosing detected failures, and both on-line and off-line applications.
