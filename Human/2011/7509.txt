Revenue Prediction of Local Event using Mathematical Model of Hit Phenomena

Theoretical approach to investigate human-human interaction in society performed using a many-body theory including human-human interaction. The advertisement is treated as an external force. The word of mouth (WOM) effect is included as a two-body interaction between humans. The rumor effect is included as a three-body interaction between humans. The parameters to define the strength of human interactions are assumed to be constant values. The calculated result explained well the two local events "Mizuki-Shigeru Road in Sakaiminato" and "the sculpture festival at Tottori" in Japan.
