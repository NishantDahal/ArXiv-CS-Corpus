Question Answering in a Natural Language Understanding System Based on Object-Oriented Semantics

Algorithms of question answering in a computer system oriented on input and logical processing of text information are presented. A knowledge domain under consideration is social behavior of a person. A database of the system includes an internal representation of natural language sentences and supplemental information. The answer {\it Yes} or {\it No} is formed for a general question. A special question containing an interrogative word or group of interrogative words permits to find a subject, object, place, time, cause, purpose and way of action or event. Answer generation is based on identification algorithms of persons, organizations, machines, things, places, and times. Proposed algorithms of question answering can be realized in information systems closely connected with text processing (criminology, operation of business, medicine, document systems).
