Conflict-Directed Backjumping Revisited

In recent years, many improvements to backtracking algorithms for    solving constraint satisfaction problems have been proposed.    The techniques for improving backtracking algorithms can    be conveniently classified as look-ahead schemes and    look-back schemes.  Unfortunately, look-ahead and look-back    schemes are not entirely orthogonal as it has been observed    empirically that the enhancement of look-ahead techniques    is sometimes counterproductive to the effects of look-back    techniques. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between    the two most important look-ahead techniques---using a variable    ordering heuristic and maintaining a level of local consistency    during the backtracking search---and the look-back technique of    conflict-directed backjumping (CBJ). We show that there exists    a "perfect" dynamic variable ordering such that CBJ becomes    redundant. We also show theoretically that as the level of local    consistency that is maintained in the backtracking search is    increased, the less that backjumping will be an improvement.    Our theoretical results partially explain why a backtracking    algorithm doing more in the look-ahead phase cannot benefit    more from the backjumping look-back scheme. Finally, we show    empirically that adding CBJ to a backtracking algorithm that    maintains generalized arc consistency (GAC), an algorithm that    we refer to as GAC-CBJ, can still provide orders of magnitude    speedups. Our empirical results contrast with Bessiere and    Regin's conclusion (1996) that CBJ is useless to an algorithm    that maintains arc consistency.
