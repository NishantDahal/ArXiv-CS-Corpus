Unambiguous 1-Uniform Morphisms

A morphism h is unambiguous with respect to a word w if there is no other morphism g that maps w to the same image as h. In the present paper we study the question of whether, for any given word, there exists an unambiguous 1-uniform morphism, i.e., a morphism that maps every letter in the word to an image of length 1.
