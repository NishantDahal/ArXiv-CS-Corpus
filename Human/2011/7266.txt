KM and WEB 2.0 methods for project-based learning. MESHAT : a monitoring and experience sharing tool

Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in face-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better the needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the specific case of project management training. The results of a course observation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools involves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore dissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of knowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a personalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or tutor), which gives information to monitor activities and supports the acquisition and transfer of expertise. This platform is based on Knowledge Management (KM) and Web 2.0 concepts to support the dynamic building of knowledge. KM is used to define the learning process (based on the experiential learning theory) and the way the individual knowledge building is monitored (based on metacognitive concepts). Web 2.0 is used to define the way the experience is shared. We make the hypothesis that this approach improves the acquisition of complex skills (e.g. management, communication and collaboration), which requires a behavioural evolution. We aim at making the students become able 'to learn to learn' and evolve according to contexts. We facilitate their ability to have a critical analysis of their actions according to the situations they encounter.
