Privacy-Preserving Group Data Access via Stateless Oblivious RAM Simulation

We study the problem of providing privacy-preserving access to an outsourced honest-but-curious data repository for a group of trusted users. We show that such privacy-preserving data access is possible using a combination of probabilistic encryption, which directly hides data values, and stateless oblivious RAM simulation, which hides the pattern of data accesses. We give simulations that have only an $O(\log n)$ amortized time overhead for simulating a RAM algorithm, $\cal A$, that has a memory of size $n$, using a scheme that is data-oblivious with very high probability assuming the simulation has access to a private workspace of size $O(n^ν)$, for any given fixed constant $ν>0$. This simulation makes use of pseudorandom hash functions and is based on a novel hierarchy of cuckoo hash tables that all share a common stash. We also provide results from an experimental simulation of this scheme, showing its practicality. In addition, in a result that may be of some theoretical interest, we also show that one can eliminate the dependence on pseudorandom hash functions in our simulation while having the overhead rise to be $O(\log^2 n)$.
