Model Checking Probabilistic Real-Time Properties for Service-Oriented Systems with Service Level Agreements

The assurance of quality of service properties is an important aspect of service-oriented software  engineering. Notations for so-called service level agreements (SLAs), such as the Web Service Level  Agreement (WSLA) language, provide a formal syntax to specify such assurances in terms of (legally  binding) contracts between a service provider and a customer. On the other hand, formal methods for  verification of probabilistic real-time behavior have reached a level of expressiveness and efficiency  which allows to apply them in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we suggest to employ the recently  introduced model of Interval Probabilistic Timed Automata (IPTA) for formal verification of QoS  properties of service-oriented systems. Specifically, we show that IPTA in contrast to Probabilistic  Timed Automata (PTA) are able to capture the guarantees specified in SLAs directly. A particular  challenge in the analysis of IPTA is the fact that their naive semantics usually yields an infinite set  of states and infinitely-branching transitions. However, using symbolic representations, IPTA can be  analyzed rather efficiently. We have developed the first implementation of an IPTA model checker  by extending the PRISM tool and show that model checking IPTA is only slightly more expensive  than model checking comparable PTA.
