IT Security Issues Within the Video Game Industry

IT security issues are an important aspect for each and every organization within the video game industry. Within the video game industry alone, you might not normally think of security risks being an issue. But as we can and have seen in recent news, no company is immune to security risks no matter how big or how small. While each of these organizations will never be exactly the same as the next, there are common security issues that can and do affect each and every video game company. In order to properly address those security issues, one of the current leading video game companies was selected in order to perform an initial security assessment. This security assessment provided a starting point upon which specific goals and procedures were determined to help mitigate those risks. The information contained within was initially completed on the case study but has been generalized to allow the information to be easily applied to any video game company.
