On the Optimal Transmission Scheme to Maximize Local Capacity in Wireless Networks

We study the optimal transmission scheme that maximizes the local capacity in two-dimensional (2D) wireless networks. Local capacity is defined as the average information rate received by a node randomly located in the network. Using analysis based on analytical and numerical methods, we show that maximum local capacity can be obtained if simultaneous emitters are positioned in a grid pattern based on equilateral triangles. We also compare this maximum local capacity with the local capacity of slotted ALOHA scheme and our results show that slotted ALOHA can achieve at least half of the maximum local capacity in wireless networks.
