Medical Image Denoising using Adaptive Threshold Based on Contourlet Transform

Image denoising has become an essential exercise in medical imaging especially the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This paper proposes a medical image denoising algorithm using contourlet transform. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can obtained higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) than wavelet based denoising algorithms using MR Images in the presence of AWGN.
