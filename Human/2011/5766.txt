Analysis of Differential Phase Shift Quantum Key Distribution

We review the implementation of two QKD protocols (BB84 and B92) keeping in mind that their implementations do not easily satisfy the requirement of use of single photons. We argue that current models do not take into account issues raised by the Uncertainty Principle related to time-location and transmission characteristics of single photons. This indicates that security proofs of current implementations even after the fixes for the recent successful hacks are made will be hard to obtain.
