Grammatical Relations of Myanmar Sentences Augmented by Transformation-Based Learning of Function Tagging

In this paper we describe function tagging using Transformation Based Learning (TBL) for Myanmar that is a method of extensions to the previous statistics-based function tagger. Contextual and lexical rules (developed using TBL) were critical in achieving good results. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in function tagging that statistical function tagging are currently unable to express. Function tagging is the preprocessing step to show grammatical relations of the sentences. Then we use the context free grammar technique to clarify the grammatical relations in Myanmar sentences or to output the parse trees. The grammatical relations are the functional structure of a language. They rely very much on the function tag of the tokens. We augment the grammatical relations of Myanmar sentences with transformation-based learning of function tagging.
