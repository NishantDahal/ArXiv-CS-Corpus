Blind Known Interference Cancellation

This paper investigates interference-cancellation schemes at the receiver, in which the original data of the interference is known a priori. Such a priori knowledge is common in wireless relay networks. For example, a transmitting relay could be relaying data that was previously transmitted by a node, in which case the interference received by the node now is actually self information. Besides the case of self information, the node could also have overheard or received the interference data in a prior transmission by another node. Directly removing the known interference requires accurate estimate of the interference channel, which may be difficult in many situations. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC), to cancel known interference without interference channel information. BKIC consists of two steps. The first step combines adjacent symbols to cancel the interference, exploiting the fact that the channel coefficients are almost the same between successive symbols. After such interference cancellation, however, the signal of interest is also distorted. The second step recovers the signal of interest amidst the distortion. We propose two algorithms for the critical second steps. The first algorithm (BKIC-S) is based on the principle of smoothing. It is simple and has near optimal performance in the slow fading scenario. The second algorithm (BKIC-RBP) is based on the principle of real-valued belief propagation. It can achieve MAP-optimal performance with fast convergence, and has near optimal performance even in the fast fading scenario. Both BKIC schemes outperform the traditional self-interference cancellation schemes with perfect initial channel information by a large margin, while having lower complexities.
