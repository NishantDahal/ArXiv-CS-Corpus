ABHIVYAKTI: A Vision Based Intelligent System for Elder and Sick Persons

This paper describes an intelligent system ABHIVYAKTI, which would be pervasive in nature and based on the Computer Vision. It would be very easy in use and deployment. Elder and sick people who are not able to talk or walk, they are dependent on other human beings and need continuous monitoring, while our system provides flexibility to the sick or elder person to announce his or her need to their caretaker by just showing a particular gesture with the developed system, if the caretaker is not nearby. This system will use fingertip detection techniques for acquiring gesture and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) will be used for gesture recognition.
