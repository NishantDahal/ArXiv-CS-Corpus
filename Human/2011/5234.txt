Visualizing Domain Ontology using Enhanced Anaphora Resolution Algorithm

Enormous explosion in the number of the World Wide Web pages occur every day and since the efficiency of most of the information processing systems is found to be less, the potential of the Internet applications is often underutilized. Efficient utilization of the web can be exploited when similar web pages are rigorously, exhaustively organized and clustered based on some domain knowledge (semantic-based) .Ontology which is a formal representation of domain knowledge aids in such efficient utilization. The performance of almost all the semantic-based clustering techniques depends on the constructed ontology, describing the domain knowledge . The proposed methodology provides an enhanced pronominal anaphora resolution, one of the key aspects of semantic analysis in Natural Language Processing for obtaining cross references within a web page providing better ontology construction. The experimental data sets exhibits better efficiency of the proposed method compared to earlier traditional algorithms.
