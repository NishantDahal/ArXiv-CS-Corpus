Average-Consensus Algorithms in a Deterministic Framework

We consider the average-consensus problem in a multi-node network of finite size. Communication between nodes is modeled by a sequence of directed signals with arbitrary communication delays. Four distributed algorithms that achieve average-consensus are proposed. Necessary and sufficient communication conditions are given for each algorithm to achieve average-consensus. Resource costs for each algorithm are derived based on the number of scalar values that are required for communication and storage at each node. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the empirical convergence rate of the four algorithms in comparison with a well-known "gossip" algorithm as well as a randomized information spreading algorithm when assuming a fully connected random graph with instantaneous communication.
