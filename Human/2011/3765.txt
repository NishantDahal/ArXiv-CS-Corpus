Long-Term Energy Constraints and Power Control in Cognitive Radio Networks

When a long-term energy constraint is imposed to a transmitter, the average energy-efficiency of a transmitter is, in general, not maximized by always transmitting. In a cognitive radio context, this means that a secondary link can re-exploit the non-used time-slots. In the case where the secondary link is imposed to generate no interference on the primary link, a relevant issue is therefore to know the fraction of time-slots available to the secondary transmitter, depending on the system parameters. On the other hand, if the secondary transmitter is modeled as a selfish and free player choosing its power control policy to maximize its average energy-efficiency, resulting primary and secondary signals are not necessarily orthogonal and studying the corresponding Stackelberg game is relevant to know the outcome of this interactive situation in terms of power control policies.
