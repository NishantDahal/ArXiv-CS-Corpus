An Event-driven Operator Model for Dynamic Simulation of Construction Machinery

Prediction and optimisation of a wheel loader's dynamic behaviour is a challenge due to tightly coupled, non-linear subsystems of different technical domains. Furthermore, a simulation regarding performance, efficiency, and operability cannot be limited to the machine itself, but has to include operator, environment, and work task. This paper presents some results of our approach to an event-driven simulation model of a human operator. Describing the task and the operator model independently of the machine's technical parameters, gives the possibility to change whole sub-system characteristics without compromising the relevance and validity of the simulation.
