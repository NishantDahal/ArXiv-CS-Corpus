Edge covering pseudo-outerplanar graphs with forests

A graph is called pseudo-outerplanar if each block has an embedding on the plane in such a way that the vertices lie on a fixed circle and the edges lie inside the disk of this circle with each of them crossing at most one another. In this paper, we prove that each pseudo-outerplanar graph admits edge decompositions into a linear forest and an outerplanar graph, or a star forest and an outerplanar graph, or two forests and a matching, or $\max\{Δ(G),4\}$ matchings, or $\max\{\lceilΔ(G)/2\rceil,3\}$ linear forests. These results generalize some ones on outerplanar graphs and $K_{2,3}$-minor-free graphs, since the class of pseudo-outerplanar graphs is a larger class than the one of $K_{2,3}$-minor-free graphs.
