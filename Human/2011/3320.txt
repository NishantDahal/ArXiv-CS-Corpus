A study of the singularity locus in the joint space of planar parallel manipulators: special focus on cusps and nodes

Cusps and nodes on plane sections of the singularity locus in the joint space of parallel manipulators play an important role in nonsingular assembly-mode changing motions. This paper analyses in detail such points, both in the joint space and in the workspace. It is shown that a cusp (resp. a node) defines a point of tangency (resp. a crossing point) in the workspace between the singular curves and the curves associated with the so-called characteristics surfaces. The study is conducted on a planar 3-RPR manipulator for illustrative purposes.
