SRS BUILDER 1.0: An Upper Type CASE Tool For Requirement Specification

Software (SW) development is a labor intensive activity. Modern software projects generally have to deal with producing and managing large and complex software products. Developing such software has become an extremely challenging job not only because of inherent complexity, but also mainly for economic constraints unlike time, quality, maintainability concerns. Hence, developing modern software within the budget still remains as one of the main software crisis. The most significant way to reduce the software development cost is to use the Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools over the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process as substitute to expensive human labor cost. We think that automation of software development methods is a valuable support for the software engineers in coping with this complexity and for improving quality too. This paper demonstrates the newly developed CASE tools name "SRS Builder 1.0" for software requirement specification developed at our university laboratory, University of North Bengal, India. This paper discusses our new developed product with its functionalities and usages. We believe the tool has the potential to play an important role in the software development process.
