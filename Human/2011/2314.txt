Relational Schema Protocol (RSP)

This document specifies the Relational Schema Protocol (RSP). RSP enables loosely coupled applications to share and exchange relational data. It defines fixed message format for an arbitrary relational schema so that the changes in the data schema do not affect the message format. This prevents the interacting applications from having to be reimplemented during the data schema evolvement.
