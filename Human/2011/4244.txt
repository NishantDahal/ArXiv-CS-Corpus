About a Discrete Cellular Soliton (computer simulation)

For the first time a mathematical object is presented - a reversible cellular Automaton - with many paradoxical qualities, the main ones among them are: a frequent quickly return to its original state, the presence of a large number of conservation laws and paradoxical "fuzzy" symmetries, which connects the current position of the automaton with its signature Main Integral.
