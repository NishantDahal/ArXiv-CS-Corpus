Optimal Self-Dual Z4-Codes and a Unimodular Lattice in Dimension 41

For lengths up to 47 except 37, we determine the largest minimum Euclidean weight among all Type I Z4-codes of that length. We also give the first example of an optimal odd unimodular lattice in dimension 41 explicitly, which is constructed from some Type I Z4-code of length 41.
