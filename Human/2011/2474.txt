Book review: Katy Börner, Atlas of Science: Visualizing What We Know. Cambridge, MA/ London UK: The MIT Press, 2010

Katy Börner has written a wonderful book about visualization that makes our field of scientometrics accessible to much larger audiences. The book is to be read in relation to the ongoing series of exhibitions entitled "Places & Spaces: Mapping Science" currently touring the world. The book also provides the scholarly background to the exhibitions. It celebrates scientometrics as the discipline in the background that enables us to visualize the evolution of knowledge as the acumen of human civilization.
