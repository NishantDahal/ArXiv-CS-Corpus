Towards Optimal Learning of Chain Graphs

In this paper, we extend Meek's conjecture (Meek 1997) from directed and acyclic graphs to chain graphs, and prove that the extended conjecture is true. Specifically, we prove that if a chain graph H is an independence map of the independence model induced by another chain graph G, then (i) G can be transformed into H by a sequence of directed and undirected edge additions and feasible splits and mergings, and (ii) after each operation in the sequence H remains an independence map of the independence model induced by G. Our result has the same important consequence for learning chain graphs from data as the proof of Meek's conjecture in (Chickering 2002) had for learning Bayesian networks from data: It makes it possible to develop efficient and asymptotically correct learning algorithms under mild assumptions.
