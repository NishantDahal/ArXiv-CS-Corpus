Restricted Parameter Range Promise Set Cover Problems Are Easy

Let $({\bf U},{\bf S},d)$ be an instance of Set Cover Problem, where ${\bf U}=\{u_1,...,u_n\}$ is a $n$ element ground set, ${\bf S}=\{S_1,...,S_m\}$ is a set of $m$ subsets of ${\bf U}$ satisfying $\bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i={\bf U}$ and $d$ is a positive integer. In STOC 1993 M. Bellare, S. Goldwasser, C. Lund and A. Russell proved the NP-hardness to distinguish the following two cases of ${\bf GapSetCover_η}$ for any constant $η> 1$. The Yes case is the instance for which there is an exact cover of size $d$ and the No case is the instance for which any cover of ${\bf U}$ from ${\bf S}$ has size at least $ηd$. This was improved by R. Raz and S. Safra in STOC 1997 about the NP-hardness for ${\bf GapSetCover}_{clogm}$ for some constant $c$. In this paper we prove that restricted parameter range subproblem is easy. For any given function of $n$ satisfying $η(n) \geq 1$, we give a polynomial time algorithm not depending on $η(n)$ to distinguish between
  {\bf YES:} The instance $({\bf U},{\bf S}, d)$ where $d>\frac{2 |{\bf S}|}{3η(n)-1}$, for which there exists an exact cover of size at most $d$;
  {\bf NO:} The instance $({\bf U},{\bf S}, d)$ where $d>\frac{2 |{\bf S}|}{3η(n)-1}$, for which any cover from ${\bf S}$ has size larger than $η(n) d$.
  The polynomial time reduction of this restricted parameter range set cover problem is constructed by using the lattice.
