Redundant Wavelets on Graphs and High Dimensional Data Clouds

In this paper, we propose a new redundant wavelet transform applicable to scalar functions defined on high dimensional coordinates, weighted graphs and networks. The proposed transform utilizes the distances between the given data points. We modify the filter-bank decomposition scheme of the redundant wavelet transform by adding in each decomposition level linear operators that reorder the approximation coefficients. These reordering operators are derived by organizing the tree-node features so as to shorten the path that passes through these points. We explore the use of the proposed transform to image denoising, and show that it achieves denoising results that are close to those obtained with the BM3D algorithm.
