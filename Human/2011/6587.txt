A Single Euler Number Feature for Multi-font Multi-size Kannada Numeral Recognition

In this paper a novel approach is proposed based on single Euler number feature which is free from thinning and size normalization for multi-font and multi-size Kannada numeral recognition system. A nearest neighbor classification is used for classification of Kannada numerals by considering the Euclidian distance. A total 1500 numeral images with different font sizes between (10..84) are tested for algorithm efficiency and the overall the classification accuracy is found to be 99.00% .The said method is thinning free, fast, and showed encouraging results on varying font styles and sizes of Kannada numerals.
