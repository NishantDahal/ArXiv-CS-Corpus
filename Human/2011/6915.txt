SLPA: Uncovering Overlapping Communities in Social Networks via A Speaker-listener Interaction Dynamic Process

Overlap is one of the characteristics of social networks, in which a person may belong to more than one social group. For this reason, discovering overlapping structures is necessary for realistic social analysis. In this paper, we present a novel, general framework to detect and analyze both individual overlapping nodes and entire communities. In this framework, nodes exchange labels according to dynamic interaction rules. A specific implementation called Speaker-listener Label Propagation Algorithm (SLPA1) demonstrates an excellent performance in identifying both overlapping nodes and overlapping communities with different degrees of diversity.
