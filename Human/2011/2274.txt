SENVM: Server Environment Monitoring and Controlling System for a Small Data Center Using Wireless Sensor Network

In recent years, efficient energy utilization becomes an essential requirement for data centers, especially in data centers of world-leading companies, where "Green Data Center" defines a new term for an environment-concerned data center. Solutions to change existing a data center to the green one may vary. In the big company, high-cost approaches including re-planning server rooms, changing air-conditioners, buying low-powered servers, and equipping sophisticating environmental control equipments are possible, but not for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and academic sectors which have limited budget. In this paper, we propose a novel system, SENVM, used to monitor and control air temperature in a server room to be in appropriate condition, not too cold, where very unnecessary cooling leads to unnecessary extra electricity expenses, and also inefficient in energy utilization. With implementing on an emerging technology, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Green Data Center is feasible to every small data center with no wiring installation, easy deployment, and low maintenance fee. In addition, the prototype of the system has been tested, and the first phase of the project is deployed in a real-world data center.
