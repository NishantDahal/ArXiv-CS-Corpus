Efficient Multicore Collaborative Filtering

This paper describes the solution method taken by LeBuSiShu team for track1 in ACM KDD CUP 2011 contest (resulting in the 5th place). We identified two main challenges: the unique item taxonomy characteristics as well as the large data set size.To handle the item taxonomy, we present a novel method called Matrix Factorization Item Taxonomy Regularization (MFITR). MFITR obtained the 2nd best prediction result out of more then ten implemented algorithms. For rapidly computing multiple solutions of various algorithms, we have implemented an open source parallel collaborative filtering library on top of the GraphLab machine learning framework. We report some preliminary performance results obtained using the BlackLight supercomputer.
