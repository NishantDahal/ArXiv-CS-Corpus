A Distributed Intrusion Detection System Using Cooperating Agents

The current intrusion detection systems have a number of problems that limit their configurability, scalability and efficiency. There have been some propositions about distributed architectures based on multiple independent agents working collectively for intrusion detection. However, these distributed intrusion detection systems are not fully distributed as most of them centrally analyze data collected from distributed nodes which may lead to a single point of failure. In this paper, a distributed intrusion detection architecture is presented that is based on autonomous and cooperating agents without any centralized analysis components. The agents cooperate by using a hierarchical communication of interests and data, and the analysis of intrusion data is made by the agents at the lowest level of the hierarchy. This architecture provides significant advantages in scalability, flexibility, extensibility, fault tolerance, and resistance to compromise. A proof-of-concept prototype is developed and experiments have been conducted on it. The results show the effectiveness of the system in detecting intrusive activities.
