Multiscale Modelling: A Mobile Membrane Approach

Nowadays, multiscale modelling is recognized as the most suitable way to study biological processes. Indeed, almost every phenomenon in nature exhibits a multiscale behaviour, i.e., it is the outcome of interactions that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. Although several ways to provide "multilayer" models have been proposed, only Complex Automata naturally embed spatial information and realize the multiscale approach with well-established inter-scale integration schemas. Recently, such approach has been restated in terms of Spatial P systems - a variant of P systems with a more geometric concept of space.
  In this work we discuss how mobile membranes, a variant of membrane systems inspired by the biological movements of endocytosis and exocytosis, can be efficaciously exploited to define a uniform multiscale coupling scheme relying only on the features of the formalism itself.
