Spreadsheet on Cloud -- Framework for Learning and Health Management System

Cloud Computing has caused a paradigm shift in the world of computing. Several use case scenarios have been floating around the programming world in relation to this. Applications such as Spreadsheets have the capability to use the Cloud framework to create complex web based applications. In our effort to do the same, we have proposed a Spreadsheet on the cloud as the framework for building new web applications, which will be useful in various scenarios, specifically a School administration system and governance scenarios, such as Health and Administration. This paper is a manifestation of this work, and contains some use cases and architectures which can be used to realize these scenarios in the most efficient manner.
