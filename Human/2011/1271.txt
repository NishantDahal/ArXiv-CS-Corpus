A New Localized Network Based Routing Model in Computer and Communication networks

In view of the fact that routing algorithms are network layer entities and the varying performance of any routing algorithm depends on the underlying networks. Localized routing algorithms avoid the problems associated with the maintenance of global network state by using statistics of flow blocking probabilities. We developed a new network parameter that can be used to predict which network topology gives better performance on the quality of localized QoS routing algorithms. Using this parameter we explore a simple model that can be rewired to introduce increasing the performance. We find that this model have small characteristic path length. Simulations of random and complex networks used to show that the performance is significantly affected by the level of connectivity.
