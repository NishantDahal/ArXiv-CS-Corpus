Saying HelloWorld with QVTR-XSLT - A Solution to the TTC 2011 Instructive Case

In this short paper we present our solution for the Hello World case study of the Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) 2011 using the QVTR-XSLT tool. The tool supports editing and execution of the graphical notation of QVT Relations language. The case study consists of a set of simple transformation tasks which covers the basic functions required for a transformation language, such as creating, reading/querying, updating and deleting of model elements. We design a transformation for each of the tasks.
