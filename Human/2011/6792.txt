Breaking a chaotic image encryption algorithm based on perceptron model

Recently, a chaotic image encryption algorithm based on perceptron model was proposed. The present paper analyzes security of the algorithm and finds that the equivalent secret key can be reconstructed with only one pair of known-plaintext/ciphertext, which is supported by both mathematical proof and experiment results. In addition, some other security defects are also reported.
