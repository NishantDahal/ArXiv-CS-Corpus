A Generalized Criterion for Signature-based Algorithms to Compute Gröbner Bases

A generalized criterion for signature-based algorithms to compute Gröbner bases is proposed in this paper. This criterion is named by "generalized criterion", because it can be specialized to almost all existing criteria for signature-based algorithms which include the famous F5 algorithm, F5C, extended F5, G$^2$V and the GVW algorithm. The main purpose of current paper is to study in theory which kind of criteria is correct in signature-based algorithms and provide a generalized method to develop new criteria. For this purpose, by studying some key facts and observations of signature-based algorithms, a generalized criterion is proposed. The generalized criterion only relies on a partial order defined on a set of polynomials. When specializing the partial order to appropriate specific orders, the generalized criterion can specialize to almost all existing criteria of signature-based algorithms. For {\em admissible} partial orders, a proof is presented for the correctness of the algorithm that is based on this generalized criterion. And the partial orders implied by the criteria of F5 and GVW are also shown to be admissible. More importantly, the generalized criterion provides an effective method to check whether a new criterion is correct as well as to develop new criteria for signature-based algorithms.
