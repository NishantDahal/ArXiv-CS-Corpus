Extending Bron Kerbosch for Solving the Maximum Weight Clique Problem

This contribution extends the Bron Kerbosch algorithm for solving the maximum weight clique problem, where continuous-valued weights are assigned to both, vertices and edges. We applied the proposed algorithm to graph matching problems.
