Off-Line Handwritten Signature Retrieval using Curvelet Transforms

In this paper, a new method for offline handwritten signature retrieval is based on curvelet transform is proposed. Many applications in image processing require similarity retrieval of an image from a large collection of images. In such cases, image indexing becomes important for efficient organization and retrieval of images. This paper addresses this issue in the context of a database of handwritten signature images and describes a system for similarity retrieval. The proposed system uses a curvelet based texture features extraction. The performance of the system has been tested with an image database of 180 signatures. The results obtained indicate that the proposed system is able to identify signatures with great with accuracy even when a part of a signature is missing.
