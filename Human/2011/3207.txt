Cognitive Binary Logic - The Natural Unified Formal Theory of Propositional Binary Logic

This paper presents a formal theory which describes propositional binary logic as a semantically closed formal language, and allows for syntactically and semantically well-formed formulae, formal proofs (demonstrability in Hilbertian acception), deduction (Gentzen's view of demonstrability), CNF-ization, and deconstruction to be expressed and tested in the same (computational) formal language, using the same data structure. It is also shown here that Cognitive Binary Logic is a self-described theory in which the Liar Paradox is deconstructed.
