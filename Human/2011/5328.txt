Optimization and Evaluation of a Multimedia Streaming Service on Hybrid Telco cloud

With recent developments in cloud computing, a paradigm shift from rather static deployment of resources to more dynamic, on-demand practices means more flexibility and better utilization of resources. This demands new ways to efficiently configure networks.
  In this paper, we will characterize a class of competitive cloud services that telecom operators could provide based on the characteristics of telecom infrastructure through an applicable streaming service architecture. Then, we will model this architecture as a cost-based mathematic model. This model provides a tool to evaluate and compare the cost of software services for different telecom network topologies and deployment strategies. Additionally, with each topology it acts as a means to characterize the deployment solution that yields the lowest resource usage over the entire network. These applications are illustrated through numerical analysis. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype is deployed to shows dynamic properties of the service in the architecture and the model above.
