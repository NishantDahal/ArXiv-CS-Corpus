UWB Array Design Using Variable Zo Technology and Central Force Optimization

This note applies Variable Zo technology to the design of an Ultra Wideband (UWB) Yagi-Uda array optimized using Central Force Optimization. Variable Zo is a novel and proprietary approach to antenna design and optimization that treats the feed system characteristic impedance, Zo, as a design variable instead of a fixed design parameter as is traditionally done. Variable Zo is applicable to any antenna design or optimization methodology, and using it will generally produce better antenna designs across any user-specified set of performance objectives.
