Reasoning about Minimal Belief and Negation as Failure

We investigate the problem of reasoning in the propositional    fragment of MBNF, the logic of minimal belief and negation as failure    introduced by Lifschitz, which can be considered as a unifying    framework for several nonmonotonic formalisms, including default    logic, autoepistemic logic, circumscription, epistemic queries, and    logic programming.  We characterize the complexity and provide    algorithms for reasoning in propositional MBNF.  In particular, we    show that entailment in propositional MBNF lies at the third level of    the polynomial hierarchy, hence it is harder than reasoning in all the    above mentioned propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning.    We also prove the exact correspondence between negation as failure in    MBNF and negative introspection in Moore's autoepistemic logic.
