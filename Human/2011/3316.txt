Open-loop multi-channel inversion of room impulse response

This paper considers methods for audio display in a CAVE-type virtual reality theater, a 3 m cube with displays covering all six rigid faces. Headphones are possible since the user's headgear continuously measures ear positions, but loudspeakers are preferable since they enhance the sense of total immersion. The proposed solution consists of open-loop acoustic point control. The transfer function, a matrix of room frequency responses from the loudspeakers to the ears of the user, is inverted using multi-channel inversion methods, to create exactly the desired sound field at the user's ears. The inverse transfer function is constructed from impulse responses simulated by the image source method. This technique is validated by measuring a 2x2 matrix transfer function, simulating a transfer function with the same geometry, and filtering the measured transfer function through the inverse of the simulation. Since accuracy of the image source method decreases with time, inversion performance is improved by windowing the simulated response prior to inversion. Parameters of the simulation and inversion are adjusted to minimize residual reverberant energy; the best-case dereverberation ratio is 10 dB.
