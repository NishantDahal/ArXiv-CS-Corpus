MIS-Boost: Multiple Instance Selection Boosting

In this paper, we present a new multiple instance learning (MIL) method, called MIS-Boost, which learns discriminative instance prototypes by explicit instance selection in a boosting framework. Unlike previous instance selection based MIL methods, we do not restrict the prototypes to a discrete set of training instances but allow them to take arbitrary values in the instance feature space. We also do not restrict the total number of prototypes and the number of selected-instances per bag; these quantities are completely data-driven. We show that MIS-Boost outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods on a number of benchmark datasets. We also apply MIS-Boost to large-scale image classification, where we show that the automatically selected prototypes map to visually meaningful image regions.
