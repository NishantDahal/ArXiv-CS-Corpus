In this paper the researchers have focused on the modernization of E- Pedagogy vis-a-vis the traditional method of learning. They have highlighted the effectiveness of using the E- learning elements and various E- Methods. This work has used the decision tree algorithms particularly Classifiers.trees.J48 The obtained results show that using online examination attribute plays major role in increasing the average grade of the class in higher education. The novelty of this work is that the researchers have focused on the teaching methodology used by the faculty members and the tools available in the universities.
