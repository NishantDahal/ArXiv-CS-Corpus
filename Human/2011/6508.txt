A New IRIS Normalization Process For Recognition System With Cryptographic Techniques

Biometric technologies are the foundation of personal identification systems. It provides an identification based on a unique feature possessed by the individual. This paper provides a walkthrough for image acquisition, segmentation, normalization, feature extraction and matching based on the Human Iris imaging. A Canny Edge Detection scheme and a Circular Hough Transform, is used to detect the iris boundaries in the eye's digital image. The extracted IRIS region was normalized by using Image Registration technique. A phase correlation base method is used for this iris image registration purpose. The features of the iris region is encoded by convolving the normalized iris region with 2D Gabor filter. Hamming distance measurement is used to compare the quantized vectors and authenticate the users. To improve the security, Reed-Solomon technique is employed directly to encrypt and decrypt the data. Experimental results show that our system is quite effective and provides encouraging performance. Keywords: Biometric, Iris Recognition, Phase correlation, cryptography, Reed-Solomon
