Elementary Components of the Quadratic Assignment Problem

The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that is at the core of many real-world optimization problems. We prove that QAP can be written as the sum of three elementary landscapes when the swap neighborhood is used. We present a closed formula for each of the three elementary components and we compute bounds for the autocorrelation coefficient.
