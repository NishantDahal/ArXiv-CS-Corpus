The Axiomatic Foundation of Space in GFO

Space and time are basic categories of any top-level ontology. They are fundamental assumptions for the mode of existence of those individuals which are said to be in space and time. In the present paper the ontology of space in the General Formal Ontology (GFO) is expounded. This ontology is represented as a theory BT (Brentano Theory), which is specified by a set of axioms formalized in first-order logic. This theory uses four primitive relations: SReg(x) (x is space region), spart(x, y) (x is spatial part of y), sb(x, y) (x is spatial boundary of y), and scoinc(x, y) (x and y spatially coincide). This ontology is inspired by ideas of Franz Brentano. The investigation and exploration of Franz Brentano's ideas on space and time began about twenty years ago by work of R.M. Chisholm, B. Smith and A. Varzi. The present paper takes up this line of research and makes a further step in establishing an ontology of space which is based on rigorous logical methods and on principles of the new philosophical approach of integrative realism.
