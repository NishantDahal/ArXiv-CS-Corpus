Quantum Private Information Retrieval with Sublinear Communication Complexity

This note presents a quantum protocol for private information retrieval, in the single-server case and with information-theoretical privacy, that has O(\sqrt{n})-qubit communication complexity, where n denotes the size of the database. In comparison, it is known that any classical protocol must use Î©(n) bits of communication in this setting.
