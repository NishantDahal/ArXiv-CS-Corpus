IT Security Plan for Flight Simulation Program

Information security is one of the most important aspects of technology, we cannot protect the best interests of our organizations' assets (be that personnel, data, or other resources), without ensuring that these assetsare protected to the best of their ability. Within the Defense Department, this is vital to the security of not just those assets but also the national security of the United States. Compromise insecurity could lead severe consequences. However, technology changes so rapidly that change has to be made to reflect these changes with security in mind. This article outlines a growing technological change (virtualization and cloud computing), and how to properly address IT security concerns within an operating environment. By leveraging a series of encrypted physical and virtual systems, andnetwork isolation measures, this paper delivered a secured high performance computing environment that efficiently utilized computing resources, reduced overall computer processing costs, and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems within the operating environment.
