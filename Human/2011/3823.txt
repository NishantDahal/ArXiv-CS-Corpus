Impact of Mobility On QoS of Mobile WiMax Network With CBR Application

The issue of mobility is important in wireless network because internet connectivity can only be effective if it's available during the movement of node. To enhance mobility, wireless access systems are designed such as IEEE 802.16e to operate on the move without any disruption of services. In this paper we are analyzing the impact of mobility on the QoS parameters (Throughput, Average Jitter and Average end to end Delay) of a mobile WiMAX network (IEEE 802.16e) with CBR application.
