A Step towards an Easy Interconversion of Various Number Systems

Any system that is used for naming or representing numbers is a number system, also known as numeral system. The modern civilization is familiar with decimal number system using ten digits. However digital devices and computers use binary number system instead of decimal number system, using only two digits namely, 0 and 1 based on the fundamental concept of the decimal number system. Various other number systems also used this fundamental concept of decimal number system, for example octal system and hexadecimal number systems using eight and sixteen digits respectively. The knowledge of number systems and their inter conversion is essential for understanding of computers. More over, successful programming for digital devices requires a precise understanding of data formats, number systems and their inter conversion. The inter conversion (a process in which things are each converted into the other) of number system requires allot of time and techniques to expertise. In this paper the interconversion of four most common number systems is taken under the consideration in tabulated form. It is a step towards the easy interconversion of theses number systems to understand as well as memorise it. The four number systems are binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal.
