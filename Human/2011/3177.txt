A Framework for Enabling Distributed Applications on the Internet

The last five years have seen the rapid rise in popularity of what we term internet distributed applications (IDAs). These are internet applications with which many users interact simultaneously. IDAs range from P2P file-sharing applications, to collaborative distributed computing projects, to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Currently, there is no framework that combines IDAs collectively within a single context. We provide a basis for such a framework here.
  In considering IDAs collectively, we found that there was no generic description that had been applied to them as a group. We have therefore put forward such a description here. In our description, IDAs are functionality separated into three logic layers, which are designed and built individually. Each layer is represented by functionality on the software client running on each participating computer, which together comprise the overall IDA.
  The core contribution of this work is a framework, called the Internet Distributed Application Framework (IDAF), which outlines how IDAs can be designed, built and run. The IDAF outlines a set of constraints that each implementing software system must abide by. To verify the IDAF, we have built a system prototype implementation called the Internet Distributed Application System (IDAS). The IDAS includes an implementation of the IDAF layer model, which specifies IDAs are built. The IDAS also includes a generic software client that is capable of simultaneously running and managing arbitrary IDAs. We provide sample IDAs and demonstrations to verify both that the IDAF is implementable and that the IDAS is a workable usable system.
