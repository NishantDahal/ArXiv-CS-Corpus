Analysis of Kak's Quantum Cryptography Protocol from the Perspective of Source Strength

This paper analyzes the performance of Kak's quantum cryptography protocol when intensity monitoring is used to detect the presence of Eve during transmission. Some difficulties related to interception to obtain useful data from the transmission are discussed. The analysis shows the resilience of the protocol towards the man-in-the-middle attack.
