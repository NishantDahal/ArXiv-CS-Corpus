Future Robotics Database Management System along with Cloud TPS

This paper deals with memory management issues of robotics. In our proposal we break one of the major issues in creating humanoid. . Database issue is the complicated thing in robotics schema design here in our proposal we suggest new concept called NOSQL database for the effective data retrieval, so that the humanoid robots will get the massive thinking ability in searching each items using chained instructions. For query transactions in robotics we need an effective consistency transactions so by using latest technology called CloudTPS which guarantees full ACID properties so that the robot can make their queries using multi-item transactions through this we obtain data consistency in data retrievals. In addition we included map reduce concepts it can splits the job to the respective workers so that it can process the data in a parallel way.
