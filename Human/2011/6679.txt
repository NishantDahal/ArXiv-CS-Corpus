Application of PSO, Artificial Bee Colony and Bacterial Foraging Optimization algorithms to economic load dispatch: An analysis

This paper illustrates successful implementation of three evolutionary algorithms, namely- Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithms to economic load dispatch problem (ELD). Power output of each generating unit and optimum fuel cost obtained using all three algorithms have been compared. The results obtained show that ABC and BFO algorithms converge to optimal fuel cost with reduced computational time when compared to PSO for the two example problems considered.
