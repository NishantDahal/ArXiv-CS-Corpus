A Higher-Order Cheeger's Inequality

A basic fact in algebraic graph theory is that the number of connected components in an undirected graph is equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 1 in the normalized adjacency matrix of the graph. In particular, the graph is disconnected if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues equal to 1.
  Cheeger's inequality provides an "approximate" version of the latter fact, and it states that a graph has a sparse cut (it is "almost disconnected") if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues that are close to one.
  It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher multiplicities, that is there are $k$ eigenvalues close to 1 if and only if the vertex set can be partitioned into $k$ subsets, each defining a sparse cut. In this paper we resolve this conjecture. Our result provides a theoretical justification for clustering algorithms that use the top $k$ eigenvector to embed the vertices into $\R^k$, and then apply geometric considerations to the embedding.
