In this digital age organizations depend upon the technologies to provide customer-centric solutions by understanding well about their customers' behaviour and continuously improving business process of the organization. Business intelligence (BI) applications will play a vital role at this stage by discovering the knowledge hidden in internal as well as external sources. On the other hand, Knowledge Management (KM) will enhance the organisations performance by providing collaborative tools to learn, create and share the knowledge among the employees. The main intention of the BI is to enhance the employees' knowledge with information that allows them to make decisions to achieve its organisational strategies. However only twenty percent of data exist in structured form, majority of banks knowledge is in unstructured or minds of its employees. Organizations are needed to integrate KM with Knowledge which is discovered from data and information.
