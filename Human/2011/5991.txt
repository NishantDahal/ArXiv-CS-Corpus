Memristors can implement fuzzy logic

In our work we propose implementing fuzzy logic using memristors. Min and max operations are done by antipodally configured memristor circuits that may be assembled into computational circuits. We discuss computational power of such circuits with respect to m-efficiency and experimentally observed behavior of memristive devices. Circuits implemented with real devices are likely to manifest learning behavior. The circuits presented in the work may be applicable for instance in fuzzy classifiers.
