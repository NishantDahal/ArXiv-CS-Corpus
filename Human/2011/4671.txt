Efficient Algorithms to Enhance Recovery Schema in Link State Protocols

With the increasing demands for real-time applications traffic in net- works such as video and voice a high convergence time for the existing routing protocols when failure occurred is required. These applications can be very sensitive to packet loss when link/node goes down. In this paper, we propose two algorithms schemas for the link state protocol to reroute the traffic in two states; first, pre-calculated an alternative and disjoint path with the primary one from the source to the destination by re-routing traffic through it, regardless of the locations of failure and the number of failed links. Second, rerouting the traffic via an alternative path from a node whose local link is down without the need to wait until the source node knows about the failure. This is achieved by creating a new backup routing table based on the original routing table which is computed by the dijkstra algorithm. The goal of these algorithms is to reduce loss of packets, end-to-end delay time, improve throughput and avoiding local loop when nodes re-converge the topology in case of failure.
