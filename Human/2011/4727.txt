Estudo de Viabilidade de uma Plataforma de Baixo Custo para Data Warehouse

Often corporations need tools to improve their decision making in a competitive market. In general, these tools are based on data warehouse platforms to mange and analyze large amounts of data. However, several of these corporations do not have enough resources to buy such platforms because of the high cost. This work is dedicated to a feasibility study of a low cost platform to data warehouse. We consider as a low cost platform the use of open source software like the PostgreSQL database system and the GNU/Linux operational system. We verify the feasibility of this platform by executing two benchmarks that simulate a data warehouse workload. The workload reproduces a multi-user environment with the execution of complex queries, which executes: aggregations, nested sub queries, multi joins, in-line views and more. Considering the results we were able to highlight some problems on the PostgreSQL database system, and discuss improvements in the context of data warehouse.
