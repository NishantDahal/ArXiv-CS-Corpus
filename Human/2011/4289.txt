Modification of GTD from Flat File Format to OLAP for Data Mining

This document is part of original research work by the authors in a bid to explore new fields for applying Data Mining Techniques. The sample data is part of a large data set from University of Maryland (UMD) and outlines how more meaningful patterns can be discovered by preprocessing the data in the form of OLAP cubes.
