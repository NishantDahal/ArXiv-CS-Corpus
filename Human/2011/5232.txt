Linking Search Space Structure, Run-Time Dynamics, and Problem Difficulty: A Step Toward Demystifying Tabu Search

Tabu search is one of the most effective heuristics for locating high-quality solutions to a diverse array of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite the widespread success of tabu search, researchers have a poor understanding of many key theoretical aspects of this algorithm, including models of the high-level run-time dynamics and identification of those search space features that influence problem  difficulty. We consider these questions in the context of the job-shop  scheduling problem (JSP), a domain where tabu search algorithms have  been shown to be remarkably effective. Previously, we demonstrated  that the mean distance between random local optima and the nearest  optimal solution is highly correlated with problem difficulty for a  well-known tabu search algorithm for the JSP introduced by Taillard. In this paper, we discuss various shortcomings of this measure and  develop a new model of problem difficulty that corrects these deficiencies. We show that Taillards algorithm can be modeled  with high fidelity as a simple variant of a straightforward random  walk. The random walk model accounts for nearly all of the variability in the cost required to locate both optimal and sub-optimal solutions to random JSPs, and provides an explanation for differences in the difficulty of random versus structured JSPs. Finally, we discuss and  empirically substantiate two novel predictions regarding tabu search  algorithm behavior. First, the method for constructing the initial solution is  highly unlikely to impact the performance of tabu search. Second, tabu  tenure should be selected to be as small as possible while simultaneously  avoiding search stagnation; values larger than necessary lead to  significant degradations in performance.
