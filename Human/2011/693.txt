Number representation using generalized $(-β)$-transformation

We study non-standard number systems with negative base $-β$. Instead of the Ito-Sadahiro definition, based on the transformation $T_{-β}$ of the interval $\big[-\fracβ{β+1},\frac{1}{β+1}\big)$ into itself, we suggest a generalization using an interval $[l,l+1)$ with $l\in(-1,0]$. Such generalization may eliminate certain disadvantages of the Ito-Sadahiro system. We focus on the description of admissible digit strings and their periodicity.
