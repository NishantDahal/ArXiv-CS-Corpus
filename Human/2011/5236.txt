An Efficient Paging Algorithm for Multi-Carrier CDMA System

To cope with the increasing demand of wireless communication services multi-carrier systems are being used. Radio resources are very limited and efficient usages of these resources are inevitable to get optimum performance of the system. Paging channel is a low-bandwidth channel and one of the most important channels on which system performance depends significantly. Therefore it is vulnerable to even moderate overloads. In this paper, an efficient paging algorithm, Concurrent Search, is proposed for efficient use of paging channel in Multi- carrier CDMA system instead of existing sequential searching algorithm. It is shown by the simulation that the paging performance in proposed algorithm is far better than the existing system.
