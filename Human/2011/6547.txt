Solving the TTC 2011 Compiler Optimization Case with GrGen.NET

The challenge of the Compiler Optimization Case is to perform local optimizations and instruction selection on the graph-based intermediate representation of a compiler. The case is designed to compare participating tools regarding their performance. We tackle this task employing the general purpose graph rewrite system GrGen.NET (www.grgen.net).
