Committee-Based Sample Selection for Probabilistic Classifiers

In many real-world learning tasks, it is expensive to    acquire a sufficient number of labeled examples for training.  This    paper investigates methods for reducing annotation cost by `sample    selection'. In this approach, during training the learning program    examines many unlabeled examples and selects for labeling only those    that are most informative at each stage. This avoids redundantly    labeling examples that contribute little new information.       Our work follows on previous research on Query By Committee, extending    the committee-based paradigm to the context of probabilistic    classification.  We describe a family of empirical methods for    committee-based sample selection in probabilistic classification    models, which evaluate the informativeness of an example by measuring    the degree of disagreement between several model variants.  These    variants (the committee) are drawn randomly from a probability    distribution conditioned by the training set labeled so far.       The method was applied to the real-world natural language processing    task of stochastic part-of-speech tagging.  We find that all variants    of the method achieve a significant reduction in annotation cost,    although their computational efficiency differs.  In particular, the    simplest variant, a two member committee with no parameters to tune,    gives excellent results.  We also show that sample selection yields a    significant reduction in the size of the model used by the tagger.
