On the Simulation of Adaptive Measurements via Postselection

In this note we address the question of whether any any quantum computational model that allows adaptive measurements can be simulated by a model that allows postselected measurements. We argue in the favor of this question and prove that adaptive measurements can be simulated by postselection. We also discuss some potentially stunning consequences of this result such as the ability to solve #P problems.
