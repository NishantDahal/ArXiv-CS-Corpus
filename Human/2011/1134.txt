Defeating Internet attacks and Spam using "disposable" Mobile IPv6 home addresses

We propose a model of operation for next generation wireless Internet, in which a mobile host has hundreds of "disposable" Mobile IPv6 home addresses. Each correspondent is distributed a different disposable home address. If attacked on a given home address, the mobile user can block packets to that address and become unreachable to the attacker. Blocking one address does not affect other addresses. Other correspondents can still reach the mobile host. A new home address can also be requested via e-mail, instant messaging, or directly from the target host using a protocol that we develop. This model is especially useful against battery exhausting Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and CPU exhausting distributed DoS attacks, since it seems to be the only viable solution, currently. We show however that this model can also be used to defeat other attacks and also to stop spam.
