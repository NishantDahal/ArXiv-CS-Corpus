A protocol for a message system for the tiles of the heptagrid, in the hyperbolic plane

This paper introduces a communication system for the tiles of the heptagrid, a tiling of the hyperbolic plane. The method can be extended to other tilings of this plane. The paper focuses on an actual implementation at the programming stage with a short account of two experiments.
