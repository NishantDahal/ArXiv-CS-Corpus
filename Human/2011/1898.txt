Multi-representation d'une ontologie : OWL, bases de donnees, syst√®mes de types et d'objets

Due to the emergence of the semantic Web and the increasing need to formalize human knowledge, ontologie engineering is now an important activity. But is this activity very different from other ones like software engineering, for example ? In this paper, we investigate analogies between ontologies on one hand, types, objects and data bases on the other one, taking into account the notion of evolution of an ontology. We represent a unique ontology using different paradigms, and observe that the distance between these different concepts is small. We deduce from this constatation that ontologies and more specifically ontology description languages can take advantage of beeing fertilizated with some other computer science domains and inherit important characteristics as modularity, for example.
