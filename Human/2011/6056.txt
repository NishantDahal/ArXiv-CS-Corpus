The matrices of argumentation frameworks

We introduce matrix and its block to the Dung's theory of argumentation frameworks. It is showed that each argumentation framework has a matrix representation, and the common extension-based semantics of argumentation framework can be characterized by blocks of matrix and their relations. In contrast with traditional method of directed graph, the matrix way has the advantage of computability. Therefore, it has an extensive perspective to bring the theory of matrix into the research of argumentation frameworks and related areas.
