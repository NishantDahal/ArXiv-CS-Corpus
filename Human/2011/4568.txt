Attacks on Local Searching Tools

The Google Desktop Search is an indexing tool, currently in beta testing, designed to allow users fast, intuitive, searching for local files. The principle interface is provided through a local web server which supports an interface similar to Google.com's normal web page. Indexing of local files occurs when the system is idle, and understands a number of common file types. A optional feature is that Google Desktop can integrate a short summary of a local search results with Google.com web searches. This summary includes 30-40 character snippets of local files. We have uncovered a vulnerability that would release private local data to an unauthorized remote entity. Using two different attacks, we expose the small snippets of private local data to a remote third party.
