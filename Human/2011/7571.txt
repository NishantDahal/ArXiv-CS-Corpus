The Feedback Arc Set Problem with Triangle Inequality is a Vertex Cover Problem

We consider the (precedence constrained) Minimum Feedback Arc Set problem with triangle inequalities on the weights, which finds important applications in problems of ranking with inconsistent information. We present a surprising structural insight showing that the problem is a special case of the minimum vertex cover in hypergraphs with edges of size at most 3. This result leads to combinatorial approximation algorithms for the problem and opens the road to studying the problem as a vertex cover problem.
