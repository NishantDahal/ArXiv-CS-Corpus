Homological Error Correcting Codes and Systolic Geometry

In my masters thesis I prove a square root bound on the distance of homological codes that come from two dimensional surfaces, as a result of the systolic inequality. I also give a detailed version of M.H. Freedman's proof that due to systolic freedom, this bound does not hold in higher dimensions.
