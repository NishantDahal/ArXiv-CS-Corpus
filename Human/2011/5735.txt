New Zealand involvement in Radio Astronomical VLBI Image Processing

With the establishment of the AUT University 12m radio telescope at Warkworth, New Zealand has now become a part of the international Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) community. A major product of VLBI observations are images in the radio domain of astronomical objects such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Using large geographical separations between radio antennas, very high angular resolution can be achieved. Detailed images can be created using the technique of VLBI Earth Rotation Aperture Synthesis. We review the current process of VLBI radio imaging. In addition we model VLBI configurations using the Warkworth telescope, AuScope (a new array of three 12m antennas in Australia) and the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) array currently under construction in Western Australia, and discuss how the configuration of these arrays affects the quality of images. Recent imaging results that demonstrate the modeled improvements from inclusion of the AUT and first ASKAP telescope in the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) are presented.
