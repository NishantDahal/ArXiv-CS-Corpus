Swarmrobot.org - Open-hardware Microrobotic Project for Large-scale Artificial Swarms

The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the open-hardware microrobotic project swarmrobot.org and the platform Jasmine for building large-scale artificial swarms. The project targets an open development of cost-effective hardware and software for a quick implementation of swarm behavior with real robots. Detailed instructions for making the robot, open-source simulator, software libraries and multiple publications about performed experiments are ready for download and intend to facilitate exploration of collective and emergent phenomena, guided self-organization and swarm robotics in experimental way.
