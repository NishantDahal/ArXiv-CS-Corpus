Gas turbine diagnostic system

The creation of the systems models is very actual at present time, because it allow to simulate the work of some complex equipment without any additional spends. The given model of gas turbine is allowed to test and optimize the software for gas turbine automation systems, study station personal, like operators and engineers and will be useful for diagnostics and prediction tasks to analyze the efficiency of the gas turbine.
