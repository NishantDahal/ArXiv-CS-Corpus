Logical Modelling of Physarum Polycephalum

We propose a novel model of unconventional computing where a structural part of computation is presented by dynamics of plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, a large single cell. We sketch a new logical approach combining conventional logic with process calculus to demonstrate how to employ formal methods in design of unconventional computing media presented by Physarum polycephalum.
