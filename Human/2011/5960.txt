Multiple ant-bee colony optimization for load balancing in packet-switched networks

One of the important issues in computer networks is "Load Balancing" which leads to efficient use of the network resources. To achieve a balanced network it is necessary to find different routes between the source and destination. In the current paper we propose a new approach to find different routes using swarm intelligence techniques and multi colony algorithms. In the proposed algorithm that is an improved version of MACO algorithm, we use different colonies of ants and bees and appoint these colony members as intelligent agents to monitor the network and update the routing information. The survey includes comparison and critiques of MACO. The simulation results show a tangible improvement in the aforementioned approach.
