On the correlation between bibliometric indicators and peer review: Reply to Opthof and Leydesdorff

Opthof and Leydesdorff [arXiv:1102.2569] reanalyze data reported by Van Raan [arXiv:physics/0511206] and conclude that there is no significant correlation between on the one hand average citation scores measured using the CPP/FCSm indicator and on the other hand the quality judgment of peers. We point out that Opthof and Leydesdorff draw their conclusions based on a very limited amount of data. We also criticize the statistical methodology used by Opthof and Leydesdorff. Using a larger amount of data and a more appropriate statistical methodology, we do find a significant correlation between the CPP/FCSm indicator and peer judgment.
