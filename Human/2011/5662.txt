A more appropriate Protein Classification using Data Mining

Research in bioinformatics is a complex phenomenon as it overlaps two knowledge domains, namely, biological and computer sciences. This paper has tried to introduce an efficient data mining approach for classifying proteins into some useful groups by representing them in hierarchy tree structure. There are several techniques used to classify proteins but most of them had few drawbacks on their grouping. Among them the most efficient grouping technique is used by PSIMAP. Even though PSIMAP (Protein Structural Interactome Map) technique was successful to incorporate most of the protein but it fails to classify the scale free property proteins. Our technique overcomes this drawback and successfully maps all the protein in different groups, including the scale free property proteins failed to group by PSIMAP. Our approach selects the six major attributes of protein: a) Structure comparison b) Sequence Comparison c) Connectivity d) Cluster Index e) Interactivity f) Taxonomic to group the protein from the databank by generating a hierarchal tree structure. The proposed approach calculates the degree (probability) of similarity of each protein newly entered in the system against of existing proteins in the system by using probability theorem on each six properties of proteins.
