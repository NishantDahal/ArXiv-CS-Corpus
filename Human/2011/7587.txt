Clipping Noise Cancellation for OFDM and OFDMA Systems Using Compressed Sensing

In this paper, we propose clipping noise cancellation scheme using compressed sensing (CS) for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In the proposed scheme, only the data tones with high reliability are exploited in reconstructing the clipping noise instead of the whole data tones. For reconstructing the clipping noise using a fraction of the data tones at the receiver, the CS technique is applied. The proposed scheme is also applicable to interleaved orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems due to the decomposition of fast Fourier transform (FFT) structure. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme performs well for clipping noise cancellation of both OFDM and OFDMA systems.
