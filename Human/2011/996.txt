Strong Secrecy on the Binary Erasure Wiretap Channel Using Large-Girth LDPC Codes

For an arbitrary degree distribution pair (DDP), we construct a sequence of low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles with girth growing logarithmically in block-length using Ramanujan graphs. When the DDP has minimum left degree at least three, we show using density evolution analysis that the expected bit-error probability of these ensembles, when passed through a binary erasure channel with erasure probability $ε$, decays as $\mathcal{O}(\exp(-c_1 n^{c_2}))$ with the block-length $n$ for positive constants $c_1$ and $c_2$, as long as $ε$ is lesser than the erasure threshold $ε_\mathrm{th}$ of the DDP. This guarantees that the coset coding scheme using the dual sequence provides strong secrecy over the binary erasure wiretap channel for erasure probabilities greater than $1 - ε_\mathrm{th}$.
