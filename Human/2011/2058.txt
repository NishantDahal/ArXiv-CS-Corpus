Performance evaluation of FD-SOI Mosfets for different metal gate work function

Fully depleted (FD) Silicon on Insulator (SOI) metal oxide Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) Is the Leading Contender for Sun 65nm Regime. This paper presents a study of effects of work functions of metal gate on the performance of FD-SOI MOSFET. Sentaurus TCAD simulation tool is used to investigate the effect of work function of gates ont he performance FDSOI MOSFET. Specific channel length of the device that had been concentrated is 25nm. From simulation we observed that by changing the work function of the metal gates of FD-SOI MOSFET we can change the threshold voltage.  Hence by using this technique we can set the appropriate threshold voltage of FD-SOI MOSFET at same voltage and we can decrease the leakage current, gate tunneling current and short channel effects and increase drive current.
