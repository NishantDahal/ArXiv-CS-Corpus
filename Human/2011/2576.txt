Brain-like infrastructure for embedded SoC diagnosis

This article describes high-speed multiprocessor architecture for the concurrent analyzing information represented in analytic, graph- and table forms of associative relations to search, recognize and make a decision in n-dimensional vector discrete space. Vector-logical process models of actual applications,for which the quality of solution is estimated by the proposed integral non-arithmetical metric of the interaction between Boolean vectors, are described.
