Swiss Elections to the National Council: First trials with e-voting in elections at federal level

On October 23rd 2011, around 22'000 voters will be authorized to cast their votes electronically in occasion of the elections to the National Council. These are the first trials ever with e-voting in elections at federal level in Switzerland. Four cantons are going to conduct trials with this new channel. Only Swiss voters living abroad will be authorized to participate. The Swiss Confederation pursues the long term goal of the introduction of e-voting as a third, complementary voting method - in addition to voting in person at the polling station and postal voting.
