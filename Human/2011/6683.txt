Beating the Landauer's limit by trading energy with uncertainty

According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors in the next 10-15 years the limits imposed by the physics of switch operation will be the major roadblock for future scaling of the CMOS technology. Among these limits the most fundamental is represented by the so-called Shannon-von Neumann-Landauer limit that sets a lower bound to the minimum heat dissipated per bit erasing operation. Here we show that in a nanoscale switch, operated at finite temperature T, this limit can be beaten by trading the dissipated energy with the uncertainty in the distinguishability of switch logic states. We establish a general relation between the minimum required energy and the maximum error rate in the switch operation and briefly discuss the potential applications in the design of future switches.
