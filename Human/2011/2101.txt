Reconciling long-term cultural diversity and short-term collective social behavior

An outstanding open problem is whether collective social phenomena occurring over short timescales can systematically reduce cultural heterogeneity in the long run, and whether offline and online human interactions contribute differently to the process. Theoretical models suggest that short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity are mutually excluding, since they require very different levels of social influence. The latter jointly depends on two factors: the topology of the underlying social network and the overlap between individuals in multidimensional cultural space. However, while the empirical properties of social networks are well understood, little is known about the large-scale organization of real societies in cultural space, so that random input specifications are necessarily used in models. Here we use a large dataset to perform a high-dimensional analysis of the scientific beliefs of thousands of Europeans. We find that inter-opinion correlations determine a nontrivial ultrametric hierarchy of individuals in cultural space, a result unaccessible to one-dimensional analyses and in striking contrast with random assumptions. When empirical data are used as inputs in models, we find that ultrametricity has strong and counterintuitive effects, especially in the extreme case of long-range online-like interactions bypassing social ties. On short time-scales, it strongly facilitates a symmetry-breaking phase transition triggering coordinated social behavior. On long time-scales, it severely suppresses cultural convergence by restricting it within disjoint groups. We therefore find that, remarkably, the empirical distribution of individuals in cultural space appears to optimize the coexistence of short-term collective behavior and long-term cultural diversity, which can be realized simultaneously for the same moderate level of mutual influence.
