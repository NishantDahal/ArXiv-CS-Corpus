Each normal logic program has a 2-valued Minimal Hypotheses semantics

In this paper we explore a unifying approach --- that of hypotheses assumption --- as a means to provide a semantics for all Normal Logic Programs (NLPs), the Minimal Hypotheses (MH) semantics. This semantics takes a positive hypotheses assumption approach as a means to guarantee the desirable properties of model existence, relevance and cumulativity, and of generalizing the Stable Models in the process. To do so we first introduce the fundamental semantic concept of minimality of assumed positive hypotheses, define the MH semantics, and analyze the semantics' properties and applicability. Indeed, abductive Logic Programming can be conceptually captured by a strategy centered on the assumption of abducibles (or hypotheses). Likewise, the Argumentation perspective of Logic Programs also lends itself to an arguments (or hypotheses) assumption approach. Previous works on Abduction have depicted the atoms of default negated literals in NLPs as abducibles, i.e., assumable hypotheses. We take a complementary and more general view than these works to NLP semantics by employing positive hypotheses instead.
