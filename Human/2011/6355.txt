Controlling Communication Field of Complex Networks by Transformation Method

Controlling the global statuses of a network by its local dynamic parameters is an important issue, and it is difficult to obtain the direct solution for. The transformation method, which is originally used to control physical field by designing material parameters, is proposed to obtain the necessary local dynamic parameters when the global statuses of a network system are prescribed in a space. The feasibility of this transformation method is demonstrated and verified by two examples (a communication field cloak and a communication field bender) in the network system. It is shown that the global system state can be controlled by adjusting the local nodes dynamics with the transformation method. Simulation results also show that the transformation method provides a powerful, intuitive and direct way for the global statuses controlling of network systems.
