HD0L-$ω$-equivalence and periodicity problems in the primitive case (to the memory of G. Rauzy)

In this paper I would like to witness the mathematical inventiveness of G. Rauzy through personnal exchanges I had with him. The objects that will emerge will be used to treat the decidability of the HD 0 L $ω$-equivalence and periodicity problems in the primitive case.
