Streaming Multimedia Information Using the Features of the DVB-S Card

This paper presents a study of audio-video streaming using the additional possibilities of a DVB-S card. The board used for experiments (Technisat SkyStar 2) is one of the most frequently used cards for this purpose. Using the main blocks of the board's software support it is possible the implement a really useful and full functional system for audio-video streaming. The streaming is possible to be implemented either for decoded MPEG stream or for transport stream. In this last case it is possible to view not only a program, but any program from the same multiplex. This allows us to implement
