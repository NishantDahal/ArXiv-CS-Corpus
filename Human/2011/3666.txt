An Anonymous Authentication and Communication Protocol for Wireless Mesh Networks

Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a key technology for next generation wireless broadband networks showing rapid progress and inspiring numerous compelling applications. A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers (MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone through the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and communicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the involvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in WMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to support real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust, reliable and efficient communication protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end latency and packet drops. Design of a secure and efficient communication protocol for WMNs, therefore, is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a security and privacy protocol that provides security and user anonymity while maintaining communication efficiency in a WMN. The security protocol ensures secure authentication and encryption in access and the backbone networks. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is achieved by application of a protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that while the protocols have minimal storage and communication overhead, they are robust and provide high level of security and privacy to the users of the network services.
