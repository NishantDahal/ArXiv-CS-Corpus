Smoothing and Modeling of Video Transmission Rates over a QoS Network with Limited Bandwidth Connections

Transmission of video over a limited bandwidth network is challenging due to the natural variability of video, and link characteristics. Video smoothing techniques can be used to facilitate more effective transmission and to preserve better quality. In this paper we develop a semi-optimal video smoothing approach to manage the transmission of MPEG-4 and H.264 video while mapping it to be more suitable for a QoS based network. The proposed technique utilizes a smoothing buffer with pre-defined thresholds to smooth the transmission rates while assuming minimal information about the video to be transmitted. The results obtained showed a significant improvements in transmission rate variability while guaranteeing no buffer overflows or underflows. In addition, a queuing model is developed for the used smoothing algorithm for H.264 video streams with optimized encoding and packetization, utilizing the available H.264 macroblock ordering option.
