Grounding the Lexical Semantics of Verbs in Visual Perception using Force Dynamics and Event Logic

This paper presents an implemented system for recognizing    the occurrence of events described by simple spatial-motion verbs in    short image sequences. The semantics of these verbs is specified with    event-logic expressions that describe changes in the state of    force-dynamic relations between the participants of the event.  An    efficient finite representation is introduced for the infinite sets of    intervals that occur when describing liquid and semi-liquid events.    Additionally, an efficient procedure using this representation is    presented for inferring occurrences of compound events, described with    event-logic expressions, from occurrences of primitive events.  Using    force dynamics and event logic to specify the lexical semantics of    events allows the system to be more robust than prior systems based on    motion profile.
