BRIDGE: A Model for Modern Software Development Process to Cater the Present Software Crisis

As hardware components are becoming cheaper and powerful day by day, the expected services from modern software are increasing like any thing. Developing such software has become extremely challenging. Not only the complexity, but also the developing of such software within the time constraints and budget has become the real challenge. Quality concern and maintainability are added flavour to the challenge. On stream, the requirements of the clients are changing so frequently that it has become extremely tough to manage these changes. More often, the clients are unhappy with the end product. Large, complex software projects are notoriously late to market, often exhibit quality problems, and don't always deliver on promised functionality. None of the existing models are helpful to cater the modern software crisis. Hence, a better modern software development process model to handle with the present software crisis is badly needed. This paper suggests a new software development process model, BRIDGE, to tackle present software crisis.
