Applying whole system design in a sportscar factory

Basing on a paper which explores the adoption of a whole system approach to a more sustainable and innovative design, the present paper wants to apply the same approach to a real case, inside of a famous Italian sportscar factory. A case study in this factory was developed and decodified gaining improved understanding of whole system design and those factors that substantially influence its success. All the factors mentioned above (such as dynamics of flattened hierarchy, the need to identify relationship between parts of the system) are used, into the application presented in this paper, to achieve an ultimate optimization of the whole.
