Dimension Reduction of Health Data Clustering

The current data tends to be more complex than conventional data and need dimension reduction. Dimension reduction is important in cluster analysis and creates a smaller data in volume and has the same analytical results as the original representation. A clustering process needs data reduction to obtain an efficient processing time while clustering and mitigate curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a model for extracting multidimensional data clustering of health database. We implemented four dimension reduction techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self Organizing Map (SOM) and FastICA. The results show that dimension reductions significantly reduce dimension and shorten processing time and also increased performance of cluster in several health datasets.
