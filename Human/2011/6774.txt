Design and Validation of Safety Cruise Control System for Automobiles

In light of the recent humongous growth of the human population worldwide, there has also been a voluminous and uncontrolled growth of vehicles, which has consequently increased the number of road accidents to a large extent. In lieu of a solution to the above mentioned issue, our system is an attempt to mitigate the same using synchronous programming language. The aim is to develop a safety crash warning system that will address the rear end crashes and also take over the controlling of the vehicle when the threat is at a very high level. Adapting according to the environmental conditions is also a prominent feature of the system. Safety System provides warnings to drivers to assist in avoiding rear-end crashes with other vehicles. Initially the system provides a low level alarm and as the severity of the threat increases the level of warnings or alerts also rises. At the highest level of threat, the system enters in a Cruise Control Mode, wherein the system controls the speed of the vehicle by controlling the engine throttle and if permitted, the brake system of the vehicle. We focus on this crash area as it has a very high percentage of the crash-related fatalities. To prove the feasibility, robustness and reliability of the system, we have also proved some of the properties of the system using temporal logic along with a reference implementation in ESTEREL. To bolster the same, we have formally verified various properties of the system along with their proofs.
