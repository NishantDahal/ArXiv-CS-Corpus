Computing with Logic as Operator Elimination: The ToyElim System

A prototype system is described whose core functionality is, based on propositional logic, the elimination of second-order operators, such as Boolean quantifiers and operators for projection, forgetting and circumscription. This approach allows to express many representational and computational tasks in knowledge representation - for example computation of abductive explanations and models with respect to logic programming semantics - in a uniform operational system, backed by a uniform classical semantic framework.
