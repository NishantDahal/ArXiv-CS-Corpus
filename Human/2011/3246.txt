The MathScheme Library: Some Preliminary Experiments

We present some of the experiments we have performed to best test our design for a library for MathScheme, the mechanized mathematics software system we are building. We wish for our library design to use and reflect, as much as possible, the mathematical structure present in the objects which populate the library.
