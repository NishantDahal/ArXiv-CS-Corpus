Autómatas celulares elementales aplicados a la encriptación de datos

For data ciphering a key is usually needed as a base, so it is indispensable to have one that is strong and trustworthy, so as to keep others from accessing the ciphered data. This requires a pseudo-random number generator that would provide such a key, so it is proposed to work with cellular automata helped along with \emph{Mathematica} to check that the rules and to what level are actually pseudo-random. This project centers on the examination of possible mathematical rules, analyzing their characteristics in a detailed manner, and submitting them to a set of randomness tests with the end of knowing which of them will enable us to obtain those pseudo-random numbers that will conform the key for data ciphering.
