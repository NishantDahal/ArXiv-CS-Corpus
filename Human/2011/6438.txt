Sampling, Filtering and Sparse Approximations on Combinatorial Graphs

In this paper we address sampling and approximation of functions on combinatorial graphs. We develop filtering on graphs by using Schr√∂dinger's group of operators generated by combinatorial Laplace operator. Then we construct a sampling theory by proving Poincare and Plancherel-Polya-type inequalities for functions on graphs. These results lead to a theory of sparse approximations on graphs and have potential applications to filtering, denoising, data dimension reduction, image processing, image compression, computer graphics, visualization and learning theory.
