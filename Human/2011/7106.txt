Characterization of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences with fixed 3-error or 4-error linear complexity

The linear complexity and the $k$-error linear complexity of a sequence have been used as important security measures for key stream sequence strength in linear feedback shift register design. By using the sieve method of combinatorics, the $k$-error linear complexity distribution of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences is investigated based on Games-Chan algorithm.
  First, for $k=2,3$, the complete counting functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences with linear complexity less than $2^n$ are characterized. Second, for $k=3,4$, the complete counting functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences with linear complexity $2^n$ are presented. Third, for $k=4,5$, the complete counting functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences with linear complexity less than $2^n$ are derived. As a consequence of these results, the counting functions for the number of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences with the 3-error linear complexity are obtained, and the complete counting functions on the 4-error linear complexity of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences are obvious.
