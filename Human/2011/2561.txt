An improved mathematical model of social group competition

An improved mathematical model of social group competition is proposed. The utility obtained by a member of a certain group from each other member is assumed to be group size-dependent. Obtained results are close to available census data. It is shown that a significant fraction of population can be affiliated in a group with lower maximal specific utility.
