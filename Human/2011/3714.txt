Some Non-Classical Approaches to the Branderburger-Keisler Paradox

In this paper, we discuss a well-known self-referential paradox in foundational game theory, the Brandenburger - Keisler paradox. We approach the paradox from two different perspectives: non-well-founded set theory and paraconsistent logic. We show that the paradox persists in both frameworks for category theoretical reasons, but, with different properties.
