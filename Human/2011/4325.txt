An Experimental Comparison of PMSPrune and Other Algorithms for Motif Search

Extracting meaningful patterns from voluminous amount of biological data is a very big challenge. Motifs are biological patterns of great interest to biologists. Many different versions of the motif finding problem have been identified by researchers. Examples include the Planted $(l, d)$ Motif version, those based on position-specific score matrices, etc. A comparative study of the various motif search algorithms is very important for several reasons. For example, we could identify the strengths and weaknesses of each. As a result, we might be able to devise hybrids that will perform better than the individual components. In this paper we (either directly or indirectly) compare the performance of PMSprune (an algorithm based on the $(l, d)$ motif model) and several other algorithms in terms of seven measures and using well established benchmarks
  In this paper, we (directly or indirectly) compare the quality of motifs predicted by PMSprune and 14 other algorithms. We have employed several benchmark datasets including the one used by Tompa, et.al. These comparisons show that the performance of PMSprune is competitive when compared to the other 14 algorithms tested.
  We have compared (directly or indirectly) the performance of PMSprune and 14 other algorithms using the Benchmark dataset provided by Tompa, et.al. It is observed that both PMSprune and DME (an algorithm based on position-specific score matrices) in general perform better than the 13 algorithms reported in Tompa et. al.. Subsequently we have compared PMSprune and DME on other benchmark data sets including ChIP-Chip, ChIP-seq, and ABS. Between PMSprune and DME, PMSprune performs better than DME on six measures. DME performs better than PMSprune on one measure (namely, specificity).
