Multi-Modal Local Sensing and Communication for Collective Underwater Systems

This paper is devoted to local sensing and communication for collective underwater systems used in networked and swarm modes. It is demonstrated that a specific combination of modal and sub-modal communication, used simultaneously for robot-robot and robot-object detection, can create a dedicated cooperation between multiple AUVs. These technologies, platforms and experiments are shortly described, and allow us to make a conclusion about useful combinations of different signaling approaches for collective underwater systems.
