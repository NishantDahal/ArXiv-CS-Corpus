Enhancing LTE-Advanced Relay Deployments via Relay Cell Extension

Relaying is a promising enhancement to current radio access networks. Relay enhanced LTE-Advanced networks are expected to fulfill the demanding coverage and capacity requirements in a cost-efficient way. However, due to low transmit power, the coverage areas of the relay nodes will be small. Therefore, the performance of relay deployments may be limited by load imbalances. In this study, we present a practical solution for this problem by introducing a bias to cell selection and handover decisions along with a reduction in eNB transmit power. This method results in an extension of the relay cells and an appropriate load balance can then be achieved. Moreover, it is shown that a proper power control setting is necessary in the uplink and that power control optimization can further enhance the system performance. Comprehensive system level simulations confirm that the proposed solution yields significant user throughput gains both in the uplink and the downlink.
