A Generalized Continuous Model for Random Markets

A generalized continuous economic model is proposed for random markets. In this model, agents interact by pairs and exchange their money in a random way. A parameter controls the effectiveness of the transactions between the agents. We show in a rigorous way that this type of markets reach their asymptotic equilibrium on the exponential wealth distribution.
