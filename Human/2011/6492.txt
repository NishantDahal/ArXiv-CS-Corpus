A New Round Robin Based Scheduling Algorithm for Operating Systems: Dynamic Quantum Using the Mean Average

Round Robin, considered as the most widely adopted CPU scheduling algorithm, undergoes severe problems directly related to quantum size. If time quantum chosen is too large, the response time of the processes is considered too high. On the other hand, if this quantum is too small, it increases the overhead of the CPU. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called AN, based on a new approach called dynamic-time-quantum; the idea of this approach is to make the operating systems adjusts the time quantum according to the burst time of the set of waiting processes in the ready queue. Based on the simulations and experiments, we show that the new proposed algorithm solves the fixed time quantum problem and increases the performance of Round Robin.
