TrackMeNot: Enhancing the privacy of Web Search

Most search engines can potentially infer the preferences and interests of a user based on her history of search queries. While search engines can use these inferences for a variety of tasks, including targeted advertisements, such tasks do impose an serious threat to user privacy. In 2006, after AOL disclosed the search queries of 650,000 users, TrackMeNot was released as a simple browser extension that sought to hide user search preferences in a cloud of queries. The first versions of TrackMeNot, though used extensively in the past three years, was fairly simplistic in design and did not provide any strong privacy guarantees. In this paper, we present the new design and implementation of TrackMeNot, which address many of the limitations of the first release. TrackMeNot addresses two basic problems. First, using a model for characterizing search queries, TrackMeNot provides a mechanism for obfuscating the search preferences of a user from a search engine. Second, TrackMeNot prevents the leakage of information revealing the use of obfuscation to a search engine via several potential side channels in existing browsers such as clicks, cookies etc. Finally, we show that TrackMeNot cannot be detected by current search bot detection mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of TrackMeNot in obfuscating user interests by testing its efficiency on a major search engine.
