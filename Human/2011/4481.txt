Combinatorics on words in information security: Unavoidable regularities in the construction of multicollision attacks on iterated hash functions

Classically in combinatorics on words one studies unavoidable regularities that appear in sufficiently long strings of symbols over a fixed size alphabet. In this paper we take another viewpoint and focus on combinatorial properties of long words in which the number of occurrences of any symbol is restritced by a fixed constant. We then demonstrate the connection  of these properties to constructing multicollision attacks on so called generalized iterated hash functions.
