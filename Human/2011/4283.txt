A prototype of a knowledge-based programming environment

In this paper we present a proposal for a knowledge-based programming environment. In such an environment, declarative background knowledge, procedures, and concrete data are represented in suitable languages and combined in a flexible manner. This leads to a highly declarative programming style. We illustrate our approach on an example and report about our prototype implementation.
