One Dimensional p-adic Integral Value Transformations

In this paper, a set of transformations T^(p,k) is defined on N_0^K to N_0. Some basic and na√Øve mathematical structure of T^(p,1) are adumbrated and introduced the concept of discrete dynamical systems through IVTs. Latterly, some further research scope of IVTs is highlighted.
