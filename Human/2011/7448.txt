Multiuser Cellular Network

Modern radio communication is faced with a problem about how to distribute restricted frequency to users in a certain space. Since our task is to minimize the number of repeaters, a natural idea is enlarging coverage area. However, coverage has restrictions. First, service area has to be divided economically as repeater's coverage is limited. In this paper, our fundamental method is to adopt seamless cellular network division. Second, underlying physics content in frequency distribution problem is interference between two close frequencies. Consequently, we choose a proper frequency width of 0.1MHz and a relevantly reliable setting to apply one frequency several times.
  We make a few general assumptions to simplify real situation. For instance, immobile users yield to homogenous distribution; repeaters can receive and transmit information in any given frequency in duplex operation; coverage is mainly decided by antenna height.
  Two models are built up to solve 1000 users and 10000 users situations respectively. In order to utilize restricted frequency and PL code, three stratified terms - "cell", "cluster", "group" - are introduced to describe the models in detail. Under our analysis, 91 repeaters for 1000 users and 469 repeaters for 10000 users are viable results.
  Next, to test stability and sensitivity of models, we give total consideration to the variation of sum of users, antenna height, and frequency width and service radius. Evaluation about models is offered qualitatively. Finally, two practical cases are put forward to gain a partial knowledge of mountainous area. The brief method in dealing with mountains is classified discussion in two ideal conditions. It may provide some constructive suggestions to avoid shortcomings or take proper measures in similar locations.
