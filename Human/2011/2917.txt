On the classification of binary self-dual [44,22,8] codes with an automorphism of order 3 or 7

All binary self-dual [44,22,8] codes with an automorphism of order 3 or 7 are classified. In this way we complete the classification of extremal self-dual codes of length 44 having an automorphism of odd prime order.
