On the Throughput Capacity of Wireless Multi-hop Networks with ALOHA, Node Coloring and CSMA

We quantify the throughput capacity of wireless multi-hop networks with several medium access schemes. We analyze pure ALOHA scheme where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according to a uniform Poisson distribution and exclusion schemes where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according to an exclusion rule such as node coloring and carrier sense based schemes. We consider both no-fading and standard Rayleigh fading channel models. Our results show that, under no-fading, slotted ALOHA can achieve at least one-third (or half under Rayleigh fading) of the throughput capacity of node coloring scheme whereas carrier sense based scheme can achieve almost the same throughput capacity as node coloring.
