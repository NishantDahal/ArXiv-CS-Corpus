Knowledge Organization Research in the last two decades: 1988-2008

We apply an automatic topic mapping system to records of publications in knowledge organization published between 1988-2008. The data was collected from journals publishing articles in the KO field from Web of Science database (WoS). The results showed that while topics in the first decade (1988-1997) were more traditional, the second decade (1998-2008) was marked by a more technological orientation and by the appearance of more specialized topics driven by the pervasiveness of the Web environment.
