Dynamic OFDMA Resource Allocation for QoS Guarantee and System Optimization of Best Effort and Non Real-time Traffic

To achieve the requirement of high data rate, low latency, user fairness for next generation wireless networks, proper designing of cross-layer optimized dynamic resource allocation algorithm is prerequisite. In this paper, we propose a dynamic resource allocation scheme in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems to optimize the non real-time (NRT) traffic, which requires allocation of minimum quantum of data within a predefined time that does not incur packet loss. Most existing and proposed works on resource allocation schemes focused on traffic consisting of delay constraint real-time (RT) or delay-tolerant (NRT, Best-Effort (BE)) applications in a single scheme. In this work, we investigate the resource allocation problem in heterogeneous multiuser OFDMA system with the objective of optimizing the aggregate data delivery of NRT and BE traffic to maximize the overall system performance, by exploiting the inherent time-diversity gain in mobile wireless environment for delay-tolerant applications. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly enhances the system capacity, when compared to traditional proportional fair resource allocation algorithm.
