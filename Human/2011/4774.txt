Vision-Based Navigation II: Error Analysis for a Navigation Algorithm based on Optical-Flow and a Digital Terrain Map

The paper deals with the error analysis of a navigation algorithm that uses as input a sequence of images acquired by a moving camera and a Digital Terrain Map (DTM) of the region been imaged by the camera during the motion. The main sources of error are more or less straightforward to identify: camera resolution, structure of the observed terrain and DTM accuracy, field of view and camera trajectory. After characterizing and modeling these error sources in the framework of the CDTM algorithm, a closed form expression for their effect on the pose and motion errors of the camera can be found. The analytic expression provides a priori measurements for the accuracy in terms of the parameters mentioned above.
