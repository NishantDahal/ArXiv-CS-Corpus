Towards a Proof Theory of Gödel Modal Logics

Analytic proof calculi are introduced for box and diamond fragments of basic modal fuzzy logics that combine the Kripke semantics of modal logic K with the many-valued semantics of Gödel logic. The calculi are used to establish completeness and complexity results for these fragments.
