Efficient Traffic Control of VoD System

It has been a challenging issue to provide digital quality multimedia data stream to the remote user through the distributed system. The main aspects to design the real distributed system, which reduce the cost of the network by means of reduce packet loss and enhanced over all system performance. Since the number of user increased rapidly in the network it posed heavy load to the video servers. The requested clients, servers are all distributed in nature and the data stream delivered to the user without error. In this work I have presented the performance of the video on demand server by efficient traffic control at real time with respect to incoming multirate traffic pattern . In this work, I present how the overall system performance gradually decreases when the client population sized in the clusters increase. This work indicated the load balancing required for the on demand video distributed system to provide efficient cost effective service to the local or remote clients.
