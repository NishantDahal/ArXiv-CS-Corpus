The Limited Power of Powering: Polynomial Identity Testing and a Depth-four Lower Bound for the Permanent

Polynomial identity testing and arithmetic circuit lower bounds are two central questions in algebraic complexity theory. It is an intriguing fact that these questions are actually related. One of the authors of the present paper has recently proposed a "real τ-conjecture" which is inspired by this connection. The real τ-conjecture states that the number of real roots of a sum of products of sparse univariate polynomials should be polynomially bounded. It implies a superpolynomial lower bound on the size of arithmetic circuits computing the permanent polynomial. In this paper we show that the real τ-conjecture holds true for a restricted class of sums of products of sparse polynomials. This result yields lower bounds for a restricted class of depth-4 circuits: we show that polynomial size circuits from this class cannot compute the permanent, and we also give a deterministic polynomial identity testing algorithm for the same class of circuits.
