AIS-BN: An Adaptive Importance Sampling Algorithm for Evidential Reasoning in Large Bayesian Networks

Stochastic sampling algorithms, while an attractive alternative to    exact algorithms in very large Bayesian network models, have been    observed to perform poorly in evidential reasoning with extremely    unlikely evidence. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive    importance sampling algorithm, AIS-BN, that shows promising    convergence rates even under extreme conditions and seems to    outperform the existing sampling algorithms consistently. Three    sources of this performance improvement are (1) two heuristics for    initialization of the importance function that are based on the    theoretical properties of importance sampling in finite-dimensional    integrals and the structural advantages of Bayesian networks, (2) a    smooth learning method for the importance function, and (3) a dynamic    weighting function for combining samples from different stages of the    algorithm.       We tested the performance of the AIS-BN algorithm along with two state    of the art general purpose sampling algorithms, likelihood weighting    (Fung and Chang, 1989; Shachter and Peot, 1989) and self-importance    sampling (Shachter and Peot, 1989). We used in our tests three large    real Bayesian network models available to the scientific community:    the CPCS network (Pradhan et al., 1994), the PathFinder network    (Heckerman, Horvitz, and Nathwani, 1990), and the ANDES network (Conati,    Gertner, VanLehn, and Druzdzel, 1997), with evidence as unlikely as    10^-41. While the AIS-BN algorithm always performed better than the    other two algorithms, in the majority of the test cases it achieved    orders of magnitude improvement in precision of the results.    Improvement in speed given a desired precision is even more dramatic,    although we are unable to report numerical results here, as the other    algorithms almost never achieved the precision reached even by the    first few iterations of the AIS-BN algorithm.
