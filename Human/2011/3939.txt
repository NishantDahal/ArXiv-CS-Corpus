One dimensional Convolutional Goppa Codes over the projective line

We give a general method to construct MDS one-dimensional convolutional codes. Our method generalizes previous constructions of H. Gluesing-Luerssen and B. Langfeld. Moreover we give a classification of one-dimensional Convolutional Goppa Codes and propose a characterization of MDS codes of this type.
