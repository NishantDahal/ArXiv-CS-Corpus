Morphological Reconstruction for Word Level Script Identification

A line of a bilingual document page may contain text words in regional language and numerals in English. For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of such a document page, it is necessary to identify different script forms before running an individual OCR system. In this paper, we have identified a tool of morphological opening by reconstruction of an image in different directions and regional descriptors for script identification at word level, based on the observation that every text has a distinct visual appearance. The proposed system is developed for three Indian major bilingual documents, Kannada, Telugu and Devnagari containing English numerals. The nearest neighbour and k-nearest neighbour algorithms are applied to classify new word images. The proposed algorithm is tested on 2625 words with various font styles and sizes. The results obtained are quite encouraging
