Reducing Memory Cost of Exact Diagonalization using Singular Value Decomposition

We present a modified Lanczos algorithm to diagonalize lattice Hamiltonians with dramatically reduced memory requirements, {\em without restricting to variational ansatzes}. The lattice of size $N$ is partitioned into two subclusters. At each iteration the Lanczos vector is projected into two sets of $n_{\rm svd}$ smaller subcluster vectors using singular value decomposition. For low entanglement entropy $S_{ee}$, (satisfied by short range Hamiltonians), the truncation error is expected to vanish as $\exp(-n_{\rm svd}^{1/S_{ee}})$. Convergence is tested for the Heisenberg model on Kagom√© clusters of 24, 30 and 36 sites, with no lattice symmetries exploited, using less than 15GB of dynamical memory. Generalization of the Lanczos-SVD algorithm to multiple partitioning is discussed, and comparisons to other techniques are given.
