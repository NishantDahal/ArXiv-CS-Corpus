Dealing with large schema sets in mobile SOS-based applications

Although the adoption of OGC Web Services for server, desktop and web applications has been successful, its penetration in mobile devices has been slow. One of the main reasons is the performance problems associated with XML processing as it consumes a lot of memory and processing time, which are scarce resources in a mobile device. In this paper we propose an algorithm to generate efficient code for XML data binding for mobile SOS-based applications. The algorithm take advantage of the fact that individual implementations use only some portions of the standards' schemas, which allows the simplification of large XML schema sets in an application-specific manner by using a subset of XML instance files conforming to these schemas.
