Comprehensive online Atomic Database Management System (DBMS) with Highly Qualified Computing Capabilities

The intensive need of atomic data is expanding continuously in a wide variety of applications (e.g. fusion energy and astrophysics, laser-produced, plasma researches, and plasma processing).This paper will introduce our ongoing research work to build a comprehensive, complete, up-to-date, user friendly and online atomic Database Management System (DBMS) namely called AIMS by using SQLite (http://www.sqlite.org/about.html)(8). Programming language tools and techniques will not be covered here. The system allows the generation of various atomic data based on professional online atomic calculators. The ongoing work is a step forward to bring detailed atomic model accessible to a wide community of laboratory and astrophysical plasma diagnostics. AIMS is a professional worldwide tool for supporting several educational purposes and can be considered as a complementary database of IAEA atomic databases. Moreover, it will be an exceptional strategy of incorporating the output data of several atomic codes to external spectral models.
