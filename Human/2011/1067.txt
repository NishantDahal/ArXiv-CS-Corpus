Toward Functionality Oriented Programming

The concept of functionality oriented programming is proposed, and some of its aspects are discussed, such as: (1) implementation independent basic types and generic collection types; (2) syntax requirements and recommendations for implementation independence; (3) unified documentation and code; (4) cross-module interface; and (5) cross-language program making scheme. A prototype example is given to demonstrate functionality oriented programming.
