Semantic annotation of requirements for automatic UML class diagram generation

The increasing complexity of software engineering requires effective methods and tools to support requirements analysts' activities. While much of a company's knowledge can be found in text repositories, current content management systems have limited capabilities for structuring and interpreting documents. In this context, we propose a tool for transforming text documents describing users' requirements to an UML model. The presented tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic rules to generate an UML class diagram. The main contribution of our tool is to provide assistance to designers facilitating the transition from a textual description of user requirements to their UML diagrams based on GATE (General Architecture of Text) by formulating necessary rules that generate new semantic annotations.
