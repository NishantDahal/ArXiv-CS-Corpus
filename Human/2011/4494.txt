A Novel and Robust Evolution Algorithm for Optimizing Complicated Functions

In this paper, a novel mutation operator of differential evolution algorithm is proposed. A new algorithm called divergence differential evolution algorithm (DDEA) is developed by combining the new mutation operator with divergence operator and assimilation operator (divergence operator divides population, and, assimilation operator combines population), which can detect multiple solutions and robustness in noisy environment. The new algorithm is applied to optimize Michalewicz Function and to track changing of rain-induced-attenuation process. The results based on DDEA are compared with those based on Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA). It shows that DDEA algorithm gets better results than DEA does in the same premise. The new algorithm is significant for optimizing and tracking the characteristics of MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) channel at millimeter waves.
