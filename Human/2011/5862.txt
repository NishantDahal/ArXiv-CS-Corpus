Fuzzy Inference Systems Optimization

This paper compares various optimization methods for fuzzy inference system optimization. The optimization methods compared are genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing. When these techniques were implemented it was observed that the performance of each technique within the fuzzy inference system classification was context dependent.
