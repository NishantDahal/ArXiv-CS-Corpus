Memristor-based Synaptic Networks and Logical Operations Using In-Situ Computing

We present new computational building blocks based on memristive devices. These blocks, can be used to implement either supervised or unsupervised learning modules. This is achieved using a crosspoint architecture which is an efficient array implementation for nanoscale two-terminal memristive devices. Based on these blocks and an experimentally verified SPICE macromodel for the memristor, we demonstrate that firstly, the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) can be implemented by a single memristor device and secondly, a memristor-based competitive Hebbian learning through STDP using a $1\times 1000$ synaptic network. This is achieved by adjusting the memristor's conductance values (weights) as a function of the timing difference between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. These implementations have a number of shortcomings due to the memristor's characteristics such as memory decay, highly nonlinear switching behaviour as a function of applied voltage/current, and functional uniformity. These shortcomings can be addressed by utilising a mixed gates that can be used in conjunction with the analogue behaviour for biomimetic computation. The digital implementations in this paper use in-situ computational capability of the memristor.
