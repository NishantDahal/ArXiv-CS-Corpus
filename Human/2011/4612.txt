Privacy Preserving Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks

Privacy preservation is an important issue in today's context of extreme penetration of internet and mobile technologies. It is more important in the case of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) where collected data often requires in-network processing and collaborative computing. Researches in this area are mostly concentrated in applying data mining techniques to preserve the privacy content of the data. These techniques are mostly computationally expensive and not suitable for resource limited WSN nodes. In this paper, a scheme is developed to provide privacy preservation in a much simpler way with the help of a secure key management scheme and randomized data perturbation technique. We consider a scenario in which two or more parties owning confidential data need to share only for aggregation purpose to a third party, without revealing the content of the data. Through simulation results the efficacy of our scheme and compare the result with one of the established scheme [1].
