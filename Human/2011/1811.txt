Laminar Families and Metric Embeddings: Non-bipartite Maximum Matching Problem in the Semi-Streaming Model

In this paper, we study the non-bipartite maximum matching problem in the semi-streaming model. The maximum matching problem in the semi-streaming model has received a significant amount of attention lately. While the problem has been somewhat well solved for bipartite graphs, the known algorithms for non-bipartite graphs use $2^{\frac1ε}$ passes or $n^{\frac1ε}$ time to compute a $(1-ε)$ approximation. In this paper we provide the first FPTAS (polynomial in $n,\frac1ε$) for the problem which is efficient in both the running time and the number of passes. We also show that we can estimate the size of the matching in $O(\frac1ε)$ passes using slightly superlinear space.
  To achieve both results, we use the structural properties of the matching polytope such as the laminarity of the tight sets and total dual integrality. The algorithms are iterative, and are based on the fractional packing and covering framework. However the formulations herein require exponentially many variables or constraints. We use laminarity, metric embeddings and graph sparsification to reduce the space required by the algorithms in between and across the iterations. This is the first use of these ideas in the semi-streaming model to solve a combinatorial optimization problem.
