On Identity Testing of Tensors, Low-rank Recovery and Compressed Sensing

We study the problem of obtaining efficient, deterministic, black-box polynomial identity testing algorithms for depth-3 set-multilinear circuits (over arbitrary fields). This class of circuits has an efficient, deterministic, white-box polynomial identity testing algorithm (due to Raz and Shpilka), but has no known such black-box algorithm. We recast this problem as a question of finding a low-dimensional subspace H, spanned by rank 1 tensors, such that any non-zero tensor in the dual space ker(H) has high rank. We obtain explicit constructions of essentially optimal-size hitting sets for tensors of degree 2 (matrices), and obtain quasi-polynomial sized hitting sets for arbitrary tensors (but this second hitting set is less explicit).
  We also show connections to the task of performing low-rank recovery of matrices, which is studied in the field of compressed sensing. Low-rank recovery asks (say, over the reals) to recover a matrix M from few measurements, under the promise that M is rank <=r. We also give a formal connection between low-rank recovery and the task of sparse (vector) recovery: any sparse-recovery algorithm that exactly recovers vectors of length n and sparsity 2r, using m non-adaptive measurements, yields a low-rank recovery scheme for exactly recovering nxn matrices of rank <=r, making 2nm non-adaptive measurements. Furthermore, if the sparse-recovery algorithm runs in time τ, then the low-rank recovery algorithm runs in time O(rn^2+nτ). We obtain this reduction using linear-algebraic techniques, and not using convex optimization, which is more commonly seen in compressed sensing algorithms. By using a dual Reed-Solomon code, we are able to (deterministically) construct low-rank recovery schemes taking 4nr measurements over the reals, such that the measurements can be all rank-1 matrices, or all sparse matrices.
