OBDD-based Universal Planning for Synchronized Agents in Non-Deterministic Domains

Recently model checking representation and search techniques    were shown to be efficiently applicable to planning, in particular to    non-deterministic planning. Such planning approaches use Ordered    Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) to encode a planning domain as a    non-deterministic finite automaton and then apply fast algorithms from    model checking to search for a solution. OBDDs can effectively scale    and can provide universal plans for complex planning domains. We are    particularly interested in addressing the complexities arising in    non-deterministic, multi-agent domains.  In this article, we present    UMOP, a new universal OBDD-based planning framework for    non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. We introduce a new planning    domain description language, NADL, to specify non-deterministic,    multi-agent domains.  The language contributes the explicit definition    of controllable agents and uncontrollable environment agents. We    describe the syntax and semantics of NADL and show how to build an    efficient OBDD-based representation of an NADL description.  The UMOP    planning system uses NADL and different OBDD-based universal planning    algorithms. It includes the previously developed strong and strong    cyclic planning algorithms. In addition, we introduce our new    optimistic planning algorithm that relaxes optimality guarantees and    generates plausible universal plans in some domains where no strong    nor strong cyclic solution exists. We present empirical results    applying UMOP to domains ranging from deterministic and single-agent    with no environment actions to non-deterministic and multi-agent with    complex environment actions. UMOP is shown to be a rich and efficient    planning system.
