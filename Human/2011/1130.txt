Progress of concepts and processes in library information system: towards Library 2.0

The main principle of the Library 2.0 is in the fact that the information has to be spread from the library to the user and viceversa, to allow fast and permanent adaptation of the library services. Within the framework of the implementation of the "Departmental Plan of the Public Services Reading" by the "General Council of Moselle", the division of the public reading develops a departmental portal as main vector of the information with various users' profile. The context of this research work takes a part of a Master degree training Diploma in STI-Economic Intelligence (Nancy2 University), combining facets of R&D in a professional context at the "Conseil Général de la Moselle" in France.
