Basketball scoring in NBA games: an example of complexity

Scoring in a basketball game is a process highly dynamic and non-linear type. The level of NBA teams improve each season. They incorporate to their rosters the best players in the world. These and other mechanisms, make the scoring in the NBA basketball games be something exciting, where, on rare occasions, we really know what will be the result at the end of the game. We analyzed all the games of the 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10 NBA regular seasons (6150 games). We have studied the evolution of the scoring and the time intervals between points. These do not behave uniformly, but present more predictable areas. In turn, we have analyzed the scoring in the games regarding the differences in points. Exists different areas of behavior related with the scorea and each zone has a different nature. There are point that we can consider as tipping points. The presence of these critical points suggests that there are phase transitions where the dynamic scoring of the games varies significantly.
