Optimal Sensor Configurations for Rectangular Target Dectection

Optimal search strategies where targets are observed at several different angles are found. Targets are assumed to exhibit rectangular symmetry and have a uniformly-distributed orientation. By rectangular symmetry, it is meant that one side of a target is the mirror image of its opposite side. Finding an optimal solution is generally a hard problem. Fortunately, symmetry principles allow analytical and intuitive solutions to be found. One such optimal search strategy consists of choosing n angles evenly separated on the half-circle and leads to a lower bound of the probability of not detecting targets. As no prior knowledge of the target orientation is required, such search strategies are also robust, a desirable feature in search and detection missions.
