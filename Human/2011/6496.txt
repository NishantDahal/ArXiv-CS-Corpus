A Novel Approach for Periodic Assessment of Business Process Interoperability

Business collaboration networks provide collaborative organizations a favorable context for automated business process interoperability. This paper aims to present a novel approach for assessing interoperability of process driven services by considering the three main aspects of interoperation: potentiality, compatibility and operational performance. It presents also a software tool that supports the proposed assessment method. In addition to its capacity to track and control the evolution of interoperation degree in time, the proposed tool measures the required effort to reach a planned degree of interoperability. Public accounting of financial authority is given as an illustrative case study of interoperability monitoring in public collaboration network.
