2P-Med: Building a Personalization Platform for Mediation Systems

Nowadays, with the increasing number of integrated data sources, there is a real trend to personalize mediation systems to improve user satisfaction. To make these systems user sensitive, we propose a personalization platform called 2P-Med. 2P-Med allows personalizing any mediation system used in any domain following a cyclic process. The process includes building and managing adequate user profiles and sources profiles, content and quality matching, source selection, adapting the mediator responses to user preferences and handling user feedbacks. In this paper, we describe 2P-Med architecture and highlight its main functionalities. We also illustrate the operation of the platform through personalizing source selection in a travel planning assistant.
