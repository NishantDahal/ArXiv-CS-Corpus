Typed Operational Semantics for Dependent Record Types

Typed operational semantics is a method developed by H. Goguen to prove meta-theoretic properties of type systems. This paper studies the metatheory of a type system with dependent record types, using the approach of typed operational semantics. In particular, the metatheoretical properties we have proved include strong normalisation, Church-Rosser and subject reduction.
