Non-volatile Complementary Resistive Switch-based Content Addressable Memory

This paper presents a novel resistive-only Binary and Ternary Content Addressable Memory (B/TCAM) cell that consists of two Complementary Resistive Switches (CRSs). The operation of such a cell relies on a logic$\rightarrow$ON state transition that enables this novel CRS application.
