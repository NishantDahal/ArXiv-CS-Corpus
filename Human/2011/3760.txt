Jeux stochastiques et contrôle de puissance distribué

Transmitters of a multiple access channel are assumed to freely choose their power control strategy in order to be energy-efficient. We show that in a stochastic game framework, we can develop energy-efficient distributed control strategies which only require partial knowledge of the entire system. Achievable utility equilibrium region is characterized and based on time-sharing, an explicit power control strategy is proposed.
