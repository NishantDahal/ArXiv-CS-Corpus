Multi-variate Quickest Detection of Significant Change Process

The paper deals with a mathematical model of a surveillance system based on a net of sensors. The signals acquired by each node of the net are Markovian process, have two different transition probabilities, which depends on the presence or absence of an intruder nearby. The detection of the transition probability change at one node should be confirmed by a detection of similar change at some other sensors. Based on a simple game the model of a fusion center is then constructed. The aggregate function defined on the net is the background of the definition of a non-cooperative stopping game which is a model of the multivariate disorder detection.
