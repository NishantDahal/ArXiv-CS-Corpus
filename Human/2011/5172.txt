Comparative performance analysis of multi dynamic time quantum Round Robin(MDTQRR) algorithm with arrival time

CPU being considered a primary computer resource, its scheduling is central to operating-system design. A thorough performance evaluation of various scheduling algorithms manifests that Round Robin Algorithm is considered as optimal in time shared environment because the static time is equally shared among the processes. We have proposed an efficient technique in the process scheduling algorithm by using dynamic time quantum in Round Robin. Our approach is based on the calculation of time quantum twice in single round robin cycle. Taking into consideration the arrival time, we implement the algorithm. Experimental analysis shows better performance of this improved algorithm over the Round Robin algorithm and the Shortest Remaining Burst Round Robin algorithm. It minimizes the overall number of context switches, average waiting time and average turn-around time. Consequently the throughput and CPU utilization is better.
