Design of Thin-Film-Transistor (TFT) arrays using current mirror circuits for Flat Panel Detectors (FPDs)

We designed 4x4 matrix TFTs arrays using current mirror amplifiers. Advantages of current mirror amplifiers are they need less requiring switches and the conversion time is short. The TFTs arrays 4x4 matrix using current mirror circuits have been fabricated and tested with success. The TFTs array directly can process signals coming from 16 pixels in the same node. This enables us to make the summation of the light intensities of close pixels during a reading.
