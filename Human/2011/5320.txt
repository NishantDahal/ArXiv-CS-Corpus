An Empirical Study and Analysis of the Dynamic Load Balancing Techniques Used in Parallel Computing Systems

A parallel computer system is a collection of processing elements that communicate and cooperate to solve large computational problems efficiently. To achieve this, at first the large computational problem is partitioned into several tasks with different work-loads and then are assigned to the different processing elements for computation. Distribution of the work load is known as Load Balancing. An appropriate distribution of work-loads across the various processing elements is very important as disproportional workloads can eliminate the performance benefit of parallelizing the job. Hence, load balancing on parallel systems is a critical and challenging activity. Load balancing algorithms can be broadly categorized as static or dynamic. Static load balancing algorithms distribute the tasks to processing elements at compile time, while dynamic algorithms bind tasks to processing elements at run time. This paper explains only the different dynamic load balancing techniques in brief used in parallel systems and concluding with the comparative performance analysis result of these algorithms.
