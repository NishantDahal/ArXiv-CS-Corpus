Proceedings Sixth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta-languages: Theory and Practice

This volume constitutes the proceedings of LFMTP 2011, the Sixth International Workshop on Logical Frameworks and Meta-languages: Theory and Practice. The LFMTP workshop series brings together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss varied aspects of the structure of logical frameworks and meta-languages that impinge on their use in representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. LFMTP 2011 was held on August 26, 2011 in Nijmegen, Netherlands, as a workshop associated with ITP 2011, the Second International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving. Its program consisted of contributed and invited presentations and was integrated with that of MLPA 11, the Third Workshop on Modules and Libraries for Proof Assistants. This proceedings contains only the contributed papers that were accepted for presentation at the workshop. Each of these papers was accepted based on the reviews of three members of the program committee. Authors were subsequently given the opportunity to revise their submissions based on the comments provided by the reviewers and the feedback obtained during their presentations at the workshop.
