Difference Sequence Compression of Multidimensional Databases

The multidimensional databases often use compression techniques in order to decrease the size of the database. This paper introduces a new method called difference sequence compression. Under some conditions, this new technique is able to create a smaller size multidimensional database than others like single count header compression, logical position compression or base-offset compression. Keywords: compression, multidimensional database, On-line Analytical Processing, OLAP.
