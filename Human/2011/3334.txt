Python GUI Scripting Interface for Running Atomic Physics Applications

We create a Python GUI scripting interface working under Windows in addition to (UNIX/Linux). The GUI has been built around the Python open-source programming language. We use the Python's GUI library that so called Python Mega Widgets (PMW) and based on Tkinter Python module (http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/tutgui.htm). The new GUI was motivated primarily by the desire of more updated operations, more flexibility incorporating future and current improvements in producing atomic data. Furthermore it will be useful for a variety of applications of atomic physics, plasma physics and astrophysics and will help in calculating various atomic properties.
