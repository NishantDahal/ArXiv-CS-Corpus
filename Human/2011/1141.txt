Mining User Comment Activity for Detecting Forum Spammers in YouTube

Research shows that comment spamming (comments which are unsolicited, unrelated, abusive, hateful, commercial advertisements etc) in online discussion forums has become a common phenomenon in Web 2.0 applications and there is a strong need to counter or combat comment spamming. We present a method to automatically detect comment spammer in YouTube (largest and a popular video sharing website) forums. The proposed technique is based on mining comment activity log of a user and extracting patterns (such as time interval between subsequent comments, presence of exactly same comment across multiple unrelated videos) indicating spam behavior. We perform empirical analysis on data crawled from YouTube and demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for the task of comment spammer detection.
