PSA: The Packet Scheduling Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks

The main cause of wasted energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is packet collision. The packet scheduling algorithm is therefore introduced to solve this problem. Some packet scheduling algorithms can also influence and delay the data transmitting in the real-time wireless sensor networks. This paper presents the packet scheduling algorithm (PSA) in order to reduce the packet congestion in MAC layer leading to reduce the overall of packet collision in the system The PSA is compared with the simple CSMA/CA and other approaches using network topology benchmarks in mathematical method. The performances of our PSA are better than the standard (CSMA/CA). The PSA produces better throughput than other algorithms. On other hand, the average delay of PSA is higher than previous works. However, the PSA utilizes the channel better than all algorithms.
