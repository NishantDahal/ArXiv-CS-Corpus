An algorithm for determining copositive matrices

In this paper, we present an algorithm of simple exponential growth called COPOMATRIX for determining the copositivity of a real symmetric matrix. The core of this algorithm is a decomposition theorem, which is used to deal with simplicial subdivision of $\hat{T}^{-}=\{y\in Δ_{m}| β^Ty\leq 0\}$ on the standard simplex $Δ_m$, where each component of the vector $β$ is -1, 0 or 1.
