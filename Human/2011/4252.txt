Optimizing Network Topology to Reduce Aggregate Traffic in Systems of Mobile Robots

Systems of networked mobile robots, such as unmanned aerial or  ground vehicles, will play important roles in future military and  commercial applications. The communications for such systems will  typically be over wireless links and may require that the robots  form an ad hoc network and communicate on a peer-to-peer basis. In  this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing the network  topology to minimize the total traffic in a network required to  support a given set of data flows under constraints on the amount of  movement possible at each mobile robot. In this paper, we consider a subclass of this problem in which the initial and final topologies  are trees, and the movement restrictions are given in terms of  the number of edges in the graph that must be traversed. We develop  algorithms to optimize the network topology while maintaining  network connectivity during the topology reconfiguration process.  Our topology reconfiguration algorithm uses the concept of prefix  labelling and routing to move nodes through the network while  maintaining network connectivity. We develop two algorithms to  determine the final network topology: an optimal, but  computationally complex algorithm, and a greedy suboptimal algorithm  that has much lower complexity. We present simulation results to  compare the performance of these algorithm.
