ChemXSeer Digital Library Gaussian Search

We report on the Gaussian file search system designed as part of the ChemXSeer digital library. Gaussian files are produced by the Gaussian software [4], a software package used for calculating molecular electronic structure and properties. The output files are semi-structured, allowing relatively easy access to the Gaussian attributes and metadata. Our system is currently capable of searching Gaussian documents using a boolean combination of atoms (chemical elements) and attributes. We have also implemented a faceted browsing feature on three important Gaussian attribute types - Basis Set, Job Type and Method Used. The faceted browsing feature enables a user to view and process a smaller, filtered subset of documents.
