A New System Architecture for Pervasive Computing

We present new system architecture, a distributed framework designed to support pervasive computing applications. We propose a new architecture consisting of a search engine and peripheral clients that addresses issues in scalability, data sharing, data transformation and inherent platform heterogeneity. Key features of our application are a type-aware data transport that is capable of extract data, and present data through handheld devices (PDA (personal digital assistant), mobiles, etc). Pervasive computing uses web technology, portable devices, wireless communications and nomadic or ubiquitous computing systems. The web and the simple standard HTTP protocol that it is based on, facilitate this kind of ubiquitous access. This can be implemented on a variety of devices - PDAs, laptops, information appliances such as digital cameras and printers. Mobile users get transparent access to resources outside their current environment. We discuss our system's architecture and its implementation. Through experimental study, we show reasonable performance and adaptation for our system's implementation for the mobile devices.
