An architecture for "Web Of Things" using SOCKS protocol based IPv6/IPv4 gatewaying for heterogeneous communication

"Web Of Things" evolved from "Internet Of Things". Lot of research has been done in designing architecture for "Web Of Things". Two main architectures are Smart gateway based architecture and embedded Web Server based architecture. These architectures address some of the basic and essential issues relating to Service Oriented Architecture for "Web Of Things". Taking into consideration the period of coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 we propose an architecture using SOCKS protocol based IPv6/IPv4 gatewaying and refinements which facilitates smooth heterogeneous communications between the IPv6 and IPv4 enabled embedded nodes and can potentially be used to prevent security threats like Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on embedded devices attached to the web and increase its performance. Our architecture provides a way for caching responses from device and thereby increasing its efficiency and performance and yielding quick response times.
