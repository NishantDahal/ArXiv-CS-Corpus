Constructing Premaximal Binary Cube-free Words of Any Level

We study the structure of the language of binary cube-free words. Namely, we are interested in the cube-free words that cannot be infinitely extended preserving cube-freeness. We show the existence of such words with arbitrarily long finite extensions, both to one side and to both sides.
