Making QCD Lattice Data Accessible and Organized through Advanced Web Interfaces

The Gauge Connection at qcd.nersc.gov is one of the most popular repositories of QCD lattice ensembles. It is used to access 16TB of archived QCD data from the High Performance Storage System (HPSS) at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). Here, we present a new web interface for qcd.nersc.gov which allows physicists to browse and search the data, as well as download individual files or entire ensembles in batch. Our system distinguishes itself from others because of its ease of use and web based workflow.
