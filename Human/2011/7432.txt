Steganography: a Class of Algorithms having Secure Properties

Chaos-based approaches are frequently proposed in information hiding, but without obvious justification. Indeed, the reason why chaos is useful to tackle with discretion, robustness, or security, is rarely elucidated. This research work presents a new class of non-blind information hidingalgorithms based on some finite domains iterations that are Devaney's topologically chaotic. The approach is entirely formalized and reasons to take place into the mathematical theory of chaos are explained. Finally, stego-security and chaos security are consequently proven for a large class of algorithms.
