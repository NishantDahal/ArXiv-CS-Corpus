On isogeny classes of Edwards curves over finite fields

We count the number of isogeny classes of Edwards curves over finite fields, answering a question recently posed by Rezaeian and Shparlinski. We also show that each isogeny class contains a {\em complete} Edwards curve, and that an Edwards curve is isogenous to an {\em original} Edwards curve over $\F_q$ if and only if its group order is divisible by 8 if $q \equiv -1 \pmod{4}$, and 16 if $q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. Furthermore, we give formulae for the proportion of $d \in \F_q \setminus \{0,1\}$ for which the Edwards curve $E_d$ is complete or original, relative to the total number of $d$ in each isogeny class.
