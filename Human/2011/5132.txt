New Principles of Coordination in Large-scale Micro- and Molecular-Robotic Groups

Micro- and molecular-robotic systems act as large-scale swarms. Capabilities of sensing, communication and information processing are very limited on these scales. This short position paper describes a swarm-based minimalistic approach, which can be applied for coordinating collective behavior in such systems.
