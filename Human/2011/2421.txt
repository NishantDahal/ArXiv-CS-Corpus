Random Matrix Model for Nakagami-Hoyt Fading

Random matrix model for the Nakagami-q (Hoyt) fading in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication channels with arbitrary number of transmitting and receiving antennas is considered. The joint probability density for the eigenvalues of H†H (or HH†), where H is the channel matrix, is shown to correspond to the Laguerre crossover ensemble of random matrices and is given in terms of a Pfaffian. Exact expression for the marginal density of eigenvalues is obtained as a series consisting of associated Laguerre polynomials. This is used to study the effect of fading on the Shannon channel capacity. Exact expressions for higher order density correlation functions are also given which can be used to study the distribution of channel capacity.
