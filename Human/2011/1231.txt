Course on System Design (structural approach)

The article describes a course on system design (structural approach) which involves the following: issues of systems engineering; structural models; basic technological problems (structural system modeling, modular design, evaluation/comparison, revelation of bottlenecks, improvement/upgrade, multistage design, modeling of system evolution); solving methods (optimization, combinatorial optimization, multicriteria decision making); design frameworks; and applications. The course contains lectures and a set of special laboratory works. The laboratory works consist in designing and implementing a set of programs to solve multicriteria problems (ranking/selection, multiple choice problem, clustering, assignment). The programs above are used to solve some standard problems (e.g., hierarchical design of a student plan, design of a marketing strategy). Concurrently, each student can examine a unique applied problem from his/her applied domain(s) (e.g., telemetric system, GSM network, integrated security system, testing of microprocessor systems, wireless sensor, corporative communication network, network topology). Mainly, the course is targeted to developing the student skills in modular analysis and design of various multidisciplinary composite systems (e.g., software, electronic devices, information, computers, communications). The course was implemented in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University).
