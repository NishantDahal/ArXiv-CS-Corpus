The fuzzy gene filter: A classifier performance assesment

The Fuzzy Gene Filter (FGF) is an optimised Fuzzy Inference System designed to rank genes in order of differential expression, based on expression data generated in a microarray experiment. This paper examines the effectiveness of the FGF for feature selection using various classification architectures. The FGF is compared to three of the most common gene ranking algorithms: t-test, Wilcoxon test and ROC curve analysis. Four classification schemes are used to compare the performance of the FGF vis-a-vis the standard approaches: K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). A nested stratified Leave-One-Out Cross Validation scheme is used to identify the optimal number top ranking genes, as well as the optimal classifier parameters. Two microarray data sets are used for the comparison: a prostate cancer data set and a lymphoma data set.
