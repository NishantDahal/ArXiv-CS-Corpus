Query Expansion: Term Selection using the EWC Semantic Relatedness Measure

This paper investigates the efficiency of the EWC semantic relatedness measure in an ad-hoc retrieval task. This measure combines the Wikipedia-based Explicit Semantic Analysis measure, the WordNet path measure and the mixed collocation index. In the experiments, the open source search engine Terrier was utilised as a tool to index and retrieve data. The proposed technique was tested on the NTCIR data collection. The experiments demonstrated promising results.
