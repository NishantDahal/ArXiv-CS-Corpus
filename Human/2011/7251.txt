Dependently Typed Programming based on Automated Theorem Proving

Mella is a minimalistic dependently typed programming language and interactive theorem prover implemented in Haskell. Its main purpose is to investigate the effective integration of automated theorem provers in a pure and simple setting. Such integrations are essential for supporting program development in dependently typed languages. We integrate the equational theorem prover Waldmeister and test it on more than 800 proof goals from the TPTP library. In contrast to previous approaches, the reconstruction of Waldmeister proofs within Mella is quite robust and does not generate a significant overhead to proof search. Mella thus yields a template for integrating more expressive theorem provers in more sophisticated languages.
