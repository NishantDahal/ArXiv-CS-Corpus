Online Anomaly Detection Systems Using Incremental Commute Time

Commute Time Distance (CTD) is a random walk based metric on graphs. CTD has found widespread applications in many domains including personalized search, collaborative filtering and making search engines robust against manipulation. Our interest is inspired by the use of CTD as a metric for anomaly detection. It has been shown that CTD can be used to simultaneously identify both global and local anomalies. Here we propose an accurate and efficient approximation for computing the CTD in an incremental fashion in order to facilitate real-time applications. An online anomaly detection algorithm is designed where the CTD of each new arriving data point to any point in the current graph can be estimated in constant time ensuring a real-time response. Moreover, the proposed approach can also be applied in many other applications that utilize commute time distance.
