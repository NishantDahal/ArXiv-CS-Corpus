Incremental Versus Optimized Network Design

Even though the problem of network topology design is often studied as a "clean-slate" optimization, in practice most service-provider and enterprise networks are designed incrementally over time. This evolutionary process is driven by changes in the underlying parameters and constraints (the "environment") and it aims to minimize the modification cost after each change in the environment. In this paper, we first formulate the incremental design approach (in three variations), and compare that with the more traditional optimized design approach in which the objective is to minimize the total network cost. We evaluate the cost overhead and evolvability of incremental design under two network expansion models (random and gradual), comparing incremental and optimized networks in terms of cost, topological similarity, delay and robustness. We find that even though incremental design has some cost overhead, that overhead does not increase as the network grows. Also, it is less costly to evolve an existing network than to design it "from scratch" as long as the network expansion factor is less than a critical value.
