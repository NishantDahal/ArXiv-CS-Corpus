Stable, scalable, decentralized P2P file sharing with non-altruistic peers

P2P systems provide a scalable solution for distributing large files in a network. The file is split into many chunks, and peers contact other peers to collect missing chunks to eventually complete the entire file. The so-called `rare chunk' phenomenon, where a single chunk becomes rare and prevents peers from completing the file, is a threat to the stability of such systems. Practical systems such as BitTorrent overcome this issue by requiring a global search for the rare chunk, which necessitates a centralized mechanism. We demonstrate a new system based on an approximate rare-chunk rule, allowing for completely distributed file sharing while retaining scalability and stability. We assume non-altruistic peers and the seed is required to make only a minimal contribution.
