Stage Staffing Scheme for Copyright Protection in Multimedia

Copyright protection has become a need in today's world. To achieve a secure copyright protection we embedded some information in images and videos and that image or video is called copyright protected. The embedded information can't be detected by human eye but some attacks and operations can tamper that information to breach protection. So in order to find a secure technique of copyright protection, we have analyzed image processing techniques i.e. Spatial Domain (Least Significant Bit (LSB)), Transform Domain (Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and there are numerous algorithm for watermarking using them. After having a good understanding of the same we have proposed a novel algorithm named as Stage Staffing Algorithm that generates results with high effectiveness, additionally we can use self extracted-watermark technique to increase the security and automate the process of watermark image. The proposed algorithm provides protection in three stages. We have implemented the algorithm and results of the simulations are shown. The various factors affecting spatial domain watermarking are also discussed.
