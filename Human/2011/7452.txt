Discovering novel computer music techniques by exploring the space of short computer programs

Very short computer programs, sometimes consisting of as few as three arithmetic operations in an infinite loop, can generate data that sounds like music when output as raw PCM audio. The space of such programs was recently explored by dozens of individuals within various on-line communities. This paper discusses the programs resulting from this exploratory work and highlights some rather unusual methods they use for synthesizing sound and generating musical structure.
