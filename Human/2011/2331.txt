A parallel Buchberger algorithm for multigraded ideals

We demonstrate a method to parallelize the computation of a Gr√∂bner basis for a homogenous ideal in a multigraded polynomial ring. Our method uses anti-chains in the lattice $\mathbb N^k$ to separate mutually independent S-polynomials for reduction.
