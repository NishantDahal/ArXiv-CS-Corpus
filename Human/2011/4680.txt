Real time face recognition using adaboost improved fast PCA algorithm

This paper presents an automated system for human face recognition in a real time background world for a large homemade dataset of persons face. The task is very difficult as the real time background subtraction in an image is still a challenge. Addition to this there is a huge variation in human face image in terms of size, pose and expression. The system proposed collapses most of this variance. To detect real time human face AdaBoost with Haar cascade is used and a simple fast PCA and LDA is used to recognize the faces detected. The matched face is then used to mark attendance in the laboratory, in our case. This biometric system is a real time attendance system based on the human face recognition with a simple and fast algorithms and gaining a high accuracy rate..
