Simulation and Optimization of MQW based optical modulator for on chip optical interconnect

Optical interconnects are foreseen as a potential solution to improve the performance of data transmission in high speed integrated circuits since electrical interconnects operating at high bit rates have several limitations which creates a bottleneck at the interconnect level. The objective of the work is to model and then simulate the MQWM based optical interconnect transmitter. The power output of the simulated modulator is then optimized with respect to various parameters namely contrast ratio, insertion loss and bias current. The methodology presented here is suitable for investigation of both analog and digital modulation performance but it primarily deals with digital modulation. We have not included the effect of carrier charge density in multiple quantum well simulation.
