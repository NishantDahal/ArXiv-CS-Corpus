Scalable Grid Resource Discovery through Distributed Search

This paper proposes a simple and scalable web-based model for grid resource discovery for the Internet. The resource discovery model contains the metadata and resource finder web services. The information of resource finder web services is kept in the repositories that are distributed in the application layer of Internet. The resource finder web services will be discovered by sending queries to the repositories in a similar way as the DNS protocol. The underlying technology for implementation of the two architectures of this model is introduced. These architectures are: Direct and Centralized Web-Based Grid Resource Discovery. The resource discovery time is computed after simulating each of these models in GridSim. By performing scalability tests, we found that when increasing the load on the grid with more users and resources, the cost of our model in comparison to the grid resource discovery time is marginal.
