Face Recognition Based on SVM and 2DPCA

The paper will present a novel approach for solving face recognition problem. Our method combines 2D Principal Component Analysis (2DPCA), one of the prominent methods for extracting feature vectors, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), the most powerful discriminative method for classification. Experiments based on proposed method have been conducted on two public data sets FERET and AT&T; the results show that the proposed method could improve the classification rates.
