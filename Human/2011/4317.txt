Un metodo estable para la evaluacion de la complejidad algoritmica de cadenas cortas

It is discussed and surveyed a numerical method proposed before, that alternative to the usual compression method, provides an approximation to the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity, particularly useful for short strings for which compression methods simply fail. The method shows to be stable enough and useful to conceive and compare patterns in an algorithmic models. (article in Spanish)
