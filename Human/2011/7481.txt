Classification with Invariant Scattering Representations

A scattering transform defines a signal representation which is invariant to translations and Lipschitz continuous relatively to deformations. It is implemented with a non-linear convolution network that iterates over wavelet and modulus operators. Lipschitz continuity locally linearizes deformations. Complex classes of signals and textures can be modeled with low-dimensional affine spaces, computed with a PCA in the scattering domain. Classification is performed with a penalized model selection. State of the art results are obtained for handwritten digit recognition over small training sets, and for texture classification.
