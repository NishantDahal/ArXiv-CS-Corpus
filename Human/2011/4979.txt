Improving the Usability of Privacy Settings in Facebook

The ever increasing popularity of Facebook and other Online Social Networks has left a wealth of personal and private data on the web, aggregated and readily accessible for broad and automatic retrieval. Protection from both undesired recipients as well as harvesting through crawlers is implemented by simple access control at the provider, configured by manual authorization through the publishing user. Several studies demonstrate that standard settings directly cause an unnoticed over-sharing and that the users have trouble understanding and configuring adequate settings. Using the three simple principles of color coding, ease of access, and application of common practices, we developed a new privacy interface that increases the usability significantly. The results of our user study underlines the extent of the initial problem and documents that our interface enables faster, more precise authorisation and leads to increased intelligibility.
