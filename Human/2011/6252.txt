Universally Attainable Error and Information Exponents, and Equivocation Rate for the Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages

We show universally attainable exponents for the decoding error and the mutual information and universally attainable equivocation rates for the conditional entropy for the broadcast channels with confidential messages. The error exponents are the same as ones given by Korner and Sgarro for the broadcast channels with degraded message sets.
