Convergence Properties of Two (μ + λ) Evolutionary Algorithms On OneMax and Royal Roads Test Functions

We present a number of bounds on convergence time for two elitist population-based Evolutionary Algorithms using a recombination operator k-Bit-Swap and a mainstream Randomized Local Search algorithm. We study the effect of distribution of elite species and population size.
