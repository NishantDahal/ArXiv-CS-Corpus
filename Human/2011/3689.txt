Non-Uniform Cellular Automata: classes, dynamics, and decidability

The dynamical behavior of non-uniform cellular automata is compared with the one of classical cellular automata. Several differences and similarities are pointed out by a series of examples. Decidability of basic properties like surjectivity and injectivity is also established. The final part studies a strong form of equicontinuity property specially suited for non-uniform cellular automata.
