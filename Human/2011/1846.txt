An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle as Human-Assistant Robotics System

According to the American Heritage Dictionary [1],Robotics is the science or study of the technology associated with the design, fabrication, theory, and application of Robots. The term Hoverbot is also often used to refer to sophisticated mechanical devices that are remotely controlled by human beings even though these devices are not autonomous. This paper describes a remotely controlled hoverbot by installing a transmitter and receiver on both sides that is the control computer (PC) and the hoverbot respectively. Data is transmitted as signal or instruction via a infrastructure network which is converted into a command for the hoverbot that operates at a remote site.
