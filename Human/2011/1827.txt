Black-and-white threshold graphs

Let k be a natural number. We introduce k-threshold graphs. We show that there exists an O(n^3) algorithm for the recognition of k-threshold graphs for each natural number k. k-Threshold graphs are characterized by a finite collection of forbidden induced subgraphs. For the case k=2 we characterize the partitioned 2-threshold graphs by forbidden induced subgraphs. We introduce restricted -, and special 2-threshold graphs. We characterize both classes by forbidden induced subgraphs. The restricted 2-threshold graphs coincide with the switching class of threshold graphs. This provides a decomposition theorem for the switching class of threshold graphs.
