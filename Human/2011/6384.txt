Query Driven Visualization

The request driven way of deriving data in Astro-WISE is extended to a query driven way of visualization. This allows scientists to focus on the science they want to perform, because all administration of their data is automated. This can be done over an abstraction layer that enhances control and flexibility for the scientist.
