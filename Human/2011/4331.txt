Minimalist Grammars and Minimalist Categorial Grammars, definitions toward inclusion of generated languages

Stabler proposes an implementation of the Chomskyan Minimalist Program, Chomsky 95 with Minimalist Grammars - MG, Stabler 97. This framework inherits a long linguistic tradition. But the semantic calculus is more easily added if one uses the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Minimalist Categorial Grammars - MCG, based on an extension of the Lambek calculus, the mixed logic, were introduced to provide a theoretically-motivated syntax-semantics interface, Amblard 07. In this article, we give full definitions of MG with algebraic tree descriptions and of MCG, and take the first steps towards giving a proof of inclusion of their generated languages.
