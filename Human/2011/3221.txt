An application of Grossone to the study of a family of tilings of the hyperbolic plane

In this paper, we look at the improvement of our knowledge on a family of tilings of the hyperbolic plane which is brought in by the use of Sergeyev's numeral system based on grossone. It appears that the information we can get by using this new numeral system depends on the way we look at the tilings. The ways are significantly different but they confirm some results which were obtained in the traditional but constructive frame and allow us to obtain an additional precision with respect to this information.
