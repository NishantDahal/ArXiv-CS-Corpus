On game psychology: an experiment on the chess board/screen, should you always "do your best", and why the programs with prescribed weaknesses cannot be our good friends?

It is noted that some unusual moves against a strong chess program greatly weaken its ability to see the serious targets of the game, and its whole level of play... It is suggested to create programs with different weaknesses in order to analyze similar human behavior. Finally, a new version of chess, "Chess Corrida" is suggested.
