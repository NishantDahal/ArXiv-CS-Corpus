Implementing a Web Browser with Phishing Detection Techniques

Phishing is the combination of social engineering and technical exploits designed to convince a victim to provide personal information, usually for the monetary gain of the attacker. Phishing has become the most popular practice among the criminals of the Web. Phishing attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. The impact of phishing is drastic and significant since it can involve the risk of identity theft and financial losses. Phishing scams have become a problem for online banking and e-commerce users. In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect phishing attacks. We implemented a prototype web browser which can be used as an agent and processes each arriving email for phishing attacks. Using email data collected over a period time we demonstrate data that our approach is able to detect more phishing attacks than existing schemes.
