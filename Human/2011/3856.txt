E-DTN : A Multi-Interface Energy DTN Gateway

To overcome the problem of unavailability of grid power in rural India, we explore the possibility of powering WSN gateways using a bicycle dynamo. The "Data mule" bicycle generates its own power to ensure a self sustainable data transfer for information dissemination to small and marginal farmers. Our multi-interface WSN gateway is equipped with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPRS technologies. To achieve our goal, we exploit the DTN stack in the energy sense and introduce necessary modifications to its configuration.
