A Novel Adaptive Routing through Fitness Function Estimation Technique with Multiple QoS Parameters Compliance

The paper presents a method which shows a significant improvement in discovering the path over the distance vector protocol. The proposed method is a multi-parameter QoS along with the fitness function which shows that it overcomes the limitation of DV like routing loops by spanning tree approach, count-to-infinity problem by decision attribute. The input considered is a topology satisfying the QoS parameters of size 1 to 64 nodes and it was shown that an optimal path selection was obtained efficiently over the classical distance vector algorithm
