Time Delays in Membrane Systems and Petri Nets

Timing aspects in formalisms with explicit resources and parallelism are investigated, and it is presented a formal link between timed membrane systems and timed Petri nets with localities. For both formalisms, timing does not increase the expressive power; however both timed membrane systems and timed Petri nets are more flexible in describing molecular phenomena where time is a critical resource. We establish a link between timed membrane systems and timed Petri nets with localities, and prove an operational correspondence between them.
