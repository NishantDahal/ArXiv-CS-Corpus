Modelling of Genetic Regulatory Mechanisms with GReg

Most available tools propose simulation frameworks to study models of biological systems, but simulation only explores a few of the most probable behaviours of the system. On the contrary, techniques such as model checking, coming from IT-systems analysis, explore all the possible behaviours of the modelled systems, thus helping to identify emergent properties. A main drawback from most model checking tools in the life sciences domain is that they take as input a language designed for computer scientists, that is not easily understood by non-expert users. We propose in this article an approach based on DSL. It provides a comprehensible language to describe the system while allowing the use of complex and powerful underlying model checking techniques.
