ALPprolog --- A New Logic Programming Method for Dynamic Domains

Logic programming is a powerful paradigm for programming autonomous agents in dynamic domains, as witnessed by languages such as Golog and Flux. In this work we present ALPprolog, an expressive, yet efficient, logic programming language for the online control of agents that have to reason about incomplete information and sensing actions.
