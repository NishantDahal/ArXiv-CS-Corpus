Computational homogenization of non-stationary transport processes in masonry structures

A fully coupled transient heat and moisture transport in a masonry structure is examined in this paper. Supported by several successful applications in civil engineering the nonlinear diffusion model proposed by KÃ¼nzel is adopted in the present study. A strong material heterogeneity together with a significant dependence of the model parameters on initial conditions as well as the gradients of heat and moisture fields vindicates the use of a hierarchical modeling strategy to solve the problem of this kind. Attention is limited to the classical first order homogenization in a spatial domain developed here in the framework of a two step (meso-macro) multi-scale computational scheme (FE^2 problem). Several illustrative examples are presented to investigate the influence of transient flow at the level of constituents (meso-scale) on the macroscopic response including the effect of macro-scale boundary conditions. A two-dimensional section of Charles Bridge subjected to actual climatic conditions is analyzed next to confirm the suitability of algorithmic format of FE^2 scheme for the parallel computing.
