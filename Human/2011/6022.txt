Enhanced Secure Algorithm for Message Communion

This paper puts forward a safe mechanism of data transmission to tackle the security problem of information which is transmitted in Internet. The encryption standards such as DES (Data Encryption Standard), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and EES (Escrowed Encryption Standard) are widely used to solve the problem of communication over an insecure channel. With advanced technologies in computer hardware and software, these standards seem not to be as secure and fast as one would like. In this paper we propose a encryption technique which provides security to both the message and the secret key achieving confidentiality and authentication. The Symmetric algorithm used has two advantages over traditional schemes. First, the encryption and decryption procedures are much simpler, and consequently, much faster. Second, the security level is higher due to the inherent poly-alphabetic nature of the substitution mapping method used here, together with the translation and transposition operations performed in the algorithm. Asymmetric algorithm RSA is worldwide known for its high security. In this paper a detailed report of the process is presented and analysis is done comparing our proposed technique with familiar techniques
