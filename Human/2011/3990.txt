Elliptic Curve Based Zero Knowledge Proofs and Their Applicability on Resource Constrained Devices

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an attractive alternative to conventional public key cryptography, such as RSA. ECC is an ideal candidate for implementation on constrained devices where the major computational resources i.e. speed, memory are limited and low-power wireless communication protocols are employed. That is because it attains the same security levels with traditional cryptosystems using smaller parameter sizes. Moreover, in several application areas such as person identification and eVoting, it is frequently required of entities to prove knowledge of some fact without revealing this knowledge. Such proofs of knowledge are called Zero Knowledge Interactive Proofs (ZKIP) and involve interactions between two communicating parties, the Prover and the Verifier. In a ZKIP, the Prover demonstrates the possesion of some information (e.g. authentication information) to the Verifier without disclosing it. In this paper, we focus on the application of ZKIP protocols on resource constrained devices. We study well-established ZKIP protocols based on the discrete logarithm problem and we transform them under the ECC setting. Then, we implement the proposed protocols on Wiselib, a generic and open source algorithmic library. Finally, we present a thorough evaluation of the protocols on two popular hardware platforms equipped with low end microcontrollers (Jennic JN5139, TI MSP430) and 802.15.4 RF transceivers, in terms of code size, execution time, message size and energy requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of implementing and evaluating ZKIP protocols with emphasis on low-end devices. This work's results can be used from developers who wish to achieve certain levels of security and privacy in their applications.
