Encoding Phases using Commutativity and Non-commutativity in a Logical Framework

This article presents an extension of Minimalist Categorial Gram- mars (MCG) to encode Chomsky's phases. These grammars are based on Par- tially Commutative Logic (PCL) and encode properties of Minimalist Grammars (MG) of Stabler. The first implementation of MCG were using both non- commutative properties (to respect the linear word order in an utterance) and commutative ones (to model features of different constituents). Here, we pro- pose to adding Chomsky's phases with the non-commutative tensor product of the logic. Then we could give account of the PIC just by using logical prop- erties of the framework.
