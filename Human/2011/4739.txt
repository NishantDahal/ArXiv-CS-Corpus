On the reaction time of some synchronous systems

This paper presents an investigation of the notion of reaction time in some synchronous systems. A  state-based description of such systems is given, and the reaction time of such systems under some classic composition primitives is studied. Reaction time is shown to be non-compositional in general. Possible solutions are proposed, and applications to verification are discussed. This framework is illustrated by some examples issued from studies on real-time embedded systems.
