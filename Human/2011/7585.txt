(1+eps)-approximate Sparse Recovery

The problem central to sparse recovery and compressive sensing is that of stable sparse recovery: we want a distribution of matrices A in R^{m\times n} such that, for any x \in R^n and with probability at least 2/3 over A, there is an algorithm to recover x* from Ax with
  ||x* - x||_p <= C min_{k-sparse x'} ||x - x'||_p for some constant C > 1 and norm p. The measurement complexity of this problem is well understood for constant C > 1. However, in a variety of applications it is important to obtain C = 1 + eps for a small eps > 0, and this complexity is not well understood. We resolve the dependence on eps in the number of measurements required of a k-sparse recovery algorithm, up to polylogarithmic factors for the central cases of p = 1 and p = 2. Namely, we give new algorithms and lower bounds that show the number of measurements required is (1/eps^{p/2})k polylog(n). For p = 2, our bound of (1/eps) k log(n/k) is tight up to constant factors. We also give matching bounds when the output is required to be k-sparse, in which case we achieve (1/eps^p) k polylog(n). This shows the distinction between the complexity of sparse and non-sparse outputs is fundamental.
