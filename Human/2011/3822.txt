3-Phase Recognition Approach to Pseudo 3D Building Generation from 2D Floor Plan

Nowadays three dimension (3D) architectural visualisation has become a powerful tool in the conceptualisation, design and presentation of architectural products in the construction industry, providing realistic interaction and walkthrough on engineering products. Traditional ways of implementing 3D models involves the use of specialised 3D authoring tools along with skilled 3D designers with blueprints of the model and this is a slow and laborious process. The aim of this paper is to automate this process by simply analyzing the blueprint document and generating the 3D scene automatically. For this purpose we have devised a 3-Phase recognition approach to pseudo 3D building generation from 2D floor plan and developed a software accordingly. Our 3-phased 3D building system has been implemented using C, C++ and OpenCV library [24] for the Image Processing module; The Save Module generated an XML file for storing the processed floor plan objects attributes; while the Irrlitch [14] game engine was used to implement the Interactive 3D module. Though still at its infancy, our proposed system gave commendable results. We tested our system on 6 floor plans with complexities ranging from low to high and the results seems to be very promising with an average processing time of around 3s and a 3D generation in 4s. In addition the system provides an interactive walk-though and allows users to modify components.
