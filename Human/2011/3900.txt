Proposed Quality Evaluation Framework to Incorporate Quality Aspects in Web Warehouse Creation

Web Warehouse is a read only repository maintained on the web to effectively handle the relevant data. Web warehouse is a system comprised of various subsystems and process. It supports the organizations in decision making. Quality of data store in web warehouse can affect the quality of decision made. For a valuable decision making it is required to consider the quality aspects in designing and modelling of a web warehouse. Thus data quality is one of the most important issues of the web warehousing system. Quality must be incorporated at different stages of the web warehousing system development. It is necessary to enhance existing data warehousing system to increase the data quality. It results in the storage of high quality data in the repository and efficient decision making. In this paper a Quality Evaluation Framework is proposed keeping in view the quality dimensions associated with different phases of a web warehouse. Further more, the proposed framework is validated empirically with the help of quantitative analysis.
