Efficient management of IT Infrastructure implementation and support at enterprise level

This paper deals with how to manage effectively in the design, implementation and support of an IT infrastructure at an enterprise level. This particular management is lacking in today's IT infrastructure scenario. Just implementation is not sufficient for an NON-IT industry, they need a proper support in the infrastructure like documentation, support work flow, ticketing systems (used for IT related issue either hardware or software) etc... Many organizations spend a lot of money for this support and they expect a lot from the provider. Many providers sign in the SLA that they will provide them with an excellent support, but 80-90% it doesn't happen. Many times they don't meet the expectations of their client. So how to make these expectations being met 100% for the client? That is what is going to be discussed in this paper with respect to ITIL framework and other technical terminologies.
