Proceedings 7th International Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems

This volume contains the final and revised versions of the papers presented at the 7th International Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems (WWV 2011). The workshop was held in Reykjavik, Iceland, on June 9, 2011, as part of DisCoTec 2011. The aim of the WWV workshop series is to provide an interdisciplinary forum to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the advancement of hybrid methods that exploit concepts and tools drawn from Rule-based programming, Software engineering, Formal methods and Web-oriented research. Nowadays, indeed, many companies and institutions have diverted their Web sites into interactive, completely-automated, Web-based applications for, e.g., e-business, e-learning, e-government, and e-health. The increased complexity and the explosive growth of Web systems have made their design and implementation a challenging task. Systematic, formal approaches to their specification and verification can permit to address the problems of this specific domain by means of automated and effective techniques and tools. In response to this year's call for papers, we received 9 paper submissions. The Program Committee of WWV 2011 collected three reviews for each paper and held an electronic discussion leading to the selection of 7 papers for presentation at the workshop. In addition to the selected papers, the scientific programme included an invited lecture by Elie Najm.
