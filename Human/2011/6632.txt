Extending the adverbial coverage of a NLP oriented resource for French

This paper presents a work on extending the adverbial entries of LGLex: a NLP oriented syntactic resource for French. Adverbs were extracted from the Lexicon-Grammar tables of both simple adverbs ending in -ment '-ly' (Molinier and Levrier, 2000) and compound adverbs (Gross, 1986; 1990). This work relies on the exploitation of fine-grained linguistic information provided in existing resources. Various features are encoded in both LG tables and they haven't been exploited yet. They describe the relations of deleting, permuting, intensifying and paraphrasing that associate, on the one hand, the simple and compound adverbs and, on the other hand, different types of compound adverbs. The resulting syntactic resource is manually evaluated and freely available under the LGPL-LR license.
