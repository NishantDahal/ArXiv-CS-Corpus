Proceedings Fifth Transformation Tool Contest

The aim of the Transformation Tool Contest (TTC) series is to compare the expressiveness, the usability and the performance of graph and model transformation tools along a number of selected case studies. Participants want to learn about the pros and cons of each tool considering different applications. A deeper understanding of the relative merits of different tool features will help to further improve graph and model transformation tools and to indicate open problems.
  TTC 2011 involved 25 offline case study solutions: 12 solutions to the Hello World case, 2 solutions to the GMF Model Migration case, 5 solutions to the Compiler Optimization case, and 7 solutions to the Reengineering (i.e., Program Understanding) case.  This volume contains the submissions that have passed an additional (post-workshop) reviewing round.
