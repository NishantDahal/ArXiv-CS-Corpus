Model of skyscraper evacuation with the use of space symmetry and fluid dynamic approximation

The simulation of evacuation of pedestrians from skyscraper is a situation where the symmetry analysis method and equations of fluid dynamics finds to be very useful. When applied, they strongly reduce the number of free parameters used in simulations and in such a way speed up the calculations and make them easier to manage by the programmer and what is even more important, they can give a fresh insight into a problem of evacuation and help with incorporation of "Ambient Intelligent Devices" into future real buildings. We have analyzed various, simplified, cases of evacuation from skyscraper by employing improved "Social Force Model". For each of them we obtained the average force acting on the pedestrian as a function of the evacuation time. The results clearly show that both methods mentioned above, can be successfully implemented in the simulation process and return with satisfactory conclusions.
