Strategies for Development of a Distributed Framework for Computational Sciences

This paper discusses some generic approach for developing grid-based framework for enabling establishment of workflows comprising existing software in computational sciences areas. We highlight the main requirements addressed the developing of such framework. Some strategies for enabling interoperability between convenient computation software in the grid environment has been shown. The UML based instruments of graphical description of workflows for the developing system has been suggested.
