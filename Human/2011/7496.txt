Randomness Quality of CI Chaotic Generators: Applications to Internet Security

Due to the rapid development of the Internet in recent years, the need to find new tools to reinforce trust and security through the Internet has became a major concern. The discovery of new pseudo-random number generators with a strong level of security is thus becoming a hot topic, because numerous cryptosystems and data hiding schemes are directly dependent on the quality of these generators. At the conference Internet`09, we have described a generator based on chaotic iterations, which behaves chaotically as defined by Devaney. In this paper, the proposal is to improve the speed and the security of this generator, to make its use more relevant in the Internet security context. To do so, a comparative study between various generators is carried out and statistical results are given. Finally, an application in the information hiding framework is presented, to give an illustrative example of the use of such a generator in the Internet security field.
