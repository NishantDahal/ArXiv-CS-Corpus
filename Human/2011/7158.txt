A Complexity Approach for Steganalysis

In this proposal for the Journèes Codes et Stéganographie 2012, we define a new rigorous approach for steganalysis based on the complexity theory. It is similar to the definitions of security that can be found for hash functions, PRNG, and so on. We propose here a notion of \emph{secure hiding} and we give a first secure hiding scheme.
