Platform for Assessing Strategic Alignment Using Enterprise Architecture: Application to E-Government Process Assessment

This paper presents an overview of S2AEA (v2) (Strategic Alignment Assessment based on Enterprise Architecture (version2)), a platform for modelling enterprise architecture and for assessing strategic alignment based on internal enterprise architecture metrics. The idea of the platform is based on the fact that enterprise architecture provides a structure for business processes and information systems that supports them. This structure can be used to measure the degree of consistency between business strategies and information systems. In that sense, this paper presents a platform illustrating the role of enterprise architecture in the strategic alignment assessment. This assessment can be used in auditing information systems. The platform is applied to assess an e-government process.
