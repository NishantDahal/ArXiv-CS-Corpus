vFlow: A GUI-Based Tool for Building Batch Applications for Cloud Computing

In this paper we introduce vFlow - A framework for rapid designing of batch processing applications for Cloud Computing environment. vFlow batch processing system extracts tasks from the vPlans diagrams, systematically captures the dynamics in batch application management tasks, and translates them to Cloud environment API, named vDocuments, that can be used to execute batch processing applications. vDocuments do not only enable the complete execution of low-level configuration management tasks, but also allow the construction of more sophisticated tasks, while imposing additional reasoning logic to realize batch application management objectives in Cloud environments. We present the design of the vFlow framework and illustrate its utility by presenting the implementation of several sophisticated operational tasks.
