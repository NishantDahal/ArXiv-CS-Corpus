Many-Task Computing Tools for Multiscale Modeling

This paper discusses the use of many-task computing tools for multiscale modeling. It defines multiscale modeling and places different examples of it on a coupling spectrum, discusses the Swift parallel scripting language, describes three multiscale modeling applications that could use Swift, and then talks about how the Swift model is being extended to cover more of the multiscale modeling coupling spectrum.
