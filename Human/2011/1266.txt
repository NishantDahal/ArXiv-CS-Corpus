Off-Line Handwritten Signature Identification Using Rotated Complex Wavelet Filters

In this paper, a new method for handwritten signature identification based on rotated complex wavelet filters is proposed. We have proposed to use the rotated complex wavelet filters (RCWF) and dual tree complex wavelet transform(DTCWT) together to derive signature feature extraction, which captures information in twelve different directions. In identification phase, Canberra distance measure is used. The proposed method is compared with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). From experimental results it is found that signature identification rate of proposed method is superior over DWT
