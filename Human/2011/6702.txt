Proceedings 13th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems (INFINITY 2011). The workshop was held in Taipei, Taiwan on October 10, 2011, as a satellite event to the 9th International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis (ATVA). The INFINITY workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers who are interested in the development of formal methods and algorithmic techniques for the analysis of systems with infinitely many states, and their application in automated verification of complex software and hardware systems.
