Towards a theory of modelling with Boolean automata networks - I. Theorisation and observations

Although models are built on the basis of some observations of reality, the concepts that derive theoretically from their definitions as well as from their characteristics and properties are not necessarily direct consequences of these initial observations. Indeed, many of them rather follow from chains of theoretical inferences that are only based on the precise model definitions and rely strongly, in addition, on some consequential working hypotheses. Thus, it is important to address the question of which features of a model effectively carry some modelling meaning and which only result from the task of formalising observations of reality into a mathematical language. In this article, we address this question with a theoretical point view that sets our discussion strictly between the two stages of the modelling process that require knowledge of real systems, that is, between the initial stage that chooses a global theoretical framework to build the model and the final stage that exploits its formal predictions by comparing them to the reality that the model was designed to simulate. Taking Boolean automata networks as instances of models of systems observed in reality, we analyse in this setting the remaining stages of the modelling process and we show how the meaning of theoretical concepts can subtly rely on formal choices such as definitions and hypotheses.
