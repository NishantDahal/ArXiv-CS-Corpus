A Survey on how Description Logic Ontologies Benefit from Formal Concept Analysis

Although the notion of a concept as a collection of objects sharing certain properties, and the notion of a conceptual hierarchy are fundamental to both Formal Concept Analysis and Description Logics, the ways concepts are described and obtained differ significantly between these two research areas. Despite these differences, there have been several attempts to bridge the gap between these two formalisms, and attempts to apply methods from one field in the other. The present work aims to give an overview on the research done in combining Description Logics and Formal Concept Analysis.
