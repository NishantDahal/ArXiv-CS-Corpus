TripNet: A Method for Constructing Phylogenetic Networks from Triplets

We present TripNet, a method for constructing phylogenetic networks from triplets. We will present the motivations behind our approach and its theoretical and empirical justification. To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of TripNet, we performed two simulations and also applied the method to five published data sets: Kreitman's data, a set of triplets from real yeast data obtained from the Fungal Biodiversity Center in Utrecht, a collection of 110 highly recombinant Salmonella multi-locus sequence typing sequences, and nrDNA ITS and cpDNA JSA sequence data of New Zealand alpine buttercups of Ranunculus sect. Pseudadonis. Finally, we compare our results with those already obtained by other authors using alternative methods. TripNet, data sets, and supplementary files are freely available for download at (www.bioinf.cs.ipm.ir/softwares/tripnet).
