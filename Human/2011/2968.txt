Towards an IO intensive Grid application instrumentation in MedioGRID

Obtaining high performance in IO intensive applications requires systems that support reliable fast transfer, data replication, and caching. In this paper we present an architecture designed for supporting IO intensive applications in MedioGRID, a system for real-time processing of satellite images, operating in a Grid environment. The solution ensures that applications which are processing geographical data have uniform access to data and is based on continuous monitoring of the data transfers using MonALISA and its extensions. The MedioGRID architecture is also built on Globus, Condor and PBS and based on this middleware we aim to extract information about the running systems. The results obtained in testing MedioGRID system for large data transfers show that monitoring system provides a very good view of system evolution.
