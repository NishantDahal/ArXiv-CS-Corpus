On the Orchard crossing number of prisms, ladders and other related graphs

This paper deals with the Orchard crossing number of some families of graphs which are based on cycles. These include disjoint cycles, cycles which share a vertex and cycles which share an edge. Specifically, we focus on the prism and ladder graphs.
