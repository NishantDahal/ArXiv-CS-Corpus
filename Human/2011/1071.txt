Least-squares based iterative multipath super-resolution technique

In this paper, we study the problem of multipath channel estimation for direct sequence spread spectrum signals. To resolve multipath components arriving within a short interval, we propose a new algorithm called the least-squares based iterative multipath super-resolution (LIMS). Compared to conventional super-resolution techniques, such as the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and the estimation of signal parameters via rotation invariance techniques (ESPRIT), our algorithm has several appealing features. In particular, even in critical situations where the conventional super-resolution techniques are not very powerful due to limited data or the correlation between path coefficients, the LIMS algorithm can produce successful results. In addition, due to its iterative nature, the LIMS algorithm is suitable for recursive multipath tracking, whereas the conventional super-resolution techniques may not be. Through numerical simulations, we show that the LIMS algorithm can resolve the first arrival path among closely arriving independently faded multipaths with a much lower mean square error than can conventional early-late discriminator based techniques.
