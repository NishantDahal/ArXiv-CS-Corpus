HandsInAir: A Wearable System for Remote Collaboration

We present HandsInAir, a real-time collaborative wearable system for remote collaboration. The system is developed to support real world scenarios in which a remote mobile helper guides a local mobile worker performing a physical task. HandsInAir implements a novel approach to support mobility of remote collaborators. This approach allows the helper to perform gestures without having to touch tangible objects, requiring little environment support. The system consists of two parts: the helper part and the worker part. The two parts are connected via a wireless network and the collaboration partners communicate with each other via audio and visual links. In this paper, we review related work, describe technical implementation of the system and envision future work for further improvements.
