A cognitive diversity framework for radar target classification

Classification of targets by radar has proved to be notoriously difficult with the best systems still yet to attain sufficiently high levels of performance and reliability. In the current contribution we explore a new design of radar based target recognition, where angular diversity is used in a cognitive manner to attain better performance. Performance is bench- marked against conventional classification schemes. The proposed scheme can easily be extended to cognitive target recognition based on multiple diversity strategies.
