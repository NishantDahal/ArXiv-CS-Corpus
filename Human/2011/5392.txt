On quantum interactive proofs with short messages

This paper proves one of the open problem posed by Beigi et al. in arXiv:1004.0411v2. We consider quantum interactive proof systems where in the beginning the verifier and prover send messages to each other with the combined length of all messages being at most logarithmic (in the input length); and at the end the prover sends a polynomial-length message to the verifier. We show that this class has the same expressive power as QMA.
