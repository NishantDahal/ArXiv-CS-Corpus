The MAPLE package for calculating Poincaré series

We offer a Maple package {\tt Poincare\_Series} for calculating the Poincaré series for the algebras of invariants/covariants of binary forms, for the algebras of joint invariants/covariants of several binary forms, for the kernel of Weitzenböck derivations and for the multivariate Poincaré series of algebras of joint invariants/covariants of several binary forms.
