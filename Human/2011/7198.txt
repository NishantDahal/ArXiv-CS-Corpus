Ricean Shadowed Statistical Characterization of Shallow Water Acoustic Channels for Wireless Communications

In this letter, the statistical behaviour of the shallow water acoustic channel for wireless communications is shown to be well characterized by the Ricean shadowed distribution, which has never been proposed for communication purposes on this type of channel. This characterization is clearly motivated from statistical and physical perspectives and has both theoretical and practical advantages compared to previously proposed models.
