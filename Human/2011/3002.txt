Exploiting Reputation in Distributed Virtual Environments

The cognitive research on reputation has shown several interesting properties that can improve both the quality of services and the security in distributed electronic environments. In this paper, the impact of reputation on decision-making under scarcity of information will be shown. First, a cognitive theory of reputation will be presented, then a selection of simulation experimental results from different studies will be discussed. Such results concern the benefits of reputation when agents need to find out good sellers in a virtual market-place under uncertainty and informational cheating.
