Moment based estimation of stochastic Kronecker graph parameters

Stochastic Kronecker graphs supply a parsimonious model for large sparse real world graphs. They can specify the distribution of a large random graph using only three or four parameters. Those parameters have however proved difficult to choose in specific applications. This article looks at method of moments estimators that are computationally much simpler than maximum likelihood. The estimators are fast and in our examples, they typically yield Kronecker parameters with expected feature counts closer to a given graph than we get from KronFit. The improvement was especially prominent for the number of triangles in the graph.
