Cryptanalyzing a chaos-based image encryption algorithm using alternate structure

Recently, a chaos-based image encryption algorithm using alternate structure (IEAS) was proposed. This paper focuses on differential cryptanalysis of the algorithm and finds that some properties of IEAS can support a differential attack to recover equivalent secret key with a little small number of known plain-images. Detailed approaches of the cryptanalysis for cryptanalyzing IEAS of the lower round number are presented and the breaking method can be extended to the case of higher round number. Both theoretical analysis and experiment results are provided to support vulnerability of IEAS against differential attack. In addition, some other security defects of IEAS, including insensitivity with respect to changes of plain-images and insufficient size of key space, are also reported.
