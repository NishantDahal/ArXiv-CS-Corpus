Two Dimensional Random Patterns

A new approach to the generation of random sequences and two dimensional random patterns is proposed in this paper in which random sequences are generated by making use of either Delaunay triangulation or Voronoi diagrams drawn from random points taken in a two dimensional plane. Both the random sequences and two dimensional random patterns generated in this manner are shown to be more random when compared to pseudo-random sequences and patterns.
