Multi-Robot Searching Algorithm Using Levy Flight and Artificial Potential Field

An efficient search algorithm is very crucial in robotic area, especially for exploration missions, where the target availability is unknown and the condition of the environment is highly unpredictable. In a very large environment, it is not sufficient to scan an area or volume by a single robot, multiple robots should be involved to perform the collective exploration. In this paper, we propose to combine bio-inspired search algorithm called Levy flight and artificial potential field method to perform an efficient searching algorithm for multi-robot applications. The main focus of this work is not only to prove the concept or to measure the efficiency of the algorithm by experiments, but also to develop an appropriate generic framework to be implemented both in simulation and on real robotic platforms. Several experiments, which compare different search algorithms, are also performed.
