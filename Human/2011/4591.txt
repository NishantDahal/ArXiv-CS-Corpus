Heisenberg uncertainty relation and statistical measures in the square well

A non stationary state in the one-dimensional infinite square well formed by a combination of the ground state and the first excited one is considered. The statistical complexity and the Fisher-Shannon entropy in position and momentum are calculated with time for this system. These measures are compared with the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, ΔxΔp. It is observed that the extreme values of ΔxΔp coincide in time with extreme values of the other two statistical magnitudes.
