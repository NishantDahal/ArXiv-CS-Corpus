Analytical approach to model of scientific revolutions

The model of scientific paradigms spreading throughout the community of agents with memory is analyzed using the master equation. The case of two competing ideas is considered for various networks of interactions, including agents placed at Erdős-Rényi graphs or complete graphs. The pace of adopting a new idea by a community is analyzed, along with the distribution of periods after which a new idea replaces the old one. The approach is extended for the chain topology onto the more general case when more than two ideas compete. Our analytical results are in agreement with numerical simulations.
