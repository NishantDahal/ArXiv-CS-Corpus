Hybrid complex network topologies are preferred for component-subscription in large-scale data-centres

We report on experiments exploring the interplay between the topology of the complex network of dependent components in a large-scale data-centre, and the robustness and scaling properties of that data-centre. In a previous paper [1] we used the SPECI large-scale data-centre simulator [2] to compare the robustness and scaling characteristics of data-centres whose dependent components are connected via Strogatz-Watts small-world (SW) networks [3], versus those organized as Barabasi-Albert scale-free (SF) networks [4], and found significant differences. In this paper, we present results from using the Klemm-Eguiliz (KE) construction method [5] to generate complex network topologies for data-centre component dependencies. The KE model has a control parameter μ\in[0,1]\inR that determines whether the networks generated are SW (0<μ<<1) or SF (μ=1) or a "hybrid" network topology part-way between SW and SF (0<μ<1). We find that the best scores for system-level performance metrics of the simulated data-centres are given by "hybrid" values of μ significantly different from pure-SW or pure-SF.
