Framework Architecture for WLAN Testbed

There has been a tremendous effort in improving wireless LAN for supporting the demanding multimedia application. Many new protocols or ideas have been proposed and proved by using a mathematical model or running a simulation program. That is satisfactory but these proposed designs might not work in the real world situation. Testbed is an option to alleviate this gap and present the opportunity to see the real problem and ensure that the design works. A framework architecture for building a testbed to test a new concept or design is presented in this paper. The framework is designed in the modularity style in such a way that can be easily exchanged or modified. A testbed based on the framework that implements the polling based mechanism has been created and the results have shown that the QoS of the real time traffic can be maintained in the presence of the high non-real time traffic.
