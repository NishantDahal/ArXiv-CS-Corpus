Considerations and Results in Multimedia and DVB Application Development on Philips Nexperia Platform

This paper presents some experiments regarding applications development on high performance media processors included in Philips Nexperia Family. The PNX1302 dedicated DVB-T kit used has some limitations. Our work has succeeded to overcome these limitations and to make possible a general-purpose use of this kit. For exemplification two typical applications, important both for multimedia and DVB, are analyzed: MPEG2 video stream decoding and MP3 audio decoding. These original implementations are compared (in speed, memory requirements and costs) with Philips Nexperia Library.
