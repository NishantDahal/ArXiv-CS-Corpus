What's in an Attribute? Consequences for the Least Common Subsumer

Functional relationships between objects, called    `attributes', are of considerable importance in knowledge    representation languages, including Description Logics (DLs). A study    of the literature indicates that papers have made, often implicitly,    different assumptions about the nature of attributes: whether they are    always required to have a value, or whether they can be partial    functions. The work presented here is the first explicit study of this    difference for subclasses of the CLASSIC DL, involving the same-as    concept constructor.  It is shown that although determining    subsumption between concept descriptions has the same complexity    (though requiring different algorithms), the story is different in the    case of determining the least common subsumer (lcs). For attributes    interpreted as partial functions, the lcs exists and can be computed    relatively easily; even in this case our results correct and extend    three previous papers about the lcs of DLs.  In the case where    attributes must have a value, the lcs may not exist, and even if it    exists it may be of exponential size.  Interestingly, it is possible    to decide in polynomial time if the lcs exists.
