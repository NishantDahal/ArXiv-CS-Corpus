On the Compilability and Expressive Power of Propositional Planning Formalisms

The recent approaches of extending the GRAPHPLAN algorithm    to handle more expressive planning formalisms raise the question of    what the formal meaning of "expressive power" is. We formalize the    intuition that expressive power is a measure of how concisely planning    domains and plans can be expressed in a particular formalism by    introducing the notion of "compilation schemes" between planning    formalisms.  Using this notion, we analyze the expressiveness of a    large family of propositional planning formalisms, ranging from basic    STRIPS to a formalism with conditional effects, partial state    specifications, and propositional formulae in the preconditions.  One    of the results is that conditional effects cannot be compiled away if    plan size should grow only linearly but can be compiled away if we    allow for polynomial growth of the resulting plans. This result    confirms that the recently proposed extensions to the GRAPHPLAN    algorithm concerning conditional effects are optimal with respect to    the "compilability" framework.  Another result is that general    propositional formulae cannot be compiled into conditional effects if    the plan size should be preserved linearly.  This implies that    allowing general propositional formulae in preconditions and effect    conditions adds another level of difficulty in generating a plan.
