On the Delone property of (-β)-integers

The (-β)-integers are natural generalisations of the β-integers, and thus of the integers, for negative real bases. They can be described by infinite words which are fixed points of anti-morphisms. We show that they are not necessarily uniformly discrete and relatively dense in the real numbers.
