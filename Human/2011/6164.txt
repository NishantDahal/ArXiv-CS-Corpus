The Stanford RNA Mapping Database for sharing and visualizing RNA structure mapping experiments

We have established an RNA Mapping Database (RMDB) to enable a new generation of structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic studies from quantitative single-nucleotide-resolution RNA structure mapping (freely available at http://rmdb.stanford.edu). Chemical and enzymatic mapping is a rapid, robust, and widespread approach to RNA characterization. Since its recent coupling with high-throughput sequencing techniques, accelerated software pipelines, and large-scale mutagenesis, the volume of mapping data has greatly increased, and there is a critical need for a database to enable sharing, visualization, and meta-analyses of these data. Through its on-line front-end, the RMDB allows users to explore single-nucleotide-resolution chemical accessibility data in heat-map, bar-graph, and colored secondary structure graphics; to leverage these data to generate secondary structure hypotheses; and to download the data in standardized and computer-friendly files, including the RDAT and community-consensus SNRNASM formats. At the time of writing, the database houses 38 entries, describing 2659 RNA sequences and comprising 355,084 data points, and is growing rapidly.
