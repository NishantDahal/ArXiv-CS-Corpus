Survey of Latest Wireless Cellular Technologies for Enhancement of Spectral Density at Reduced Cost

The future of mobile wireless communication networks will include existing 3rd generation, 4th generation (implemented in Japan, USA, South Korea etc.), 5th generation (based on cognitive radio which implies the whole wireless world interconnection & WISDOM - Wireless innovative System for Dynamic Operating Megacommunications concept), 6th generation (with very high data rates Quality of Service (QoS) and service applications) and 7th generation (with space roaming). This paper is focused on the specifications of future generations and latest technologies to be used in future wireless mobile communication networks. However keeping in view the general poor masses of India, some of the future generation technologies will be embedded with 2G and 2.5G so that general masses may get the advantage of internet, multimedia services and the operators may get proper revenues with little extra expenditure in the existing mobile communication networks.
