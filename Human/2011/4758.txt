FIFA World Cup 2010: A Network Analysis of the Champion Team Play

We analyze the pass network among the players of the Spanish team (the world champion in the FIFA World Cup 2010), with the objective of explaining the results obtained from the behavior at the complex network level. The team is considered a network with players as nodes and passes as (directed) edges, and a temporal analysis of the resulting passes network is done, looking at the number of passes, length of the chain of passes, and the centrality of players in the turf. Results of the last three matches indicate that the clustering coefficient of the pass network increases with time, and stays high, indicating possession by Spanish players, which eventually leads to victory, even as the density of the pass network decreases with time.
