Modality for Free: Notes on Adding the Tarskian MÃ¶glichkeit to Substructural Logics

We briefly examine the modal formulae that can be derived in Multiplicative Additive Linear Logic (MALL) and some extensions by using Tarksi's extensional modal operators. We also breifly compare this with a substructural form of the modal logic K.
