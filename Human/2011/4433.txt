Three-dimensional Torques and Power of Horse Forelimb Joints at Trot

Reasons for Performing Study: Equine gait analysis has focused on 2D analysis in the sagittal plane, while descriptions of 3D kinetics and ground reaction force could provide more information on the Equine gait analysis. 
Hypothesis or Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the 3D torques and powers of the forelimb joints at trotting. 
Methods: Eight sound horses were used in the study. A full 3D torque and power for elbow, carpus, fetlock, pastern and coffin joints of right forelimb in horses at trot were obtained by calculating the inverse kinetics of simplified link segmental model. 
Results: Over two third of energy (70%) generated by all joints come from stance phase, and most of energy generated was by elbow joint both in stance (77%) and sway (88%) phases. Energy absorbed by all joints during stance (40%) and sway (60%) phases respectively is not a big difference. During stance phase, all most two third of energy (65%) absorbed was by fetlock joint, while over two third of energy (74%) absorbed was by carpus joint during sway phase. 
Conclusions & Clinical Relevance: This study presents a full 3D kinetic analysis of the relative motion of the humerus, radius, cannon, pastern and coffin segments of the forelimb at the trot. The results could provide for a more sensitive measure for kinetic analysis.
