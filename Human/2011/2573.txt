New Heuristic Rounding Approaches to the Quadratic Assignment Problem

Quadratic assignment problem is one of the great challenges in combinatorial optimization. It has many applications in Operations research and Computer Science. In this paper, the author extends the most-used rounding approach to a one-parametric optimization model for the quadratic assignment problems. A near-optimum parameter is also predestinated. The numerical experiments confirm the efficiency.
