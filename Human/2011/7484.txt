Using Quasigroups for Generating Pseudorandom Numbers

This paper presents an algorithm for generating pseudorandom numbers using quasigroups. Random numbers have several applications in the area of secure communication. The proposed algorithm uses a matrix of size n x n which is pre-generated and stored. The quality of random numbers generated is compared with other pseudorandom number generator using Marsaglia's Diehard battery of tests.
