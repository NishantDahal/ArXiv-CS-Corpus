Pattern 1^j0^i avoiding binary words

In this paper we study the enumeration and the construction, according to the number of ones, of particular binary words avoiding a fixed pattern.  The growth of such words can be described by particular jumping and marked succession rules. This approach enables us to obtain an algorithm which constructs all binary words having a fixed number of ones and then kills those containing the forbidden pattern.
