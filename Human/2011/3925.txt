Study of a Hybrid - Analog TV and Ethernet- Home Data Link using a Coaxial Cable

The paper presents an implementation and compatibility tests of a simple home network implemented in a nonconventional manner using a CATV coaxial cable. Reusing the cable, normally designated to supply RF modulated TV signals from cable TV networks, makes possible to add data services as well. A short presentation of the technology is given with an investigation of the main performances obtained using this technique. The measurements revealed that this simple solution makes possible to have both TV and data services with performances close to traditional home data services: cable modems or ADSL, with minimal investments. This technology keeps also open the possibility for future improvements of the network: DVB-C or Data via Cable Modems.
