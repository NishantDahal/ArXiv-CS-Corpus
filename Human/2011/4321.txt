Transfer of semantics from argumentation frameworks to logic programming A preliminary report

There are various interesting semantics' (extensions) designed for argumentation frameworks. They enable to assign a meaning, e.g., to odd-length cycles. Our main motivation is to transfer semantics' proposed by Baroni, Giacomin and Guida for argumetation frameworks with odd-length cycles to logic programs with odd-length cycles through default negation. The developed construction is even stronger. For a given logic program an argumentation framework is defined. The construction enables to transfer each semantics of the resulting argumentation framework to a semantics of the given logic program. Weak points of the construction are discussed and some future continuations of this approach are outlined.
