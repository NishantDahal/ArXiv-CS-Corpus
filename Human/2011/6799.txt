An efficient implementation of the simulated annealing heuristic for the quadratic assignment problem

The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is one of the most difficult combinatorial optimization problems. One of the most powerful and commonly used heuristics to obtain approximations to the optimal solution of the QAP is simulated annealing (SA). We present an efficient implementation of the SA heuristic which performs more than 100 times faster then existing implementations for large problem sizes and a large number of SA iterations.
