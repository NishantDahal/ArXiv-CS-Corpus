Supporting the Curation of Twitter User Lists

Twitter introduced lists in late 2009 as a means of curating tweets into meaningful themes. Lists were quickly adopted by media companies as a means of organising content around news stories. Thus the curation of these lists is important, they should contain the key information gatekeepers and present a balanced perspective on the story. Identifying members to add to a list on an emerging topic is a delicate process. From a network analysis perspective there are a number of views on the Twitter network that can be explored, e.g. followers, retweets mentions etc. We present a process for integrating these views in order to recommend authoritative commentators to include on a list. This process is evaluated on manually curated lists about unrest in Bahrain and the Iowa caucuses for the 2012 US election.
