Boolean logic gate design principles in unconventional computers: an NMR case study

We present a general method for analysing novel computational substrates to determine which of their parameters can be manipulated to exhibit the complete set of 2-input boolean logical operations. We demonstrate this approach with an NMR-based case study, showing which NMR parameters can be used to perform boolean logic.
