Interfacial Numerical Dispersion and New Conformal FDTD Method

This article shows the interfacial relation in electrodynamics shall be corrected in discrete grid form which can be seen as certain numerical dispersion beyond the usual bulk type. Furthermore we construct a lossy conductor model to illustrate how to simulate more general materials other than traditional PEC or simple dielectrics, by a new conformal FDTD method which main considers the effects of penetrative depth and the distribution of free bulk electric charge and current.
