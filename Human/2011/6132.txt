Open Input: A New Way for Websites to Grow

Regardless of current web 2.0 and 3.0 trends, there are still a lot of websites made in web 1.0 style. These websites have fixed pages which are editable only by owner and not by community. It is normal for a lot of cases, but looks like not modern and engaging approach. Are there any ways to make these sites closer to life? This paper is devoted to open input technique, a way for websites of web 1.0 era to grow and evolve community. The idea of open input, in general, means that anybody from the web can add information to any section of the website even without registration on that website. People can add news, billboard announcements, testimonials, questions, pictures, videos etc - whatever site owner permitted. We have tested this idea in practice and have positive results approving that open input is a vital approach for collaboration on the web.
