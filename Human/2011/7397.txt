ECAKP: Encrypt Collect Authenticate Kill Play

We are taught from a young age that plagiarism (copying other's work) is wrong. However, the problem of Illegal copies of multimedia data is exacerbated by the widespread availability of circumvention devices, which enable people to make infringing copies of multimedia data. Recently, Joint Video Compression and Encryption (JVCE) has gained increased attention to reduce the computational complexity of video compression, as well as provide encryption of multimedia data. In this paper, a novel protection method for multimedia data (ECAKP) is proposed. It combines encryption process and compression with authenticating process. The method had been implemented and the results are discussed in detail.
