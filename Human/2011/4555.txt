Generalised elastic nets

The elastic net was introduced as a heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimisation and has been applied, among other problems, to biological modelling. It has an energy function which trades off a fitness term against a tension term. In the original formulation of the algorithm the tension term was implicitly based on a first-order derivative. In this paper we generalise the elastic net model to an arbitrary quadratic tension term, e.g. derived from a discretised differential operator, and give an efficient learning algorithm. We refer to these as generalised elastic nets (GENs). We give a theoretical analysis of the tension term for 1D nets with periodic boundary conditions, and show that the model is sensitive to the choice of finite difference scheme that represents the discretised derivative. We illustrate some of these issues in the context of cortical map models, by relating the choice of tension term to a cortical interaction function. In particular, we prove that this interaction takes the form of a Mexican hat for the original elastic net, and of progressively more oscillatory Mexican hats for higher-order derivatives. The results apply not only to generalised elastic nets but also to other methods using discrete differential penalties, and are expected to be useful in other areas, such as data analysis, computer graphics and optimisation problems.
