X-ray view on a Class using Conceptual Analysis in Java Environment

Modularity is one of the most important principles in software engineering and a necessity for every practical software. Since the design space of software is generally quite large, it is valuable to provide automatic means to help modularizing it. An automatic technique for software modularization is object- oriented concept analysis (OOCA). X-ray view of the class is one of the aspect of this Object oriented concept analysis. We shall use this concept in a java environment.
