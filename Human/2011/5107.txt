Three Cases of Connectivity and Global Information Transfer in Robot Swarms

In this work we consider three different cases of robot-robot interactions and resulting global information transfer in robot swarms. These mechanisms define cooperative properties of the system and can be used for designing collective behavior. These three cases are demonstrated and discussed based on experiments in a swarm of microrobots "Jasmine".
