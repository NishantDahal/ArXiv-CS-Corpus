Feature-Based Matrix Factorization

Recommender system has been more and more popular and widely used in many applications recently. The increasing information available, not only in quantities but also in types, leads to a big challenge for recommender system that how to leverage these rich information to get a better performance. Most traditional approaches try to design a specific model for each scenario, which demands great efforts in developing and modifying models. In this technical report, we describe our implementation of feature-based matrix factorization. This model is an abstract of many variants of matrix factorization models, and new types of information can be utilized by simply defining new features, without modifying any lines of code. Using the toolkit, we built the best single model reported on track 1 of KDDCup'11.
