DWT Based Fingerprint Recognition using Non Minutiae Features

Forensic applications like criminal investigations, terrorist identification and National security issues require a strong fingerprint data base and efficient identification system. In this paper we propose DWT based Fingerprint Recognition using Non Minutiae (DWTFR) algorithm. Fingerprint image is decomposed into multi resolution sub bands of LL, LH, HL and HH by applying 3 level DWT. The Dominant local orientation angle Î¸ and Coherence are computed on LL band only. The Centre Area Features and Edge Parameters are determined on each DWT level by considering all four sub bands. The comparison of test fingerprint with database fingerprint is decided based on the Euclidean Distance of all the features. It is observed that the values of FAR, FRR and TSR are improved compared to the existing algorithm.
