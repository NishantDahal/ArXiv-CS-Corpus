Proceedings Second Workshop on Logics for Component Configuration

This volume contains the papers presented at the second international workshop on Logics for Component Configuration (LoCoCo 2011) which was associated with the International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2011) and which took place on September 12, 2011 in Perugia, Italy. Representing and solving configuration problems is a hot topic of great importance for many application domains. For example, modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide the necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution, but also are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large repository of possible choices, and configuring these components according to user needs, resource constraints, and interdependencies with other components. Some well-known examples of complex systems of components in the world of Free and Open Source software are the different distributions for GNU/Linux, BSD, or Eclipse plugins. The LoCoCo workshop focus on logic-based methods for specifying and solving complex configuration problems. The goal of the workshop was to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the area of component configuration of systems, using different modeling and solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programming, description logics, satisfiability and its extensions. The workshop was an opportunity to discuss common and complementary solutions for solving component configuration.
