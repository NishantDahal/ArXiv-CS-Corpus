Dynamical generalizations of the Lagrange spectrum

We compute two invariants of topological conjugacy, the upper and lower limits of the inverse of Boshernitzan's ne_n, where e_n is the smallest measure of a cylinder of length n, for three families of symbolic systems, the natural codings of rotations and three-interval exchanges and the Arnoux-Rauzy systems. The sets of values of these invariants for a given family of systems generalize the Lagrange spectrum, which is what we get for the family of rotations with the upper limit of 1/ne_n.
