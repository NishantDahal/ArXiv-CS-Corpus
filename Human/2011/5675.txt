Un modello di struttura dinamica per ebook scolastici

This article proposes a model of e-books for schools based on a graph in which nodes represent individual subjects of a teaching program to a the relatively low granularity, which facilitates their aggregation and re-usability, and edges represent prerequisites between subjects (and, indeed, between nodes). On this graph we will develop a series of simple algorithms that allow both teachers and students to assemble an interactive and personalized ebook that, respecting the prerequisites, it will be significant from the point of methodological and stylistic sense. Therefore, teachers and students do not have available a set of unrelated units neither a limited set a few pre-packaged learning paths, as it is typical of some solutions on the Web, but rather will have a network of topics that can be serialized in a combinatorial vast number of alternatives, and therefore can create as many custom ebook, but guaranteed from the point of view of the scientific perspective.
