Independent sets of words and the synchronization problem

The synchronization problem is investigated for the class of locally strongly transitive automata introduced in a previous work of the authors. Some extensions of this problem related to the notions of stable set and word of minimal rank of an automaton are studied. An application to synchronizing colorings of aperiodic graphs with a Hamiltonian path is also considered.
