Bandits with an Edge

We consider a bandit problem over a graph where the rewards are not directly observed. Instead, the decision maker can compare two nodes and receive (stochastic) information pertaining to the difference in their value. The graph structure describes the set of possible comparisons. Consequently, comparing between two nodes that are relatively far requires estimating the difference between every pair of nodes on the path between them. We analyze this problem from the perspective of sample complexity: How many queries are needed to find an approximately optimal node with probability more than $1-Î´$ in the PAC setup? We show that the topology of the graph plays a crucial in defining the sample complexity: graphs with a low diameter have a much better sample complexity.
