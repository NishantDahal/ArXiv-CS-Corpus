Convex hulls of spheres and convex hulls of convex polytopes lying on parallel hyperplanes

Given a set $Σ$ of spheres in $\mathbb{E}^d$, with $d\ge{}3$ and $d$ odd, having a fixed number of $m$ distinct radii $ρ_1,ρ_2,...,ρ_m$, we show that the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the convex hull $CH_d(Σ)$ of $Σ$ is $Θ(\sum_{1\le{}i\ne{}j\le{}m}n_in_j^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor})$, where $n_i$ is the number of spheres in $Σ$ with radius $ρ_i$.
  To prove the lower bound, we construct a set of $Θ(n_1+n_2)$ spheres in $\mathbb{E}^d$, with $d\ge{}3$ odd, where $n_i$ spheres have radius $ρ_i$, $i=1,2$, and $ρ_2\neρ_1$, such that their convex hull has combinatorial complexity $Ω(n_1n_2^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor}+n_2n_1^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor})$. Our construction is then generalized to the case where the spheres have $m\ge{}3$ distinct radii.
  For the upper bound, we reduce the sphere convex hull problem to the problem of computing the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the convex hull of a set of $m$ $d$-dimensional convex polytopes lying on $m$ parallel hyperplanes in $\mathbb{E}^{d+1}$, where $d\ge{}3$ odd, a problem which is of independent interest. More precisely, we show that the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the convex hull of a set $\{\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2,...,\mathcal{P}_m\}$ of $m$ $d$-dimensional convex polytopes lying on $m$ parallel hyperplanes of $\mathbb{E}^{d+1}$ is $O(\sum_{1\le{}i\ne{}j\le{}m}n_in_j^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor})$, where $n_i$ is the number of vertices of $\mathcal{P}_i$.
  We end with algorithmic considerations, and we show how our tight bounds for the parallel polytope convex hull problem, yield tight bounds on the combinatorial complexity of the Minkowski sum of two convex polytopes in $\mathbb{E}^d$.
