Model based system engineering approach of a lightweight embedded TCP/IP

The use of embedded software is growing very rapidly. Accessing the internet is a necessary service which has large range of applications in many fields. The Internet is based on TCP/IP which is a very important stack. Although TCP/IP is very important there is not a software engineering model describing it. The common method in modeling and describing TCP/IP is RFCs which is not sufficient for software engineer and developers. Therefore there is a need for software engineering approach to help engineers and developers to customize their own web based applications for embedded systems. This research presents a model based system engineering approach of lightweight TCP/IP. The model contains the necessary phases for developing a lightweight TCP/IP for embedded systems. The proposed model is based on SysML as a model based system engineering language.
