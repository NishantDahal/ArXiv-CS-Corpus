Real-Time Performance Analysis of Infrastructure-based IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function

With the increasing popularity of wireless networks, wireless local area networks (WLANs) have attracted significant research interest, which play a critical role in providing anywhere and anytime connectivity. For WLANs the IEEE 802.11 standard is the most mature technology and has been widely adopted for wireless networks. This paper analyzes real-time performance of the IEEE 802.11 standard that adopts the MAC protocol of Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) operating in infrastructure mode. Extensive simulations have been done to examine how the network performance in terms of realtime metrics including effective data rate, latency and packet loss rate will be impacted by some critical parameters (e.g. CWmin and packet payload). The results are presented and analyzed. The analysis of simulation results can provide support for parameter configuration and optimization of WLANs for realtime applications.
