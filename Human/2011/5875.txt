Stochastic Ordering based Carrier-to-Interference Ratio Analysis for the Shotgun Cellular Systems

A simple analytical tool based on stochastic ordering is developed to compare the distributions of carrier-to-interference ratio at the mobile station of two cellular systems where the base stations are distributed randomly according to certain non-homogeneous Poisson point processes. The comparison is conveniently done by studying only the base station densities without having to solve for the distributions of the carrier-to-interference ratio, that are often hard to obtain.
