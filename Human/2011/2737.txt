Affine trajectory correction for nonholonomic mobile robots

Planning trajectories for nonholonomic systems is difficult and computationally expensive. When facing unexpected events, it may therefore be preferable to deform in some way the initially planned trajectory rather than to re-plan entirely a new one. We suggest here a method based on affine transformations to make such deformations. This method is exact and fast: the deformations and the resulting trajectories can be computed algebraically, in one step, and without any trajectory re-integration. To demonstrate the possibilities offered by this new method, we use it to derive position and orientation correction algorithms for the general class of planar wheeled robots and for a tridimensional underwater vehicle. These algorithms allow in turn achieving more complex applications, including obstacle avoidance, feedback control or gap filling for sampling-based kinodynamic planners.
