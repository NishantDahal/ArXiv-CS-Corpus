Quantum information approach to the ultimatum game

The paper is devoted to quantization of extensive games with the use of both the Marinatto-Weber and the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein concept of quantum game. We revise the current conception of quantum ultimatum game and we show why the proposal is unacceptable. To support our comment, we present the new idea of the quantum ultimatum game. Our scheme also makes a point of departure for a protocol to quantize extensive games.
