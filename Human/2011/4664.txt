On a New Multicomputer Interconnection Topology for Massively Parallel Systems

This paper introduces a new interconnection network topology called Balanced Varietal Hypercube (BVH), suitable for massively parallel systems. The proposed topology being a hybrid structure retains almost all the attractive properties of Balanced Hypercube and Varietal Hypercube. The topology, various parameters, routing and broadcasting of Balanced Varietal Hypercube are presented. The performance of the Balanced Varietal Hypercube is compared with other networks. In terms of diameter, cost and average distance and reliability the proposed network is found to be better than the Hypercube, Balanced Hypercube and Varietal Hypercube. Also it is more reliable and cost-effective than Hypercube and Balanced Hypercube.
