Image Encryption Based on Diffusion and Multiple Chaotic Maps

In the recent world, security is a prime important issue, and encryption is one of the best alternative way to ensure security. More over, there are many image encryption schemes have been proposed, each one of them has its own strength and weakness. This paper presents a new algorithm for the image encryption/decryption scheme. This paper is devoted to provide a secured image encryption technique using multiple chaotic based circular mapping. In this paper, first, a pair of sub keys is given by using chaotic logistic maps. Second, the image is encrypted using logistic map sub key and in its transformation leads to diffusion process. Third, sub keys are generated by four different chaotic maps. Based on the initial conditions, each map may produce various random numbers from various orbits of the maps. Among those random numbers, a particular number and from a particular orbit are selected as a key for the encryption algorithm. Based on the key, a binary sequence is generated to control the encryption algorithm. The input image of 2-D is transformed into a 1- D array by using two different scanning pattern (raster and Zigzag) and then divided into various sub blocks. Then the position permutation and value permutation is applied to each binary matrix based on multiple chaos maps. Finally the receiver uses the same sub keys to decrypt the encrypted images. The salient features of the proposed image encryption method are loss-less, good peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Symmetric key encryption, less cross correlation, very large number of secret keys, and key-dependent pixel value replacement.
