Constructive proof of the existence of Nash Equilibrium in a finite strategic game with sequentially locally non-constant payoff functions by Sperner's lemma

Using Sperner's lemma for modified partition of a simplex we will constructively prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium in a finite strategic game with sequentially locally non-constant payoff functions. We follow the Bishop style constructive mathematics.
