3D Protein Structure Predicted from Sequence

The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by function and three-dimensional (3D) structure. Residues in spatial proximity tend to co-evolve, yet attempts to invert the evolutionary record to identify these constraints and use them to computationally fold proteins have so far been unsuccessful. Here, we show that co-variation of residue pairs, observed in a large protein family, provides sufficient information to determine 3D protein structure. Using a data-constrained maximum entropy model of the multiple sequence alignment, we identify pairs of statistically coupled residue positions which are expected to be close in the protein fold, termed contacts inferred from evolutionary information (EICs). To assess the amount of information about the protein fold contained in these coupled pairs, we evaluate the accuracy of predicted 3D structures for proteins of 50-260 residues, from 15 diverse protein families, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These structure predictions are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The resulting low Cα-RMSD error range of 2.7-5.1Å, over at least 75% of the protein, indicates the potential for predicting essentially correct 3D structures for the thousands of protein families that have no known structure, provided they include a sufficiently large number of divergent sample sequences. With the current enormous growth in sequence information based on new sequencing technology, this opens the door to a comprehensive survey of protein 3D structures, including many not currently accessible to the experimental methods of structural genomics. This advance has potential applications in many biological contexts, such as synthetic biology, identification of functional sites in proteins and interpretation of the functional impact of genetic variants.
