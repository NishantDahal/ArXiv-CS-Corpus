Effects of MAC Approaches on Non-Monotonic Saturation with COPE - A Simple Case Study

We construct a simple network model to provide insight into network design strategies. We show that the model can be used to address various approaches to network coding, MAC, and multi-packet reception so that their effects on network throughput can be evaluated. We consider several topology components which exhibit the same non-monotonic saturation behavior found within the Katti et. al. COPE experiments. We further show that fairness allocation by the MAC can seriously impact performance and cause this non-monotonic saturation. Using our model, we develop a MAC that provides monotonic saturation, higher saturation throughput gains and fairness among flows rather than nodes. The proposed model provides an estimate of the achievable gains for the cross-layer design of network coding, multi-packet reception, and MAC showing that super-additive throughput gains on the order of six times that of routing are possible.
