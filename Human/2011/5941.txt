Applying statistical methods to text steganography

This paper presents a survey of text steganography methods used for hid- ing secret information inside some covertext. Widely known hiding techniques (such as translation based steganography, text generating and syntactic embed- ding) and detection are considered. It is shown that statistical analysis has an important role in text steganalysis.
