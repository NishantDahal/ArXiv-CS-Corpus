Optimal Base Station Placement: A Stochastic Method Using Interference Gradient In Downlink Case

In this paper, we study the optimal placement and optimal number of base stations added to an existing wireless data network through the interference gradient method. This proposed method considers a sub-region of the existing wireless data network, hereafter called region of interest. In this region, the provider wants to increase the network coverage and the users throughput. In this aim, the provider needs to determine the optimal number of base stations to be added and their optimal placement. The proposed approach is based on the Delaunay triangulation of the region of interest and the gradient descent method in each triangle to compute the minimum interference locations. We quantify the increase of coverage and throughput.
