On the Stability Region of Multi-Queue Multi-Server Queueing Systems with Stationary Channel Distribution

In this paper, we characterize the stability region of multi-queue multi-server (MQMS) queueing systems with stationary channel and packet arrival processes. Toward this, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of the system are derived under general arrival processes with finite first and second moments. We show that when the arrival processes are stationary, the stability region form is a polytope for which we explicitly find the coefficients of the linear inequalities which characterize the stability region polytope.
