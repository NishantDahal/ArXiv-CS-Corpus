Evaluation of Fiji National University Campus Information Systems

Fiji National University (FNU) has been encountering many difficulties with its current campus administrative systems. These difficulties include accessibility, scalability, performance, flexibility and integration. In order to address these difficulties, we developed a thin client web based campus information system. The newly designed system allows the students, academic and administration staff of the university to handle their day to day affairs with the university online. In this paper we describe three types of evaluation carried out to determine the suitability of newly developed system for FNU environment. User interface evaluation was carried out to assess user interface on a set of usability principles, usability evaluation to see the ease at which users can use the system and finally performance evaluation to verify and validate user response time required to complete various tasks. The result of each of these evaluations were analysed and the system was rectified as part of iterative design process.
