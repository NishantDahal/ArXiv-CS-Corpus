Graph Searching, Parity Games and Imperfect Information

We investigate the interrelation between graph searching games and games with imperfect information. As key consequence we obtain that parity games with bounded imperfect information can be solved in PTIME on graphs of bounded DAG-width which generalizes several results for parity games on graphs of bounded complexity. We use a new concept of graph searching where several cops try to catch multiple robbers instead of just a single robber. The main technical result is that the number of cops needed to catch r robbers monotonously is at most r times the DAG-width of the graph. We also explore aspects of this new concept as a refinement of directed path-width which accentuates its connection to the concept of imperfect information.
