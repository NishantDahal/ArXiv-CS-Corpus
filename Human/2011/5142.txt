IR-based Communication and Perception in Microrobotic Swarms

In this work we consider development of IR-based communication and perception mechanisms for real microrobotic systems. It is demonstrated that a specific combination of hardware and software elements provides capabilities for navigation, objects recognition, directional and unidirectional communication. We discuss open issues and their resolution based on the experiments in the swarm of microrobots "Jasmine".
