Proceedings Fifth Workshop on Formal Languages and Analysis of Contract-Oriented Software

This volume consists of the proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Formal Languages and Analysis of Contract-Oriented Software (FLACOS'11). The FLACOS Workshops serve as annual meeting places to bring together researchers and practitioners working on language-based solutions to contract-oriented software development. High-level models of contracts are needed as a tool to negotiate contracts and provide services conforming to them. This Workshop provides language-based solutions to the above issues through formalization of contracts, design of appropriate abstraction mechanisms, and formal analysis of contract languages and software. The program of this edition consists of 5 regular papers and 3 invited presentations.
