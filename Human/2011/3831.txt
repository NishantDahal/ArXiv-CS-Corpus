New construction of APN quaratic

The purpose of this paper is to detail the article of Carlet. Along the way I recall some interesting results in the theory of finite fields, I give (new) proofs of some known results, and then I generalize the construction of a family of APN function. The reference precedes each result, and in the absence of reference the proof is due to the author.
