An Adaptive Technique using Advanced Encryption Standard to Implement Hard Disk Security

The main objective of the paper is to study and develop an efficient method for Hard Disk Drive(HDD) Security using Full Disk Encryption (FDE) with Advanced Encryption Standards(AES) for data security specifically for Personal Computers(PCS) and Laptops . The focus of this work is to authenticate and protect the content of HDD from illegal use. The paper proposes an adaptive methods for protecting a HDD based on FDE. The proposed method is labeled as DiskTrust. FDE encrypts entire content or a single volume on your disk. DiskTrust implements Symmetric key cryptography with, Advanced Encryption Standards. Finally, the applicability of these methodologies for HDD security will be evaluated on a set of data files with different key sizes.
