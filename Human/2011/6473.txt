Agile Professional Virtual Community Inheritance via Adaptation of Social Protocols

Support for human-to-human interactions over a network is still insufficient, particularly for professional virtual communities (PVC). Among other limitations, adaptation and learning-by-experience capabilities of humans are not taken into account in existing models for collaboration processes in PVC. This paper presents a model for adaptive human collaboration. A key element of this model is the use of negotiation for adaptation of social protocols modelling processes. A second contribution is the proposition of various adaptation propagation strategies as means for continuous management of the PVC inheritance.
