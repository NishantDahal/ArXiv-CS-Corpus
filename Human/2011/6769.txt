Throughput Performance of 2$\times$2 Mimo LTE Downlink in a Spatial Correlation Based Microcellular Channel for Wireless Broadband Networks

Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology is going to be a viable alternative for future generation wireless broadband services in order to meet the striving requirements for throughput and system robustness. In Long Term Evolution (LTE), MIMO technologies have been broadly used to get better downlink peak rate, cell coverage, as well as average cell throughput. In the present paper a 2x2 MIMO is taken as baseline configuration for a LTE downlink under a Microcellular propagation scenario considering a non physical correlation based channel with Poor and rich scattering environment. The throughput capacity of the downlink is obtained for poor and rich scattering environments. Besides, two vital aspects of MIMO technique viz Spatial Multiplexing (SM) and Transmit Diversity (TD) are investigated in order to see their effect on throughput of the system. The effect of parameters like Speed of mobile station, number of Multipath, Rician factor (K) on throughput of such systems is reported and discussed. The investigations reported in this paper helps in estimating the throughput capacity of LTE downlink under SM and TD mode.
