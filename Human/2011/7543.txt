YouASTRO: a web-based bibliography management system with distributed comments and rating features for SAO/NASA ADS papers

We present a working prototype of YouASTRO (www.youastro.org), a web-based BibTeX-compliant reference management software (RMS) for astrophysical papers in the SAO/NASA ADS database. It also includes as a main feature the concept of distributed paper comments and ratings. In these paper, we introduce the main characteristics of the web application, and we will briefly discuss what could be the advantages and drawbacks of such a system being widespread adopted by the astrophysical community for its scientific literature.
