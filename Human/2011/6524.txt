Enhancement of Image Resolution by Binarization

Image segmentation is one of the principal approaches of image processing. The choice of the most appropriate Binarization algorithm for each case proved to be a very interesting procedure itself. In this paper, we have done the comparison study between the various algorithms based on Binarization algorithms and propose a methodologies for the validation of Binarization algorithms. In this work we have developed two novel algorithms to determine threshold values for the pixels value of the gray scale image. The performance estimation of the algorithm utilizes test images with, the evaluation metrics for Binarization of textual and synthetic images. We have achieved better resolution of the image by using the Binarization method of optimum thresholding techniques.
