Application of distributed constraint satisfaction problem to the agent-based planning in manufacturing systems

Nowadays, a globalization of national markets requires developing flexible and demand-driven production systems. Agent-based technology, being distributed, flexible and autonomous is expected to provide a short-time reaction to disturbances and sudden changes of environment and allows satisfying the mentioned requirements. The distributed constraint satisfaction approach underlying the suggested method is described by a modified Petri network providing both the conceptual notions and main details of implementation.
