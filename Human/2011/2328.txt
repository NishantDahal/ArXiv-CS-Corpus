Design and Analysis of SD_DWCA - A Mobility based clustering of Homogeneous MANETs

This paper deals with the design and analysis of the distributed weighted clustering algorithm SD_DWCA proposed for homogeneous mobile ad hoc networks. It is a connectivity, mobility and energy based clustering algorithm which is suitable for scalable ad hoc networks. The algorithm uses a new graph parameter called strong degree defined based on the quality of neighbours of a node. The parameters are so chosen to ensure high connectivity, cluster stability and energy efficient communication among nodes of high dynamic nature. This paper also includes the experimental results of the algorithm implemented using the network simulator NS2. The experimental results show that the algorithm is suitable for high speed networks and generate stable clusters with less maintenance overhead.
