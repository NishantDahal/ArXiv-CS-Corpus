Convergence of a Recombination-Based Elitist Evolutionary Algorithm on the Royal Roads Test Function

We present an analysis of the performance of an elitist Evolutionary algorithm using a recombination operator known as 1-Bit-Swap on the Royal Roads test function based on a population. We derive complete, approximate and asymptotic convergence rates for the algorithm. The complete model shows the benefit of the size of the population and re- combination pool.
