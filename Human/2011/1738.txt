Serial Concatenation of RS Codes with Kite Codes: Performance Analysis, Iterative Decoding and Design

In this paper, we propose a new ensemble of rateless forward error correction (FEC) codes. The proposed codes are serially concatenated codes with Reed-Solomon (RS) codes as outer codes and Kite codes as inner codes. The inner Kite codes are a special class of prefix rateless low-density parity-check (PRLDPC) codes, which can generate potentially infinite (or as many as required) random-like parity-check bits. The employment of RS codes as outer codes not only lowers down error-floors but also ensures (with high probability) the correctness of successfully decoded codewords. In addition to the conventional two-stage decoding, iterative decoding between the inner code and the outer code are also implemented to improve the performance further. The performance of the Kite codes under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding is analyzed by applying a refined Divsalar bound to the ensemble weight enumerating functions (WEF). We propose a simulation-based optimization method as well as density evolution (DE) using Gaussian approximations (GA) to design the Kite codes. Numerical results along with semi-analytic bounds show that the proposed codes can approach Shannon limits with extremely low error-floors. It is also shown by simulation that the proposed codes performs well within a wide range of signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs).
