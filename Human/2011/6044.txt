Hilbert Matrix Based Cryptosystem using a Session Key

Cryptography protects users by providing functionality for the encryption of data and authentication of other users. This technology lets the receiver of an electronic message verify the sender, ensures that a message can be read only by the intended person, and assures the recipient that a message has not be altered in transit. Classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools and pattern finding. The objectives of the proposed work are to propose a new cryptographic method based on the special matrix called the Hilbert matrix for authentication and confidentiality and to propose a model for confidentiality and authentication using shared key cryptosystems with the concept of digital enveloping using a session key. In the present work various algorithms are presented for encryption and authentication based on Hilbert matrix using a session key.
