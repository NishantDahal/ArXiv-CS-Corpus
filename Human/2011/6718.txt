Data Integrity and Dynamic Storage Way in Cloud Computing

It is not an easy task to securely maintain all essential data where it has the need in many applications for clients in cloud. To maintain our data in cloud, it may not be fully trustworthy because client doesn't have copy of all stored data. But any authors don't tell us data integrity through its user and CSP level by comparison before and after the data update in cloud. So we have to establish new proposed system for this using our data reading protocol algorithm to check the integrity of data before and after the data insertion in cloud. Here the security of data before and after is checked by client with the help of CSP using our "effective automatic data reading protocol from user as well as cloud level into the cloud" with truthfulness. Also we have proposed the multi-server data comparison algorithm with the calculation of overall data in each update before its outsourced level for server restore access point for future data recovery from cloud data server. Our proposed scheme efficiently checks integrity in efficient manner so that data integrity as well as security can be maintained in all cases by considering drawbacks of existing methods.
