Social Service Brokerage based on UDDI and Social Requirements

The choice of a suitable service provider is an important issue often overlooked in existing architectures. Current systems focus mostly on the service itself, paying little (if at all) attention to the service provider. In the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registries have been proposed as a way to publish and find information about available services. These registries have been criticized for not being completely trustworthy. In this paper, an enhancement of existing mechanisms for finding services is proposed. The concept of Social Service Broker addressing both service and social requirements is proposed. While UDDI registries still provide information about available services, methods from Social Network Analysis are proposed as a way to evaluate and rank the services proposed by a UDDI registry in social terms.
