Proceedings of Second International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics and Formal Verification

This volume contains the Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on  Games, Automata, Languages, and Formal Verification (GandALF 2011). The conference was held in Minori (Amalfi Coast, Italy), from the 15th to the 17th of June 2011.  The aim of the GandALF Symposium is to provide a forum for researchers from different areas and with different background, that share a common interest in game theory, mathematical logic, automata theory, and their applications to the specification, design, and verification of complex systems. This proceedings contain the abstracts of three invited talks and nineteen regular papers that have been selected through a rigorous reviewing process  according to originality, quality, and relevance to the topics of the symposium.
