A Variation of the Box-Counting Algorithm Applied to Colour Images

The box counting method for fractal dimension estimation had not been applied to large or colour images thus far due to the processing time required. In this letter we present a fast, easy to implement and very easily expandable to any number of dimensions variation, the box merging method. It is applied here in RGB images which are considered as sets in 5-D space.
