Paraconsistency and Topological Semantics

The well-studied notion of deductive explosion describes the situation where any formula can be deduced from an inconsistent set of formulas. Paraconsistent logic, on the other hand, is the umbrella term for logical systems where the logical consequence relation is not explosive. In this work, we investigate the relationship between some different topological spaces and paraconsistency.
