Small witnesses, accepting lassos and winning strategies in omega-automata and games

Obtaining accepting lassos, witnesses and winning strategies in omega-automata and games with omega-regular winning conditions is an integral part of many formal methods commonly found in practice today. Despite the fact that in most applications, the lassos, witnesses and strategies found should be as small as possible, little is known about the hardness of obtaining small such certificates. In this paper, we survey the known hardness results and complete the complexity landscape for the cases not considered in the literature so far. We pay particular attention to the approximation hardness of the problems as approximate small solutions usually suffice in practice.
