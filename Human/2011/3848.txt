Object Oriented Information Computing over WWW

Traditional search engines on World Wide Web (WWW) focus essentially on relevance ranking at the page level. But this lead to missing innumerable structured information about real-world objects embedded in static Web pages and online Web databases. Page-level information retrieval (IR) can unfortunately lead to highly inaccurate relevance ranking in answering object-oriented queries. On the other hand, Object Oriented Information Computing (OOIC) is promising and greatly reduces the complexity of the system while improving reusability and manageability. The most distinguishing requirement of today's complex heterogeneous systems is the need of the computing system to instantly adapt to vigorously changing conditions. OOIC allows reflecting the dynamic characteristics of the applications by instantiating objects dynamically. In this paper, major challenges of OOIC as well as its rudiments are recapped. The review includes the insight to PopRank Model and comparison analysis of conventional page rank based IR with OOIC
