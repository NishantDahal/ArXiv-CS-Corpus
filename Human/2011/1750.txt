Secured Message Transmission in Mobile AD HOC Networks through Identification and Removal of Byzantine Failures

The emerging need for mobile ad hoc networks and secured data transmission phase is of crucial importance depending upon the environments like military. In this paper, a new way to improve the reliability of message transmission is presented. In the open collaborative MANET environment, any node can maliciously or selfishly disrupt and deny communication of other nodes. Dynamic changing topology makes it hard to determine the adversary nodes that affect the communication in MANET. An SMT protocol provides a way to secure message transmission by dispersing the message among several paths with minimal redundancy. The multiple routes selected are known as APS -Active Path Set. This paper describes a technique for fault discovery process to identify Byzantine failures which include nodes that drop, modify, or mis-route packets in an attempt to disrupt the routing service. An adaptive probing technique detects a malicious link through binary search and according to the nodes behavior, these links are avoided in the active path by multiplicatively increasing their weights. The proposed scheme provides secure communication even with increased number of adversaries.
