Long-Term Proportional Fair QoS Profile Follower Sub-carrier Allocation Algorithm in Dynamic OFDMA Systems

In this paper, Long-Term Proportional Fair (LTPF) resource allocation algorithm in dynamic OFDMA system is presented, which provides long-term QoS guarantee (mainly throughput requirement satisfaction) to individual user and follows every user's QoS profile at long-term by incremental optimization of proportional fairness and overall system rate maximization. The LTPF algorithm dynamically allocates the OFDMA sub-carriers to the users in such a way that in long-term the individual QoS requirement is achieved as well as fairness among the users is maintained even in a heterogeneous traffic condition. Here more than maintaining individual user's instantaneous QoS; emphasis is given to follow mean QoS profile of all the users in long-term to retain the objectives of both proportional fairness and multi-user raw rate maximization. Compared to the algorithms, which provide proportional fair optimization and raw-rate maximization independently, this algorithm attempts to provide both kinds of optimizations simultaneously and reach an optimum point when computed in long-term by exploiting the time diversity gain of mobile wireless environment.
