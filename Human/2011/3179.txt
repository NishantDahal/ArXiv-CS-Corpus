Transduction on Kadanoff Sand Pile Model Avalanches, Application to Wave Pattern Emergence

Sand pile models are dynamical systems describing the evolution from $N$ stacked grains to a stable configuration. It uses local rules to depict grain moves and iterate it until reaching a fixed configuration from which no rule can be applied. The main interest of sand piles relies in their {\em Self Organized Criticality} (SOC), the property that a small perturbation | adding some sand grains | on a fixed configuration has uncontrolled consequences on the system, involving an arbitrary number of grain fall. Physicists L. Kadanoff {\em et al} inspire KSPM, a model presenting a sharp SOC behavior, extending the well known {\em Sand Pile Model}. In KSPM($D$), we start from a pile of $N$ stacked grains and apply the rule: $D-1$ grains can fall from column $i$ onto the $D-1$ adjacent columns to the right if the difference of height between columns $i$ and $i+1$ is greater or equal to $D$. This paper develops a formal background for the study of KSPM fixed points. This background, resumed in a finite state word transducer, is used to provide a plain formula for fixed points of KSPM(3).
