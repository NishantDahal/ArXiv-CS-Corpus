Lossless Digital Image Compression Method for Bitmap Images

In this research paper, the authors propose a new approach to digital image compression using crack coding This method starts with the original image and develop crack codes in a recursive manner, marking the pixels visited earlier and expanding the entropy in four directions. The proposed method is experimented with sample bitmap images and results are tabulated. The method is implemented in uni-processor machine using C language source code.
