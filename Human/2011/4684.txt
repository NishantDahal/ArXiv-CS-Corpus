Architecture Of A Identity Based Firewall System

Classic firewall systems are built to filter traffic based on IP addresses, source and destination ports and protocol types. The modern networks have grown to a level where the possibility for users' mobility is a must. In such networks, modern firewalls may introduce such complexity where administration can become very frustrating since it needs the intervention of a firewall administrator. The solution for this problem is an identity based firewall system. In this paper we will present a new design of a firewall system that uses the user's identity to filter the traffic. In the design phase we will define key points which have to be satisfied as a crucial milestone for the functioning of the whole Identity based firewall system.
