The parallel versus branching recurrences in computability logic

This paper shows that the basic logic induced by the parallel recurrence of Computability Logic is a proper superset of the basic logic induced by the branching recurrence. The latter is known to be precisely captured by the cirquent calculus system CL15, conjectured by Japaridze to remain sound---but not complete---with parallel recurrence instead of branching recurrence. The present result is obtained by positively verifying that conjecture. A secondary result of the paper is showing that parallel recurrence is strictly weaker than branching recurrence in the sense that, while the latter logically implies the former, vice versa does not hold.
