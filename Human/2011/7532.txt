Mask Iterative Hard Thresholding Algorithms for Sparse Image Reconstruction of Objects with Known Contour

We develop mask iterative hard thresholding algorithms (mask IHT and mask DORE) for sparse image reconstruction of objects with known contour. The measurements follow a noisy underdetermined linear model common in the compressive sampling literature. Assuming that the contour of the object that we wish to reconstruct is known and that the signal outside the contour is zero, we formulate a constrained residual squared error minimization problem that incorporates both the geometric information (i.e. the knowledge of the object's contour) and the signal sparsity constraint. We first introduce a mask IHT method that aims at solving this minimization problem and guarantees monotonically non-increasing residual squared error for a given signal sparsity level. We then propose a double overrelaxation scheme for accelerating the convergence of the mask IHT algorithm. We also apply convex mask reconstruction approaches that employ a convex relaxation of the signal sparsity constraint. In X-ray computed tomography (CT), we propose an automatic scheme for extracting the convex hull of the inspected object from the measured sinograms; the obtained convex hull is used to capture the object contour information. We compare the proposed mask reconstruction schemes with the existing large-scale sparse signal reconstruction methods via numerical simulations and demonstrate that, by exploiting both the geometric contour information of the underlying image and sparsity of its wavelet coefficients, we can reconstruct this image using a significantly smaller number of measurements than the existing methods.
