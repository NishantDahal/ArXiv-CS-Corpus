Quantum Strategies Win in a Defector-Dominated Population

Quantum strategies are introduced into evolutionary games. The agents using quantum strategies are regarded as invaders whose fraction generally is 1% of a population in contrast to the 50% defectors. In this paper, the evolution of strategies on networks is investigated in a defector-dominated population, when three networks (Regular Lattice, Newman-Watts small world network, scale-free network) are constructed and three games (Prisoners' Dilemma, Snowdrift, Stag-Hunt) are employed. As far as these three games are concerned, the results show that quantum strategies can always invade the population successfully. Comparing the three networks, we find that the regular lattice is most easily invaded by agents that adopt quantum strategies. However, for a scale-free network it can be invaded by agents adopting quantum strategies only if a hub is occupied by an agent with a quantum strategy or if the fraction of agents with quantum strategies in the population is significant.
