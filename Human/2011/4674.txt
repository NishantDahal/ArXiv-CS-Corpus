Non-uniform cellular automata and distributions of rules

In this paper we study $ν$-CA on one-dimensional lattice defined over a finite set of local rules. The main goal is to determine how the local rules can be mixed to ensure the produced $ν$-CA has some properties. In a first part, we give some background for the study of $ν$-CA. Then surjectivity and injectivity are studied using a variant of DeBruijn graphs. The next part is dedicated to the number-conserving property.
