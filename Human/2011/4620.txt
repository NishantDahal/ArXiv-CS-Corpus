Witness Rectangle Graphs

In a witness rectangle graph (WRG) on vertex point set P with respect to witness points set W in the plane, two points x, y in P are adjacent whenever the open isothetic rectangle with x and y as opposite corners contains at least one point in W. WRGs are representative of a a larger family of witness proximity graphs introduced in two previous papers. We study graph-theoretic properties of WRGs. We prove that any WRG has at most two non-trivial connected components. We bound the diameter of the non-trivial connected components of a WRG in both the one-component and two-component cases. In the latter case, we prove that a graph is representable as a WRG if and only if each component is a connected co-interval graph, thereby providing a complete characterization of WRGs of this type. We also completely characterize trees drawable as WRGs. In addition, we prove that a WRG with no isolated vertices has domination number at most four. Moreover, we show that any combinatorial graph can be drawn as a WRG using a combination of positive and negative witnesses. Finally we conclude with some related results on the number of points required to stab all the rectangles defined by a set of n point.
