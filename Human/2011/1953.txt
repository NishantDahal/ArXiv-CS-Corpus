Experimental Investigation of Forecasting Methods Based on Universal Measures

We describe and experimentally investigate a method to construct forecasting algorithms for stationary and ergodic processes based on universal measures (or so-called universal data compressors). Using some geophysical and economical time series as examples, we show that the precision of thus obtained predictions is higher than that of known methods.
