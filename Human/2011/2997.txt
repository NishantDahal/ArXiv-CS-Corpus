A Simulation Study for T0/T1 Data Replication and Production Activities

This paper discusses the latest generation of the MONARC (MOdels of Networked Analysis at Regional Centers) simulation framework, as a design and modeling tool for large scale distributed systems applied to HEP experiments. The simulation of Grid architectures has a vital importance in the future deployment of Grid systems for providing the users an appropriate feed-back. We present here an example of simulating complex data processing systems and the way the framework is used to optimize the overall Grid architecture and/or the policies that govern the Grid's use.
