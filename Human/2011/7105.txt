Multi-Connected Ontologies

Ontologies have been used for the purpose of bringing system and consistency to subject and knowledge areas. We present a criticism of the present mathematical structure of ontologies and indicate that they are not sufficient in their present form to represent the many different valid expressions of a subject knowledge domain. We propose an alternative structure for ontologies based on a richer multi connected complex network which contains the present ontology structure as a projection. We demonstrate how this new multi connected ontology should be represented as an asymmetric probability matrix.
