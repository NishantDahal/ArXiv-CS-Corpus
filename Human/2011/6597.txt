Different types of attacks in Mobile ADHOC Network

Security in mobile AD HOC network is a big challenge as it has no centralized authority which can supervise the individual nodes operating in the network. The attacks can come from both inside the network and from the outside. We are trying to classify the existing attacks into two broad categories: DATA traffic attacks and CONTROL traffic attacks. We will also be discussing the presently proposed methods of mitigating those attacks.
