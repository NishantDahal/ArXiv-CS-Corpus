Dynamic Clustering of Histogram Data Based on Adaptive Squared Wasserstein Distances

This paper deals with clustering methods based on adaptive distances for histogram data using a dynamic clustering algorithm. Histogram data describes individuals in terms of empirical distributions. These kind of data can be considered as complex descriptions of phenomena observed on complex objects: images, groups of individuals, spatial or temporal variant data, results of queries, environmental data, and so on. The Wasserstein distance is used to compare two histograms. The Wasserstein distance between histograms is constituted by two components: the first based on the means, and the second, to internal dispersions (standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and so on) of the histograms. To cluster sets of histogram data, we propose to use Dynamic Clustering Algorithm, (based on adaptive squared Wasserstein distances) that is a k-means-like algorithm for clustering a set of individuals into $K$ classes that are apriori fixed.
  The main aim of this research is to provide a tool for clustering histograms, emphasizing the different contributions of the histogram variables, and their components, to the definition of the clusters. We demonstrate that this can be achieved using adaptive distances. Two kind of adaptive distances are considered: the first takes into account the variability of each component of each descriptor for the whole set of individuals; the second takes into account the variability of each component of each descriptor in each cluster. We furnish interpretative tools of the obtained partition based on an extension of the classical measures (indexes) to the use of adaptive distances in the clustering criterion function. Applications on synthetic and real-world data corroborate the proposed procedure.
