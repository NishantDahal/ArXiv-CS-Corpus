Simplicial blowups and discrete normal surfaces in simpcomp

simpcomp is an extension to GAP, the well known system for computational discrete algebra. It allows the user to work with simplicial complexes. In the latest version, support for simplicial blowups and discrete normal surfaces was added, both features unique to simpcomp. Furthermore, new functions for constructing certain infinite series of triangulations have been implemented and interfaces to other software packages have been improved to previous versions.
