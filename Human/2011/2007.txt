Scalability of spin FPGA: A Reconfigurable Architecture based on spin MOSFET

Scalability of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using spin MOSFET (spin FPGA) with magnetocurrent (MC) ratio in the range of 100% to 1000% is discussed for the first time. Area and speed of million-gate spin FPGA are numerically benchmarked with CMOS FPGA for 22nm, 32nm and 45nm technologies including 20% transistor size variation. We show that area is reduced and speed is increased in spin FPGA owing to the nonvolatile memory function of spin MOSFET.
