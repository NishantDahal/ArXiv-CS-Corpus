A note on the expressive power of linear orders

This article shows that there exist two particular linear orders such that first-order logic with these two linear orders has the same expressive power as first-order logic with the Bit-predicate FO(Bit). As a corollary we obtain that there also exists a built-in permutation such that first-order logic with a linear order and this permutation is as expressive as FO(Bit).
