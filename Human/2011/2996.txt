LISA (Localhost Information Service Agent)

Grid computing has gained an increasing importance in the last years, especially in the academic environments, offering the possibility to rapidly solve complex scientific problems. The monitoring of the Grid jobs has a vital importance for analyzing the system's performance, for providing the users an appropriate feed-back, and for obtaining historical data which may be used for performance prediction. Several monitoring systems have been developed, with different strategies to collect and store the information. We shall present here a solution based on MonALISA, a distributed service for monitoring, control and global optimization of complex systems, and LISA, a component application of MonALISA which can help in optimizing other applications by means of monitoring services. The advantages of this system are, among others, flexibility, dynamic configuration, high communication performance.
