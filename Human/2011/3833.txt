Privacy-Enhanced Methods for Comparing Compressed DNA Sequences

In this paper, we study methods for improving the efficiency and privacy of compressed DNA sequence comparison computations, under various querying scenarios. For instance, one scenario involves a querier, Bob, who wants to test if his DNA string, $Q$, is close to a DNA string, $Y$, owned by a data owner, Alice, but Bob does not want to reveal $Q$ to Alice and Alice is willing to reveal $Y$ to Bob \emph{only if} it is close to $Q$. We describe a privacy-enhanced method for comparing two compressed DNA sequences, which can be used to achieve the goals of such a scenario. Our method involves a reduction to set differencing, and we describe a privacy-enhanced protocol for set differencing that achieves absolute privacy for Bob (in the information theoretic sense), and a quantifiable degree of privacy protection for Alice. One of the important features of our protocols, which makes them ideally suited to privacy-enhanced DNA sequence comparison problems, is that the communication complexity of our solutions is proportional to a threshold that bounds the cardinality of the set differences that are of interest, rather than the cardinality of the sets involved (which correlates to the length of the DNA sequences). Moreover, in our protocols, the querier, Bob, can easily compute the set difference only if its cardinality is close to or below a specified threshold.
