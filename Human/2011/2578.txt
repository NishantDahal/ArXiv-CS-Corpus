Algebra-Logical Repair Method for FPGA Logic Blocks

An algebra-logical repair method for FPGA functional logic blocks on the basis of solving the coverage problem is proposed. It is focused on implementation into Infrastructure IP for system-on-a chip and system-in-package. A method is designed for providing the operability of FPGA blocks and digital system as a whole. It enables to obtain exact and optimal solution associated with the minimum number of spares needed to repair the FPGA logic components with multiple faults.
