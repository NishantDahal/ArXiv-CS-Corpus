A New Approach to Design Graph Based Search Engine for Multiple Domains Using Different Ontologies

Search Engine has become a major tool for searching any information from the World Wide Web (WWW). While searching the huge digital library available in the WWW, every effort is made to retrieve the most relevant results. But in WWW majority of the Web pages are in HTML format and there are no such tags which tells the crawler to find any specific domain. To find more relevant result we use Ontology for that particular domain. If we are working with multiple domains then we use multiple ontologies. Now in order to design a domain specific search engine for multiple domains, crawler must crawl through the domain specific Web pages in the WWW according to the predefined ontologies.
