Towards a Query Language for the Web of Data (A Vision Paper)

Research on querying the Web of Data is still in its infancy. In this paper, we provide an initial set of general features that we envision should be considered in order to define a query language for the Web of Data. Furthermore, for each of these features, we pose questions that have not been addressed before in the context of querying the Web of Data. We believe that addressing these questions and studying these features may guide the next 10 years of research on the Web of Data.
