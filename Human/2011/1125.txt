On primary and secondary repetitions in words

Combinatorial properties of maximal repetitions (runs) in formal words are studied. We classify all maximal repetitions in a word as primary and secondary where the set of all primary repetitions determines all the other repetitons in the word. Essential combinatorial properties of primary repetitions are established.
