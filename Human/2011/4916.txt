A Formal Approach for Agent Based Large Concurrent Intelligent Systems

Large Intelligent Systems are so complex these days that an urgent need for designing such systems in best available way is evolving. Modeling is the useful technique to show a complex real world system into the form of abstraction, so that analysis and implementation of the intelligent system become easy and is useful in gathering the prior knowledge of system that is not possible to experiment with the real world complex systems. This paper discusses a formal approach of agent-based large systems modeling for intelligent systems, which describes design level precautions, challenges and techniques using autonomous agents, as its fundamental modeling abstraction. We are discussing Ad-Hoc Network System as a case study in which we are using mobile agents where nodes are free to relocate, as they form an Intelligent Systems. The designing is very critical in this scenario and it can reduce the whole cost, time duration and risk involved in the project.
