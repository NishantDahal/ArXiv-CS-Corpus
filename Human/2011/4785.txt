Embedding and Automating Conditional Logics in Classical Higher-Order Logic

A sound and complete embedding of conditional logics into classical higher-order logic is presented. This embedding enables the application of off-the-shelf higher-order automated theorem provers and model finders for reasoning within and about conditional logics.
