Algorithmic entropy, thermodynamics, and game interpretation

Basic relations for the mean length and algorithmic entropy are obtained by solving a new extremal problem. Using this extremal problem, they are obtained in a most simple and general way. The length and entropy are considered as two players of a new type of a game, in which we follow the scheme of our previous work on thermodynamic characteristics in quantum and classical approaches.
