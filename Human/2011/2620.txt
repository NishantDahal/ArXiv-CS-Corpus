DNA Circuits Based on Isothermal Constrained Loop Extension DNA Amplification

In this paper, we first describe the isothermal constrained loop extension DNA amplification (ICLEDA), which is a new variant of amplification combining the advantages of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and of strand displacement amplification (SDA). Then, we formalize this process in terms of the theory of formal languages and show, on the basis of this formulation, how to manage OR and AND gates. We then explain how to introduce negation, which allows us to prove that, in principle, it is possible to implement the computation of any boolean function on DNA strands using ICLEDA.
