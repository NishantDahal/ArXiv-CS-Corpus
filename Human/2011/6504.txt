Robot Companions: Technology for Humans

Creation of devices and mechanisms which help people has a long history. Their inventors always targeted practical goals such as irrigation, harvesting, devices for construction sites, measurement, and, last but not least, military tasks for different mechanical and later mechatronic systems. Development of such assisting mechanisms counts back to Greek engineering, came through Middle Ages and led finally in XIX and XX centuries to autonomous devices, which we call today "Robots". This chapter provides overview of several robotic technologies, introduces bio-/chemo- hybrid and collective systems and discuss their applications in service areas.
