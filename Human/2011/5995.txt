Cluster-Based Load Balancing Algorithms for Grids

E-science applications may require huge amounts of data and high processing power where grid infrastructures are very suitable for meeting these requirements. The load distribution in a grid may vary leading to the bottlenecks and overloaded sites. We describe a hierarchical dynamic load balancing protocol for Grids. The Grid consists of clusters and each cluster is represented by a coordinator. Each coordinator first attempts to balance the load in its cluster and if this fails, communicates with the other coordinators to perform transfer or reception of load. This process is repeated periodically. We analyze the correctness, performance and scalability of the proposed protocol and show from the simulation results that our algorithm balances the load by decreasing the number of high loaded nodes in a grid environment.
