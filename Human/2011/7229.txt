A real time vehicles detection algorithm for vision based sensors

A vehicle detection plays an important role in the traffic control at signalised intersections. This paper introduces a vision-based algorithm for vehicles presence recognition in detection zones. The algorithm uses linguistic variables to evaluate local attributes of an input image. The image attributes are categorised as vehicle, background or unknown features. Experimental results on complex traffic scenes show that the proposed algorithm is effective for a real-time vehicles detection.
