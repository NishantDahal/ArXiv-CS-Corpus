Applications of Zigzag Persistence to Topological Data Analysis

The theory of zigzag persistence is a substantial extension of persistent homology, and its development has enabled the investigation of several unexplored avenues in the area of topological data analysis. In this paper, we discuss three applications of zigzag persistence: topological bootstrapping, parameter thresholding, and the comparison of witness complexes.
