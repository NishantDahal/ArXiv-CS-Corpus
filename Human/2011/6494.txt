Representations and Ensemble Methods for Dynamic Relational Classification

Temporal networks are ubiquitous and evolve over time by the addition, deletion, and changing of links, nodes, and attributes. Although many relational datasets contain temporal information, the majority of existing techniques in relational learning focus on static snapshots and ignore the temporal dynamics. We propose a framework for discovering temporal representations of relational data to increase the accuracy of statistical relational learning algorithms. The temporal relational representations serve as a basis for classification, ensembles, and pattern mining in evolving domains. The framework includes (1) selecting the time-varying relational components (links, attributes, nodes), (2) selecting the temporal granularity, (3) predicting the temporal influence of each time-varying relational component, and (4) choosing the weighted relational classifier. Additionally, we propose temporal ensemble methods that exploit the temporal-dimension of relational data. These ensembles outperform traditional and more sophisticated relational ensembles while avoiding the issue of learning the most optimal representation. Finally, the space of temporal-relational models are evaluated using a sample of classifiers. In all cases, the proposed temporal-relational classifiers outperform competing models that ignore the temporal information. The results demonstrate the capability and necessity of the temporal-relational representations for classification, ensembles, and for mining temporal datasets.
