Sparse Principal Component of a Rank-deficient Matrix

We consider the problem of identifying the sparse principal component of a rank-deficient matrix. We introduce auxiliary spherical variables and prove that there exists a set of candidate index-sets (that is, sets of indices to the nonzero elements of the vector argument) whose size is polynomially bounded, in terms of rank, and contains the optimal index-set, i.e. the index-set of the nonzero elements of the optimal solution. Finally, we develop an algorithm that computes the optimal sparse principal component in polynomial time for any sparsity degree.
