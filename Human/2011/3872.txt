Fingerprint recognition using standardized fingerprint model

Fingerprint recognition is one of most popular and accuracy Biometric technologies. Nowadays, it is used in many real applications. However, recognizing fingerprints in poor quality images is still a very complex problem. In recent years, many algorithms, models...are given to improve the accuracy of recognition system. This paper discusses on the standardized fingerprint model which is used to synthesize the template of fingerprints. In this model, after pre-processing step, we find the transformation between templates, adjust parameters, synthesize fingerprint, and reduce noises. Then, we use the final fingerprint to match with others in FVC2004 fingerprint database (DB4) to show the capability of the model.
