Improve performance of tcp new reno over mobile ad-hoc network using abra

In a mobile ad hoc network, temporary link failures and route changes occur frequently. With the assumption that all packet losses are due to congestion, TCP performs poorly in such an environment. There are many versions of TCP which modified time to time as per need. In this paper modifications introduced on TCP New Reno over mobile ad-hoc networks using calculation of New Retransmission Time out (RTO), to improve performance in term of congestion control. To calculate New RTO, adaptive backoff response approach (ABRA) in TCP New Reno was applied which suggest ABRA New Reno. It utilizes an ABRA by which congestion window and slow start threshold values were decreased whenever an acknowledgement is received and new backoff value calculate from smoothed round trip time. Evaluation based on comparative study of ABRA New Reno with other TCP Variants like New Reno and Reno was done using realistic parameters like TCP Packet Received, Packet Drop, Packets Retransmitted, Throughput, and Packet Delivery Ratio calculated by varying attributes of Node Speed, Number of Nodes and Pause Time. Implementation and simulations were performed in QualNet 4.0 simulator.
