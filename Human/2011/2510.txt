Multi-Amdahl: Optimal Resource Sharing with Multiple Program Execution Segments

This paper presents Multi-Amdahl, a resource allocation analytical tool for heterogeneous systems. Our model includes multiple program execution segments, where each one is accelerated by a specific hardware unit. The acceleration speedup of the specific hardware unit is a function of a limited resource, such as the unit area, power, or energy. Using the Lagrange theorem we discover the optimal resource distribution between all specific units. We then illustrate this general Multi-Amdahl technique using several examples of area and power allocation among several cores and accelerators.
