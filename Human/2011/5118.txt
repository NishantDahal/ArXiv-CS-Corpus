Lowest-ID with Adaptive ID Reassignment: A Novel Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks Clustering Algorithm

Clustering is a promising approach for building hierarchies and simplifying the routing process in mobile ad-hoc network environments. The main objective of clustering is to identify suitable node representatives, i.e. cluster heads (CHs), to store routing and topology information and maximize clusters stability. Traditional clustering algorithms suggest CH election exclusively based on node IDs or location information and involve frequent broadcasting of control packets, even when network topology remains unchanged. More recent works take into account additional metrics (such as energy and mobility) and optimize initial clustering. However, in many situations (e.g. in relatively static topologies) re-clustering procedure is hardly ever invoked; hence initially elected CHs soon reach battery exhaustion. Herein, we introduce an efficient distributed clustering algorithm that uses both mobility and energy metrics to provide stable cluster formations. CHs are initially elected based on the time and cost-efficient lowest-ID method. During clustering maintenance phase though, node IDs are re-assigned according to nodes mobility and energy status, ensuring that nodes with low-mobility and sufficient energy supply are assigned low IDs and, hence, are elected as CHs. Our algorithm also reduces control traffic volume since broadcast period is adjusted according to nodes mobility pattern: we employ infrequent broadcasting for relative static network topologies, and increase broadcast frequency for highly mobile network configurations. Simulation results verify that energy consumption is uniformly distributed among network nodes and that signaling overhead is significantly decreased.
