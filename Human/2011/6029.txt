Error Detection and Correction for Distributed Group Key Agreement Protocol

Integrating an efficient Error detection and correction scheme with less encoding and decoding complexity to support the distribution of keying material in a secure group communication is an important issue, since the amount of information carried out in the wireless channel is high which produces more errors due to noise available in the communication channel. Moreover, the key must be sent securely to the group members. In this paper, we propose a new efficient group key computation protocol that provides more security and also integrates an encoding method in sender side and decoding method in the receiver side. To achieve security in key computation process, we propose Euler's totient function based Diffie-hellman key distribution protocol. To provide efficient error detection and correction method while distributing the Keying and re-keying information, we introduce tanner graph based encoding stopping set construction algorithm in sender and receiver side of the group communication. Two major operations in this scheme are joining and leaving operations for managing group memberships. The encoding and decoding complexity of this approach is computed in this paper and it is proved that this proposed approach takes less decoding time complexity.
