Integration of Communication Analysis and the OO-Method: Rules for the manual derivation of the Conceptual Model

Enterprise information systems can be developed following a model-driven paradigm. This way, models that represent the organisational work practice are used to produce models that represent the information system. Current software development methods are starting to provide guidelines for the construction of conceptual models, taking as input requirements models. This paper proposes the integration of two methods: Communication Analysis (a communication-oriented requirements engineering method [España, González et al. 2009]) and the OO-Method (a model-driven object-oriented software development method [Pastor and Molina 2007]). For this purpose, a systematic technique for deriving OO-Method Conceptual Models from business process and requirements models is proposed. The business process specifications (which include message structures) are processed in order to obtain static and dynamic views of the computerised information system. Then, using the OLIVANOVA framework, software source code can be generated automatically [CARE Technologies].
