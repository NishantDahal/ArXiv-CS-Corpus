VIZGR: Combining Data on a Visual Level

In this paper we present a novel method to connect data on the visualization level. In general, visualizations are a dead end, when it comes to reusability. Yet, users prefer to work with visualizations as evidenced by WYSIWYG editors. To enable users to work with their data in a way that is intuitive to them, we have created Vizgr. Vizgr.com offers basic visualization methods, like graphs, tag clouds, maps and time lines. But unlike normal data visualizations, these can be re-used, connected to each other and to web sites. We offer a simple opportunity to combine diverse data structures, such as geo-locations and networks, with each other by a mouse click. In an evaluation, we found that over 85 % of the participants were able to use and understand this technology without any training or explicit instructions.
