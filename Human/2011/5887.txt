Structure of lexicographic Groebner bases in three variables of ideals of dimension zero

We generalize the structural theorem of Lazard in 1985, from 2 variables to 3 variables. We use the Gianni-Kalkbrener result to do this, which implies some restrictions inside which lies the case of a radical ideal.
