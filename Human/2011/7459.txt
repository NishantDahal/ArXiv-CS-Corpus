Performance Analysis of a Keyed Hash Function based on Discrete and Chaotic Proven Iterations

Security of information transmitted through the Internet is an international concern. This security is guaranteed by tools like hash functions. However, as security flaws have been recently identified in the current standard in this domain, new ways to hash digital media must be investigated. In this document an original keyed hash function is evaluated. It is based on chaotic iterations and thus possesses various topological properties as uniform repartition and sensibility to its initial condition. These properties make our hash function satisfy the requirements in this field. This claim is verified qualitatively and experimentally in this research work, among other things by realizing simulations of diffusion and confusion.
