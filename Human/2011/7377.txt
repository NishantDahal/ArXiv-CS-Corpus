Stabilizer States as a Basis for Density Matrices

We show that the space of density matrices for n-qubit states, considered as a (2^n)^2 dimensional real vector space, has a basis consisting of density matrices of stabilizer states. We describe an application of this result to automated verification of quantum protocols.
