Bigraphical Refinement

We propose a mechanism for the vertical refinement of bigraphical reactive systems, based upon a mechanism for limiting observations and utilising the underlying categorical structure of bigraphs.  We present a motivating example to demonstrate that the proposed notion of refinement is sensible with respect to the theory of bigraphical reactive systems; and we propose a sufficient condition for guaranteeing the existence of a safety-preserving vertical refinement.  We postulate the existence of a complimentary notion of horizontal refinement for bigraphical agents, and finally we discuss the connection of this work to the general refinement of Reeves and Streader.
