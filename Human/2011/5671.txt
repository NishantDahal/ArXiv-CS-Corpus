The mathematics of Spinpossible

Notes on the Spinpossible puzzle game. We give a mathematical description of the game, prove some elementary bounds on the length of optimal solutions, and consider variations of the game which place restrictions on the set of permitted moves. We conclude with a list of open questions.
