Solving puzzles described in English by automated translation to answer set programming and learning how to do that translation

We present a system capable of automatically solving combinatorial logic puzzles given in (simplified) English. It involves translating the English descriptions of the puzzles into answer set programming(ASP) and using ASP solvers to provide solutions of the puzzles. To translate the descriptions, we use a lambda-calculus based approach using Probabilistic Combinatorial Categorial Grammars (PCCG) where the meanings of words are associated with parameters to be able to distinguish between multiple meanings of the same word. Meaning of many words and the parameters are learned. The puzzles are represented in ASP using an ontology which is applicable to a large set of logic puzzles.
