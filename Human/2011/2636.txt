Eigengestures for natural human computer interface

We present the application of Principal Component Analysis for data acquired during the design of a natural gesture interface. We investigate the concept of an eigengesture for motion capture hand gesture data and present the visualisation of principal components obtained in the course of conducted experiments. We also show the influence of dimensionality reduction on reconstructed gesture data quality.
