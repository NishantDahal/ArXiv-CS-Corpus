Proceedings Second International Workshop on Algebraic Methods in Model-based Software Engineering

Over the past years there has been quite a lot of activity in the algebraic community about using algebraic methods for providing support to model-driven software engineering. The aim of this workshop is to gather researchers working on the development and application of algebraic methods to provide rigorous support to model-based software engineering.   The topics relevant to the workshop are all those related to the use of algebraic methods in software engineering, including but not limited to:  formally specifying and verifying model-based software engineering concepts and related ones (MDE, UML, OCL, MOF, DSLs, ...); tool support for the above; integration of formal and informal methods; and theoretical frameworks (algebraic, rewriting-based, category theory-based, ...).  The workshop's main goal is to examine, discuss, and relate the existing projects within the algebraic community that address common open-issues in model-driven software engineering.
