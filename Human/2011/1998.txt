Symbolic computation of weighted Moore-Penrose inverse using partitioning method

We propose a method and algorithm for computing the weighted Moore-Penrose inverse of one-variable rational matrices. Continuing this idea, we develop an algorithm for computing the weighted Moore-Penrose inverse of one-variable polynomial matrix. These methods and algorithms are generalizations of the method for computing the weighted Moore-Penrose inverse for constant matrices, originated in Wang and Chen [G.R. Wang, Y.L. Chen, A recursive algorithm for computing the weighted Moore-Penrose inverse AMN, J. Comput. Math. 4 (1986) 74-85], and the partitioning method for computing the Moore-Penrose inverse of rational and polynomial matrices introduced in Stanimirovic and Tasic [P.S. Stanimirovic, M.B. Tasic, Partitioning method for rational and polynomial matrices, Appl. Math. Comput. 155 (2004) 137-163]. Algorithms are implemented in the symbolic computational package MATHEMATICA.
