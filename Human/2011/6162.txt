A Behavioral Distance for Fuzzy-Transition Systems

In contrast to the existing approaches to bisimulation for fuzzy systems, we introduce a behavioral distance to measure the behavioral similarity of states in a nondeterministic fuzzy-transition system. This behavioral distance is defined as the greatest fixed point of a suitable monotonic function and provides a quantitative analogue of bisimilarity. The behavioral distance has the important property that two states are at zero distance if and only if they are bisimilar. Moreover, for any given threshold, we find that states with behavioral distances bounded by the threshold are equivalent. In addition, we show that two system combinators---parallel composition and product---are non-expansive with respect to our behavioral distance, which makes compositional verification possible.
