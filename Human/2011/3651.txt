Proceedings 10th International Workshop on the Foundations of Coordination Languages and Software Architectures

Computation nowadays is becoming inherently concurrent, either because of characteristics of the hardware (with multicore processors becoming omnipresent) or due to the ubiquitous presence of distributed systems (incarnated in the Internet). Computational systems are therefore typically distributed, concurrent, mobile, and often involve composition of heterogeneous components.
  To specify and reason about such systems and go beyond the functional correctness proofs, e.g., by supporting reusability and improving maintainability, approaches such as coordination languages and software architecture are recognised as fundamental.
  The goal of the this workshop is to put together researchers and practitioners of the aforementioned fields, to share and identify common problems, and to devise general solutions in the context of coordination languages and software architectures.
