Large primes in generalized Pascal triangles

In this paper, after presenting the results of the generalization of Pascal triangle (using powers of base numbers), we examine some properties of the 112-based triangle, most of all regarding to prime numbers. Additionally, an effective implementation of ECPP method is presented which enables Magma computer algebra system to prove the primality of numbers with more than 1000 decimal digits.
