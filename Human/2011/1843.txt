On a conjecture by Belfiore and Solé on some lattices

The point of this note is to prove that the secrecy function attains its maximum at y=1 on all known extremal even unimodular lattices. This is a special case of a conjecture by Belfiore and Solé. Further, we will give a very simple method to verify or disprove the conjecture on any given unimodular lattice.
