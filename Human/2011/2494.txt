Double Blind Comparisons using Groups with Infeasible Inversion

Double Blind Comparison is a new cryptographic primitive that allows a user who is in possession of a ciphertext to determine if the corresponding plaintext is identical to the plaintext for a different ciphertext held by a different user, but only if both users co-operate. Neither user knows anything about the plaintexts corresponding to either ciphertext, and neither user learns anything about the plaintexts as a result of the comparison, other than whether the two plaintexts are identical. Neither user can determine whether the plaintexts are equal without the other user's co-operation. Double Blind Comparisons have potential application in Anonymous Credentials and the Database Aggregation Problem. This paper shows how Double Blind Comparisons can be implemented using a Strong Associative One-Way Function (SAOWF). Proof of security is given, making an additional assumption that the SAOWF is implemented on a Group with Infeasible Inversion (GII), whose existence was postulated by Hohenberger and Molnar.
