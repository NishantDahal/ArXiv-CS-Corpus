Software Architecture for Fiji National University Campus Information Systems

Software Architecture defines the overview of the system which consists of various components and their relationships among the software. Architectural design is very important in the development of large scale software solution and plays a very active role in achieving business goals, quality and reusable solution. It is often difficult to choose the best software architecture for your system from the several candidate types available. In this paper we look at the several architectural types and compare them based on the key requirements of our system, and select the most appropriate architecture for the implementation of campus information systems at Fiji National University. Finally we provide details of proposed architecture and outline future plans for implementation of our system.
