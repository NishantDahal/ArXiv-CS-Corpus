Product Lines for Service Oriented Applications - PL for SOA

PL for SOA proposes, formally, a software engineering methodology, development  techniques and support tools for the provision of service product lines. We  propose rigorous modeling techniques for the specification and verification of  formal notations and languages for service computing with inclinations of  variability. Through these cutting-edge technologies, increased levels of  flexibility and adaptivity can be achieved. This will involve developing  semantics of variability over behavioural models of services. Such tools will  assist organizations to plan, optimize and control the quality of software  service provision, both at design and at run time by making it possible to  develop flexible and cost-effective software systems that support high levels of  reuse. We tackle this challenge from two levels. We use feature modeling from  product line engineering and, from a services point of view, the orchestration  language Orc. We introduce the Smart Grid as the service product line to apply  the techniques to.
