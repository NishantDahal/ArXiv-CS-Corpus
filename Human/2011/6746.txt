The UWB Solution for Multimedia Traffic in Wireless Sensor Networks

Several researches are focused on the QoS (Quality of Service) and Energy consumption in wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks. Those research projects invest in theory and practice in order to extend the spectrum of use of norms, standards and technologies which are emerged in wireless communications. The performance of these technologies is strongly related to domains of use and limitations of their characteristics. In this paper, we give a comparison of ZigBee technology, most widely used in sensor networks, and UWB (Ultra Wide Band) which presents itself as competitor that present in these work better results for audiovisual applications with medium-range and high throughput.
