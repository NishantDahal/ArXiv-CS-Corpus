OntologyNavigator: WEB 2.0 scalable ontology based CLIR portal to IT scientific corpus for researchers

This work presents the architecture used in the ongoing OntologyNavigator project. It is a research tool to help advanced learners to find adapted IT papers to create scientific bibliographies. The purpose is the use of an IT representation as educational research software for researchers. We use an ontology based on the ACM's Computing Classification System in order to find scientific papers directly related to the new researcher's domain without any formal request. An ontology translation in French is automatically proposed and can be based on Web 2.0 enhanced by a community of users. A visualization and navigation model is proposed to make it more accessible and examples are given to show the interface of the tool. This model offers the possibility of cross language query. Users deeply interact with the translation by providing alternative translation of the node label. Customers also enrich the ontology node labels with implicit descriptors.
