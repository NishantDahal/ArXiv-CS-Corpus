Algebraic Independence and Blackbox Identity Testing

Algebraic independence is an advanced notion in commutative algebra that generalizes independence of linear polynomials to higher degree. Polynomials {f_1, ..., f_m} \subset \F[x_1, ..., x_n] are called algebraically independent if there is no non-zero polynomial F such that F(f_1, ..., f_m) = 0. The transcendence degree, trdeg{f_1, ..., f_m}, is the maximal number r of algebraically independent polynomials in the set. In this paper we design blackbox and efficient linear maps φthat reduce the number of variables from n to r but maintain trdeg{φ(f_i)}_i = r, assuming f_i's sparse and small r. We apply these fundamental maps to solve several cases of blackbox identity testing:
  (1) Given a polynomial-degree circuit C and sparse polynomials f_1, ..., f_m with trdeg r, we can test blackbox D := C(f_1, ..., f_m) for zeroness in poly(size(D))^r time.
  (2) Define a spsp_δ(k,s,n) circuit C to be of the form \sum_{i=1}^k \prod_{j=1}^s f_{i,j}, where f_{i,j} are sparse n-variate polynomials of degree at most δ. For k = 2 we give a poly(snδ)^{δ^2} time blackbox identity test.
  (3) For a general depth-4 circuit we define a notion of rank. Assuming there is a rank bound R for minimal simple spsp_δ(k,s,n) identities, we give a poly(snRδ)^{Rkδ^2} time blackbox identity test for spsp_δ(k,s,n) circuits. This partially generalizes the state of the art of depth-3 to depth-4 circuits.
  The notion of trdeg works best with large or zero characteristic, but we also give versions of our results for arbitrary fields.
