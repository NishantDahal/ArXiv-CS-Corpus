Public Announcement Logic in Geometric Frameworks

In this paper we introduce public announcement logic in different geometric frameworks. First, we consider topological models, and then extend our discussion to a more expressive model, namely, subset space models. Furthermore, we prove the completeness of public announcement logic in those frameworks. Moreover, we apply our results to different issues: announcement stabilization, backward induction and persistence.
