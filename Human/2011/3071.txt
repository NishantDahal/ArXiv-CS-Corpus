Repeaters in relativistic communications

The communication efficiency between a transmitter and a receiver is affected by motion and the presence of gravitational fields. We study the effect of regenerating the signal in intermediate repeaters in different relativistic scenarios and comment the differences with respect to nonrelativistic repeaters.
