A Glance into the Future of Human Computer Interactions

Computers have a direct impact on our lives nowadays. Human's interaction with the computer has modified with the passage of time as improvement in technology occurred the better the human computer interaction became. Today we are facilitated by the operating system that has reduced all the complexity of hardware and we undergo our computation in a very convenient way irrespective of the process occurring at the hardware level. Though the human computer interaction has improved but it's not done yet. If we come to the future the computer's role in our lives would be a lot more rather our life would be of the artificial intelligence. In our future the biggest resource would be component of time and wasting time for a key board entry or a mouse input would be unbearable so the need would be of the computer interaction environment that along with the complexity reduction also minimizes the time wastage in the human computer interaction. Accordingly in our future the computation would also be increased it would not be a simple operating system limited to a computer it would be computers managing our entire life activities hence fall out of domain of present computers electronic based architecture .In this research paper we propose a model that shall be meeting the future human computer interaction needs possessing linguistic human computer interference environment based on surface technology, automation and photonic computing, which would be reliable, efficient and quicker satisfying all the future artificial intelligence pre requisites.
