A distributed Approach for Access and Visibility Task with a Manikin and a Robot in a Virtual Reality Environment

This paper presents a new method, based on a multi-agent system and on a digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient path planner for a manikin or a robot for access and visibility task taking into account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to solve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process optimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This operator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary agents. The result of this work validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to simulate maintenability and mountability tasks.
