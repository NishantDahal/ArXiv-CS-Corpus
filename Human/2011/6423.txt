Pattern-Based Classification: A Unifying Perspective

The use of patterns in predictive models is a topic that has received a lot of attention in recent years. Pattern mining can help to obtain models for structured domains, such as graphs and sequences, and has been proposed as a means to obtain more accurate and more interpretable models. Despite the large amount of publications devoted to this topic, we believe however that an overview of what has been accomplished in this area is missing. This paper presents our perspective on this evolving area. We identify the principles of pattern mining that are important when mining patterns for models and provide an overview of pattern-based classification methods. We categorize these methods along the following dimensions: (1) whether they post-process a pre-computed set of patterns or iteratively execute pattern mining algorithms; (2) whether they select patterns model-independently or whether the pattern selection is guided by a model. We summarize the results that have been obtained for each of these methods.
