A specification language for Lexical Functional Grammars

This paper defines a language L for specifying LFG grammars. This enables constraints on LFG's composite ontology (c-structures synchronised with f-structures) to be stated directly; no appeal to the LFG construction algorithm is needed. We use L to specify schemata annotated rules and the LFG uniqueness, completeness and coherence principles. Broader issues raised by this work are noted and discussed.
