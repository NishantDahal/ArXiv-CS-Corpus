Integrating "Free" Word Order Syntax and Information Structure

This paper describes a combinatory categorial formalism called Multiset-CCG that can capture the syntax and interpretation of ``free'' word order in languages such as Turkish. The formalism compositionally derives the predicate-argument structure and the information structure (e.g. topic, focus) of a sentence in parallel, and uniformly handles word order variation among the arguments and adjuncts within a clause, as well as in complex clauses and across clause boundaries.
