Letting the Cat out of the Bag: Generation for Shake-and-Bake MT

Describes an algorithm for the generation phase of a Shake-and-Bake Machine Translation system. Since the problem is NP-complete, it is unlikely that the algorithm will be efficient in all cases, but for the cases tested it offers an improvement over Whitelock's previously published algorithm. The work was carried out while the author was employed at Sharp Laboratories of Europe Ltd.
