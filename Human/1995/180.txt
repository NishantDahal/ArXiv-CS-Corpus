Constraint Categorial Grammars

Although unification can be used to implement a weak form of $β$-reduction, several linguistic phenomena are better handled by using some form of $λ$-calculus. In this paper we present a higher order feature description calculus based on a typed $λ$-calculus. We show how the techniques used in \CLG for resolving complex feature constraints can be efficiently extended. \CCLG is a simple formalism, based on categorial grammars, designed to test the practical feasibility of such a calculus.
