A Grammar Formalism and Cross-Serial Dependencies

First we define a unification grammar formalism called the Tree Homomorphic Feature Structure Grammar. It is based on Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), but has a strong restriction on the syntax of the equations. We then show that this grammar formalism defines a full abstract family of languages, and that it is capable of describing cross-serial dependencies of the type found in Swiss German.
