A Proposal for Word Sense Disambiguation using Conceptual Distance

This paper presents a method for the resolution of lexical ambiguity and its automatic evaluation over the Brown Corpus. The method relies on the use of the wide-coverage noun taxonomy of WordNet and the notion of conceptual distance among concepts, captured by a Conceptual Density formula developed for this purpose. This fully automatic method requires no hand coding of lexical entries, hand tagging of text nor any kind of training process. The results of the experiment have been automatically evaluated against SemCor, the sense-tagged version of the Brown Corpus.
