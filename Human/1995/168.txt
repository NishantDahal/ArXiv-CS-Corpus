Co-Indexing Labelled DRSs to Represent and Reason with Ambiguities

The paper addresses the problem of representing ambiguities in a way that allows for monotonic disambiguation and for direct deductive computation. The paper focuses on an extension of the formalism of underspecified DRSs to ambiguities introduced by plural NPs. It deals with the collective/distributive distinction, and also with generic and cumulative readings. In addition it provides a systematic account for an underspecified treatment of plural pronoun resolution.
