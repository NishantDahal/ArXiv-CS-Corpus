A Tractable Extension of Linear Indexed Grammars

It has been shown that Linear Indexed Grammars can be processed in polynomial time by exploiting constraints which make possible the extensive use of structure-sharing. This paper describes a formalism that is more powerful than Linear Indexed Grammar, but which can also be processed in polynomial time using similar techniques. The formalism, which we refer to as Partially Linear PATR manipulates feature structures rather than stacks.
