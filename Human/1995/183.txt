New results on binary linear codes

This research announcement describes in very rough terms methods and a computer language under development, which can be used to prove the nonexistence of binary linear codes. Over a hundred new results have been obtained by the author. For example, there is no [29,11,10] code. The proof of this is roughly outlined.
