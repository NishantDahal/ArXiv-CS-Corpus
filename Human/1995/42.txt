Interlingual Lexical Organisation for Multilingual Lexical Databases in NADIA

We propose a lexical organisation for multilingual lexical databases (MLDB). This organisation is based on acceptions (word-senses). We detail this lexical organisation and show a mock-up built to experiment with it. We also present our current work in defining and prototyping a specialised system for the management of acception-based MLDB. Keywords: multilingual lexical database, acception, linguistic structure.
