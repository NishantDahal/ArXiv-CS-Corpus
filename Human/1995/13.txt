Bi-directional memory-based dialog translation: The KEMDT approach

A bi-directional Korean/English dialog translation system is designed and implemented using the memory-based translation technique. The system KEMDT (Korean/English Memory-based Dialog Translation system) can perform Korean to English, and English to Korean translation using unified memory network and extended marker passing algorithm. We resolve the word order variation and frequent word omission problems in Korean by classifying the concept sequence element in four different types and extending the marker- passing-based-translation algorithm. Unlike the previous memory-based translation systems, the KEMDT system develops the bilingual memory network and the unified bi-directional marker passing translation algorithm. For efficient language specific processing, we separate the morphological processors from the memory-based translator. The KEMDT technology provides a hierarchical memory network and an efficient marker-based control for the recent example-based MT paradigm.
