ParseTalk about Textual Ellipsis

A hybrid methodology for the resolution of text-level ellipsis is presented in this paper. It incorporates conceptual proximity criteria applied to ontologically well-engineered domain knowledge bases and an approach to centering based on functional topic/comment patterns. We state text grammatical predicates for ellipsis and then turn to the procedural aspects of their evaluation within the framework of an actor-based implementation of a lexically distributed parser.
