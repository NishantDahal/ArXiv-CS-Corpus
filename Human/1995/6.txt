A State-Transition Grammar for Data-Oriented Parsing

This paper presents a grammar formalism designed for use in data-oriented approaches to language processing. The formalism is best described as a right-linear indexed grammar extended in linguistically interesting ways. The paper goes on to investigate how a corpus pre-parsed with this formalism may be processed to provide a probabilistic language model for use in the parsing of fresh texts.
