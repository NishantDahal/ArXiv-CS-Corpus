An HPSG Parser Based on Description Logics

In this paper I present a parser based on Description Logics (DL) for a German HPSG -style fragment. The specified parser relies mainly on the inferential capabilities of the underlying DL system. Given a preferential default extension for DL disambiguation is achieved by choosing the parse containing a qualitatively minimal number of exceptions.
