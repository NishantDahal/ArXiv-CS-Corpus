Lexical Knowledge Representation in an Intelligent Dictionary Help System

The frame-based knowledge representation model adopted in IDHS (Intelligent Dictionary Help System) is described in this paper. It is used to represent the lexical knowledge acquired automatically from a conventional dictionary. Moreover, the enrichment processes that have been performed on the Dictionary Knowledge Base and the dynamic exploitation of this knowledge - both based on the exploitation of the properties of lexical semantic relations - are also described.
