Utilization of a Lexicon for Spelling Correction in Modern Greek

In this paper we present an interactive spelling correction system for Modern Greek. The entire system is based on a morphological lexicon. Emphasis is given to the development of the lexicon, especially as far as storage economy, speed efficiency and dictionary coverage is concerned. Extensive research was conducted from both the computer engineering and linguisting fields, in order to describe inflectional morphology as economically as possible.
