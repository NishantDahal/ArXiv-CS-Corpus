CSIEC (Computer Simulator in Educational Communication): An Intelligent Web-Based Teaching System for Foreign Language Learning

In this paper we present an innovative intelligent web-based computer-aided instruction system for foreign language learning: CSIEC (Computer Simulator in Educational Communication). This system can not only grammatically understand the sentences in English given from the users via Internet, but also reasonably and individually speak with the users. At first the related works in this research field are analyzed. Then we introduce the system goals and the system framework, i.e., the natural language understanding mechanism (NLML, NLOMJ and NLDB) and the communicational response (CR). Finally we give the syntactic and semantic content of this instruction system, i.e. some important notations of English grammar used in it and their relations with the NLOMJ.
