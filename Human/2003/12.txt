Size reduction and partial decoupling of systems of equations

A method is presented that reduces the number of terms of systems of linear equations (algebraic, ordinary and partial differential equations). As a byproduct these systems have a tendency to become partially decoupled and are more likely to be factorizable or integrable. A variation of this method is applicable to non-linear systems. Modifications to improve efficiency are given and examples are shown. This procedure can be used in connection with the computation of the radical of a differential ideal (differential Groebner basis).
