Grid Data Management in Action: Experience in Running and Supporting Data Management Services in the EU DataGrid Project

In the first phase of the EU DataGrid (EDG) project, a Data Management System has been implemented and provided for deployment. The components of the current EDG Testbed are: a prototype of a Replica Manager Service built around the basic services provided by Globus, a centralised Replica Catalogue to store information about physical locations of files, and the Grid Data Mirroring Package (GDMP) that is widely used in various HEP collaborations in Europe and the US for data mirroring. During this year these services have been refined and made more robust so that they are fit to be used in a pre-production environment. Application users have been using this first release of the Data Management Services for more than a year. In the paper we present the components and their interaction, our implementation and experience as well as the feedback received from our user communities. We have resolved not only issues regarding integration with other EDG service components but also many of the interoperability issues with components of our partner projects in Europe and the U.S. The paper concludes with the basic lessons learned during this operation. These conclusions provide the motivation for the architecture of the next generation of Data Management Services that will be deployed in EDG during 2003.
