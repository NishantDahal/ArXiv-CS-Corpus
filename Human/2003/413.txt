Gridscape: A Tool for the Creation of Interactive and Dynamic Grid Testbed Web Portals

The notion of grid computing has gained an increasing popularity recently as a realistic solution to many of our large-scale data storage and processing needs. It enables the sharing, selection and aggregation of resources geographically distributed across collaborative organisations. Now more and more people are beginning to embrace grid computing and thus are seeing the need to set up their own grids and grid testbeds. With this comes the need to have some means to enable them to view and monitor the status of the resources in these testbeds (eg. Web based Grid portal). Generally developers invest a substantial amount of time and effort developing custom monitoring software. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes Gridscape ? a tool that enables the rapid creation of interactive and dynamic testbed portals (without any programming effort). Gridscape primarily aims to provide a solution for those users who need to be able to create a grid testbed portal but don?t necessarily have the time or resources to build a system of their own from scratch.
