The Best Trail Algorithm for Assisted Navigation of Web Sites

We present an algorithm called the Best Trail Algorithm, which helps solve the hypertext navigation problem by automating the construction of memex-like trails through the corpus. The algorithm performs a probabilistic best-first expansion of a set of navigation trees to find relevant and compact trails. We describe the implementation of the algorithm, scoring methods for trails, filtering algorithms and a new metric called \emph{potential gain} which measures the potential of a page for future navigation opportunities.
