Managing Inconsistent Intelligence

In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to manage intelligence in constant time as a pre-process to information fusion through a series of processes dealing with issues such as clustering reports, ranking reports with respect to importance, extraction of prototypes from clusters and immediate classification of newly arriving intelligence reports. These methods are used when intelligence reports arrive which concerns different events which should be handled independently, when it is not known a priori to which event each intelligence report is related. We use clustering that runs as a back-end process to partition the intelligence into subsets representing the events, and in parallel, a fast classification that runs as a front-end process in order to put the newly arriving intelligence into its correct information fusion process.
