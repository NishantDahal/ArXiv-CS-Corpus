Extremal Properties of Random Structures

The extremal characteristics of random structures, including trees, graphs, and networks, are discussed. A statistical physics approach is employed in which extremal properties are obtained through suitably defined rate equations. A variety of unusual time dependences and system-size dependences for basic extremal properties are obtained.
