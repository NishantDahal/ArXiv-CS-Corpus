Results on zeta functions for codes

We give a new and short proof of the Mallows-Sloane upper bound for self-dual codes. We formulate a version of Greene's theorem for normalized weight enumerators. We relate normalized rank-generating polynomials to two-variable zeta functions. And we show that a self-dual code has the Clifford property, but that the same property does not hold in general for formally self-dual codes.
