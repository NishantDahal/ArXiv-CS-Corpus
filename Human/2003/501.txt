A Bernstein-Bezier Sufficient Condition for Invertibility of Polynomial Mapping Functions

We propose a sufficient condition for invertibility of a polynomial mapping function defined on a cube or simplex. This condition is applicable to finite element analysis using curved meshes. The sufficient condition is based on an analysis of the Bernstein-BÃ©zier form of the columns of the derivative.
