A first approach for a possible cellular automaton model of fluids dynamics

In this paper I present a first attempt for a possible description of fluids dynamics by mean of a cellular automata technique. With the use of simple and elementary rules, based on random behaviour either, the model permits to obtain the evolution in time for a two-dimensional grid, where one molecule of the material fluid can ideally place itself on a single geometric square. By mean of computational simulations, some realistic effects, here showed by use of digital pictures, have been obtained. In a subsequent step of this work I think to use a parallel program for a high performances computational simulation, for increasing the degree of realism of the digital rendering by mean of a three-dimensional grid too. For the execution of the simulations, numerical methods of resolution for differential equations have not been used.
