Issues in Communication Game

As interaction between autonomous agents, communication can be analyzed in game-theoretic terms. Meaning game is proposed to formalize the core of intended communication in which the sender sends a message and the receiver attempts to infer its meaning intended by the sender. Basic issues involved in the game of natural language communication are discussed, such as salience, grammaticality, common sense, and common belief, together with some demonstration of the feasibility of game-theoretic account of language.
