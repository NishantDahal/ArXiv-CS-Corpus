Quantum Domain Theory - Definitions and Applications

Classically domain theory is a rigourous mathematical structure to describe denotational semantics for programming languages and to study the computability of partial functions. Recently, the application of domain theory has also been extended to the quantum setting. In this note we review these results and we present some new thoughts in this field.
