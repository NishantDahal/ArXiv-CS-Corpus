Modelling Delay Jitter in Voice over IP

It has been suggested in voice over IP that an appropriate choice of the distribution used in modeling the delay jitters, can improve the play-out algorithm. In this paper, we propose a tool using which, one can determine, at a given instance, which distribution model best explains the jitter distribution. This is done using Expectation Maximization, to choose amongst possible distribution models which include, the i.i.d exponential distribution, the gamma distribution etc.
