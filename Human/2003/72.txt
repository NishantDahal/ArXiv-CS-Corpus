G-Monitor: Gridbus web portal for monitoring and steering application execution on global grids

Grids are experiencing a rapid growth in their application and along with this there is a requirement for a portal which is easy to use and scalable. We have responded to this requirement by developing an easy to use, scalable, web-based portal called G-Monitor. This paper proposes a generic architecture for a web portal into a grid environment and discusses our implementation and its application.
