A data Grid testbed environment in Gigabit WAN with HPSS

For data analysis of large-scale experiments such as LHC Atlas and other Japanese high energy and nuclear physics projects, we have constructed a Grid test bed at ICEPP and KEK. These institutes are connected to national scientific gigabit network backbone called SuperSINET. In our test bed, we have installed NorduGrid middleware based on Globus, and connected 120TB HPSS at KEK as a large scale data store. Atlas simulation data at ICEPP has been transferred and accessed using SuperSINET. We have tested various performances and characteristics of HPSS through this high speed WAN. The measurement includes comparison between computing and storage resources are tightly coupled with low latency LAN and long distant WAN.
