A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for the Segmentation of Greek Texts

In this paper we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm to perform linear text segmentation by global minimization of a segmentation cost function which consists of: (a) within-segment word similarity and (b) prior information about segment length. The evaluation of the segmentation accuracy of the algorithm on a text collection consisting of Greek texts showed that the algorithm achieves high segmentation accuracy and appears to be very innovating and promissing.
