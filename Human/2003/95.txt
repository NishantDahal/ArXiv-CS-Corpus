Conferences with Internet Web-Casting as Binding Events in a Global Brain: Example Data From Complexity Digest

There is likeness of the Internet to human brains which has led to the metaphor of the world-wide computer network as a `Global Brain'. We consider conferences as 'binding events' in the Global Brain that can lead to metacognitive structures on a global scale. One of the critical factors for that phenomenon to happen (similar to the biological brain) are the time-scales characteristic for the information exchange. In an electronic newsletter- the Complexity Digest (ComDig) we include webcasting of audio (mp3) and video (asf) files from international conferences in the weekly ComDig issues. Here we present the time variation of the weekly rate of accesses to the conference files. From those empirical data it appears that the characteristic time-scales related to access of web-casting files is of the order of a few weeks. This is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the characteristic time-scales of peer reviewed publications and conference proceedings. We predict that this observation will have profound implications on the nature of future conference proceedings, presumably in electronic form.
