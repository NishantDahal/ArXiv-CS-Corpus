This is a review of the article "Government Preferences for Promoting Open-Source Software: A Solution in Search of A Problem" by David Evans and Bernard J. Reddy. This report was paid for by Microsoft and put together at its request. Now Microsoft is using it as part of their lobbying campaign in Europe against governments' promotion of Open Source Software. As expected, this article is strongly biased and most of the conclusions are based upon false hypotheses and evidence.
