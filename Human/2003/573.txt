Semi-metric Behavior in Document Networks and its Application to Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems for different Document Networks (DN) such as the World Wide Web (WWW) and Digital Libraries, often use distance functions extracted from relationships among documents and keywords. For instance, documents in the WWW are related via a hyperlink network, while documents in bibliographic databases are related by citation and collaboration networks. Furthermore, documents are related to keyterms. The distance functions computed from these relations establish associative networks among items of the DN, referred to as Distance Graphs, which allow recommendation systems to identify relevant associations for individual users. However, modern recommendation systems need to integrate associative data from multiple sources such as different databases, web sites, and even other users. Thus, we are presented with a problem of combining evidence (about associations between items) from different sources characterized by distance functions. In this paper we describe our work on (1) inferring relevant associations from, as well as characterizing, semi-metric distance graphs and (2) combining evidence from different distance graphs in a recommendation system. Regarding (1), we present the idea of semi-metric distance graphs, and introduce ratios to measure semi-metric behavior. We compute these ratios for several DN such as digital libraries and web sites and show that they are useful to identify implicit associations. Regarding (2), we describe an algorithm to combine evidence from distance graphs that uses Evidence Sets, a set structure based on Interval Valued Fuzzy Sets and Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence. This algorithm has been developed for a recommendation system named TalkMine.
