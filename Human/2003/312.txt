AliEnFS - a Linux File System for the AliEn Grid Services

Among the services offered by the AliEn (ALICE Environment http://alien.cern.ch) Grid framework there is a virtual file catalogue to allow transparent access to distributed data-sets using various file transfer protocols. $alienfs$ (AliEn File System) integrates the AliEn file catalogue as a new file system type into the Linux kernel using LUFS, a hybrid user space file system framework (Open Source http://lufs.sourceforge.net). LUFS uses a special kernel interface level called VFS (Virtual File System Switch) to communicate via a generalised file system interface to the AliEn file system daemon. The AliEn framework is used for authentication, catalogue browsing, file registration and read/write transfer operations. A C++ API implements the generic file system operations. The goal of AliEnFS is to allow users easy interactive access to a worldwide distributed virtual file system using familiar shell commands (f.e. cp,ls,rm ...) The paper discusses general aspects of Grid File Systems, the AliEn implementation and present and future developments for the AliEn Grid File System.
