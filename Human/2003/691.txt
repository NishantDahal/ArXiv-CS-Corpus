S-ToPSS: Semantic Toronto Publish/Subscribe System

The increase in the amount of data on the Internet has led to the development of a new generation of applications based on selective information dissemination where, data is distributed only to interested clients. Such applications require a new middleware architecture that can efficiently match user interests with available information. Middleware that can satisfy this requirement include event-based architectures such as publish-subscribe systems. In this demonstration paper we address the problem of semantic matching. We investigate how current publish/subscribe systems can be extended with semantic capabilities. Our main contribution is the development and validation (through demonstration) of a semantic pub/sub system prototype S-ToPSS (Semantic Toronto Publish/Subscribe System).
