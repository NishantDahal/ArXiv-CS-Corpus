Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture (R-GMA)

We describe R-GMA (Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture) which has been developed within the European DataGrid Project as a Grid Information and Monitoring System. Is is based on the GMA from GGF, which is a simple Consumer-Producer model. The special strength of this implementation comes from the power of the relational model. We offer a global view of the information as if each Virtual Organisation had one large relational database. We provide a number of different Producer types with different characteristics; for example some support streaming of information. We also provide combined Consumer/Producers, which are able to combine information and republish it. At the heart of the system is the mediator, which for any query is able to find and connect to the best Producers for the job. We have developed components to allow a measure of inter-working between MDS and R-GMA. We have used it both for information about the grid (primarily to find out about what services are available at any one time) and for application monitoring. R-GMA has been deployed in various testbeds; we describe some preliminary results and experiences of this deployment.
