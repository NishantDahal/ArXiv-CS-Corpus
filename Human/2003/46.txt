Power and beauty of interval methods

Interval calculus is a relatively new branch of mathematics. Initially understood as a set of tools to assess the quality of numerical calculations (rigorous control of rounding errors), it became a discipline in its own rights today. Interval methods are usefull whenever we have to deal with uncertainties, which can be rigorously bounded. Fuzzy sets, rough sets and probability calculus can perform similar tasks, yet only the interval methods are able to (dis)prove, with mathematical rigor, the (non)existence of desired solution(s). Known are several problems, not presented here, which cannot be effectively solved by any other means.
  This paper presents basic notions and main ideas of interval calculus and two examples of useful algorithms.
