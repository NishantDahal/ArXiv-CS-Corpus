Collaborative Creation of Digital Content in Indian Languages

The world is passing through a major revolution called the information revolution, in which information and knowledge is becoming available to people in unprecedented amounts wherever and whenever they need it. Those societies which fail to take advantage of the new technology will be left behind, just like in the industrial revolution.
  The information revolution is based on two major technologies: computers and communication. These technologies have to be delivered in a COST EFFECTIVE manner, and in LANGUAGES accessible to people.
  One way to deliver them in cost effective manner is to make suitable technology choices, and to allow people to access through shared resources. This could be done throuch street corner shops (for computer usage, e-mail etc.), schools, community centres and local library centres.
