The COMPASS Event Store in 2002

COMPASS, the fixed-target experiment at CERN studying the structure of the nucleon and spectroscopy, collected over 260 TB during summer 2002 run. All these data, together with reconstructed events information, were put from the beginning in a database infrastructure based on Objectivity/DB and on the hierarchical storage manager CASTOR. The experience in the usage of the database is reviewed and the evolution of the system outlined.
