Revolutionary Ideas for Radio Regulation

Radio technology seems destined to become part of the standard micro-processor input/output system. But unlike for memory or display systems, for radio systems government regulation matters a lot. Much discussion of radio regulation has focused on narrow spectrum management and interference issues. Reflecting on historical experience and centuries of conversation about fundamental political choices, persons working with radio technology should also ponder three questions. First, what is a good separation and balance of powers in radio regulation? Second, how should radio regulation be geographically configured? Third, how should radio regulation understand and respect personal freedom and equality? Working out answering to these questions involves a general process of shaping good government. This process will be hugely important for radio regulation, technology, and applications.
