On the existence of a new family of Diophantine equations for $\bf Ω$

We show how to determine the $k$-th bit of Chaitin's algorithmically random real number $Ω$ by solving $k$ instances of the halting problem. From this we then reduce the problem of determining the $k$-th bit of $Ω$ to determining whether a certain Diophantine equation with two parameters, $k$ and $N$, has solutions for an odd or an even number of values of $N$. We also demonstrate two further examples of $Ω$ in number theory: an exponential Diophantine equation with a parameter $k$ which has an odd number of solutions iff the $k$-th bit of $Ω$ is 1, and a polynomial of positive integer variables and a parameter $k$ that takes on an odd number of positive values iff the $k$-th bit of $Ω$ is 1.
