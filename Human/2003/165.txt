Embedded Reflection Mapping

Environment maps are used to simulate reflections off curved objects. We present a technique to reflect a user, or a group of users, in a real environment, onto a virtual object, in a virtual reality application, using the live video feeds from a set of cameras, in real-time. Our setup can be used in a variety of environments ranging from outdoor or indoor scenes.
