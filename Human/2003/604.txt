Application Architecture for Spoken Language Resources in Organisational Settings

Special technologies need to be used to take advantage of, and overcome, the challenges associated with acquiring, transforming, storing, processing, and distributing spoken language resources in organisations. This paper introduces an application architecture consisting of tools and supporting utilities for indexing and transcription, and describes how these tools, together with downstream processing and distribution systems, can be integrated into a workflow. Two sample applications for this architecture are outlined- the analysis of decision-making processes in organisations and the deployment of systems development methods by designers in the field.
