GRAPPA: Grid Access Portal for Physics Applications

Grappa is a Grid portal effort designed to provide physicists convenient access to Grid tools and services. The ATLAS analysis and control framework, Athena, was used as the target application. Grappa provides basic Grid functionality such as resource configuration, credential testing, job submission, job monitoring, results monitoring, and preliminary integration with the ATLAS replica catalog system, MAGDA. Grappa uses Jython to combine the ease of scripting with the power of java-based toolkits. This provides a powerful framework for accessing diverse Grid resources with uniform interfaces. The initial prototype system was based on the XCAT Science Portal developed at the Indiana University Extreme Computing Lab and was demonstrated by running Monte Carlo production on the U.S. ATLAS test-bed. The portal also communicated with a European resource broker on WorldGrid as part of the joint iVDGL-DataTAG interoperability project for the IST2002 and SC2002 demonstrations. The current prototype replaces the XCAT Science Portal with an xbooks jetspeed portlet for managing user scripts.
