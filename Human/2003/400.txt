Web Access to Cultural Heritage for the Disabled

Physical disabled access is something that most cultural institutions such as museums consider very seriously. Indeed, there are normally legal requirements to do so. However, online disabled access is still a relatively novel and developing field. Many cultural organizations have not yet considered the issues in depth and web developers are not necessarily experts either. The interface for websites is normally tested with major browsers, but not with specialist software like text to audio converters for the blind or against the relevant accessibility and validation standards. We consider the current state of the art in this area, especially with respect to aspects of particular importance to the access of cultural heritage.
