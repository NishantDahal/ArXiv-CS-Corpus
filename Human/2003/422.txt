A Note on Objects Built From Bricks without Corners

We report a small advance on a question raised by Robertson, Schweitzer, and Wagon in [RSW02]. They constructed a genus-13 polyhedron built from bricks without corners, and asked whether every genus-0 such polyhedron must have a corner. A brick is a parallelopiped, and a corner is a brick of degree three or less in the brick graph. We describe a genus-3 polyhedron built from bricks with no corner, narrowing the genus gap.
