Individual Communication Complexity

We initiate the theory of communication complexity of individual inputs held by the agents, rather than worst-case or average-case. We consider total, partial, and partially correct protocols, one-way versus two-way, with and without help bits. The results are expressed in trems of Kolmogorov complexity.
