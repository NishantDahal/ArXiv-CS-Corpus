A Very Short Self-Interpreter

In this paper we would like to present a very short (possibly the shortest) self-interpreter, based on a simplistic Turing-complete imperative language. This interpreter explicitly processes the statements of the language, which means the interpreter constitutes a description of the language inside that same language. The paper does not require any specific knowledge; however, experience in programming and a vivid imagination are beneficial.
