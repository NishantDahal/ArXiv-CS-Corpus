The FRED Event Display: an Extensible HepRep Client for GLAST

A new graphics client prototype for the HepRep protocol is presented. Based on modern toolkits and high level languages (C++ and Ruby), Fred is an experiment to test applicability of scripting facilities to the high energy physics event display domain. Its flexible structure, extensibility and the use of the HepRep protocol are key features for its use in the astroparticle experiment GLAST.
