On Simple Characterisations of Sheffer psi- polynomials and Related Propositions of the Calculus of Sequences

A calculus of sequences started in 1936 opened the way for future extensions of umbral calculus in its finite operator form. Because of historically established notation we call it the psi-calculus.It appears in parts to be almost automatic extension of the standard classical finite operator calculus.
