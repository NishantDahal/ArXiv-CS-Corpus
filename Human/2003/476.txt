New Approachs to Quantum Computer Simulaton in a Classical Supercomputer

Classical simulation is important because it sets a benchmark for quantum computer performance. Classical simulation is currently the only way to exercise larger numbers of qubits. To achieve larger simulations, sparse matrix processing is emphasized below while trading memory for processing. It performed well within NCSA supercomputers, giving a state vector in convenient continuous portions ready for post processing.
