A Model for Grid User Management

Registration and management of users in a large scale Grid computing environment presents new challenges that are not well addressed by existing protocols. Within a single Virtual Organization (VO), thousands of users will potentially need access to hundreds of computing sites, and the traditional model where users register for local accounts at each site will present significant scaling problems. However, computing sites must maintain control over access to the site and site policies generally require individual local accounts for every user. We present here a model that allows users to register once with a VO and yet still provides all of the computing sites the information they require with the required level of trust. We have developed tools to allow sites to automate the management of local accounts and the mappings between Grid identities and local accounts.
