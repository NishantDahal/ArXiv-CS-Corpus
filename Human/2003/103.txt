Theoretical study of cache syatems

The aim of this paper is a theoretical study of a cache system in order to optimize proxy cache systems and to modernize construction principles including prefetching schemes. Two types of correlations, Zipf-like distribution and normalizing conditions, play a role of the fundamental laws. A corresponding system of equations allows to describe the basic effects like ratio between construction parts, steady-state performance, optimal size, long-term prefetching, etc. A modification of the fundamental laws leads to the description of new effects of documents' renewal in the global network. An internet traffic caching system based on Zipf-like distribution (ZBS) is invented. The additional module to the cache construction gives an effective prefetching by lifetime.
