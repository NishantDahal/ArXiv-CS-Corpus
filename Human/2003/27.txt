Open Network Handles Implemented in DNS

An Open Network Handle System (ONHS) provides an intermediate level of service between IP numbers and domain names. A handle adheres permanently to an owner, who may assign and reassign it to different addresses at will. But a handle is a number, carrying no significance in natural language. Any user desiring a handle may generate one from a public key. This memo describes a simple implementation of an Open Network Handle System using the security extensions to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC).
