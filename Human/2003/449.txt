Supporting Out-of-turn Interactions in a Multimodal Web Interface

Multimodal interfaces are becoming increasingly important with the advent of mobile devices, accessibility considerations, and novel software technologies that combine diverse interaction media. This article investigates systems support for web browsing in a multimodal interface. Specifically, we outline the design and implementation of a software framework that integrates hyperlink and speech modes of interaction. Instead of viewing speech as merely an alternative interaction medium, the framework uses it to support out-of-turn interaction, providing a flexibility of information access not possible with hyperlinks alone. This approach enables the creation of websites that adapt to the needs of users, yet permits the designer fine-grained control over what interactions to support. Design methodology, implementation details, and two case studies are presented.
