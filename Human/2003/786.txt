Verification of recursive parallel systems

In this paper we consider the problem of proving properties of infinite behaviour of formalisms suitable to describe (infinite state) systems with recursion and parallelism. As a formal setting, we consider the framework of Process Rewriting Systems (PRSs). For a meaningfull fragment of PRSs, allowing to accommodate both Pushdown Automata and Petri Nets, we state decidability results for a class of properties about infinite derivations (infinite term rewritings). The given results can be exploited for the automatic verification of some classes of linear time properties of infinite state systems described by PRSs. In order to exemplify the assessed results, we introduce a meaningful automaton based formalism which allows to express both recursion and multi--treading.
