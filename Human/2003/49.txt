Computing Symmetrized Weight Enumerators for Lifted Quadratic Residue Codes

The paper describes a method to determine symmetrized weight enumerators of $p^m$-linear codes based on the notion of a disjoint weight enumerator. Symmetrized weight enumerators are given for the lifted quadratic residue codes of length 24 modulo $2^m$ and modulo $3^m$, for any positive $m$.
