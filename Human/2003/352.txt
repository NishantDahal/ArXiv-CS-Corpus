Grid-based access control for Unix environments, Filesystems and Web Sites

The EU DataGrid has deployed a grid testbed at approximately 20 sites across Europe, with several hundred registered users. This paper describes authorisation systems produced by GridPP and currently used on the EU DataGrid Testbed, including local Unix pool accounts and fine-grained access control with Access Control Lists and Grid-aware filesystems, fileservers and web developement environments.
