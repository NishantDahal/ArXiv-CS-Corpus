Exploiting Sublanguage and Domain Characteristics in a Bootstrapping Approach to Lexicon and Ontology Creation

It is very costly to build up lexical resources and domain ontologies. Especially when confronted with a new application domain lexical gaps and a poor coverage of domain concepts are a problem for the successful exploitation of natural language document analysis systems that need and exploit such knowledge sources. In this paper we report about ongoing experiments with `bootstrapping techniques' for lexicon and ontology creation.
