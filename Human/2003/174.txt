The missing links in the BGP-based AS connectivity maps

A number of recent studies of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems level (AS graph) are based on the BGP-based AS connectivity maps (original maps). The so-called extended maps use additional data sources and contain more complete pictures of the AS graph. In this paper, we compare an original map, an extended map and a synthetic map generated by the Barabasi-Albert model. We examine the recently reported rich-club phenomenon, alternative routing paths and attack tolerance. We point out that the majority of the missing links of the original maps are the connecting links between rich nodes (nodes with large numbers of links) of the extended maps. We show that the missing links are relevant because links between rich nodes can be crucial for the network structure.
