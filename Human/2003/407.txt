Group Authentication Using The Naccache-Stern Public-Key Cryptosystem

A group authentication protocol authenticates pre-defined groups of individuals such that:
 - No individual is identified
 - No knowledge of which groups can be successfully authenticated is known to the verifier
 - No sensitive data is exposed
  The paper presents a group authentication protocol based on splitting the private keys of the Naccache-Stern public-key cryptosystem in such a way that the Boolean expression defining the authenticable groups is implicit in the split.
