Analysis of Quantum Functions

This paper initiates a systematic study of quantum functions, which are (partial) functions defined in terms of quantum mechanical computations. Of all quantum functions, we focus on resource-bounded quantum functions whose inputs are classical bit strings. We prove complexity-theoretical properties and unique characteristics of these quantum functions by recent techniques developed for the analysis of quantum computations. We also discuss relativized quantum functions that make adaptive and nonadaptive oracle queries.
