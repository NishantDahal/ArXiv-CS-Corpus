Design, implementation and deployment of the Saclay muon reconstruction algorithms (Muonbox/y) in the Athena software framework of the ATLAS experiment

This paper gives an overview of a reconstruction algorithm for muon events in ATLAS experiment at CERN. After a short introduction on ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, we will describe the procedure performed by the algorithms Muonbox and Muonboy (last version) in order to achieve correctly the reconstruction task. These algorithms have been developed in Fortran language and are working in the official C++ framework Athena, as well as in stand alone mode. A description of the interaction between Muonboy and Athena will be given, together with the reconstruction performances (efficiency and momentum resolution) obtained with MonteCarlo data.
