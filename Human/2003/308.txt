Data Management for Physics Analysis in Phenix (BNL, RHIC)

Every year the PHENIX collaboration deals with increasing volume of data (now about 1/4 PB/year). Apparently the more data the more questions how to process all the data in most efficient way. In recent past many developments in HEP computing were dedicated to the production environment. Now we need more tools to help to obtain physics results from the analysis of distributed simulated and experimental data. Developments in Grid architectures gave many examples how distributed computing facilities can be organized to meet physics analysis needs. We feel that our main task in this area is to try to use already developed systems or system components in PHENIX environment.
  We are concentrating here on the followed problems: file/replica catalog which keep names of our files, data moving over WAN, job submission in multicluster environment.
  PHENIX is a running experiment and this fact narrowed our ability to test new software on the collaboration computer facilities. We are experimenting with system prototypes at State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNYSB) where we run midrange computing cluster for physics analysis. The talk is dedicated to discuss some experience with Grid software and achieved results.
