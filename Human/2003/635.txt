Fuzzy Relational Modeling of Cost and Affordability for Advanced Technology Manufacturing Environment

Relational representation of knowledge makes it possible to perform all the computations and decision making in a uniform relational way by means of special relational compositions called triangle and square products. In this paper some applications in manufacturing related to cost analysis are described. Testing fuzzy relational structures for various relational properties allows us to discover dependencies, hierarchies, similarities, and equivalences of the attributes characterizing technological processes and manufactured artifacts in their relationship to costs and performance.
  A brief overview of mathematical aspects of BK-relational products is given in Appendix 1 together with further references in the literature.
