Adaptive Domain Model: Dealing With Multiple Attributes of Self-Managing Distributed Object Systems

Self-managing software has emerged as modern systems have become more complex. Some of the distributed object systems may contain thousands of objects deployed on tens or even hundreds hosts. Development and support of such systems often costs a lot. To solve this issue the systems, which are capable supporting multiple self-managing attributes, should be created. In the paper, the Adaptive domain concept is introduced as an extension to the basic domain concept to support a generic adaptation environment for building distributed object systems with multiple self-managing attributes.
