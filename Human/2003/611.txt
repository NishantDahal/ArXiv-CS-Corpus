An O(m) Algorithm for Cores Decomposition of Networks

The structure of large networks can be revealed by partitioning them to smaller parts, which are easier to handle. One of such decompositions is based on $k$--cores, proposed in 1983 by Seidman. In the paper an efficient, $O(m)$, $m$ is the number of lines, algorithm for determining the cores decomposition of a given network is presented.
