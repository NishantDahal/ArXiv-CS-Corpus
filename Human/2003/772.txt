Using sensors in the web crawling process

This paper offers a short description of an Internet information field monitoring system, which places a special module-sensor on the side of the Web-server to detect changes in information resources and subsequently reindexes only the resources signalized by the corresponding sensor. Concise results of simulation research and an implementation attempt of the given "sensors" concept are provided.
