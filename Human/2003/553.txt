Postmortem Object Type Identification

This paper presents a novel technique for the automatic type identification of arbitrary memory objects from a memory dump. Our motivating application is debugging memory corruption problems in optimized, production systems -- a problem domain largely unserved by extant methodologies. We describe our algorithm as applicable to any typed language, and we discuss it with respect to the formidable obstacles posed by C. We describe the heuristics that we have developed to overcome these difficulties and achieve effective type identification on C-based systems. We further describe the implementation of our heuristics on one C-based system -- the Solaris operating system kernel -- and describe the extensions that we have added to the Solaris postmortem debugger to allow for postmortem type identification. We show that our implementation yields a sufficiently high rate of type identification to be useful for debugging memory corruption problems. Finally, we discuss some of the novel automated debugging mechanisms that can be layered upon postmortem type identification.
