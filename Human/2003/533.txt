Error Correcting Codes on Algebraic Surfaces

Error correcting codes are defined and important parameters for a code are explained. Parameters of new codes constructed on algebraic surfaces are studied. In particular, codes resulting from blowing up points in $\proj^2$ are briefly studied, then codes resulting from ruled surfaces are covered. Codes resulting from ruled surfaces over curves of genus 0 are completely analyzed, and some codes are discovered that are better than direct product Reed Solomon codes of similar length. Ruled surfaces over genus 1 curves are also studied, but not all classes are completely analyzed. However, in this case a family of codes are found that are comparable in performance to the direct product code of a Reed Solomon code and a Goppa code. Some further work is done on surfaces from higher genus curves, but there remains much work to be done in this direction to understand fully the resulting codes. Codes resulting from blowing points on surfaces are also studied, obtaining necessary parameters for constructing infinite families of such codes.
  Also included is a paper giving explicit formulas for curves with more \field{q}-rational points than were previously known for certain combinations of field size and genus. Some upper bounds are now known to be optimal from these examples.
