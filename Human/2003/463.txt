Permutation Generation: Two New Permutation Algorithms

Two completely new algorithms for generating permutations, shift-cursor algorithm and level algorithm, and their efficient implementations are presented in this paper. One implementation of the shift cursor algorithm gives an optimal solution of the permutation generation problem, and one implementation of the level algorithm can be used to generate random permutations.
