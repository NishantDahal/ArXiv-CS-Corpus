Parsing and Generation with Tabulation and Compilation

The standard tabulation techniques for logic programming presuppose fixed order of computation. Some data-driven control should be introduced in order to deal with diverse contexts. The present paper describes a data-driven method of constraint transformation with a sort of compilation which subsumes accessibility check and last-call optimization, which characterize standard natural-language parsing techniques, semantic-head-driven generation, etc.
