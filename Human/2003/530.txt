Treatment of sound on quantum computers

We study numerically how a sound signal stored in a quantum computer can be recognized and restored with a minimal number of measurements in presence of random quantum gate errors. A method developed uses elements of MP3 sound compression and allows to recover human speech and sound of complex quantum wavefunctions.
