Computing Convex Hulls with a Linear Solver

A programming tactic involving polyhedra is reported that has been widely applied in the polyhedral analysis of (constraint) logic programs. The method enables the computations of convex hulls that are required for polyhedral analysis to be coded with linear constraint solving machinery that is available in many Prolog systems.
