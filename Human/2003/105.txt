The measurements, parameters and construction of Web proxy cache

The aim of this paper is an experimental study of cache systems in order to optimize proxy cache systems and to modernize construction principles. Our investigations lead to the criteria for the optimal use of storage capacity and allow the description of the basic effects of the ratio between construction parts, steady-state performance, optimal size, etc. We want to outline that the results obtained and the plan of the experiment follow from the theoretical model. Special consideration is given to the modification of the key formulas supposed by Wolman at al.
