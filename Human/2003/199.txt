Towards automation of computing fabrics using tools from the fabric management workpackage of the EU DataGrid project

The EU DataGrid project workpackage 4 has as an objective to provide the necessary tools for automating the management of medium size to very large computing fabrics. At the end of the second project year subsystems for centralized configuration management (presented at LISA'02) and performance/exception monitoring have been delivered. This will soon be augmented with a subsystem for node installation and service configuration, which is based on existing widely used standards where available (e.g. rpm, kickstart, init.d scripts) and clean interfaces to OS dependent components (e.g. base installation and service management). The three subsystems together allow for centralized management of very large computer farms. Finally, a fault tolerance system is being developed for tying together the above subsystems to form a complete framework for automated enterprise computing management by 3Q03. All software developed is open source covered by the EU DataGrid project license agreements. This article describes the architecture behind the designed fabric management system and the status of the different developments. It also covers the experience with an existing tool for automated configuration and installation that have been adapted and used from the beginning to manage the EU DataGrid testbed, which is now used for LHC data challenges.
