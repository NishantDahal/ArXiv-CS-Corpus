Cubefree binary words avoiding long squares

Entringer, Jackson, and Schatz conjectured in 1974 that every infinite cubefree binary word contains arbitrarily long squares. In this paper we show this conjecture is false: there exist infinite cubefree binary words avoiding all squares xx with |x| >= 4, and the number 4 is best possible. However, the Entringer-Jackson-Schatz conjecture is true if "cubefree" is replaced with "overlap-free".
