On the Verge of One Petabyte - the Story Behind the BaBar Database System

The BaBar database has pioneered the use of a commercial ODBMS within the HEP community. The unique object-oriented architecture of Objectivity/DB has made it possible to manage over 700 terabytes of production data generated since May'99, making the BaBar database the world's largest known database. The ongoing development includes new features, addressing the ever-increasing luminosity of the detector as well as other changing physics requirements. Significant efforts are focused on reducing space requirements and operational costs. The paper discusses our experience with developing a large scale database system, emphasizing universal aspects which may be applied to any large scale system, independently of underlying technology used.
