A Physics-Free Introduction to the Quantum Computation Model

This article defines and proves basic properties of the standard quantum circuit model of computation. The model is developed abstractly in close analogy with (classical) deterministic and probabilistic circuits, without recourse to any physical concepts or principles. It is intended as a primer for theoretical computer scientists who do not know--and perhaps do not care to know--any physics.
