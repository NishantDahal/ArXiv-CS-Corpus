A Representation of Changes of Images and its Application for Developmental Biolology

In this paper, we consider a series of events observed at spaced time intervals and present a method of representation of the series. To explain an idea, by dealing with a set of gene expression data, which could be obtained from developmental biology, the procedures are sketched with comments in some details. We mean representation by choosing a proper function, which fits well with observed data of a series, and turning its characteristics into numbers, which extract the intrinsic properties of fluctuating data. With help of a machine learning techniques, this method will give a classification of developmental biological data as well as any varying data during a certain period and the classification can be applied for diagnosis of a disease.
