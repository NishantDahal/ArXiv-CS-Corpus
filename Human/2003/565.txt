Results on the quantitative mu-calculus qMu

The mu-calculus is a powerful tool for specifying and verifying transition systems, including those with both demonic and angelic choice; its quantitative generalisation qMu extends that to probabilistic choice.
  We show that for a finite-state system the logical interpretation of qMu, via fixed-points in a domain of real-valued functions into [0,1], is equivalent to an operational interpretation given as a turn-based gambling game between two players.
  The logical interpretation provides direct access to axioms, laws and meta-theorems. The operational, game- based interpretation aids the intuition and continues in the more general context to provide a surprisingly practical specification tool.
  A corollary of our proofs is an extension of Everett's singly-nested games result in the finite turn-based case: we prove well-definedness of the minimax value, and existence of fixed memoriless strategies, for all qMu games/formulae, of arbitrary (including alternating) nesting structure.
