Time-scales, Meaning, and Availability of Information in a Global Brain

We note the importance of time-scales, meaning, and availability of information for the emergence of novel information meta-structures at a global scale. We discuss previous work in this area and develop future perspectives. We focus on the transmission of scientific articles and the integration of traditional conferences with their virtual extensions on the Internet, their time-scales, and availability. We mention the Semantic Web as an effort for integrating meaningful information.
