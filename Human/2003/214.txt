Conflict-based Force Aggregation

In this paper we present an application where we put together two methods for clustering and classification into a force aggregation method. Both methods are based on conflicts between elements. These methods work with different type of elements (intelligence reports, vehicles, military units) on different hierarchical levels using specific conflict assessment methods on each level. We use Dempster-Shafer theory for conflict calculation between elements, Dempster-Shafer clustering for clustering these elements, and templates for classification. The result of these processes is a complete force aggregation on all levels handled.
