Multi-valued Connectives for Fuzzy Sets

We present a procedure for the construction of multi-valued t-norms and t-conorms. Our procedure makes use of a pair of single-valued t-norms and the respective dual t-conorms and produces interval-valued t-norms and t-conorms. In this manner we combine desirable characteristics of different t-norms and t-conorms; if we use the t-norm min and t-conorm max, then the resulting structure is a superlattice, i.e. the multivalued analog of a lattice.
