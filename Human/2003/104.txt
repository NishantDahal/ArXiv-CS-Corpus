Extending the code generation capabilities of the Together CASE tool to support Data Definition languages

Together is the recommended software development tool in the Atlas collaboration. The programmatic API, which provides the capability to use and augment Together's internal functionality, is comprised of three major components - IDE, RWI and SCI. IDE is a read-only interface used to generate custom outputs based on the information contained in a Together model. RWI allows to both extract and write information to a Together model. SCI is the Source Code Interface, as the name implies it allows to work at the level of the source code. Together is extended by writing modules (java classes) extensively making use of the relevant API. We exploited Together extensibility to add support for the Atlas Dictionary Language. ADL is an extended subset of OMG IDL. The implemented module (ADLModule) makes Together to support ADL keywords, enables options and generate ADL object descriptions directly from UML Class diagrams. The module thoroughly accesses a Together reverse engineered C++ project - and/or design only class diagrams - and it is general enough to allow for possibly additional HEP-specific Together tool tailoring.
