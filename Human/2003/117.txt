PHORMA: Perfectly Hashable Order Restricted Multidimensional Arrays

In this paper we propose a simple and efficient data structure yielding a perfect hashing of quite general arrays. The data structure is named phorma, which is an acronym for perfectly hashable order restricted multidimensional array.
  Keywords: Perfect hash function, Digraph, Implicit enumeration, Nijenhuis-Wilf combinatorial family.
