The EU DataGrid Workload Management System: towards the second major release

In the first phase of the European DataGrid project, the 'workload management' package (WP1) implemented a working prototype, providing users with an environment allowing to define and submit jobs to the Grid, and able to find and use the ``best'' resources for these jobs. Application users have now been experiencing for about a year now with this first release of the workload management system. The experiences acquired, the feedback received by the user and the need to plug new components implementing new functionalities, triggered an update of the existing architecture. A description of this revised and complemented workload management system is given.
