The integration of systems of linear PDEs using conservation laws of syzygies

A new integration technique is presented for systems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for which syzygies can be formulated that obey conservation laws. These syzygies come for free as a by-product of the differential Groebner Basis computation. Compared with the more obvious way of integrating a single equation and substituting the result in other equations the new technique integrates more than one equation at once and therefore introduces temporarily fewer new functions of integration that in addition depend on fewer variables. Especially for high order PDE systems in many variables the conventional integration technique may lead to an explosion of the number of functions of integration which is avoided with the new method. A further benefit is that redundant free functions in the solution are either prevented or that their number is at least reduced.
