Convolutional Codes with Maximum Distance Profile

Maximum distance profile codes are characterized by the property that two trajectories which start at the same state and proceed to a different state will have the maximum possible distance from each other relative to any other convolutional code of the same rate and degree.
  In this paper we use methods from systems theory to characterize maximum distance profile codes algebraically. Tha main result shows that maximum distance profile codes form a generic set inside the variety which parametrizes the set of convolutional codes of a fixed rate and a fixed degree.
