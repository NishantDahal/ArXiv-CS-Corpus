Complex Systems

The study of Complex Systems is considered by many to be a new scientific field, and is distinguished by being a discipline that has applications within many separate areas of scientific study. The study of Neural Networks, Traffic Patterns, Artificial Intelligence, Social Systems, and many other scientific areas can all be considered to fall within the realm of Complex Systems, and can be studied from this new perspective. The advent of more capable computer systems has allowed these systems to be simulated and modeled with far greater ease, and new understanding of computer modeling approaches has allowed the fledgling science to be studied as never before.
  The preliminary focus of this paper will be to provide a general overview of the science of Complex Systems, including terminology, definitions, history, and examples. I will attempt to look at some of the most important trends in different areas of research, and give a general overview of research methods that have been used in parallel with computer modeling. Also, I will further define the areas of the science that concern themselves with computer modeling and simulation, and I will attempt to make it clear why the science only came into its own when the proper modeling and simulation tools were finally available. In addition, although there seems to be general agreement between different authors and institutes regarding the generalities of the study, there are some differences in terminology and methodology. I have attempted in this paper to bring as many elements together as possible, as far as the scope of the subject is concerned, without losing focus by studying Complex System techniques that are bound to one particular area of scientific study, unless that area is that of computer modeling.
