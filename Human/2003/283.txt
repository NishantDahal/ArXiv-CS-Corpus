The DataFlow System of the ATLAS Trigger and DAQ

The baseline design and implementation of the DataFlow system, to be documented in the ATLAS DAQ/HLT Technical Design Report in summer 2003, will be presented. Empahsis will be placed on the system performance and scalability based on the results from prototyping studies which have maximised the use of commercially available hardware.
