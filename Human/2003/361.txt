Relational databases for data management in PHENIX

PHENIX is one of the two large experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and archives roughly 100TB of experimental data per year. In addition, large volumes of simulated data are produced at multiple off-site computing centers. For any file catalog to play a central role in data management it has to face problems associated with the need for distributed access and updates. To be used effectively by the hundreds of PHENIX collaborators in 12 countries the catalog must satisfy the following requirements: 1) contain up-to-date data, 2) provide fast and reliable access to the data, 3) have write permissions for the sites that store portions of data. We present an analysis of several available Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) to support a catalog meeting the above requirements and discuss the PHENIX experience with building and using the distributed file catalog.
