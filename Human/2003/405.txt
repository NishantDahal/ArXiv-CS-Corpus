An Alternative to RDF-Based Languages for the Representation and Processing of Ontologies in the Semantic Web

This paper describes an approach to the representation and processing of ontologies in the Semantic Web, based on the ICMAUS theory of computation and AI. This approach has strengths that complement those of languages based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) such as RDF Schema and DAML+OIL. The main benefits of the ICMAUS approach are simplicity and comprehensibility in the representation of ontologies, an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties in knowledge, and a versatile reasoning system with capabilities in the kinds of probabilistic reasoning that seem to be required in the Semantic Web.
