On secret sharing for graphs

In the paper we discuss how to share the secrets, that are graphs. So, far secret sharing schemes were designed to work with numbers. As the first step, we propose conditions for "graph to number" conversion methods. Hence, the existing schemes can be used, without weakening their properties. Next, we show how graph properties can be used to extend capabilities of secret sharing schemes. This leads to proposal of using such properties for number based secret sharing.
