Approximate Grammar for Information Extraction

In this paper, we present the concept of Approximate grammar and how it can be used to extract information from a documemt. As the structure of informational strings cannot be defined well in a document, we cannot use the conventional grammar rules to represent the information. Hence, the need arises to design an approximate grammar that can be used effectively to accomplish the task of Information extraction. Approximate grammars are a novel step in this direction. The rules of an approximate grammar can be given by a user or the machine can learn the rules from an annotated document. We have performed our experiments in both the above areas and the results have been impressive.
