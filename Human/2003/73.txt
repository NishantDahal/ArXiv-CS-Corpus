Grid Market Directory: A Web Services based Grid Service Publication Directory

As Grids are emerging as the next generation service-oriented computing platforms, they need to support Grid economy that helps in the management of supply and demand for resources and offers an economic incentive for Grid resource providers. To enable this Grid economy, a market-like Grid environment including an infrastructure that supports the publication of services and their discovery is needed. As part of the Gridbus project, we proposed and have developed a Grid Market Directory (GMD) that serves as a registry for high-level service publication and discovery in Virtual Organisations.
