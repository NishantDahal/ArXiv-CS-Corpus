Development of a Java Package for Matrix Programming

We had assembled a Java package, known as MatrixPak, of four classes for the purpose of numerical matrix computation. The classes are matrix, matrix_operations, StrToMatrix, and MatrixToStr; all of which are inherited from java.lang.Object class. Class matrix defines a matrix as a two-dimensional array of float types, and contains the following mathematical methods: transpose, adjoint, determinant, inverse, minor and cofactor. Class matrix_operations contains the following mathematical methods: matrix addition, matrix subtraction, matrix multiplication, and matrix exponential. Class StrToMatrix contains methods necessary to parse a string representation (for example, [[2 3 4]-[5 6 7]]) of a matrix into a matrix definition, whereas class MatrixToStr does the reverse.
