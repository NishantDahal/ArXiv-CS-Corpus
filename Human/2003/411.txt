Contributions to the Development and Improvement of a Regulatory and Pre-Regulatory Digitally System for the Tools within Flexible Fabrication Systems

The paper reports the obtained results for the projection and realization of a digitally system aiming to assist the equipment for a regulatory and pre-regulatory tools and holding tools within the flexible fabrication systems (FFS). Moreover, based on the present results, the same methodology can be applied for assisting tools from the point of view of their integrity and to wear compensation in the FFS framework.
