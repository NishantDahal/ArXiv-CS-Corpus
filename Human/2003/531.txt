Self-organizing Traffic Control: First Results

We developed a virtual laboratory for traffic control where agents use different strategies in order to self-organize on the road. We present our first results where we compare the performance and behaviour promoted by environmental constrains and five different simple strategies: three inspired in flocking behaviour, one selfish, and one inspired in the minority game. Experiments are presented for comparing the strategies. Different issues are discussed, such as the important role of environmental constrains and the emergence of traffic lanes.
