How NP got a new definition: a survey of probabilistically checkable proofs

We survey a collective achievement of a group of researchers: the PCP Theorems. They give new definitions of the class \np, and imply that computing approximate solutions to many \np-hard problems is itself \np-hard. Techniques developed to prove them have had many other consequences.
