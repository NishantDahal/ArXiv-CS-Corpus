Pure Prolog Execution in 21 Rules

A simple mathematical definition of the 4-port model for pure Prolog is given. The model combines the intuition of ports with a compact representation of execution state. Forward and backward derivation steps are possible. The model satisfies a modularity claim, making it suitable for formal reasoning.
