The Linguistic DS: Linguisitic Description in MPEG-7

MPEG-7 (Moving Picture Experts Group Phase 7) is an XML-based international standard on semantic description of multimedia content. This document discusses the Linguistic DS and related tools. The linguistic DS is a tool, based on the GDA tag set (http://i-content.org/GDA/tagset.html), for semantic annotation of linguistic data in or associated with multimedia content. The current document text reflects `Study of FPDAM - MPEG-7 MDS Extensions' issued in March 2003, and not most part of MPEG-7 MDS, for which the readers are referred to the first version of MPEG-7 MDS document available from ISO (http://www.iso.org). Without that reference, however, this document should be mostly intelligible to those who are familiar with XML and linguistic theories. Comments are welcome and will be considered in the standardization process.
