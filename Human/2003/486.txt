A new approach to relevancy in Internet searching - the "Vox Populi Algorithm"

In this paper we will derive a new algorithm for Internet searching. The main idea of this algorithm is to extend the existing algorithms by a component, which reflects the interests of the users more than existing methods. The "Vox Populi Algorithm" (VPA) creates a feedback from the users to the content of the search index. The information derived from the users query analysis is used to modify the existing crawling algorithms. The VPA controls the distribution of the resources of the crawler. Finally, we also discuss methods of suppressing unwanted content (spam).
