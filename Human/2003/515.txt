Two- versus three-dimensional connectivity testing of first-order queries to semi-algebraic sets

This paper addresses the question whether one can determine the connectivity of a semi-algebraic set in three dimensions by testing the connectivity of a finite number of two-dimensional ``samples'' of the set, where these samples are defined by first-order queries. The question is answered negatively for two classes of first-order queries: cartesian-product-free, and positive one-pass.
