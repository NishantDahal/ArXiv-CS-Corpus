Least squares fitting of circles and lines

We study theoretical and computational aspects of the least squares fit (LSF) of circles and circular arcs. First we discuss the existence and uniqueness of LSF and various parametrization schemes. Then we evaluate several popular circle fitting algorithms and propose a new one that surpasses the existing methods in reliability. We also discuss and compare direct (algebraic) circle fits.
