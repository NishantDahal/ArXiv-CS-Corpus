Complete Weight Enumerators of Generalized Doubly-Even Self-Dual Codes

For any q which is a power of 2 we describe a finite subgroup of the group of invertible complex q by q matrices under which the complete weight enumerators of generalized doubly-even self-dual codes over the field with q elements are invariant.
 An explicit description of the invariant ring and some applications to extremality of such codes are obtained in the case q=4.
