The Rich-Club Phenomenon In The Internet Topology

We show that the Internet topology at the Autonomous System (AS) level has a rich--club phenomenon. The rich nodes, which are a small number of nodes with large numbers of links, are very well connected to each other. The rich--club is a core tier that we measured using the rich--club connectivity and the node--node link distribution. We obtained this core tier without any heuristic assumption between the ASes. The rich--club phenomenon is a simple qualitative way to differentiate between power law topologies and provides a criterion for new network models. To show this, we compared the measured rich--club of the AS graph with networks obtained using the Barab√°si--Albert (BA) scale--free network model, the Fitness BA model and the Inet--3.0 model.
