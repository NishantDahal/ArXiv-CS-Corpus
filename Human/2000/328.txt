The Concurrent Language Aldwych

Aldwych is proposed as the foundation of a general purpose language for parallel applications. It works on a rule-based principle, and has aspects variously of concurrent functional, logic and object-oriented languages, yet it forms an integrated whole. It is intended to be applicable both for small-scale parallel programming, and for large-scale open systems.
