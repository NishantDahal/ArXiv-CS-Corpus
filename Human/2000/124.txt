TSIA: A Dataflow Model

The Task System and Item Architecture (TSIA) is a model for transparent application execution. In many real-world projects, a TSIA provides a simple application with a transparent reliable, distributed, heterogeneous, adaptive, dynamic, real-time, parallel, secure or other execution. TSIA is suitable for many applications, not just for the simple applications served to date. This presentation shows that TSIA is a dataflow model - a long-standing model for transparent parallel execution. The advances to the dataflow model include a simple semantics, as well as support for input/output, for modifiable items and for other such effects.
