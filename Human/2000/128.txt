Materialized View Selection and Maintenance Using Multi-Query Optimization

Because the presence of views enhances query performance, materialized views are increasingly being supported by commercial database/data warehouse systems. Whenever the data warehouse is updated, the materialized views must also be updated. However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse, the query loads, and the need to obtain up-to-date responses are all increasing, the time window available for making the warehouse up-to-date is shrinking. These trends necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.
  In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for maintenance of a {\em set} of views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view maintenance expressions. These common subexpressions may be materialized temporarily during view maintenance. Our algorithms also choose subexpressions/indices to be materialized permanently (and maintained along with other materialized views), to speed up view maintenance. While there has been much work on view maintenance in the past, our novel contributions lie in exploiting a recently developed framework for multiquery optimization to efficiently find good view maintenance plans as above. In addition to faster view maintenance, our algorithms can also be used to efficiently select materialized views to speed up workloads containing queries.
