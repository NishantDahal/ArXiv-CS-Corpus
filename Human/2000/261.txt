Base Encryption: Dynamic algorithms, Keys, and Symbol Set

All the current modern encryption algorithms utilize fixed symbols for plaintext and cyphertext. What I mean by fixed is that there is a set and limited number of symbols to represent the characters, numbers, and punctuations. In addition, they are usually the same (the plaintext symbols have the same and equivalent counterpart in the cyphertext symbols). Almost all the encryption algorithms rely on a predefined keyspace and length for the encryption/decription keys, and it is usually fixed (number of bits). In addition, the algorithms used by the encryptions are static. There is a predefined number of operatiors, and a predefined order (loops included) of operations. The algorithm stays the same, and the plaintext and cyphertext along with the key are churned through this cypherblock.
  Base Encryption does the opposite: It utilizes the novel concepts of base conversion, symbol remapping, and dynamic algorithms (dynamic operators and dynamic operations). Base Encryption solves the weakness in todays encryption schemes, namely... Fixed symbols (base) Fixed keylengths Fixed algorithms (fixed number of operations and operators)
  Unique features... Immune from plain-text-attacks. Immune from brute-force-attacks. Can utilize throwaway algorithms (as opposed to throw away keys). Plug-And-Play engine (other cyphers can be augmentated to it)
