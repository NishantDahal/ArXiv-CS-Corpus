Min-Max Fine Heaps

In this paper we present a new data structure for double ended priority queue, called min-max fine heap, which combines the techniques used in fine heap and traditional min-max heap. The standard operations on this proposed structure are also presented, and their analysis indicates that the new structure outperforms the traditional one.
