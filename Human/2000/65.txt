Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, NMR'2000

The papers gathered in this collection were presented at the 8th International Workshop on Nonmonotonic Reasoning, NMR2000. The series was started by John McCarthy in 1978. The first international NMR workshop was held at Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, New York in June, 1984, and was organized by Ray Reiter and Bonnie Webber.
  In the last 10 years the area of nonmonotonic reasoning has seen a number of important developments. Significant theoretical advances were made in the understanding of general abstract principles underlying nonmonotonicity. Key results on the expressibility and computational complexity of nonmonotonic logics were established. The role of nonmonotonic reasoning in belief revision, abduction, reasoning about action, planing and uncertainty was further clarified. Several successful NMR systems were built and used in applications such as planning, scheduling, logic programming and constraint satisfaction.
  The papers in the proceedings reflect these recent advances in the field. They are grouped into sections corresponding to special sessions as they were held at the workshop:
  1. General NMR track
  2. Abductive reasonig
  3. Belief revision: theory and practice
  4. Representing action and planning
  5. Systems descriptions and demonstrations
  6. Uncertainty frameworks in NMR
