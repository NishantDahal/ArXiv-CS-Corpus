Applying System Combination to Base Noun Phrase Identification

We use seven machine learning algorithms for one task: identifying base noun phrases. The results have been processed by different system combination methods and all of these outperformed the best individual result. We have applied the seven learners with the best combinator, a majority vote of the top five systems, to a standard data set and managed to improve the best published result for this data set.
