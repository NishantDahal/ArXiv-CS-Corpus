Entrenchment Relations: A Uniform Approach to Nonmonotonicity

We show that Gabbay's nonmonotonic consequence relations can be reduced to a new family of relations, called entrenchment relations. Entrenchment relations provide a direct generalization of epistemic entrenchment and expectation ordering introduced by Gardenfors and Makinson for the study of belief revision and expectation inference, respectively.
