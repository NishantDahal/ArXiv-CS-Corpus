Low Ambiguity in Strong, Total, Associative, One-Way Functions

Rabi and Sherman present a cryptographic paradigm based on associative, one-way functions that are strong (i.e., hard to invert even if one of their arguments is given) and total. Hemaspaandra and Rothe proved that such powerful one-way functions exist exactly if (standard) one-way functions exist, thus showing that the associative one-way function approach is as plausible as previous approaches. In the present paper, we study the degree of ambiguity of one-way functions. Rabiand Sherman showed that no associative one-way function (over a universe having at least two elements) can be unambiguous (i.e., one-to-one). Nonetheless, we prove that if standard, unambiguous, one-way functions exist, then there exist strong, total, associative, one-way functions that are $\mathcal{O}(n)$-to-one. This puts a reasonable upper bound on the ambiguity.
