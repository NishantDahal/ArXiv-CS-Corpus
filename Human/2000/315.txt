Data Mining to Measure and Improve the Success of Web Sites

For many companies, competitiveness in e-commerce requires a successful presence on the web. Web sites are used to establish the company's image, to promote and sell goods and to provide customer support. The success of a web site affects and reflects directly the success of the company in the electronic market. In this study, we propose a methodology to improve the ``success'' of web sites, based on the exploitation of navigation pattern discovery. In particular, we present a theory, in which success is modelled on the basis of the navigation behaviour of the site's users. We then exploit WUM, a navigation pattern discovery miner, to study how the success of a site is reflected in the users' behaviour. With WUM we measure the success of a site's components and obtain concrete indications of how the site should be improved. We report on our first experiments with an online catalog, the success of which we have studied. Our mining analysis has shown very promising results, on the basis of which the site is currently undergoing concrete improvements.
