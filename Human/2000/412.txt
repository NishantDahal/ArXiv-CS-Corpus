SimLab 1.1, Software for Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis, tool for sound modelling

The aim of this paper is to present and describe SimLab 1.1 (Simulation Laboratory for Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis) software designed for Monte Carlo analysis that is based on performing multiple model evaluations with probabilistically selected model input. The results of these evaluations are used to determine both the uncertainty in model predictions and the input variables that drive this uncertainty. This methodology is essential in situations where a decision has to be taken based on the model results; typical examples include risk and emergency management systems, financial analysis and many others. It is also highly recommended as part of model validation, even where the models are used for diagnostic purposes, as an element of sound model building. SimLab allows an exploration of the space of possible alternative model assumptions and structure on the prediction of the model, thereby testing both the quality of the model and the robustness of the model based inference.
