A brief overview of the MAD debugging activities

Debugging parallel and distributed programs is a difficult activitiy due to the multiplicity of sequential bugs, the existence of malign effects like race conditions and deadlocks, and the huge amounts of data that have to be processed. These problems are addressed by the Monitoring And Debugging environment MAD, which offers debugging functionality based on a graphical representation of a program's execution. The target applications of MAD are parallel programs applying the standard Message-Passing Interface MPI, which is used extensively in the high-performance computing domain. The highlights of MAD are interactive inspection mechanisms including visualization of distributed arrays, the possibility to graphically place breakpoints, a mechanism for monitor overhead removal, and the evaluation of racing messages occuring due to nondeterminism in the code.
