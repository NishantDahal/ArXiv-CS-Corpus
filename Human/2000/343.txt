Combining Linguistic and Spatial Information for Document Analysis

We present a framework to analyze color documents of complex layout. In addition, no assumption is made on the layout. Our framework combines in a content-driven bottom-up approach two different sources of information: textual and spatial. To analyze the text, shallow natural language processing tools, such as taggers and partial parsers, are used. To infer relations of the logical layout we resort to a qualitative spatial calculus closely related to Allen's calculus. We evaluate the system against documents from a color journal and present the results of extracting the reading order from the journal's pages. In this case, our analysis is successful as it extracts the intended reading order from the document.
