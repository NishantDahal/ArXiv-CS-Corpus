Knowledge Theoretic Properties of Topological Spaces

We study the topological models of a logic of knowledge for topological reasoning, introduced by Larry Moss and Rohit Parikh. Among our results is a solution of a conjecture by the formentioned authors, finite satisfiability property and decidability for the theory of topological models.
