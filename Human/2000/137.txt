Assisted Video Sequences Indexing : Motion Analysis Based on Interest Points

This work deals with content-based video indexing. Our viewpoint is semi-automatic analysis of compressed video. We consider the possible applications of motion analysis and moving object detection : assisting moving object indexing, summarising videos, and allowing image and motion queries. We propose an approach based on interest points. As first results, we test and compare the stability of different types of interest point detectors in compressed sequences.
