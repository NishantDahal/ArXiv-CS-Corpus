Fuzzy Approaches to Abductive Inference

This paper proposes two kinds of fuzzy abductive inference in the framework of fuzzy rule base. The abductive inference processes described here depend on the semantic of the rule. We distinguish two classes of interpretation of a fuzzy rule, certainty generation rules and possible generation rules. In this paper we present the architecture of abductive inference in the first class of interpretation. We give two kinds of problem that we can resolve by using the proposed models of inference.
