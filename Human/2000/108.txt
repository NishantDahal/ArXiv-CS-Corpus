SLDNFA-system

The SLDNFA-system results from the LP+ project at the K.U.Leuven, which investigates logics and proof procedures for these logics for declarative knowledge representation. Within this project inductive definition logic (ID-logic) is used as representation logic. Different solvers are being developed for this logic and one of these is SLDNFA. A prototype of the system is available and used for investigating how to solve efficiently problems represented in ID-logic.
