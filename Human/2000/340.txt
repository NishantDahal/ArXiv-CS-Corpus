A Tableau Calculus for Pronoun Resolution

We present a tableau calculus for reasoning in fragments of natural language. We focus on the problem of pronoun resolution and the way in which it complicates automated theorem proving for natural language processing. A method for explicitly manipulating contextual information during deduction is proposed, where pronouns are resolved against this context during deduction. As a result, pronoun resolution and deduction can be interleaved in such a way that pronouns are only resolved if this is licensed by a deduction rule; this helps us to avoid the combinatorial complexity of total pronoun disambiguation.
