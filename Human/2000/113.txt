Hypothetical revision and matter-of-fact supposition

The paper studies the notion of supposition encoded in non-Archimedean conditional probability (and revealed in the acceptance of the so-called indicative conditionals). The notion of qualitative change of view that thus arises is axiomatized and compared with standard notions like AGM and UPDATE. Applications in the following fields are discussed: (1) theory of games and decisions, (2) causal models, (3) non-monotonic logic.
