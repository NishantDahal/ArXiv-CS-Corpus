Metonymy Interpretation Using X NO Y Examples

We developed on example-based method of metonymy interpretation. One advantages of this method is that a hand-built database of metonymy is not necessary because it instead uses examples in the form ``Noun X no Noun Y (Noun Y of Noun X).'' Another advantage is that we will be able to interpret newly-coined metonymic sentences by using a new corpus. We experimented with metonymy interpretation and obtained a precision rate of 66% when using this method.
