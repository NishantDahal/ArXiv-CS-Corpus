Fuzzy data: XML may handle it

Data modeling is one of the most difficult tasks in application engineering. The engineer must be aware of the use cases and the required application services and at a certain point of time he has to fix the data model which forms the base for the application services. However, once the data model has been fixed it is difficult to consider changing needs. This might be a problem in specific domains, which are as dynamic as the healthcare domain. With fuzzy data we address all those data that are difficult to organize in a single database. In this paper we discuss a gradual and pragmatic approach that uses the XML technology to conquer more model flexibility. XML may provide the clue between unstructured text data and structured database solutions and shift the paradigm from "organizing the data along a given model" towards "organizing the data along user requirements".
