Anonymous Oblivious Transfer

In this short note we want to introduce {\em anonymous oblivious transfer} a new cryptographic primitive which can be proven to be strictly more powerful than oblivious transfer. We show that all functions can be robustly realized by multi party protocols with {\em anonymous oblivious transfer}. No assumption about possible collusions of cheaters or disruptors have to be made. Furthermore we shortly discuss how to realize anonymous oblivious transfer with oblivious broadcast or by quantum cryptography. The protocol of anonymous oblivious transfer was inspired by a quantum protocol: the anonymous quantum channel.
