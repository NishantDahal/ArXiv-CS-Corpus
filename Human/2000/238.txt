A Note on "Optimal Static Load Balancing in Distributed Computer Systems"

The problem of minimizing mean response time of generic jobs submitted to a heterogenous distributed computer systems is considered in this paper. A static load balancing strategy, in which decision of redistribution of loads does not depend on the state of the system, is used for this purpose. The article is closely related to a previous article on the same topic. The present article points out number of inconsistencies in the previous article, provides a new formulation, and discusses the impact of new findings, based on the improved formulation, on the results of the previous article.
