Compositionality, Synonymy, and the Systematic Representation of Meaning

In a recent issue of Linguistics and Philosophy Kasmi and Pelletier (1998) (K&P), and Westerstahl (1998) criticize Zadrozny's (1994) argument that any semantics can be represented compositionally. The argument is based upon Zadrozny's theorem that every meaning function m can be encoded by a function μsuch that (i) for any expression E of a specified language L, m(E) can be recovered from μ(E), and (ii) μis a homomorphism from the syntactic structures of L to interpretations of L.
  In both cases, the primary motivation for the objections brought against Zadrozny's argument is the view that his encoding of the original meaning function does not properly reflect the synonymy relations posited for the language.
  In this paper, we argue that these technical criticisms do not go through. In particular, we prove that μproperly encodes synonymy relations, i.e. if two expressions are synonymous, then their compositional meanings are identical. This corrects some misconceptions about the function μ, e.g. Janssen (1997).
  We suggest that the reason that semanticists have been anxious to preserve compositionality as a significant constraint on semantic theory is that it has been mistakenly regarded as a condition that must be satisfied by any theory that sustains a systematic connection between the meaning of an expression and the meanings of its parts. Recent developments in formal and computational semantics show that systematic theories of meanings need not be compositional.
