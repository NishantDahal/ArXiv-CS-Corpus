Programming in Alma-0, or Imperative and Declarative Programming Reconciled

In (Apt et al, TOPLAS 1998) we introduced the imperative programming language Alma-0 that supports declarative programming. In this paper we illustrate the hybrid programming style of Alma-0 by means of various examples that complement those presented in (Apt et al, TOPLAS 1998). The presented Alma-0 programs illustrate the versatility of the language and show that ``don't know'' nondeterminism can be naturally combined with assignment.
