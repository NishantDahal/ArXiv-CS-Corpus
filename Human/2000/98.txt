QUIP - A Tool for Computing Nonmonotonic Reasoning Tasks

In this paper, we outline the prototype of an automated inference tool, called QUIP, which provides a uniform implementation for several nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms. The theoretical basis of QUIP is derived from well-known results about the computational complexity of nonmonotonic logics and exploits a representation of the different reasoning tasks in terms of quantified boolean formulae.
