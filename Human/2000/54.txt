Data storage issues in lattice QCD calculations

I describe some of the data management issues in lattice Quantum Chromodynamics calculations. I focus on the experience of the UKQCD collaboration. I describe an attempt to use a relational database to store part of the data produced by a lattice QCD calculation.
