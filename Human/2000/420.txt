Apache web server execution tracing using Third Eye

Testing of modern software systems that integrate many components developed by different teams is a difficult task. Third Eye is a framework for tracing and validating software systems using application domain events. We use formal descriptions of the constraints between events to identify violations in execution traces. Third Eye is a flexible and modular framework that can be used in different products. We present the validation of the Apache Web Server access policy implementation. The results indicate that our tool is a helpful addition to software development infrastructure.
