Quantum error-correcting codes associated with graphs

We present a construction scheme for quantum error correcting codes. The basic ingredients are a graph and a finite abelian group, from which the code can explicitly be obtained. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the graph such that the resulting code corrects a certain number of errors. This allows a simple verification of the 1-error correcting property of fivefold codes in any dimension. As new examples we construct a large class of codes saturating the singleton bound, as well as a tenfold code detecting 3 errors.
