Brainstorm/J: a Java Framework for Intelligent Agents

Despite the effort of many researchers in the area of multi-agent systems (MAS) for designing and programming agents, a few years ago the research community began to take into account that common features among different MAS exists. Based on these common features, several tools have tackled the problem of agent development on specific application domains or specific types of agents. As a consequence, their scope is restricted to a subset of the huge application domain of MAS. In this paper we propose a generic infrastructure for programming agents whose name is Brainstorm/J. The infrastructure has been implemented as an object oriented framework. As a consequence, our approach supports a broader scope of MAS applications than previous efforts, being flexible and reusable.
