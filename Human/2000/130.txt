A database and lexicon of scripts for ThoughtTreasure

Since scripts were proposed in the 1970's as an inferencing mechanism for AI and natural language processing programs, there have been few attempts to build a database of scripts. This paper describes a database and lexicon of scripts that has been added to the ThoughtTreasure commonsense platform. The database provides the following information about scripts: sequence of events, roles, props, entry conditions, results, goals, emotions, places, duration, frequency, and cost. English and French words and phrases are linked to script concepts.
