A Virtual Java Simulation Lab for Computer Science Students

The VJ-Lab is a project oriented to improve the students learning process of Computer Science degree at the National University of La Plata. The VJ-Lab is a Web application with Java based simulations. Java can be used to provide simulation environments with simple pictorial interfaces that can help students to understand the subject. There are many fields in which it is difficult to give students a feel for the subject that they are learning. Computer based simulations offer a fun and effective way to enable students to learn by doing. Both, practicing skills and applying knowledge are both allowed in simulated worlds. We will focus on the VJ-Lab project overview, the work in progress and some Java based simulations running. They imitate the behavior of data network protocol and data structure algorithms. These applets are produced by the students of the 'Software Development Laboratory' course.
