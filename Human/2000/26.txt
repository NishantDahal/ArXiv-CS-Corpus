Von Neumann Quantum Logic vs. Classical von Neumann Architecture?

The name of John von Neumann is common both in quantum mechanics and computer science. Are they really two absolutely unconnected areas? Many works devoted to quantum computations and communications are serious argument to suggest about existence of such a relation, but it is impossible to touch the new and active theme in a short review. In the paper are described the structures and models of linear algebra and just due to their generality it is possible to use universal description of very different areas as quantum mechanics and theory of Bayesian image analysis, associative memory, neural networks, fuzzy logic.
