Adaptive simulated annealing (ASA): Lessons learned

Adaptive simulated annealing (ASA) is a global optimization algorithm based on an associated proof that the parameter space can be sampled much more efficiently than by using other previous simulated annealing algorithms. The author's ASA code has been publicly available for over two years. During this time the author has volunteered to help people via e-mail, and the feedback obtained has been used to further develop the code. Some lessons learned, in particular some which are relevant to other simulated annealing algorithms, are described.
