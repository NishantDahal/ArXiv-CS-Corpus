Almost-Everywhere Superiority for Quantum Computing

Simon as extended by Brassard and HÃ¸yer shows that there are tasks on which polynomial-time quantum machines are exponentially faster than each classical machine infinitely often. The present paper shows that there are tasks on which polynomial-time quantum machines are exponentially faster than each classical machine almost everywhere.
