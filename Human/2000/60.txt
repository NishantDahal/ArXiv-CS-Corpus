Differential Invariants under Gamma Correction

This paper presents invariants under gamma correction and similarity transformations. The invariants are local features based on differentials which are implemented using derivatives of the Gaussian. The use of the proposed invariant representation is shown to yield improved correlation results in a template matching scenario.
