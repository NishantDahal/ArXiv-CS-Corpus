Perfect simulation from the Quicksort limit distribution

The weak limit of the normalized number of comparisons needed by the Quicksort algorithm to sort n randomly permuted items is known to be determined implicitly by a distributional fixed-point equation. We give an algorithm for perfect random variate generation from this distribution.
