Fault Detection using Immune-Based Systems and Formal Language Algorithms

This paper describes two approaches for fault detection: an immune-based mechanism and a formal language algorithm. The first one is based on the feature of immune systems in distinguish any foreign cell from the body own cell. The formal language approach assumes the system as a linguistic source capable of generating a certain language, characterised by a grammar. Each algorithm has particular characteristics, which are analysed in the paper, namely in what cases they can be used with advantage. To test their practicality, both approaches were applied on the problem of fault detection in an induction motor.
