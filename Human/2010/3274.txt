Balancing congestion for unsplittable routing on a bidirected ring

Given a bidirected ring with capacities and a demand graph, we present an approximation algorithm to the problem of finding the minimum $α$ such that there exists a feasible unsplittable routing of the demands after multiplying each capacity by $α$. We also give an approximation scheme to the problem.
