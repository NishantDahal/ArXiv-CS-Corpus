Fréchet Distance Problems in Weighted Regions

We discuss two versions of the Fréchet distance problem in weighted planar subdivisions. In the first one, the distance between two points is the weighted length of the line segment joining the points. In the second one, the distance between two points is the length of the shortest path between the points. In both cases, we give algorithms for finding a (1+epsilon)-factor approximation of the Fréchet distance between two polygonal curves. We also consider the Fréchet distance between two polygonal curves among polyhedral obstacles in R^3 and present a (1+epsilon)-factor approximation algorithm.
