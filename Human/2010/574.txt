Properties of Pseudo-Primitive Words and their Applications

A pseudo-primitive word with respect to an antimorphic involution θis a word which cannot be written as a catenation of occurrences of a strictly shorter word t and θ(t). Properties of pseudo-primitive words are investigated in this paper. These properties link pseudo-primitive words with essential notions in combinatorics on words such as primitive words, (pseudo)-palindromes, and (pseudo)-commutativity. Their applications include an improved solution to the extended Lyndon-Schützenberger equation u_1 u_2 ... u_l = v_1 ... v_n w_1 ... w_m, where u_1, ..., u_l \in {u, θ(u)}, v_1, ..., v_n \in {v, θ(v)}, and w_1, ..., w_m \in {w, \theata(w)} for some words u, v, w, integers l, n, m \ge 2, and an antimorphic involution θ. We prove that for l \ge 4, n,m \ge 3, this equation implies that u, v, w can be expressed in terms of a common word t and its image θ(t). Moreover, several cases of this equation where l = 3 are examined.
