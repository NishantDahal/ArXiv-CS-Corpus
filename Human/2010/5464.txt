Characterizing the speed and paths of shared bicycles in Lyon

Thanks to numerical data gathered by Lyon's shared bicycling system Vélo'v, we are able to analyze 11.6 millions bicycle trips, leading to the first robust characterization of urban bikers' behaviors. We show that bicycles outstrip cars in downtown Lyon, by combining high speed and short paths.These data also allows us to calculate Vélo'v fluxes on all streets, pointing to interesting locations for bike paths.
