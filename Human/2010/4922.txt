Concurrent Processing Memory

A theoretical memory with limited processing power and internal connectivity at each element is proposed. This memory carries out parallel processing within itself to solve generic array problems. The applicability of this in-memory finest-grain massive SIMD approach is studied in some details. For an array of N items, it reduces the total instruction cycle count of universal operations such as insertion/deletion and match finding to ~ 1, local operations such as filtering and template matching to ~ local operation size, and global operations such as sum, finding global limit and sorting to ~\sqroot{N} instruction cycles. It eliminates most streaming activities for data processing purpose on the system bus. Yet it remains general-purposed, easy to use, pin compatible with conventional memory, and practical for implementation.
