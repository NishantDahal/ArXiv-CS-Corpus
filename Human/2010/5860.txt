Intuitionistic Fuzzy Ideal Extensions of Γ-Semigroups

In this paper the concept of the extensions of intuitionistic fuzzy ideals in a semigroup has been extended to a Γ-Semigroups. Among other results characterization of prime ideals in a Γ-Semigroups in terms of intuitionistic fuzzy ideal extension has been obtained.
