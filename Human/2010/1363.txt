A Survey of Na誰ve Bayes Machine Learning approach in Text Document Classification

Text Document classification aims in associating one or more predefined categories based on the likelihood suggested by the training set of labeled documents. Many machine learning algorithms play a vital role in training the system with predefined categories among which Na誰ve Bayes has some intriguing facts that it is simple, easy to implement and draws better accuracy in large datasets in spite of the na誰ve dependence. The importance of Na誰ve Bayes Machine learning approach has felt hence the study has been taken up for text document classification and the statistical event models available. This survey the various feature selection methods has been discussed and compared along with the metrics related to text document classification.
