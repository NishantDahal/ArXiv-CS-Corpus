Essential variables and positions in terms

The paper deals with $Σ-$composition of terms, which allows us to extend the derivation rules in formal deduction of identities.
  The concept of essential variables and essential positions of terms with respect to a set of identities is a key step in the simplification of the process of formal deduction. $Σ-$composition of terms is defined as replacement between $Σ$-equal terms. This composition induces $ΣR-$deductively closed sets of identities. In analogy to balanced identities we introduce and investigate $Σ-$balanced identities for a given set of identities $Σ$.
