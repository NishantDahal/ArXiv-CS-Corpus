Competition of Self-Organized Rotating Spiral Autowaves in a Nonequilibrium Dissipative System of Three-Level Phaser

We present results of cellular automata based investigations of rotating spiral autowaves in a nonequilibrium excitable medium which models three-level paramagnetic microwave phonon laser (phaser). The computational model is described in arXiv:cond-mat/0410460v2 and arXiv:cond-mat/0602345v1 . We have observed several new scenarios of self-organization, competition and dynamical stabilization of rotating spiral autowaves under conditions of cross-relaxation between three-level active centers. In particular, phenomena of inversion of topological charge, as well as processes of regeneration and replication of rotating spiral autowaves in various excitable media were revealed and visualized for mesoscopic-scale areas of phaser-type active systems, which model real phaser devices.
