Régularisation et optimisation pour l'imagerie sismique des fondations de pylônes

This research report summarizes the progress of work carried out jointly by the IRCCyN and the École Polytechnique de Montréal about the resolution of the inverse problem for the seismic imaging of transmission overhead line structure foundations. Several methods aimed at mapping the underground medium are considered. More particularly, we focus on methods based on a bilinear formulation of the forward problem on one hand (CSI, modified gradient, etc.) and on methods based on a "primal" formulation on the other hand. The performances of these methods are compared using synthetic data. This work was partially funded by RTE (Réseau de Transport d'Électricité), which has initiated the project, and was carried out in collaboration with EDF R&D (Électricité de France - Recherche et Développement).
