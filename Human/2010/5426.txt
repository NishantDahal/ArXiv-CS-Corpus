Correcting a Fraction of Errors in Nonbinary Expander Codes with Linear Programming

A linear-programming decoder for \emph{nonbinary} expander codes is presented. It is shown that the proposed decoder has the maximum-likelihood certificate properties. It is also shown that this decoder corrects any pattern of errors of a relative weight up to approximately 1/4 δ_A δ_B (where δ_A and δ_B are the relative minimum distances of the constituent codes).
