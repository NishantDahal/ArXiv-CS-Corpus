A Class of lattices and boolean functions related to a Manickam-Miklös-Singhi Conjecture

The aim of this paper is to build a new family of lattices related to some combinatorial extremal sum problems, in particular to a conjecture of Manickam, Miklös and Singhi. We study the fundamentals properties of such lattices and of a particular class of boolean functions defined on them.
