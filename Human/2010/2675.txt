The averaging trick and the Cerny conjecture

The results of several papers concerning the Černý conjecture are deduced as consequences of a simple idea that I call the averaging trick. This idea is implicitly used in the literature, but no attempt was made to formalize the proof scheme axiomatically. Instead, authors axiomatized classes of automata to which it applies.
