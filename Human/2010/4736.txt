Brief Announcement: Decentralized Construction of Multicast Trees Embedded into P2P Overlay Networks based on Virtual Geometric Coordinates

In this paper we consider the problem of efficiently constructing in a fully distributed manner multicast trees which are embedded into P2P overlays using virtual geometric node coordinates. We consider two objectives: to minimize the number of messages required for constructing a multicast tree by using the geometric properties of the P2P overlay, and to construct stable multicast trees when the lifetime durations of the peers are known.
