An O(M(n) log n) algorithm for the Jacobi symbol

The best known algorithm to compute the Jacobi symbol of two n-bit integers runs in time O(M(n) log n), using Schönhage's fast continued fraction algorithm combined with an identity due to Gauss. We give a different O(M(n) log n) algorithm based on the binary recursive gcd algorithm of Stehlé and Zimmermann. Our implementation - which to our knowledge is the first to run in time O(M(n) log n) - is faster than GMP's quadratic implementation for inputs larger than about 10000 decimal digits.
