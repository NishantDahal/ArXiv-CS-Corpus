No embedding of the automorphisms of a topological space into a compact metric space endows them with a composition that passes to the limit

The Hausdorff distance, the Gromov-Hausdorff, the Fréchet  and the natural pseudo-distances are instances of dissimilarity measures widely used in shape comparison. We show that they  share the property of being defined as $\inf_ρF(ρ)$ where $F$ is a suitable functional and $ρ$ varies in  a set of correspondences containing the set of homeomorphisms. Our main result states that the set of homeomorphisms cannot be enlarged to a metric space $\mathcal{K}$, in such a way that the composition in $\mathcal{K}$ (extending the composition of homeomorphisms) passes to the limit and, at the same time, $\mathcal{K}$ is compact.
