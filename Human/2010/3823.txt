Optimal topological simplification of discrete functions on surfaces

We solve the problem of minimizing the number of critical points among all functions on a surface within a prescribed distance δ from a given input function. The result is achieved by establishing a connection between discrete Morse theory and persistent homology. Our method completely removes homological noise with persistence less than 2δ, constructively proving the tightness of a lower bound on the number of critical points given by the stability theorem of persistent homology in dimension two for any input function. We also show that an optimal solution can be computed in linear time after persistence pairs have been computed.
