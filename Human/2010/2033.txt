The Isomorphism Problem for omega-Automatic Trees

The main result of this paper is that the isomorphism for omega-automatic trees of finite height is at least has hard as second-order arithmetic and therefore not analytical. This strengthens a recent result by Hjorth, Khoussainov, Montalban, and Nies showing that the isomorphism problem for omega-automatic structures is not $Σ^1_2$. Moreover, assuming the continuum hypothesis CH, we can show that the isomorphism problem for omega-automatic trees of finite height is recursively equivalent with second-order arithmetic. On the way to our main results, we show lower and upper bounds for the isomorphism problem for omega-automatic trees of every finite height: (i) It is decidable ($Π^0_1$-complete, resp,) for height 1 (2, resp.), (ii) $Π^1_1$-hard and in $Π^1_2$ for height 3, and (iii) $Π^1_{n-3}$- and $Σ^1_{n-3}$-hard and in $Π^1_{2n-4}$ (assuming CH) for all n > 3. All proofs are elementary and do not rely on theorems from set theory.
