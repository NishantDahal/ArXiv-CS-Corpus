A Short Story of a Subtle Error in LTL Formulas Reduction and Divine Incorrectness

We identify a subtle error in LTL formulas reduction method used as one optimization step in an LTL to BÃ¼chi automata translation. The error led to some incorrect answers of the established model checker DiVinE. This paper should help authors of other model checkers to avoid this error.
