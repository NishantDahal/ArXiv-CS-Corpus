Infinite Families of Optimal Splitting Authentication Codes Secure Against Spoofing Attacks of Higher Order

We consider the problem of constructing optimal authentication codes with splitting. New infinite families of such codes are obtained. In particular, we establish the first known infinite family of optimal authentication codes with splitting that are secure against spoofing attacks of order two.
