Cusp points in the parameter space of RPR-2PRR parallel manipulator

This paper investigates the existence conditions of cusp points in the design parameter space of the R\underline{P}R-2P\underline{R}R parallel manipulators. Cusp points make possible non-singular assembly-mode changing motion, which can possibly increase the size of the aspect, i.e. the maximum singularity free workspace. The method used is based on the notion of discriminant varieties and Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition, and resorts to Gr√∂bner bases for the solutions of systems of equations.
