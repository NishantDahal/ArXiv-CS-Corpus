Waveform Transmission Method, a New Waveform-relaxation Based Algorithm to Solve Ordinary Differential Equations in Parallel

Waveform Relaxation method (WR) is a beautiful algorithm to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). However, because of its poor convergence capability, it was rarely used. In this paper, we propose a new distributed algorithm, named Waveform Transmission Method (WTM), by virtually inserting waveform transmission lines into the dynamical system to achieve distributed computing of extremely large ODEs. WTM has better convergence capability than the traditional WR algorithms.
