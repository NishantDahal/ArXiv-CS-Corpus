Proof of a Conjecture about Rotation Symmetric Functions

Rotation symmetric Boolean functions have important applications in the design of cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, the Conjecture about rotation symmetric Boolean functions (RSBFs) of degree 3 proposed by Cusik and Stănică is proved. As a result, the nonlinearity of such kind of functions is determined.
