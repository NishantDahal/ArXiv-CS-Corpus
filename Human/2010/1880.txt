GIST: A Solver for Probabilistic Games

Gist is a tool that (a) solves the qualitative analysis problem of turn-based probabilistic games with Ï‰-regular objectives; and (b) synthesizes reasonable environment assumptions for synthesis of unrealizable specifications. Our tool provides the first and efficient implementations of several reduction-based techniques to solve turn-based probabilistic games, and uses the analysis of turn-based probabilistic games for synthesizing environment assumptions for unrealizable specifications.
