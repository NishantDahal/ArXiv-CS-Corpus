Cumulative-Separable Codes

q-ary cumulative-separable $Γ(L,G^{(j)})$-codes $L=\{ α\in GF(q^{m}):G(α)\neq 0 \}$ and $G^{(j)}(x)=G(x)^{j}, 1 \leq i\leq q$ are considered. The relation between different codes from this class is demonstrated. Improved boundaries of the minimum distance and dimension are obtained.
