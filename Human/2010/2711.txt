Polyharmonic Daubechies type wavelets in Image Processing and Astronomy, II

We consider the application of the polyharmonic subdivision wavelets (of Daubechies type) to Image Processing, in particular to Astronomical Images. The results show an essential advantage over some standard multivariate wavelets and a potential for better compression.
