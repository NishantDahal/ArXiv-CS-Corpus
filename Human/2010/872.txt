Recherche de relations spatio-temporelles : une méthode basée sur l'analyse de corpus textuels

This paper presents a work package realized for the GéOnto project. A new method is proposed for an enrichment of a first geographical ontology developed beforehand. This method relies on text analysis by lexico-syntactic patterns.
  From the retrieve of n-ary relations the method automatically detect those involved in a spatial and/or temporal relation in a context of a description of journeys.
