A generalized Faddeev's axiom and the uniqueness theorem for Tsallis entropy

The uniequness theorem for the Tsallis entropy by introducing the generalized Faddeev's axiom is proven. Our result improves the recent result, the uniqueness theorem for Tsallis entropy by the generalized Shannon-Khinchin's axiom in \cite{Suy}, in the sence that our axiom is simpler than his one, as similar that Faddeev's axiom is simpler than Shannon-Khinchin's one.
