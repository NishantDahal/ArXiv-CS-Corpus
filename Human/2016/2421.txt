Evolution of the number of GitHub users in Spain

Since we started measuring the community of GitHub users in Spain, it has kept increasing in numbers in such a way that it has grown almost 50%, to the current 12000, in less than one year. However, the reasons for this are not clear. In this paper we will try to find out what are the different components in this growth, or at least those that can be measured, in order to find out which ones are due to the measurement itself and which might be due to other reasons. In this paper we make an advance towards finding out the reasons for this growth.
