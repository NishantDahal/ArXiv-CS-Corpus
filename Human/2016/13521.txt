This presentation focuses on differences between quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Both are discussed related to classical computer systems in terms of vulnerability. Research concerning quantum cryptography is analyzed in terms of work done by the University of Cambridge in partnership with a division of Toshiba, and also attacks demonstrated by Swedish researchers against QKD of energy-time entangled systems. Quantum computing is covered in terms of classical cryptography related to weaknesses presented by Shor's algorithm. Previous classical vulnerabilities also discussed were conducted by Israeli researchers as a side-channel attack using parabolic curve microphones, which has since been patched.
