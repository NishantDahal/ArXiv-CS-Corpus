Performance Evaluation of LOS MIMO Systems under the Influence of Phase Noise

To deal with the ever increasing data rate demand in wireless systems, suitable backhaul solutions have to be found. One option is to use LOS MIMO systems at mmWave frequencies, as high bandwidths and spectral efficiencies will be able to fulfill this requirement. Several investigations have shown, that phase noise can decimate the efficiency of such systems immensely and needs to be adequately dealt with. In this work we investigate the system level performance of LOS MIMO systems subject to this impairment and examine the influence for various practical phase noise values. Furthermore, it is shown how a simple phase noise compensation algorithm can be used to enhance the performance of these systems in different scenarios.
