Linear Network Coding over Rings, Part II: Vector Codes and Non-Commutative Alphabets

We prove the following results regarding the linear solvability of networks over various alphabets. For any network, the following are equivalent: (i) vector linear solvability over some finite field, (ii) scalar linear solvability over some ring, (iii) linear solvability over some module. Analogously, the following are equivalent: (a) scalar linear solvability over some finite field, (b) scalar linear solvability over some commutative ring, (c) linear solvability over some module whose ring is commutative. Whenever any network is linearly solvable over a module, a smallest such module arises in a vector linear solution for that network over a field.
  If a network is linearly solvable over some non-commutative ring but not over any commutative ring, then such a non-commutative ring must have size at least $16$, and for some networks, this bound is achieved. An infinite family of networks is demonstrated, each of which is scalar linearly solvable over some non-commutative ring but not over any commutative ring.
  Whenever $p$ is prime and $2 \le k \le 6$, if a network is scalar linearly solvable over some ring of size $p^k$, then it is also $k$-dimensional vector linearly solvable over the field $GF(p)$, but the converse does not necessarily hold. This result is extended to all $k\ge 2$ when the ring is commutative.
