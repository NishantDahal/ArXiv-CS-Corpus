Can NDN Perform Better than OLSR in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks?

The emerging paradigm of Information-Centric Networking is an exciting field of research, opening opportunities in many areas, such as forwarding strategies, caching placement policies, applications (e.g. video streaming and instant messaging), to name a few. In this paper, we address the mobility aspect of ICN, as well as how it performs in tactical wireless ad hoc environments. In this paper, we present results from a simulation study that investigates the performance of Named Data Networking, an instantiation of ICN, in such environments. We perform a series of simulations based on ndnSIM studying different mobility scenarios. Our simulations show that even in the short-term absence of the producer, consumers can still achieve better file retrieval when caches are used. As an effort to increase the cache diversity and have a better utilization of the Content Store we study probabilistic LRU. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our NDN network with a TCP based approach, using OLSR routing protocol, discussing advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
