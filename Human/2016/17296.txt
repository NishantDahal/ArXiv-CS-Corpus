Reliability of k-out-of-n Data Storage System with Deterministic Parallel and Serial Repair

In this paper, we find the Laplace Stieltjes transform of the probability of data loss for the k-out-of-n distributed storage system with deterministic repair times. We consider two repair models, namely the serial and parallel repair. We show that for failure rate much lower than the repair rate, mean time of data loss for the two models is the same unlike the case for exponential repair models.
