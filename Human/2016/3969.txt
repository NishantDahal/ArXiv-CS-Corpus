Wanted: Floating-Point Add Round-off Error instruction

We propose a new instruction (FPADDRE) that computes the round-off error in floating-point addition. We explain how this instruction benefits high-precision arithmetic operations in applications where double precision is not sufficient. Performance estimates on Intel Haswell, Intel Skylake, and AMD Steamroller processors, as well as Intel Knights Corner co-processor, demonstrate that such an instruction would improve the latency of double-double addition by up to 55% and increase double-double addition throughput by up to 103%, with smaller, but non-negligible benefits for double-double multiplication. The new instruction delivers up to 2x speedups on three benchmarks that use high-precision floating-point arithmetic: double-double matrix-matrix multiplication, compensated dot product, and polynomial evaluation via the compensated Horner scheme.
