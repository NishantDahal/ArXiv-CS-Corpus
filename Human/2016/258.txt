Communication Tradeoffs in Wireless Networks

We characterize the maximum achievable broadcast rate in a wireless network under various fading assumptions. Our result exhibits a duality between the performance achieved in this context by collaborative beamforming strategies and the number of degrees of freedom available in the network.
