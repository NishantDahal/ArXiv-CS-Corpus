Characterizing Communicability of Networks formed on Mobile Nodes

Smartphones have become extremely popular by launching wide ubiquitous networks. Nowadays studying of DTN Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and Opportunistic Networks where formed over these mobile nodes, is one of the interesting topics in the research community. In this paper, we measure communicability capacity of DTN Network formed over the mobile nodes at a university campus and also an area in Montreal city through exploiting static and temporal graphs. We observed a significant difference between communicability measures in static and temporal cases, especially for short snapshot windows. It implies that analyzing dynamic networks by considering a static model for them may lead to an unrealistic and even mislead results.
