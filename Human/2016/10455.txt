Supervised quantum gate "teaching" for quantum hardware design

We show how to train a quantum network of pairwise interacting qubits such that its evolution implements a target quantum algorithm into a given network subset. Our strategy is inspired by supervised learning and is designed to help the physical construction of a quantum computer which operates with minimal external classical control.
