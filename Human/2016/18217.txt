Forensics in Industrial Control System: A Case Study

Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are used worldwide in critical infrastructures. An ICS system can be a single embedded system working stand-alone for controlling a simple process or ICS can also be a very complex Distributed Control System (DCS) connected to Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system(s) in a nuclear power plant. Although ICS are widely used to-day, there are very little research on the forensic acquisition and analyze ICS artefacts. In this paper we present a case study of forensics in ICS where we de-scribe a method of safeguarding important volatile artefacts from an embedded industrial control system and several other sources
