A Functional Package for Automatic Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations with Spectral Methods

We present a Python module named PyCheb, to solve the ordinary differential equations by using spectral collocation method. PyCheb incorporates discretization using Chebyshev points, barycentric interpolation and iterate methods. With this Python module, users can initialize the ODEsolver class by passing attributes, including the both sides of a given differential equation, boundary conditions, and the number of Chebyshev points, which can also be generated automatically by the ideal precision, to the constructor of ODEsolver class. Then, the instance of the ODEsolver class can be used to automatically determine the resolution of the differential equation as well as generate the graph of the high-precision approximate solution.
