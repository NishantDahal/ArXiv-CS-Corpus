On Board Data Handling (OBDH) based on PC104

Developing OBDH for satellite should consider the condition of the existing research facilities and resources in an institution. Many OBDH developments have been failed because not considering the capabilities of the institution. Considering to the capabilities of the institution is important, because it is major factor whether building OBDH can be realized successfully or not.
  System Design OBDH that has great opportunities to success in our research environment is to concentrate on developing the software for the OBDH. The software must be supported with the appropriate hardware which has been recognized as space qualified. Therefore selection board which has space qualified is important method: it has been conducted in this research. To develop good software in the term of perspective programming, fast, standardize, testable, multitasking: Operating System has been implemented in this OBDH.
  This research showed the OBDH development is pretty fast and more realizable to the limited institution resources. This research has produced an OBDH prototype in terms of hardware/board selection and software development.
