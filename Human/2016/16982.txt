Analogue-digital systems with modes of physical behaviour

Complex environments, processes and systems may exhibit several distinct modes of physical behaviour or operation. Thus, for example, in their design, a set of mathematical models may be needed, each model having its own domain of application and representing a particular mode of behaviour or operation of physical reality. The models may be of disparate kinds { discrete or continuous in data, time and space. Furthermore, some physical modes may not have a reliable model. Physical measurements determine modes of operation. We explore the question: What is a mode of behaviour? How do we specify algorithms and software that monitor or govern a complex physical situation with many modes? How do we specify a portfolio of modes, and the computational problem of transitioning from using one mode to another mode as physical modes change? We propose a general definition of an analogue-digital system with modes. We show how any diverse set of modes { with or without models { can be bound together, and how the transitions between modes can be determined, by constructing a topological data type based upon a simplicial complex. We illustrate the ideas of physical modes and our theory by reflecting on simple examples, including driverless racing cars.
