Future Wireless Network: MyNET Platform and End-to-End Network Slicing

Future wireless networks are facing new challenges. These new challenges require new solutions and strategies of the network deployment, management, and operation. Many driving factors are decisive in the re-definition and re-design of the future wireless network architecture. In the previously published paper "5G Wireless Network - MyNET and SONAC", MyNET and SONAC, a future network architecture, are described. This paper elaborates MyNET platform with more details. The design principles of MyNET architecture, the development of MyNET platform, the functions of MyNET platform, the automation of the creation and the management of end-to-end slices by MyNET, and the new capabilities enabled by MyNET are described in details.
