Graph Based Sinogram Denoising for Tomographic Reconstructions

Limited data and low dose constraints are common problems in a variety of tomographic reconstruction paradigms which lead to noisy and incomplete data. Over the past few years sinogram denoising has become an essential pre-processing step for low dose Computed Tomographic (CT) reconstructions. We propose a novel sinogram denoising algorithm inspired by the modern field of signal processing on graphs. Graph based methods often perform better than standard filtering operations since they can exploit the signal structure. This makes the sinogram an ideal candidate for graph based denoising since it generally has a piecewise smooth structure. We test our method with a variety of phantoms and different reconstruction methods. Our numerical study shows that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of analytical filtered back-projection (FBP) and iterative methods ART (Kaczmarz) and SIRT (Cimmino).We observed that graph denoised sinogram always minimizes the error measure and improves the accuracy of the solution as compared to regular reconstructions.
