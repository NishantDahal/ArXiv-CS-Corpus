Review on Telemonitoring of Maternal Health care Targeting Medical Cyber-Physical Systems

We aim to review available literature related to the telemonitoring of maternal health care for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of Medical Cyber-Physical-Systems (MCPS) as cutting edge technology in maternal risk factor management, and for understanding the possible research gap in the domain. In this regard, we search literature through google scholar and PubMed databases for published studies that focus on maternal telemonitoring systems using sensors, Cyber-Physical-System (CPS) and information decision systems for addressing risk factors We extract 1340 articles relevant to maternal health care that addresses different risk factors as their managerial issues. Of a large number of relevant articles, we included 26 prospective studies relating to sensors or Medical Cyber-Physical-Systems (MCPS) based maternal telemonitoring. Of the 1340 primary articles, we have short-listed 26 articles (12 articles for risk factor analysis, 9 for synthesis matrices and 5 papers for finding essential elements. We have extracted 17 vital symptoms as maternal risk factors during pregnancy. Moreover, we have identified a number of cyber-frameworks as the basis of information decision support system to cope with the different maternal complexities. We have found the Medical Cyber-Physical System (MCPS) as a promising technology to manage the vital risk factors quickly and efficiently by the care provider from a distant place to reduce the fatal risks. Despite communication issues, MCPS is a key-enabling technology to cope with the advancement of telemonitoring paradigm in the maternal health care system.
