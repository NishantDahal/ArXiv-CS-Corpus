User Access Mode Selection in Fog Computing Based Radio Access Networks

Fog computing based radio access network is a promising paradigm for the fifth generation wireless communication system to provide high spectral and energy efficiency. With the help of the new designed fog computing based access points (F-APs), the user-centric objectives can be achieved through the adaptive technique and will relieve the load of fronthaul and alleviate the burden of base band unit pool. In this paper, we derive the coverage probability and ergodic rate for both F-AP users and device-to-device users by taking into account the different nodes locations, cache sizes as well as user access modes. Particularly, the stochastic geometry tool is used to derive expressions for above performance metrics. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analysis and we obtain interesting trade-offs that depend on the effect of the cache size, user node density, and the quality of service constrains on the different performance metrics.
