This is the era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Nowadays, there is no limit to learn, people can learn anywhere and anytime with the enhancement of technology. Electronic Learning (E-learning) and Mobile Learning (M-learning) are the two vital buzz terms in modern education particularly in Education Enhanced Technology and Technologies Supported Learning. E-learning is defined as the instructional content or learning experience delivered or enabled by electronic technologies whereas, M-learning is defined simply as learning via mobile devices such as cell phones, smart phones, palmtops, and handheld computers. There are many similarities between the two technologies as both are modern learning tools. Moreover, the latter is an extension and a subset of the former. However, there are few limitations or differences still exist in mobile learning tools, especially in the design, development and the technology usability. In this paper we have mainly focused on how the digital content is administrated (Content Management) in these two technologies.
