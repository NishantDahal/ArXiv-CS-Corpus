Benign-Malignant Lung Nodule Classification with Geometric and Appearance Histogram Features

Lung cancer accounts for the highest number of cancer deaths globally. Early diagnosis of lung nodules is very important to reduce the mortality rate of patients by improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. This work proposes an automated system to classify lung nodules as malignant and benign in CT images. It presents extensive experimental results using a combination of geometric and histogram lung nodule image features and different linear and non-linear discriminant classifiers. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on the LIDC-IDRI public lung cancer screening thoracic computed tomography (CT) dataset containing nodule level diagnostic data. The obtained results are very encouraging correctly classifying 82% of malignant and 93% of benign nodules on unseen test data at best.
