Location Based Performance Model for Indoor mmWave Wearable Communication

Simultaneous use of high-end wearable wireless devices like smart glasses is challenging in a dense indoor environment due to the high nature of interference. In this scenario, the millimeter wave (mmWave) band offers promising potential for achieving gigabits per second throughput. Here we propose a novel system model for analyzing system performance of mmWave based communication among wearables. The proposed model accounts for the non-isotropy of the indoor environment and the effects of reflections that are predominant for indoor mmWave signals. The effect of human body blockages are modeled and the system performance is shown to hugely vary depending on the user location, body orientation and the density of the network. Closed form expressions for spatially averaged signal to interference plus noise ratio distribution are also derived as a function of the location and orientation of a reference user.
