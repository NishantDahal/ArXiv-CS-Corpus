A note on Edge Isoperimetric Numbers and Regular Graphs

This note resolves an open problem asked by Bezrukov in the open problem session of IWOCA 2014. It shows an equivalence between regular graphs and graphs for which a sequence of invariants presents some symmetric property. We extend this result to a few other sequences.
