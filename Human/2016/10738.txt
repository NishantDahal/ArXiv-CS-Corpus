Application of Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification on Pascal VOC Challenge 2012 dataset

In this project we work on creating a model to classify images for the Pascal VOC Challenge 2012. We use convolutional neural networks trained on a single GPU instance provided by Amazon via their cloud service Amazon Web Services (AWS) to classify images in the Pascal VOC 2012 data set. We train multiple convolutional neural network models and finally settle on the best model which produced a validation accuracy of 85.6% and a testing accuracy of 85.24%.
