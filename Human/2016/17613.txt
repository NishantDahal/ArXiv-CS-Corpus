Towards a Complete Framework for Virtual Data Center Embedding

Cloud computing is widely adopted by corporate as well as retail customers to reduce the upfront cost of establishing computing infrastructure. However, switching to the cloud based services poses a multitude of questions, both for customers and for data center owners. In this work, we propose an algorithm for optimal placement of multiple virtual data centers on a physical data center. Our algorithm has two modes of operation - an online mode and a batch mode. Coordinated batch and online embedding algorithms are used to maximize resource usage while fulfilling the QoS demands. Experimental evaluation of our algorithms show that acceptance rate is high - implying higher profit to infrastructure provider. Additionaly, we try to keep a check on the number of VM migrations, which can increase operational cost and thus lead to service level agreement violations.
