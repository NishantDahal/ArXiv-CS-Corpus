Antenna, Spectrum and Capacity trade-off for Cloud-RAN Massive Distributed MIMO over Next Generation PONs

We propose a cost-optimal antenna vs. spectrum resource allocation strategy for mobile 5G MD-MIMO over Next-Generation PONs. Comparing wavelength overlay and shared wavelength approaches, split-PHY leads to solutions with higher mobile capacity than fronthaul.
