Energy Efficient Scheduling and Groupping for Machine-TYpe Communications over Cellular Networks

In this paper, energy-efficient scheduling for grouped machine-type devices deployed in cellular networks is investigated. We introduce a scheduling-based cooperation incentive scheme which enables machine nodes to organize themselves locally, create machine groups, and communicate through group representatives to the base station. This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which takes into account the cooperation level of each node, reimburses the extra energy consumptions of group representatives, and maximizes the network lifetime. As reusing cellular uplink resources for communications inside the groups degrades the Quality of Service (QoS) of the primary users, analytical results are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number of simultaneously active machine groups in a given cell and QoS of the primary users. Furthermore, we extend our derived solutions for the existing cellular networks, propose a cooperation-incentive LTE scheduler, and present our simulation results in the context of LTE. The simulation results show that the proposed solutions significantly prolong the network lifetime. Also, it is shown that under certain circumstances, reusing uplink resource by machine devices can degrade the outage performance of the primary users significantly, and hence, coexistence management of machine devices and cellular users is of paramount importance for next generations of cellular networks in order to enable group-based machine-type communications while guaranteeing QoS for the primary users.
