Approximate optimality with bounded regret in dynamic matching models

We consider a discrete-time bipartite matching model with random arrivals of units of supply and demand that can wait in queues located at the nodes in the network. A control policy determines which are matched at each time. The focus is on the infinite-horizon average-cost optimal control problem. A relaxation of the stochastic control problem is proposed, which is found to be a special case of an inventory model, as treated in the classical theory of Clark and Scarf. The optimal policy for the relaxation admits a closed-form expression. Based on the policy for this relaxation, a new matching policy is proposed. For a parameterized family of models in which the network load approaches capacity, this policy is shown to be approximately optimal, with bounded regret, even though the average cost grows without bound.
