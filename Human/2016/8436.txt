Secure MIMO Relaying Network: An Artificial Noise Aided Robust Design Approach

Owing to the vulnerability of relay-assisted and device-to-device (D2D) communications, improving wireless security from a physical layer signal processing perspective is attracting increasing interest. Hence we address the problem of secure transmission in a relay-assisted network, where a pair of legitimate user equipments (UEs) communicate with the aid of a multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (eves). Assuming imperfect knowledge of the eves' channels, we jointly optimize the power of the source UE, the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying matrix and the covariance of the artificial noise (AN) transmitted by the relay, in order to maximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the destination, while imposing a set of robust secrecy constraints. To tackle the resultant nonconvex optimization problem, a globally optimal solution based on a bi-level optimization framework is proposed, but with high complexity. Then a low-complexity sub-optimal method relying on a new penalized difference-of-convex (DC) algorithmic framework is proposed, which is specifically designed for non-convex semidefinite programs (SDPs). We show how this penalized DC framework can be invoked for solving our robust secure relaying problem with proven convergence. Our extensive simulation results show that both proposed solutions are capable of ensuring the secrecy of the relay-aided transmission and significantly improve the robustness towards the eves' channel uncertainties as compared to the non-robust counterparts. It is also demonstrated the penalized DC-based method advocated yields a performance close to the globally optimal solution.
