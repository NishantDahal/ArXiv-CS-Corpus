An Intuitive Tangible Game Controller

This paper outlines the development of a sensory feedback device providing a tangible interface for controlling digital environments, in this example a flight simulator, where the intention for the device is that it is relatively low cost, versatile and intuitive. Gesture based input allows for a more immersive experience, so rather than making the user feel like they are controlling an aircraft the intuitive interface allows the user to become the aircraft that is controlled by the movements of the user's hand. The movements are designed to allow a sense of immersion that would be difficult to achieve with an alternative interface. A vibrotactile based haptic feedback is incorporated in the device to further enhance the connection between the user and the game environment by providing immediate confirmation of game events. When used for navigating an aircraft simulator, this device invites playful action and thrill. It bridges new territory on portable, low cost solutions for haptic devices in gaming contexts.
