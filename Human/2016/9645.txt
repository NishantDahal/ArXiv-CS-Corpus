Degrees of Freedom in Deep Neural Networks

In this paper, we explore degrees of freedom in deep sigmoidal neural networks. We show that the degrees of freedom in these models is related to the expected optimism, which is the expected difference between test error and training error. We provide an efficient Monte-Carlo method to estimate the degrees of freedom for multi-class classification methods. We show degrees of freedom are lower than the parameter count in a simple XOR network. We extend these results to neural nets trained on synthetic and real data, and investigate impact of network's architecture and different regularization choices. The degrees of freedom in deep networks are dramatically smaller than the number of parameters, in some real datasets several orders of magnitude. Further, we observe that for fixed number of parameters, deeper networks have less degrees of freedom exhibiting a regularization-by-depth.
