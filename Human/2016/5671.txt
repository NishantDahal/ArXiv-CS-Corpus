Voronoi Region-Based Adaptive Unsupervised Color Image Segmentation

Color image segmentation is a crucial step in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. This article introduces an adaptive and unsupervised clustering approach based on Voronoi regions, which can be applied to solve the color image segmentation problem. The proposed method performs region splitting and merging within Voronoi regions of the Dirichlet Tessellated image (also called a Voronoi diagram) , which improves the efficiency and the accuracy of the number of clusters and cluster centroids estimation process. Furthermore, the proposed method uses cluster centroid proximity to merge proximal clusters in order to find the final number of clusters and cluster centroids. In contrast to the existing adaptive unsupervised cluster-based image segmentation algorithms, the proposed method uses K-means clustering algorithm in place of the Fuzzy C-means algorithm to find the final segmented image. The proposed method was evaluated on three different unsupervised image segmentation evaluation benchmarks and its results were compared with two other adaptive unsupervised cluster-based image segmentation algorithms. The experimental results reported in this article confirm that the proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of the quality of image segmentation results. Also, the proposed method results in the lowest average execution time per image compared to the existing methods reported in this article.
