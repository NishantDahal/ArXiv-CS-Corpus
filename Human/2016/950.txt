The Security of WebRTC

WebRTC is an API that allows users to share streaming information, whether it is text, sound, video or files. It is supported by all major browsers and has a flexible underlying infrastructure. In this study we review current WebRTC structure and security in the contexts of communication disruption, modification and eavesdropping. In addition, we examine WebRTC security in a few representative scenarios, setting up and simulating real WebRTC environments and attacks.
