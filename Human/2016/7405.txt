A Fast Lightweight Time-Series Store for IoT Data

With the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), handling large volumes of time-series data has become a growing concern. Data, generated from millions of Internet-connected sensors, will drive new IoT applications and services. A key requirement is the ability to aggregate, preprocess, index, store and analyze data with minimal latency so that time-to-insight can be reduced. In the future, we expect real-time data collection and analysis to be performed both on small devices (e.g., in hubs and appliances) as well in server-based infrastructure. The ability to localize sensitive data to the home, and thus preserve privacy, is a key driver for small-device deployment.
  In this paper, we present an efficient architecture for time-series data management that provides a high data ingestion rate, while still being sufficiently lightweight that it can be deployed in embedded environments or small virtual machines. Our solution strives to minimize overhead and explores what can be done without complex indexing schemes that typically, for performance reasons, must be held in main memory. We combine a simple in-memory hierarchical index, log-structured store and in-flight sort, with a high-performance data pipeline architecture that is optimized for multicore platforms. We show that our solution is able to handle streaming insertions at over 4 million records per second (on a single x86 server) while still retaining SQL query performance better than or comparable to existing RDBMS.
