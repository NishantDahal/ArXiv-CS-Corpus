Capacity-Achieving Rate-Compatible Polar Codes

We present a method of constructing rate-compatible polar codes that are capacity-achieving with low-complexity sequential decoders. The proposed code construction allows for incremental retransmissions at different rates in order to adapt to channel conditions. The main idea of the construction exploits the common characteristics of polar codes optimized for a sequence of successively degraded channels. The proposed approach allows for an optimized polar code to be used at every transmission thereby achieving capacity.
