A polynomial kernel for Block Graph Deletion

In the Block Graph Deletion problem, we are given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and a positive integer $k$, and the objective is to check whether it is possible to delete at most $k$ vertices from $G$ to make it a block graph, i.e., a graph in which each block is a clique. In this paper, we obtain a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^{6})$ vertices for the Block Graph Deletion problem. This is a first step to investigate polynomial kernels for deletion problems into non-trivial classes of graphs of bounded rank-width, but unbounded tree-width. Our result also implies that Chordal Vertex Deletion admits a polynomial-size kernel on diamond-free graphs. For the kernelization and its analysis, we introduce the notion of `complete degree' of a vertex. We believe that the underlying idea can be potentially applied to other problems. We also prove that the Block Graph Deletion problem can be solved in time $10^{k}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.
