Overloaded Multiuser MISO Transmission with Imperfect CSIT

A required feature for the next generation of wireless communication networks will be the capability to serve simultaneously a large number of devices with heterogeneous CSIT qualities and demands. In this paper, we consider the overloaded MISO BC with two groups of CSIT qualities. We propose a transmission scheme where degraded symbols are superimposed on top of spatially-multiplexed symbols. The developed strategy allows to serve all users in a non-orthogonal manner and the analysis shows an enhanced perfomance compared to existing schemes. Moreover, optimality in a DoF sense is shown.
