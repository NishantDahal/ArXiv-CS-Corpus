Trace-distance measure of coherence

We show that trace distance measure of coherence is a strong monotone for all qubit and, so called, $X$ states. An expression for the trace distance coherence for all pure states and a semi definite program for arbitrary states is provided. We also explore the relation between $l_1$-norm and relative entropy based measures of coherence, and give a sharp inequality connecting the two. In addition, it is shown that both $l_p$-norm- and Schatten-$p$-norm-based measures violate the (strong) monotonicity for all $p\in(1,\infty)$.
