Level-Confluence of 3-CTRSs in Isabelle/HOL

We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization of an earlier result by Suzuki, Middeldorp, and Ida; namely that a certain class of conditional rewrite systems is level-confluent. Our formalization is basically along the lines of the original proof, from which we deviate mostly in the level of detail as well as concerning some basic definitions.
