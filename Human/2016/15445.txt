Computable g- Frames

The notion of g-frames for Hilbert spaces was introduced and studied by Wenchang Sun [16] as a generalization of the notion of frames. In this paper, we define computable g-frames in computable Hilbert spaces and obtain computable versions of some of their characterizations and related results.
