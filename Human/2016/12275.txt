Hard Clusters Maximize Mutual Information

In this paper, we investigate mutual information as a cost function for clustering, and show in which cases hard, i.e., deterministic, clusters are optimal. Using convexity properties of mutual information, we show that certain formulations of the information bottleneck problem are solved by hard clusters. Similarly, hard clusters are optimal for the information-theoretic co-clustering problem that deals with simultaneous clustering of two dependent data sets. If both data sets have to be clustered using the same cluster assignment, hard clusters are not optimal in general. We point at interesting and practically relevant special cases of this so-called pairwise clustering problem, for which we can either prove or have evidence that hard clusters are optimal. Our results thus show that one can relax the otherwise combinatorial hard clustering problem to a real-valued optimization problem with the same global optimum.
