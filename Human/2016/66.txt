TrAD: Traffic Adaptive Data Dissemination Protocol for Both Urban and Highway VANETs

Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) aim to improve transportation activities that include traffic safety, transport efficiency and even infotainment on the wheels, in which a great number of traffic event-driven messages are needed to disseminate in a region of interest timely. However, due to the nature of VANETs, highly dynamic mobility and frequent disconnection, data dissemination faces great challenges. Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) protocols are the key technology to mitigate this issue. Therefore, we propose an infrastructure-less Traffic Adaptive data Dissemination (TrAD) protocol that considers road traffic and network traffic status for both highway and urban scenarios. TrAD is flexible to fit the irregular road topology and owns double broadcast suppression techniques. Three state-of-the-art IVC protocols have been compared with TrAD by means of realistic simulations. The performance of all protocols is quantitatively evaluated with different real city maps and traffic routes. Finally, TrAD gets an outstanding overall performance in terms of several metrics, even though under the worse condition of GPS drift.
