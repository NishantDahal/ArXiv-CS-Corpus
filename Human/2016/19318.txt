Party Comrades and Constituency Buddies: Determinants of Private Initiative Cosponsor Networks in a Parliamentary Multiparty System

We study Members of Parliament (MP) private initiative (bill) cosponsor patterns from a European parliamentary multiparty perspective. By applying network detection algorithms, we set out to find the determinants of the cosponsorship patterns. The algorithms detect the initiative networks core communities, after which the variables characterizing the core communities can be analyzed. We found legislative network communities being best characterized by the MPs' party affiliations. The budget motion networks, which constitute roughly half of the data, were found mostly characterized by the MPs' home constituencies and only to a limited extent by the MPs' party affiliations. In comparison to previous findings regarding certain presidential systems, MPs committee assignments or gender were found irrelevant.
