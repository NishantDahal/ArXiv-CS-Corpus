A discrete log-Sobolev inequality under a Bakry-Emery type condition

We consider probability mass functions $V$ supported on the positive integers using arguments introduced by Caputo, Dai Pra and Posta, based on a Bakry--Ã‰mery condition for a Markov birth and death operator with invariant measure $V$. Under this condition, we prove a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality, generalizing and strengthening results of Wu, Bobkov and Ledoux, and Caputo, Dai Pra and Posta. We show how this inequality implies results including concentration of measure and hypercontractivity, and discuss how it may extend to higher dimensions.
