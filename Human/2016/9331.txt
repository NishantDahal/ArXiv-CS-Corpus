Conceptual Knowledge Relationship Model of Enterprise Architecture and Top Management Roles

Enterprise Architecture (EA) continues to gain global recognition as a management tool that would improve the organizations performance. However, based on literature, it was found that the lack of EA knowledge of top management (TM) hinders the assimiliation of EA. This study aims to gauge EA knowledge required for TM for providing a comprehensive support towards EA assimiliation. A semi-structured interviews were conducted with several personnels in an organization. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. This study found two sets of EA knowledge of TM; business knowledge and technology knowledge. A conceptual knowledge relationship model is proposed through synthesizing the roles of EA and TM in supporting the TM in identifying the EA knowledge required. The findings gave contribution to academicians and practitioners with knowledge of how to improve EA assimiliation and a structured roadmap for understanding EA to achieve high business value.
