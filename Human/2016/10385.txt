Multi-Fingered Robotic Grasping: A Primer

This technical report presents an introduction to different aspects of multi-fingered robot grasping. After having introduced relevant mathematical background for modeling, form and force closure are discussed. Next, we present an overview of various grasp planning algorithms with the objective of illustrating different approaches to solve this problem. Finally, we discuss grasp performance benchmarking.
