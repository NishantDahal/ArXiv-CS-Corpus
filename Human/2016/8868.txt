Outer Bounds on the Storage-Repair Bandwidth Tradeoff of Exact-Repair Regenerating Codes

In this paper, three outer bounds on the normalized storage-repair bandwidth (S-RB) tradeoff of regenerating codes having parameter set $\{(n,k,d),(α,β)\}$ under the exact-repair (ER) setting are presented. The first outer bound is applicable for every parameter set $(n,k,d)$ and in conjunction with a code construction known as {\em improved layered codes}, it characterizes the normalized ER tradeoff for the case $(n,k=3,d=n-1)$. It establishes a non-vanishing gap between the ER and functional-repair (FR) tradeoffs for every $(n,k,d)$. The second bound is an improvement upon an existing bound due to Mohajer et al. and is tighter than the first bound, in a regime away from the Minimum Storage Regeneraing (MSR) point. The third bound is for the case of $k=d$, under the linear setting. This outer bound matches with the achievable region of {\em layered codes} thereby characterizing the normalized ER tradeoff of linear ER codes when $k=d=n-1$.
