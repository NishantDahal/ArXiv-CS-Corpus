Tuning the Scheduling of Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent with Bayesian Optimization

We present an optimizer which uses Bayesian optimization to tune the system parameters of distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Given a specific context, our goal is to quickly find efficient configurations which appropriately balance the load between the available machines to minimize the average SGD iteration time. Our experiments consider setups with over thirty parameters. Traditional Bayesian optimization, which uses a Gaussian process as its model, is not well suited to such high dimensional domains. To reduce convergence time, we exploit the available structure. We design a probabilistic model which simulates the behavior of distributed SGD and use it within Bayesian optimization. Our model can exploit many runtime measurements for inference per evaluation of the objective function. Our experiments show that our resulting optimizer converges to efficient configurations within ten iterations, the optimized configurations outperform those found by generic optimizer in thirty iterations by up to 2X.
