Extracting Formal Models from Normative Texts

Normative texts are documents based on the deontic notions of obligation, permission, and prohibition. Our goal is to model such texts using the C-O Diagram formalism, making them amenable to formal analysis, in particular verifying that a text satisfies properties concerning causality of actions and timing constraints. We present an experimental, semi-automatic aid to bridge the gap between a normative text and its formal representation. Our approach uses dependency trees combined with our own rules and heuristics for extracting the relevant components. The resulting tabular data can then be converted into a C-O Diagram.
