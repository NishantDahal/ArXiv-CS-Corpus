Unique Sense: Smart Computing Prototype for Industry 4.0 Revolution with IOT and Bigdata Implementation Model

Today, The Computing architectures are one of the most complex constrained developing area in the research field. Which delivers solution for different domains computation problem from its stack above. The architectural integration constrains makes difficulties to customize and modify the system for dynamic industrial and business needs. This model is the initiation towards the solution for findings of Industry 4.0 and Bigdata needs. This Unique sense smart computing implementation model for Industry 4.0 holds the innovative Smart computing prototype is a part of UNIQUE SENSE computing architecture which can delivers alternate solution for today's computing architecture to satisfy the future generation needs of diversified technologies and techniques, which brings extended support to the ubiquitous environment. Primitively the industrial 4.0 having a lots of chained interlinked process which also holds valuable information. So it is especially designed for fault tolerance data processing integrated system. This implementation model constructed in the way that smart control and selfaccessible system for next generation cyber physical machine and automation controlling system. Also that focusing towards dynamic customization, reusability, eco friendliness for next generation controlling and computation power.
