Synthetic Language Generation and Model Validation in BEAST2

Generating synthetic languages aids in the testing and validation of future computational linguistic models and methods. This thesis extends the BEAST2 phylogenetic framework to add linguistic sequence generation under multiple models. The new plugin is then used to test the effects of the phenomena of word borrowing on the inference process under two widely used phylolinguistic models.
