Graph Isomorphism for unit square graphs

In the past decades for more and more graph classes the Graph Isomorphism Problem was shown to be solvable in polynomial time. An interesting family of graph classes arises from intersection graphs of geometric objects. In this work we show that the Graph Isomorphism Problem for unit square graphs, intersection graphs of axis-parallel unit squares in the plane, can be solved in polynomial time. Since the recognition problem for this class of graphs is NP-hard we can not rely on standard techniques for geometric graphs based on constructing a canonical realization. Instead, we develop new techniques which combine structural insights into the class of unit square graphs with understanding of the automorphism group of such graphs. For the latter we introduce a generalization of bounded degree graphs which is used to capture the main structure of unit square graphs. Using group theoretic algorithms we obtain sufficient information to solve the isomorphism problem for unit square graphs.
