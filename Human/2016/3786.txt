A Real-Time and Energy-Efficient Implementation of Difference-of-Gaussian with Flexible Thin-Film Transistors

With many advantageous features, softness and better biocompatibility, flexible electronic devices have developed rapidly and increasingly attracted attention. Many currently applications with flexible devices are sensors and drivers, while there is nearly no utilization aiming at complex computation since flexible devices have lower electron mobility, simple structure and large process variation. In this paper, we proposed an innovative method that enabled flexible devices to implement real-time and energy-efficient Difference-of-Gaussian, which illustrated feasibility and potentials for them to achieve complicated real-time computation in future generation products.
