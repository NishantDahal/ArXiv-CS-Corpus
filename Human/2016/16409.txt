Multiuser Rate-Diverse Network-Coded Multiple Access

This paper presents the first Network-Coded Multiple Access (NCMA) system with multiple users adopting different signal modulations, referred to as rate-diverse NCMA. A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of physical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost throughput of multipacket reception systems. In previous NCMA systems, users adopt the same modulation regardless of their individual channel conditions. This leads to suboptimal throughput for many practical scenarios, especially when different users have widely varying channel conditions. A rate-diverse NCMA system allows different users to use modulations that are commensurate with their channel conditions. A key challenge is the design of the PNC mapping and decoding mechanisms in NCMA when different users adopt different modulations. While there have been past work on non-channel-coded rate-diverse PNC, this paper is the first attempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC to ensure the reliability of the overall NCMA system. Specifically, we put forth a symbol-splitting channel coding and modulation design so that PNC/NCMA can work over different modulations. We implemented our rate-diverse NCMA system on software-defined radios. Experimental results show that the throughput of rate-diverse NCMA can outperform the state-of-the-art rate-homogeneous NCMA by 80%. Overall, the introduction of rate diversity significantly boosts the NCMA system throughput in practical scenarios.
