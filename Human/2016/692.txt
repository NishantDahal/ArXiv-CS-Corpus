Almost universal codes for fading wiretap channels

We consider a fading wiretap channel model where the transmitter has only statistical channel state information, and the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper have perfect channel state information. We propose a sequence of non-random lattice codes which achieve strong secrecy and semantic security over ergodic fading channels. The construction is almost universal in the sense that it achieves the same constant gap to secrecy capacity over Gaussian and ergodic fading models.
