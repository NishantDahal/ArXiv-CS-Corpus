Advanced Transport Options for the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP

Multimedia streaming over HTTP is no longer a niche research topic as it has entered our daily live. The common assumption is that it is deployed on top of the existing infrastructure utilizing application (HTTP) and transport (TCP) layer protocols as is. Interestingly, standards like MPEG's Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) do not mandate the usage of any specific transport protocol allowing for sufficient deployment flexibility which is further supported by emerging developments within both protocol layers. This paper investigates and evaluates the usage of advanced transport options for the dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP. We utilize a common test setup to evaluate HTTP/2.0 and Google's Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol in the context of DASH-based services.
