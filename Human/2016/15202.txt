Optimal Scheduling for Interference Mitigation by Range Information

The multiple access scheduling decides how the channel is shared among the nodes in the network. Typical scheduling algorithms aims at increasing the channel utilization and thereby throughput of the network. This paper describes several algorithms for generating an optimal schedule in terms of channel utilization for multiple access by utilizing range information in a fully connected network. We also provide detailed analysis for the proposed algorithms performance in terms of their complexity, convergence, and effect of non-idealities in the network. The performance of the proposed schemes are compared with non-aided methods to quantify the benefits of using the range information in the communication. The proposed methods have several favorable properties for the scalable systems. We show that the proposed techniques yields better channel utilization and throughput as the number of nodes in the network increases. We provide simulation results in support of this claim. The proposed methods indicate that the throughput can be increased on average by 3-10 times for typical network configurations.
