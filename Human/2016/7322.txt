SDNsec: Forwarding Accountability for the SDN Data Plane

SDN promises to make networks more flexible, programmable, and easier to manage. Inherent security problems in SDN today, however, pose a threat to the promised benefits. First, the network operator lacks tools to proactively ensure that policies will be followed or to reactively inspect the behavior of the network. Second, the distributed nature of state updates at the data plane leads to inconsistent network behavior during reconfigurations. Third, the large flow space makes the data plane susceptible to state exhaustion attacks.
  This paper presents SDNsec, an SDN security extension that provides forwarding accountability for the SDN data plane. Forwarding rules are encoded in the packet, ensuring consistent network behavior during reconfigurations and limiting state exhaustion attacks due to table lookups. Symmetric-key cryptography is used to protect the integrity of the forwarding rules and enforce them at each switch. A complementary path validation mechanism allows the controller to reactively examine the actual path taken by the packets. Furthermore, we present mechanisms for secure link-failure recovery and multicast/broadcast forwarding.
