Computing Zigzag Persistent Cohomology

Zigzag persistent homology is a powerful generalisation of persistent homology that allows one not only to compute persistence diagrams with less noise and using less memory, but also to use persistence in new fields of application. However, due to the increase in complexity of the algebraic treatment of the theory, most algorithmic results in the field have remained of theoretical nature.
  This article describes an efficient algorithm to compute zigzag persistence, emphasising on its practical interest. The algorithm is a zigzag persistent cohomology algorithm, based on the dualisation of reflections and transpositions transformations within the zigzag sequence.
  We provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm. We study the algorithm along two directions. First, we compare its performance with zigzag persistent homology algorithm and show the interest of cohomology in zigzag persistence. Second, we illustrate the interest of zigzag persistence in topological data analysis by comparing it to state of the art methods in the field, specifically optimised algorithm for standard persistent homology and sparse filtrations. We compare the memory and time complexities of the different algorithms, as well as the quality of the output persistence diagrams.
