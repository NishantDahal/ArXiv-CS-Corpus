On Dynamic Job Ordering and Slot Configurations for Minimizing the Makespan Of Multiple MapReduce Jobs

MapReduce is a popular parallel computing paradigm for Big Data processing in clusters and data centers. It is observed that different job execution orders and MapReduce slot configurations for a MapReduce workload have significantly different performance with regarding to the makespan, total completion time, system utilization and other performance metrics. There are quite a few algorithms on minimizing makespan of multiple MapReduce jobs. However, these algorithms are heuristic or suboptimal. The best known algorithm for minimizing the makespan is 3-approximation by applying Johnson rule. In this paper, we propose an approach called UAAS algorithm to meet the conditions of classical Johnson model. Then we can still use Johnson model for an optimal solution. We explain how to adapt to Johnson model and provide a few key features of our proposed method.
