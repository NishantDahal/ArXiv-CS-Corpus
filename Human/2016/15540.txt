Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Formal Methods for and on the Cloud

Cloud solutions are increasingly used for a plethora of purposes, including solving memory-intensive and computation-intensive problems. Ensuring the reliability, availability, scalability, and security of cloud solutions, as networked distributed systems with properties such as dynamic reallocation of resources, is a challenging problem that requires rigorous modeling, analysis, and verification tools. Such tools can be devised using the techniques provided by the formal methods community. On the other hand, many formal analysis and verification tools are memory-intensive and computation-intensive solutions, which can benefit from the cloud technology.
  The goal of the iFMCloud workshop is to identify and better understand challenges of using formal and semi-formal methods for modeling and verification of Cloud-based systems and computer and communication networks, as well as challenges and opportunities in providing formal analysis and verification as services on the Cloud. We aim to reach these goals by bringing together researchers and practitioners from these, and other related fields.
