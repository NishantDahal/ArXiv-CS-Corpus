Security Management Model in Cloud Computing Environment

In the cloud computing environment, cloud virtual machine (VM) will be more and more the number of virtual machine security and management faced giant Challenge. In order to address security issues cloud computing virtualization environment, this paper presents a virtual machine based on efficient and dynamic deployment VM security management model state migration and scheduling, study of which virtual machine security architecture, based on AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) virtual machine deployment and scheduling method, based on CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) DDoS attack detection algorithm, and the above-described method for functional testing and validation.
