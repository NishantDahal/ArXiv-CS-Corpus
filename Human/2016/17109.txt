Information Rates and post-FEC BER Prediction in Optical Fiber Communications

Information-theoretic metrics to analyze optical fiber communications systems with binary and nonbinary soft-decision FEC are reviewed. The numerical evaluation of these metrics in both simulations and experiments is also discussed. Ready-to-use closed-form approximations are presented.
