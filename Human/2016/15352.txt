Domain Specific Distributed Search Engine Based on Semantic P2P Networks

This paper presents a distributed search engine based on semantic P2P Networks. The user's computers join the domains in which user wants to share information in semantic P2P networks which is domain specific virtual tree (VIRGO ). Each user computer contains search engine which indexes the domain specific information on local computer or Internet. We can get all search information through P2P message provided by all joined computers. By companies' effort, we have implemented a prototype of distributed search engine, which demonstrates easily retrieving domain-related information provided by joined computers .
