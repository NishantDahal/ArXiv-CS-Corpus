NodIO, a JavaScript framework for volunteer-based evolutionary algorithms : first results

JavaScript is an interpreted language mainly known for its inclusion in web browsers, making them a container for rich Internet based applications. This has inspired its use, for a long time, as a tool for evolutionary algorithms, mainly so in browser-based volunteer computing environments. Several libraries have also been published so far and are in use. However, the last years have seen a resurgence of interest in the language, becoming one of the most popular and thus spawning the improvement of its implementations, which are now the foundation of many new client-server applications. We present such an application for running distributed volunteer-based evolutionary algorithm experiments, and we make a series of measurements to establish the speed of JavaScript in evolutionary algorithms that can serve as a baseline for comparison with other distributed computing experiments. These experiments use different integer and floating point problems, and prove that the speed of JavaScript is actually competitive with other languages commonly used by the evolutionary algorithm practitioner.
