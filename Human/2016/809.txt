A Routing Mechanism Based on Social Networks and Betweenness Centrality in Delay-Tolerant Networks

With the growing popularity of mobile smart devices, the existing networks are unable to meet the requirement of many complex scenarios; current network architectures and protocols do not work well with the network with high latency and frequent disconnections. To improve the performance of these networks some scholars opened up a new research field, delay-tolerant networks, in which one of the important research subjects is the forwarding and routing mechanism of data packets. This paper presents a routing scheme based on social networks owing to the fact that nodes in computer networks and social networks have high behavioural similarity. To further improve efficiency this paper also suggests a mechanism, which is the improved version of an existing betweenness centrality based routing algorithm. The experiments showed that the proposed scheme has better performance than the existing friendship routing algorithms.
