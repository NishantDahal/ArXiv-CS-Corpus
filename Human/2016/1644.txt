Wireless Information and Power Transfer for Multi-Relay Assisted Cooperative Communication

In this paper, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in multi-relay assisted two-hop relay system, where multiple relay nodes simultaneously assist the transmission from source to destination using the concept of distributed space-time coding. Each relay applies power splitting protocol to coordinate the received signal energy for information decoding and energy harvesting. The optimization problems of power splitting ratios at the relays are formulated for both decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocols. Efficient algorithms are proposed to find the optimal solutions. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.
