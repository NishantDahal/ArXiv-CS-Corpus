Holistic Small Cell Traffic Balancing across Licensed and Unlicensed Bands

Due to the dramatic growth in mobile data traffic on one hand and the scarcity of the licensed spectrum on the other hand, mobile operators are considering the use of unlicensed bands (especially those in 5 GHz) as complementary spectrum for providing higher system capacity and better user experience. This approach is currently being standardized by 3GPP under the name of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a holistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly optimizing the use of the licensed and unlicensed bands. We pose this traffic balancing as an optimization problem that seeks proportional fair coexistence of WiFi, small cell and macro cell users by adapting the transmission probability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and unlicensed bands. The motivation for this formulation is for the LTE-LAA small cell to switch between or aggregate licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the interference/traffic level and the number of active users in each band. We derive a closed form solution for this optimization problem and additionally propose a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on both bands. Through numerical and simulation results, we show that our proposed traffic balancing scheme, besides enabling better LTE-WiFi coexistence and efficient utilization of the radio resources relative to the existing traffic balancing scheme, also provides a better tradeoff between maximizing the total network throughput and achieving fairness among all network flows compared to alternative approaches.
