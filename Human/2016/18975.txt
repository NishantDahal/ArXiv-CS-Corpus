Second-order Cyclostationarity-based Detection of LTE SC-FDMA Signals for Cognitive Radio Systems

In this paper, we investigate the detection of long term evolution (LTE) single carrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) signals, with application to cognitive radio systems. We explore the second-order cyclostationarity of the LTE SC-FDMA signals, and apply results obtained for the cyclic autocorrelation function to signal detection. The proposed detection algorithm provides a very good performance under various channel conditions, with a short observation time and at low signal-to-noise ratios, with reduced complexity. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified using signals generated and acquired by laboratory instrumentation, and the experimental results show a good match with computer simulation results.
