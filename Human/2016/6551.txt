Designing Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Protocols for Linear Multi-Agent Systems Over Directed Graphs

This technical note addresses the distributed fixed-time consensus protocol design problem for multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics over directed communication graphs. By using motion planning approaches, a class of distributed fixed-time consensus algorithms are developed, which rely only on the sampling information at some sampling instants. For linear multi-agent systems, the proposed algorithms solve the fixed-time consensus problem for any directed graph containing a directed spanning tree. In particular, the settling time can be off-line pre-assigned according to task requirements. Compared with the existing results for multi-agent systems, to our best knowledge, it is the first-time to solve fixed-time consensus problems for general linear multi-agent systems over directed graphs having a directed spanning tree. Extensions to the fixed-time formation flying are further studied for multiple satellites described by Hill equations.
