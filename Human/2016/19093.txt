Multivariate mixture model for myocardium segmentation combining multi-source images

This paper proposes a method for simultaneous segmentation of multi-source images, using the multivariate mixture model (MvMM) and maximum of log-likelihood (LL) framework. The segmentation is a procedure of texture classification, and the MvMM is used to model the joint intensity distribution of the images. Specifically, the method is applied to the myocardial segmentation combining the complementary texture information from multi-sequence (MS) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Furthermore, there exist inter-image mis-registration and intra-image misalignment of slices in the MS CMR images. Hence, the MvMM is formulated with transformations, which are embedded into the LL framework and optimized simultaneously with the segmentation parameters. The proposed method is able to correct the inter- and intra-image misalignment by registering each slice of the MS CMR to a virtual common space, as well as to delineate the indistinguishable boundaries of myocardium consisting of pathologies. Results have shown statistically significant improvement in the segmentation performance of the proposed method with respect to the conventional approaches which can solely segment each image separately. The proposed method has also demonstrated better robustness in the incongruent data, where some images may not fully cover the region of interest and the full coverage can only be reconstructed combining the images from multiple sources.
