2016 Google Scholar Metrics released: a matter of languages... and something else

The 2016 edition of Google Scholar Metrics was released on July 15th 2016. There haven't been any structural changes respect to previous versions, which means that most of its limitations still persist. The biggest changes are the addition of five new language rankings (Russian, Korean, Polish, Ukrainian, and Indonesian) and elimination of two other language rankings (Italian and Dutch). In addition, for reasons still unknown, this new edition doesn't include as many working paper and discussion paper series as previous editions.
