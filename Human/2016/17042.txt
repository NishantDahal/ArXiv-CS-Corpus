Tackling Corruption With Agents & ICT: A Vision

Corruption is universally considered as an undesirable characteristic of public services. But despite attempts to simplify and automate such services, there is very little prior work to detect, handle or prevent corruption in computation literature. This is particularly surprising given the significant advances made in detecting fraud, a relevant but different form of public impropriety afflicting businesses. In this paper, we paint a vision of how information and communications technology (ICT), and specifically agent-based methods, can help tackle corruption in public services and identify challenges to achieve the vision.
