Towards an Understanding of Valence in E-Government Services

The Australian government, to remind job seekers of appointments with employment services providers in order to cut costs and free up human resources, is using technologies such as Short Messaging Services (SMS). However, the technologies in-use are but one side of this equation the specifics of how these technologies are used is the other side, and these specifics are highly under-theorized, particularly in regard to the views of the people to which these technologies are directed. The purpose of this paper is to provide a theoretical framing for this phenomenon as well as to introduce an emerging methodological direction that may allow for a better understanding of demographic-specific values and thereby better valence framing. The paper also theorizes reactions to information that could be applicable elsewhere, not just in e-government or with SMS, thereby contributing to discussions surrounding the Big Data debate.
