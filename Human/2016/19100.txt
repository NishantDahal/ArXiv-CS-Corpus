Capacity and Delay Tradeoff of Secondary Cellular Networks with Spectrum Aggregation

Cellular communication networks are plagued with redundant capacity, which results in low utilization and cost-effectiveness of network capital investments. The redundant capacity can be exploited to deliver secondary traffic that is ultra-elastic and delay-tolerant. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework to study the capacity-delay tradeoff of elastic/secondary traffic in large scale cellular networks with spectrum aggregation. Our framework integrates stochastic geometry and queueing theory models and gives analytical insights into the capacity-delay performance in the interference limited regime. Closed-form results are obtained to characterize the mean delay and delay distribution as functions of per user throughput capacity. The impacts of spectrum aggregation, user and base station (BS) densities, traffic session payload, and primary traffic dynamics on the capacity-delay tradeoff relationship are investigated. The fundamental capacity limit is derived and its scaling behavior is revealed. Our analysis shows the feasibility of providing secondary communication services over cellular networks and highlights some critical design issues.
