Liquid Humans - Pedestrian Simulator based on the LWR-model

Dense human flow has been a concern for the safety of public events for a long time. Macroscopic pedestrian models, which are mainly based on fluid dynamics, are often used to simulate huge crowds due to their low computational costs. Similar approaches are used in the field of traffic simulations. A combined macroscopic simulation of vehicles and pedestrians is extremely helpful for all-encompassing traffic control. Therefore, we developed a hybrid model that contains networks for vehicular traffic and human flow. This comprehensive model supports concurrent multi-modal simulations of traffic and pedestrians.
