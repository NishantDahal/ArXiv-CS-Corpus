But some researches on a search engine (searching) concluded that the average user error in the search is quite high due to several factors. Therefore, we need a development on this feature as search suggestion. This study discusses the application of the method of approximate string matching algorithm using levenshtein distance. Levensthein distance algorithm is capable of calculating the minimum distance conversion of a string into another string to the optimum. Archiving information system using Levensthein Algorithm String is an application that will be built to address these problems, this application will help, especially in the administration to enter or save a document, locate and make a report that will be seen by government agencies.
