Characterizing Smartphone Power Management in the Wild

For better reliability and prolonged battery life, it is important that users and vendors understand the quality of charging and the performance of smartphone batteries. Considering the diverse set of devices and user behavior it is a challenge. In this work, we analyze a large collection of battery analytics dataset collected from 30K devices of 1.5K unique smartphone models. We analyze their battery properties and state of charge while charging, and reveal the characteristics of different components of their power management systems: charging mechanisms, state of charge estimation techniques, and their battery properties. We explore diverse charging behavior of devices and their users.
