Improve Positioning Accuracy in WCDMA/FDD Networks Utilizing Adaptive Threshold for Direct Component Detection

In NLOS propagation conditions power of direct component can be attenuated significantly. Therefore detection of direct component is aggravated which can degrades accuracy of Time of Arrival mobile positioning. The goal of this paper is to determine possibilities to improve estimation of direct component time delay by reducing detection threshold. Three different methods for calculating threshold has been tested and compared in terms of positioning error.
