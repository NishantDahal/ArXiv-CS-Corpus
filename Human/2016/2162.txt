Approximate Capacity of Index Coding for Some Classes of Graphs

For a class of graphs for which the Ramsey number $R(i,j)$ is upper bounded by $ci^aj^b$, for some constants $a,b,$ and $c$, it is shown that the clique covering scheme approximates the broadcast rate of every $n$-node index coding problem in the class within a multiplicative factor of $c^{\frac{1}{a+b+1}} n^{\frac{a+b}{a+b+1}}$ for every $n$. Using this theorem and some graph theoretic arguments, it is demonstrated that the broadcast rate of planar graphs, line graphs and fuzzy circular interval graphs is approximated by the clique covering scheme within a factor of $n^{\frac{2}{3}}$.
