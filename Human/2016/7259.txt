AndorEstimator: Android based Software Cost Estimation Application

The main aim of the proposed system is to assist the software development team to estimate the cost, effort and maintenance of the project under development. Android-based platform, namely MIT App Inventor is used for the development of application, which contains visual block programming language. The current study has following uniqueness of (1)Accuracy of results,(2)user friendly environment(3)no such application is available on android platform to the best of our knowledge. Questionnaire regarding CoCoMo model is developed and circulated by using objective qualitative method. Findings: The estimation module of our application is quite important with respect to facilitating the students of software engineering for performing CoCoMo-based cost estimation easily, and enabling the software developers for performing software cost estimation easily. The cost estimator based on CoCoMo model is developed on android platform however, to the best of our knowledge no such application is available. This system can be used by business and educational stakeholders, such as students, software developers, and business organizations
