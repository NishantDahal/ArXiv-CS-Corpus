Transmission of Waveforms Determined by 7 Eigenvalues with PSK-Modulated Spectral Amplitudes

2-ns waveforms with 7 eigenvalues and their QPSK-modulated spectral amplitudes were optimized by taking constraints of link, transmitter, and receiver into account. In experiment these signals were transmitted with a BER of 3.2E-3 over 1440-km of NZ-DSF fiber spans.
