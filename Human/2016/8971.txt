Variable Neighborhood Search Based Algorithm for University Course Timetabling Problem

In this paper a variable neighborhood search approach as a method for solving combinatoric optimization problems is presented. A variable neighborhood search based algorithm for solving the problem concerning the university course timetable design has been developed. This algorithm is used to solve the real problem regarding the university course timetable design. It is compared with other algorithms that are tested on the same sets of input data. The object and the methodology of study are presented. The main objectives of the experiment are formulated. The conditions for conducting the experiment are specified. The results are analyzed and appropriate conclusions are made. The future trends of work in this field are presented.
