For-loops in Logic Programming

Logic programming has traditiLogic programming has traditionally lacked devices for expressing iterative tasks. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes iterative goal formulas of the form $\seqandq{x}{L} G$ where $G$ is a goal, $x$ is a variable, and $L$ is a list. $\seqandq{x}{L}$ is called a parallel bounded quantifier. These goals allow us to specify the following task: iterate $G$ with $x$ ranging over all the elements of $L$. onally lacked devices for expressing iterative tasks.
