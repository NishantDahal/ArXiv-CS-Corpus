Real-Time Image Distortion Correction: Analysis and Evaluation of FPGA-Compatible Algorithms

Image distortion correction is a critical pre-processing step for a variety of computer vision and image processing algorithms. Standard real-time software implementations are generally not suited for direct hardware porting, so appropriated versions need to be designed in order to obtain implementations deployable on FPGAs. In this paper, hardware-compatible techniques for image distortion correction are introduced and analyzed in details. The considered solutions are compared in terms of output quality by using a geometrical-error-based approach, with particular emphasis on robustness with respect to increasing lens distortion. The required amount of hardware resources is also estimated for each considered approach.
