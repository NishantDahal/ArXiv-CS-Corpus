Efficient distribution and improved security for reliable cloud storage system

The distributed data storage systems are constructed by large number of nodes which are interconnected over a network. Each node in such peer-to-peer network is vulnerable and at a potential risk for attack. The attackers can eavesdrop the nodes and possibly modify their data. Hence distributed storage systems should be secure apart from satisfying the reconstruction and repair requirements. We constructed a distributed storage system, Twin MDS code framework which is more efficient than the regenerating codes based storage systems. We prove that this Twin MDS code framework gives better performance than MBR codes and equal with MSR codes in the distribution process and investigate its security performance comparing with the security of the MBR and MSR codes. Such Twin MDS code framework is examined in an eavesdropper model where passive attackers can access to the stored data or/and downloaded data during the repair process. We demonstrate that the Twin MDS code framework manages better results than MBR and MSR codes regarding the security in the system.
