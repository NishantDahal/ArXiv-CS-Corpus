Hybrid Duplex Switching in Heterogeneous Networks

In this paper, a novel hybrid-duplex scheme based on received power is proposed for heterogeneous networks (HetNets). In the proposed scheme, the duplex mode (half- or full-duplex) of each user is switchable according to the received power from its serving base station (BS). The signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and spectral efficiency are analyzed for both downlink and uplink channels by using the tools of \emph{inhomogeneous} Poisson point process. Furthermore, determining power threshold for duplex mode switching is investigated for sum rate maximization, which is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem and a greedy algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The theoretical analysis and the proposed algorithm are evaluated by numerical simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid-duplex scheme outperforms the half-duplex or full-duplex HetNet schemes.
