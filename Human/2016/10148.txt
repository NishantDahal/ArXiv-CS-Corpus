Economics of Resilient Cloud Services

Computer systems today must meet and maintain service availability, performance, and security requirements. Each of these demands requires redundancy and some form of isolation. When service requirements are implemented separately, the system architecture cannot easily share common components of redundancy and isolation. We will present these service traits collectively as cyber resilience with a system called Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance or SCIT. Further, we will demonstrate that SCIT provides an effective resilient cloud implementation making cost effective utilization of cloud excess capacity and economies of scale. Lastly, we will introduce the notion of serverless applications utilizing AWS Lambda and how a stateless architecture can drastically reduce operational costs by utilizing cloud function services.
