Opportunistic Channel Sharing in Stochastic Networks with Dynamic Traffic

In this paper, we consider the stochastic network with dynamic traffic. The spatial distribution of access points (APs) and users are first modeled as mutually independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). Different from most previous literatures which assume all the APs are fully loaded, we consider the fact that APs having no data to transmit do not generate interference to users. The APs opportunistically share the channel according to the existence of the packet to be transmitted and the proposed interference suppression strategy. In the interference suppression region, only one AP can be active at a time to transmit the packet on the channel and the other adjacent APs keep silent to reduce serious interference. The idle probability of any AP, influenced by the traffic load and availability of the channels, is analyzed. The density of simultaneously active APs in the network is obtained and the packet loss rate is further elaborated. We reveal the impacts of network features (e.g., AP density, user density and channel state) and service features (e.g., user request, packet size) on the network performance. Simulation results validate our proposed model.
