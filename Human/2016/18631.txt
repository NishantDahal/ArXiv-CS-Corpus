Modeling Missing Data in Clinical Time Series with RNNs

We demonstrate a simple strategy to cope with missing data in sequential inputs, addressing the task of multilabel classification of diagnoses given clinical time series. Collected from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, our data consists of multivariate time series of observations. The measurements are irregularly spaced, leading to missingness patterns in temporally discretized sequences. While these artifacts are typically handled by imputation, we achieve superior predictive performance by treating the artifacts as features. Unlike linear models, recurrent neural networks can realize this improvement using only simple binary indicators of missingness. For linear models, we show an alternative strategy to capture this signal. Training models on missingness patterns only, we show that for some diseases, what tests are run can be as predictive as the results themselves.
