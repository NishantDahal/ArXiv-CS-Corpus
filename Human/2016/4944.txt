SWIPT in 3-D Bipolar Ad Hoc Networks with Sectorized Antennas

In this letter, we study the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) concept in 3-D bipolar ad hoc networks with spatial randomness. Due to three spatial dimensions of the network, we introduce a 3-D antenna sectorization that exploits the horizontal and the vertical spatial separation. The impact of 3-D antenna sectorization on SWIPT performance is evaluated for the power-splitting technique by using stochastic geometry tools. Theoretical and numerical results show that 3-D sectorization achieves a more accurate beam steering in the 3-D space, which can be beneficial for both the information and the power transfer.
