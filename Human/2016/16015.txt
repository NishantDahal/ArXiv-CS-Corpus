Automatic sequences, generalised polynomials, and nilmanifolds

We conjecture that bounded generalised polynomial functions cannot be generated by finite automata, except for the trivial case when they are periodic away from a finite set. Using methods from ergodic theory, we are able to partially resolve this conjecture, proving that any hypothetical counterexample is periodic away from a very sparse and structured set. In particular, we show that for a polynomial $p(n)$ with at least one irrational coefficient (except for the constant one) and integer $m$, the sequence $\lfloor p(n) \rfloor \bmod{m}$ is never automatic. We also obtain a conditional result, where we prove the conjecture under the assumption that the characteristic sequence of the set of powers of an integer $k\geq 2$ is not given by a generalised polynomial.
