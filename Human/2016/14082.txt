RALL - Routing-Aware Of Path Length, Link Quality, And Traffic Load For Wireless Sensor Networks

Due to the enormous variety of application scenarios and ubiquity,Internet of Things (IoT) brought a new perspective of applications for the current and future Internet. The Wireless Sensor Networks provide key devices for developing the IoT communication paradigm, such as the sensors collecting various kind of information and the routing and MAC protocols. However, this type of network has strong power consumption and transmission capacity restrictions (low speed wireless links and subject to interference). In this context, it is necessary to develop solutions that enable a more efficient communication based on the optimized utilization of the network resources. This papers aims to present a multi-objective routing algorithm, named Routing-Aware of path Length, Link quality, and traffic Load (RALL), that seeks to balance three objectives: to minimize bottlenecks, to minimize path length, and to avoid links with low quality. RALL results in good performance when taking into consideration delivery rate, overhead, delay, and power consumption.
