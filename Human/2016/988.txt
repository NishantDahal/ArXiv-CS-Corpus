TermPicker: Enabling the Reuse of Vocabulary Terms by Exploiting Data from the Linked Open Data Cloud - An Extended Technical Report

Deciding which vocabulary terms to use when modeling data as Linked Open Data (LOD) is far from trivial. Choosing too general vocabulary terms, or terms from vocabularies that are not used by other LOD datasets, is likely to lead to a data representation, which will be harder to understand by humans and to be consumed by Linked data applications. In this technical report, we propose TermPicker: a novel approach for vocabulary reuse by recommending RDF types and properties based on exploiting the information on how other data providers on the LOD cloud use RDF types and properties to describe their data. To this end, we introduce the notion of so-called schema-level patterns (SLPs). They capture how sets of RDF types are connected via sets of properties within some data collection, e.g., within a dataset on the LOD cloud. TermPicker uses such SLPs and generates a ranked list of vocabulary terms for reuse. The lists of recommended terms are ordered by a ranking model which is computed using the machine learning approach Learning To Rank (L2R). TermPicker is evaluated based on the recommendation quality that is measured using the Mean Average Precision (MAP) and the Mean Reciprocal Rank at the first five positions (MRR@5). Our results illustrate an improvement of the recommendation quality by 29% - 36% when using SLPs compared to the beforehand investigated baselines of recommending solely popular vocabulary terms or terms from the same vocabulary. The overall best results are achieved using SLPs in conjunction with the Learning To Rank algorithm Random Forests.
