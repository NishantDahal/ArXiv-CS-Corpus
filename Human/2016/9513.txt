Constructions of Good Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Error Correcting Codes

Entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) are a simple and fundamental class of codes. They allow for the construction of quantum codes from classical codes by relaxing the duality condition and using pre-shared entanglement between the sender and receiver. However, in general it is not easy to determine the number of shared pairs required to construct an EAQECC. In this paper, we show that this number is related to the hull of the classical code. Using this fact, we give methods to construct EAQECCs requiring desirable amount of entanglement. This leads to design families of EAQECCs with good error performance. Moreover, we construct maximal entanglement EAQECCs from LCD codes. Finally, we prove the existence of asymptotically good EAQECCs in the odd characteristic case.
