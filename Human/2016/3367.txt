Optimal Response to Burstable Billing under Demand Uncertainty

Burstable billing is widely adopted in practice, e.g., by colocation data center providers, to charge for their users, e.g., data centers, for data transferring. However, there is still a lack of research on what the best way is for a user to manage its workload in response to burstable billing. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel method to optimally respond to burstable billing under demand uncertainty. First, we develop a tractable mathematical expression to calculate the 95th percentile usage of a user, who is charged by provider via burstable billing for bandwidth usage. This model is then used to formulate a new bandwidth allocation problem to maximize the user's surplus, i.e., its net utility minus cost. Additionally, we examine different non-convex solution methods for the formulated stochastic optimization problem. We also extend our design to the case where a user can receive service from multiple providers, who all employ burstable billing. Using real-world workload traces, we show that our proposed method can reduce user's bandwidth cost by 26% and increase its total surplus by 23%, compared to the current practice of allocating bandwidth on-demand.
