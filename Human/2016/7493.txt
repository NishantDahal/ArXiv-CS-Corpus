Using Two Types of Computer Algebra Systems to Solve Maxwell Optics Problems

To synthesize Maxwell optics systems, the mathematical apparatus of tensor and vector analysis is generally employed. This mathematical apparatus implies executing a great number of simple stereotyped operations, which are adequately supported by computer algebra systems. In this paper, we distinguish between two stages of working with a mathematical model: model development and model usage. Each of these stages implies its own computer algebra system. As a model problem, we consider the problem of geometrization of Maxwell's equations. Two computer algebra systems---Cadabra and FORM---are selected for use at different stages of investigation.
