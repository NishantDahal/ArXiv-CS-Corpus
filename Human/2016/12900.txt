The DLVHEX System for Knowledge Representation: Recent Advances (System Description)

The DLVHEX system implements the HEX-semantics, which integrates answer set programming (ASP) with arbitrary external sources. Since its first release ten years ago, significant advancements were achieved. Most importantly, the exploitation of properties of external sources led to efficiency improvements and flexibility enhancements of the language, and technical improvements on the system side increased user's convenience. In this paper, we present the current status of the system and point out the most important recent enhancements over early versions. While existing literature focuses on theoretical aspects and specific components, a bird's eye view of the overall system is missing. In order to promote the system for real-world applications, we further present applications which were already successfully realized on top of DLVHEX. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming.
