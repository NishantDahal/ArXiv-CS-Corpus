Low-Complexity Hybrid Linear/Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding for Downlink Large-Scale MU-MIMO Systems

In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity hybrid linear/Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (H-L-THP) for downlink large-scale multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. The proposed precoder comprises an inner linear precoder which utilizes only the second order statistics of the channel state information (CSI) and outer THPs which use the instantaneous overall CSI of the cascade of the actual channel and the inner precoder. The user terminals are divided into groups, where for each group a THP successively mitigates the intra-group interference, whereas the inter-group interference is canceled by the inner linear precoder. Our simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed H-L-THP precoder is close to that of the conventional THP precoder, and is substantially lower than the BER of the commonly used regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder. Moreover, we derive exact expressions for the computational complexity of the proposed H-L-THP precoder in terms of the required numbers of floating-point operations. These results reveal that the proposed H-L-THP precoder has a much lower computational complexity than the conventional THP and RZF precoders, and is thus an excellent candidate for practical implementations.
