Using network centrality measures to improve national journal classification lists

In countries like Denmark and Spain classified journal lists are now being produced and used in the calculation of nationwide performance indicators. As a result, Danish and Spanish scholars are advised to contribute to journals of high 'authority' (as in the former) or those within a high class (as in the latter). This can create a few problems. The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential use of network centrality measures to identify possible mismatches of journal categories. It analysis the Danish National Authority List and the Spanish CIRC Classification. Based on a sample of Library and Information Science publications, it analyses centrality measures that can assess on the importance of journals to given fields, correcting mismatches in these classifications. We conclude by emphasising the use of these measures to better calibrate journal classifications as we observe a general bias in these lists towards older journals. Centrality measures can allow to identify periphery-to-core journals' transitions.
