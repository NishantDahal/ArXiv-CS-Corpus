Automatic TM Cleaning through MT and POS Tagging: Autodesk's Submission to the NLP4TM 2016 Shared Task

We describe a machine learning based method to identify incorrect entries in translation memories. It extends previous work by Barbu (2015) through incorporating recall-based machine translation and part-of-speech-tagging features. Our system ranked first in the Binary Classification (II) task for two out of three language pairs: English-Italian and English-Spanish.
