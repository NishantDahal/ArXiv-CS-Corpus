TwoPaCo: An efficient algorithm to build the compacted de Bruijn graph from many complete genomes

Motivation: De Bruijn graphs have been proposed as a data structure to facilitate the analysis of related whole genome sequences, in both a population and comparative genomic settings. However, current approaches do not scale well to many genomes of large size (such as mammalian genomes). Results: In this paper, we present TwoPaCo, a simple and scalable low memory algorithm for the direct construction of the compacted de Bruijn graph from a set of complete genomes. We demonstrate that it can construct the graph for 100 simulated human genomes in less then a day and eight real primates in less than two hours, on a typical shared-memory machine. We believe that this progress will enable novel biological analyses of hundreds of mammalian-sized genomes.
