MIMO UWB Radar System with Compressive Sensing

A multiple input multiple output ultra-wideband cognitive radar based on compressive sensing is presented in this letter. For traditional UWB radar, high sampling rate analog to digital converter at the receiver is required to meet Shannon theorem, which increases hardware complexity. In order to bypass the bottleneck of ADC or further increase the radar bandwidth using the latest wideband ADC, we propose to exploit CS for signal reconstruction at the receiver of UWB radar for the sparse targets in the surveillance area. Besides, the function of narrowband interference cancellation is integrated into the proposed MIMO UWB radar. The field demonstration proves the feasibility and reliability of the proposed algorithm.
