Proceedings 9th Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE 2016, the 9th Interaction and Concurrency Experience, which was held in Heraklion, Greece on the 8th and 9th of June 2016 as a satellite event of DisCoTec 2016. The ICE procedure for paper selection allows PC members to interact, anonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a discussion forum whose access is restricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of interest. The PC members post comments and questions that the authors reply to. For the first time, the 2016 edition of ICE included a feature targeting review transparency: reviews of accepted papers were made public on the workshop website and workshop participants in particular were able to access them during the workshop. Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether nine papers were accepted for publication (the workshop also featured three brief announcements which are not part of this volume). We were proud to host two invited talks, by Alexandra Silva and Uwe Nestmann. The abstracts of these two talks are included in this volume together with the regular papers.
