The Effects of Latency Penalties in Evaluating Push Notification Systems

We examine the effects of different latency penalties in the evaluation of push notification systems, as operationalized in the TREC 2015 Microblog track evaluation. The purpose of this study is to inform the design of metrics for the TREC 2016 Real-Time Summarization track, which is largely modeled after the TREC 2015 evaluation design.
