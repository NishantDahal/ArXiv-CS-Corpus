Integrated Resource Management in Software Defined Networking, Caching and Computing

Recently, there are significant advances in the areas of networking, caching and computing. Nevertheless, these three important areas have traditionally been addressed separately in the existing research. In this paper, we present a novel framework that integrates networking, caching and computing in a systematic way and enables dynamic orchestration of these three resources to improve the end-to-end system performance and meet the requirements of different applications. Then, we consider the bandwidth, caching and computing resource allocation issue and formulate it as a joint caching/computing strategy and servers selection problem to minimize the combination cost of network usage and energy consumption in the framework. To minimize the combination cost of network usage and energy consumption in the framework, we formulate it as a joint caching/computing strategy and servers selection problem. In addition, we solve the joint caching/computing strategy and servers selection problem using an exhaustive-search algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the traditional network without in-network caching/computing in terms of network usage and energy consumption.
