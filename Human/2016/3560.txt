An efficient Exact-PGA algorithm for constant curvature manifolds

Manifold-valued datasets are widely encountered in many computer vision tasks. A non-linear analog of the PCA, called the Principal Geodesic Analysis (PGA) suited for data lying on Riemannian manifolds was reported in literature a decade ago. Since the objective function in PGA is highly non-linear and hard to solve efficiently in general, researchers have proposed a linear approximation. Though this linear approximation is easy to compute, it lacks accuracy especially when the data exhibits a large variance. Recently, an alternative called exact PGA was proposed which tries to solve the optimization without any linearization. For general Riemannian manifolds, though it gives better accuracy than the original (linearized) PGA, for data that exhibit large variance, the optimization is not computationally efficient. In this paper, we propose an efficient exact PGA for constant curvature Riemannian manifolds (CCM-EPGA). CCM-EPGA differs significantly from existing PGA algorithms in two aspects, (i) the distance between a given manifold-valued data point and the principal submanifold is computed analytically and thus no optimization is required as in existing methods. (ii) Unlike the existing PGA algorithms, the descent into codimension-1 submanifolds does not require any optimization but is accomplished through the use of the Rimeannian inverse Exponential map and the parallel transport operations. We present theoretical and experimental results for constant curvature Riemannian manifolds depicting favorable performance of CCM-EPGA compared to existing PGA algorithms. We also present data reconstruction from principal components and directions which has not been presented in literature in this setting.
