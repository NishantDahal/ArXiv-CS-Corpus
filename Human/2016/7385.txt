Notes on a model for fuzzy computing

In these notes we propose a setting for fuzzy computing in a framework similar to that of well-established theories of computation: boolean, and quantum computing. Our efforts have been directed towards stressing the formal similarities: there is a common pattern underlying these three theories. We tried to conform our approach, as much as possible, to this pattern. This work was part of a project jointly with Professor Vittorio Cafagna. Professor Cafagna passed away unexpectedly in 2007. His intellectual breadth and inspiring passion for mathematics is still very well alive.
