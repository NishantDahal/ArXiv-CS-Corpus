Computer-assisted workflows composition based on Virtual Simulation Objects technology

The existing approaches for scientific workflows composition face the problems of domain knowledge integration. By this paper we summarize the results, which have been elaborated and implemented during the 2-year research concerning to Virtual Simulation Objects (VSO) concept and technology development. The contribution of this paper consists of formal models of the VSO internal structures and user-assistance logic, which may be obtained as a result of the reasoning over knowledge base. (This paper was rejected to appear in "Recent Advances in Knowledge Based Technologies and Applications" by Hindawi in 2014, but was stolen and published by Ke Han under the name "The Study on Workflows Composition Based on Virtual Simulation Objects Technology")
