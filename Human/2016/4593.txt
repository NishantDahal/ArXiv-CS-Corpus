Semantic Reasoning for Context-aware Internet of Things Applications

Advances in ICT are bringing into reality the vision of a large number of uniquely identifiable, interconnected objects and things that gather information from diverse physical environments and deliver the information to a variety of innovative applications and services. These sensing objects and things form the Internet of Things (IoT) that can improve energy and cost efficiency and automation in many different industry fields such as transportation and logistics, health care and manufacturing, and facilitate our everyday lives as well. IoT applications rely on real-time context data and allow sending information for driving the behaviors of users in intelligent environments.
