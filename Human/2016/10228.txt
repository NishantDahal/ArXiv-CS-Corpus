Joint Embedding of Hierarchical Categories and Entities for Concept Categorization and Dataless Classification

Due to the lack of structured knowledge applied in learning distributed representation of cate- gories, existing work cannot incorporate category hierarchies into entity information. We propose a framework that embeds entities and categories into a semantic space by integrating structured knowledge and taxonomy hierarchy from large knowledge bases. The framework allows to com- pute meaningful semantic relatedness between entities and categories. Our framework can han- dle both single-word concepts and multiple-word concepts with superior performance on concept categorization and yield state of the art results on dataless hierarchical classification.
