Combining Vision, Machine Learning and Automatic Control to Play the Labyrinth Game

The labyrinth game is a simple yet challenging platform, not only for humans but also for control algorithms and systems. The game is easy to understand but still very hard to master. From a system point of view, the ball behaviour is in general easy to model but close to the obstacles there are severe non-linearities. Additionally, the far from flat surface on which the ball rolls provides for changing dynamics depending on the ball position. The general dynamics of the system can easliy be handled by traditional automatic control methods. Taking the obstacles and uneaven surface into accout would require very detailed models of the system. A simple deterministic control algorithm is combined with a learning control method. The simple control method provides initial training data. As the learning method is trained, the system can learn from the results of its own actions and the performance improves well beyond the performance of the initial controller. A vision system and image analysis is used to estimate the ball position while a combination of a PID controller and a learning controller based on LWPR is used to learn to navigate the ball through the maze.
