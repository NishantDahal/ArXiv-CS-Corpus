On the capacity of the binary adversarial wiretap channel

New bounds on the semantic secrecy capacity of the binary adversarial wiretap channel are established . Against an adversary which reads a $ρ_r$ fraction of the transmitted codeword and modifies a $ρ_w$ fraction of the codeword, we show an achievable rate of $1-h(ρ_w)-ρ_r$, where $h(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. We also give an upper bound which is nearly matching when $ρ_r$ is small.
