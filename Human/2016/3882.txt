Remarks on Frankl's conjecture

First a few reformulations of Frankl's conjecture are given, in terms of reduced families or matrices, or analogously in terms of lattices. These lead naturally to a stronger conjecture with a neat formulation which might be easier to attack than Frankl's. To this end we prove an inequality which might help in proving the stronger conjecture.
