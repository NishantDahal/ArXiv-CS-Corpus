Mathematical analysis of the spreading of a rumor among different subgroups of spreaders

This paper presents a system of differential equations that describes the spreading of a rumor when it is propagated by different subgroups of spreaders. The system that is developed is a generalization of the model proposed by Daley and Kendall. Finally, the system is applied to the exchange rate of the parallel dollar in Venezuela, where the source data that was used were obtained from Google Trends.
