Electoral Systems Used around the World

We give an overview of the diverse electoral systems used in local, national, or super-national elections around the world. We discuss existing methods for selecting single and multiple winners and give real-world examples for some more elaborate systems. Eventually, we elaborate on some of the better known strengths and weaknesses of various methods from both the theoretical and practical points of view.
