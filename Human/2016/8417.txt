Validation of the Replica Trick for Simple Models

We discuss replica analytic continuation using several simple models in order to prove mathematically the validity of replica analysis, which is used in a wide range of fields related to large scale complex systems. While replica analysis consists of two analytical techniques, the replica trick (or replica analytic continuation) and the thermodynamical limit (and/or order parameter expansion), we focus our study on replica analytic continuation, which is the mathematical basis of the replica trick. We apply replica analysis to solve a variety of analytical models, and examine the properties of replica analytic continuation. Based on the positive results for these models we propose that replica analytic continuation is a robust procedure in replica analysis.
