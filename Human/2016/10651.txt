Lightweight Security Protocol for WiSense based Wireless Sensor Network

Wireless Sensor Networks have emerged as one of the leading technologies. These networks are designed to monitor crucial environmental parameters of humidity, temperature, wind speed, soil moisture content, UV index, sound, etc. and then transfer the required information to the base station. However, security remains the key challenge of such networks as critical data is being transferred. Most sensor nodes currently deployed have constraints on memory and processing power and hence operate without an efficient security protocol. Hereby a protocol which is lightweight and is secure for wireless sensor applications is proposed.
