Planning system for deliveries in Medellín

Here we present the implementation of an application capable of planning the shortest delivery route in the city of Medellín, Colombia. We discuss the different approaches to this problem which is similar to the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), but differs in the fact that, in our problem, we can visit each place (or vertex) more than once. Solving this problem is important since it would help people, especially stores with delivering services, to save time and money spent in fuel, because they can plan any route in an efficient way.
