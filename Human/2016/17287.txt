A conservation rule for constructing bibliometric network matrices

The social network analysis of bibliometric data needs matrices to be recast in a network framework. In this paper we argue that a simple conservation rule requires that this should be done only using fractional counting so that conservation at the paper level will be faithfully reproduced at higher levels ofaggregation (i.e. author, institute, country, journal etc.) of the complex network.
