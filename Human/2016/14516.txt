Coexistence of Filter Banks and CP-OFDM: What are the Real Gains?

A coexistence scenario between filter bank (FB) based waveforms and legacy Cyclic Prefix-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM) is studied. It is shown that studies available on that matter use a wrong metric to rate the interference between the coexisting systems. Specifically, it is shown that even well spectrally localized FB waveforms interfere at a high level with incumbent CP-OFDM receivers. The presented results invalidate a number of studies in the literature, which stated that FB based waveforms could be very efficiently used to insert communications in parts of spectrum left free by incumbent legacy CP-OFDM users.
