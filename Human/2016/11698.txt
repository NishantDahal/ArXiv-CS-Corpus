A Direct Algorithm to Compute the Topological Euler Characteristic and Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson Class of Projective Complete Intersection Varieties

Let $V$ be a possibly singular scheme-theoretic complete intersection subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^n$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Using a recent result of Fullwood ("On Milnor classes via invariants of singular subschemes", Journal of Singularities) we develop an algorithm to compute the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class and Euler characteristic of $V$. This algorithm complements existing algorithms by providing performance improvements in the computation of the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class and Euler characteristic for certain types of complete intersection subschemes of $\mathbb{P}^n$.
