Pure and Stationary Optimal Strategies in Perfect-Information Stochastic Games with Global Preferences

We examine the problem of the existence of optimal deterministic stationary strategiesintwo-players antagonistic (zero-sum) perfect information stochastic games with finitely many states and actions.We show that the existenceof  such strategies follows from the existence of optimal deterministic stationarystrategies for some derived one-player games.Thus we reducethe problem from two-player to one-player games (Markov decisionproblems),  where usually it is much easier to  tackle.The reduction is very general, it holds not only for all possible payoff mappings but alsoin more a general situations whereplayers' preferences are not expressed by payoffs.
