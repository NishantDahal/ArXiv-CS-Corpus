Detection of Dangerous Magnetic Field Ranges from Tablets by Clustering Analysis

The paper considers the problem of the extremely low frequency magnetic field radiation generated by the tablet computers. Accordingly, the measurement of the magnetic field radiation from a set of tablets is carried out. Furthermore, the measurement results are analyzed and clustered according to the K-Medians algorithm to obtain different magnetic field ranges. The obtained cluster ranges are evaluated according to the reference level proposed by the TCO standard in order to define dangerous areas in the neighborhood of tablet, which are established during the typical work with tablet computers. Analysis shows that dangerous areas correspond to specific inner components of tablet, and gives suggestions to users for a safe usage of tablet and to companies producing tablet components for limiting the risk of magnetic field exposure.
