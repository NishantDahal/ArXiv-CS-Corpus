Learning to Abstain from Binary Prediction

A binary classifier capable of abstaining from making a label prediction has two goals in tension: minimizing errors, and avoiding abstaining unnecessarily often. In this work, we exactly characterize the best achievable tradeoff between these two goals in a general semi-supervised setting, given an ensemble of predictors of varying competence as well as unlabeled data on which we wish to predict or abstain. We give an algorithm for learning a classifier in this setting which trades off its errors with abstentions in a minimax optimal manner, is as efficient as linear learning and prediction, and is demonstrably practical. Our analysis extends to a large class of loss functions and other scenarios, including ensembles comprised of specialists that can themselves abstain.
