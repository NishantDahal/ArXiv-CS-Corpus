Network as a Service: The New Vista of Opportunities

The networking industry, compared to the compute industry, has been slow in evolving from a closed ecosystem with limited abstractions to a more open ecosystem with well-defined sophisticated high level abstractions. This has resulted in an ossified Internet architecture that inhibits innovation and is unnecessarily complex. Fortunately, there has been an exciting flux of rapid developments in networking in recent times with prominent trends emerging that have brought us to the cusp of a major paradigm shift. In particular, the emergence of technologies such as cloud computing, software defined networking (SDN), and network virtualization are driving a new vision of `networking as a service' (NaaS) in which networks are managed flexibly and efficiently cloud computing style. These technologies promise to both facilitate architectural and technological innovation while also simplifying commissioning, orchestration, and composition of network services. In this article, we introduce our readers to these technologies. In the coming few years, the trends of cloud computing, SDN, and network virtualization will further strengthen each other's value proposition symbiotically and NaaS will increasingly become the dominant mode of commissioning new networks.
