Lattice spanners of low degree

Let $δ_0(P,k)$ denote the degree $k$ dilation of a point set $P$ in the domain of plane geometric spanners. If $Λ$ is the infinite square lattice, it is shown that $1+\sqrt{2} \leq δ_0(Λ,3) \leq (3+2\sqrt2) \, 5^{-1/2} = 2.6065\ldots$ and $δ_0(Λ,4) = \sqrt{2}$. If $Λ$ is the infinite hexagonal lattice, it is shown that $δ_0(Λ,3) = 1+\sqrt{3}$ and $δ_0(Λ,4) = 2$. All our constructions are planar lattice tilings constrained to degree $3$ or $4$.
