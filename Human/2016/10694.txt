Android Permission Model

The recent evolution on the smart phone technology has made its application market huge and less secure. Every single day large number of apps introduced in the android market (mostly on google play store) without any particular inspections which creates a lot of security issues and they remain unresolved. There are a lot of recent and increasing security issues which are mostly caused by the android apps. Mainly, the access of user data through the apps relied on the users given permission to apps.So, it is always a big question that how different apps on the android smart phones bypass the android permission model to have root access and how user data compromised or stolen by its apps. It is not startling that the Google Play Store has massive number of malicious apps that may gain users attention to fall victim for one, but some time it might be even worse than we thought. In this paper, we will look at the security issues (i.e. rooting phone, malware bypassing and secondary storage) and how easy to get access to users phone by using its app.
  Furthermore, I will discuss the android update mechanism and its functionalities as well as vulnerability to possible third party bypassing and root access. Moreover, a key feature and source of the all possible access route to android applications I will discuss an android permission model. Finally, I will first time present concept of the feature based development model implementing a feature based permission selections as a solution to android application system and describe the purposed Feature based permission model in detail how it is the solution for current security issues caused by intentional (evil coded) or unintentional (poorly coded) coding using android permission models.
