Security in The Gaussian Interference Channel: Weak and Moderately Weak Interference Regimes

We consider a secure communication scenario through the two-user Gaussian interference channel: each transmitter (user) has a confidential message to send reliably to its intended receiver while keeping it secret from the other receiver. Prior work investigated the performance of two different approaches for this scenario; i.i.d. Gaussian random codes and real alignment of structured codes. While the latter achieves the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.), its extension to finite SNR regimes is challenging. In this paper, we propose a new achievability scheme for the weak and the moderately weak interference regimes, in which the reliability as well as the confidentiality of the transmitted messages are maintained at any finite SNR value. Our scheme uses lattice structure, structured jamming codewords, and lattice alignment in the encoding and the asymmetric compute-and-forward strategy in the decoding. We show that our lower bound on the sum secure rates scales linearly with log(SNR) and hence, it outperforms i.i.d. Gaussian random codes. Furthermore, we show that our achievable result is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we provide a discussion on an extension of our scheme to K>2 users.
