Physical Layer Security in Three-Tier Wireless Sensor Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach

This paper develops a tractable framework for exploiting the potential benefits of physical layer security in three-tier wireless sensor networks using stochastic geometry. In such networks, the sensing data from the remote sensors are collected by sinks with the help of access points, and the external eavesdroppers intercept the data transmissions.We focus on the secure transmission in two scenarios: i) the active sensors transmit their sensing data to the access points, and ii) the active access points forward the data to the sinks. We derive new compact expressions for the average secrecy rate in these two scenarios. We also derive a new compact expression for the overall average secrecy rate. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and show that multiple antennas at the access points can enhance the security of three-tier wireless sensor networks. Our results show that increasing the number of access points decreases the average secrecy rate between the access point and its associated sink. However, we find that increasing the number of access points first increases the overall average secrecy rate, with a critical value beyond which the overall average secrecy rate then decreases. When increasing the number of active sensors, both the average secrecy rate between the sensor and its associated access point and the overall average secrecy rate decrease. In contrast, increasing the number of sinks improves both the average secrecy rate between the access point and its associated sink, as well as the overall average secrecy rate.
