Proceedings Second Graphs as Models Workshop

Graphs are used as models in all areas of computer science: examples are state space graphs, control flow graphs, syntax graphs, UML-type models of all kinds, network layouts, social networks, dependency graphs, and so forth. Once such graphical models are constructed, they can be analysed and transformed to verify their correctness within a domain, discover new properties, or produce new equivalent and/or optimised versions.
  Graphs as Models' main focus is the exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds. The workshop serves as platform to boost inter- and transdisciplinary research and wants to serve as leeway for new ideas. Thus, besides classical research presentations, the workshop is highly geared toward numerous interactive sessions.
  The second edition of the Graphs as Models workshop was held on 2-3 June 2016 in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, colocated with the 19th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2016).
