A Nonparametric Latent Factor Model For Location-Aware Video Recommendations

We are interested in learning customers' video preferences from their historic viewing patterns and geographical location. We consider a Bayesian latent factor modeling approach for this task. In order to tune the complexity of the model to best represent the data, we make use of Bayesian nonparameteric techniques. We describe an inference technique that can scale to large real-world data sets. Finally we show results obtained by applying the model to a large internal Netflix data set, that illustrates that the model was able to capture interesting relationships between viewing patterns and geographical location.
