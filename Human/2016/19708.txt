Double Successive Rough Set Approximations

We examine double successive approximations on a set, which we denote by $L_2L_1, \ U_2U_1, U_2L_1,$ $L_2U_1$ where $L_1, U_1$ and $L_2, U_2$ are based on generally non-equivalent equivalence relations $E_1$ and $E_2$ respectively, on a finite non-empty set $V.$ We consider the case of these operators being given fully defined on its powerset $\mathscr{P}(V).$ Then, we investigate if we can reconstruct the equivalence relations which they may be based on. Directly related to this, is the question of whether there are unique solutions for a given defined operator and the existence of conditions which may characterise this. We find and prove these characterising conditions that equivalence relation pairs should satisfy in order to generate unique such operators.
