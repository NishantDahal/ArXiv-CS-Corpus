Complementary Dual Algebraic Geometry Codes

Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes is a class of linear codes introduced by Massey in 1964. LCD codes have been extensively studied in literature recently. In addition to their applications in data storage, communications systems, and consumer electronics, LCD codes have been employed in cryptography. More specifically, it has been shown that LCD codes can also help improve the security of the information processed by sensitive devices, especially against so-called side-channel attacks (SCA) and fault non-invasive attacks. In this paper, we are interested in the construction of particular algebraic geometry (AG) LCD codes which could be good candidates to be resistant against SCA. We firstly provide a construction scheme for obtaining LCD codes from elliptic curves. Then, some explicit LCD codes from elliptic curve are presented. MDS codes are of the most importance in coding theory due to their theoretical significance and practical interests. In this paper, all the constructed LCD codes from elliptic curves are MDS or almost MDS. Some infinite classes of LCD codes from elliptic curves are optimal due to the Griesmer bound. Finally, we introduce a construction mechanism for obtaining LCD codes from any algebraic curve and derive some explicit LCD codes from hyperelliptic curves and Hermitian curves.
