Event-driven Adaptation in COP

Context-Oriented Programming languages provide us with primitive constructs to adapt program behaviour depending on the evolution of their operational environment, namely the context. In previous work we proposed ML_CoDa, a context-oriented language with two-components: a declarative constituent for programming the context and a functional one for computing. This paper describes an extension of ML_CoDa to deal with adaptation to unpredictable context changes notified by asynchronous events.
