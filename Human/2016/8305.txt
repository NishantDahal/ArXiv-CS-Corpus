XML Entity Architecture for Efficient Software Integration

This paper proposed xml entities based architectural implementation to improve integration between multiple third party vendor software systems with incompatible xml schema. The xml entity architecture implementation showed that the lines of code change required for mapping the schema between in house software and three other vendor schema, decreased by 5.2%, indicating an improvement in quality. The schema mapping development time decreased by 3.8% and overall release time decreased by 5.3%, indicating an improvement in productivity. The proposed technique proved that using xml entities and XSLT transforms is more efficient in terms of coding effort and deployment complexity when compared to mapping the schema using object oriented scripting language such as C#.
