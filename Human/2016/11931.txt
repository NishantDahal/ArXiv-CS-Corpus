Who Leads the Clothing Fashion: Style, Color, or Texture? A Computational Study

It is well known that clothing fashion is a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style in which a person dresses. Clothing fashions are usually expressed with visual stimuli such as style, color, and texture. However, it is not clear which visual stimulus places higher/lower influence on the updating of clothing fashion. In this study, computer vision and machine learning techniques are employed to analyze the influence of different visual stimuli on clothing-fashion updates. Specifically, a classification-based model is proposed to quantify the influence of different visual stimuli, in which each visual stimulus's influence is quantified by its corresponding accuracy in fashion classification. Experimental results demonstrate that, on clothing-fashion updates, the style holds a higher influence than the color, and the color holds a higher influence than the texture.
