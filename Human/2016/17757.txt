Joint Network based Attention for Action Recognition

By extracting spatial and temporal characteristics in one network, the two-stream ConvNets can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in action recognition. However, such a framework typically suffers from the separately processing of spatial and temporal information between the two standalone streams and is hard to capture long-term temporal dependence of an action. More importantly, it is incapable of finding the salient portions of an action, say, the frames that are the most discriminative to identify the action. To address these problems, a \textbf{j}oint \textbf{n}etwork based \textbf{a}ttention (JNA) is proposed in this study. We find that the fully-connected fusion, branch selection and spatial attention mechanism are totally infeasible for action recognition. Thus in our joint network, the spatial and temporal branches share some information during the training stage. We also introduce an attention mechanism on the temporal domain to capture the long-term dependence meanwhile finding the salient portions. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Experimental results show that our method can improve the action recognition performance significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art results on both datasets.
