Approximating Dynamic Time Warping and Edit Distance for a Pair of Point Sequences

We give the first subquadratic-time approximation schemes for dynamic time warping (DTW) and edit distance (ED) of several natural families of point sequences in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for any fixed $d \ge 1$. In particular, our algorithms compute $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations of DTW and ED in time near-linear for point sequences drawn from k-packed or k-bounded curves, and subquadratic for backbone sequences. Roughly speaking, a curve is $κ$-packed if the length of its intersection with any ball of radius $r$ is at most $κ\cdot r$, and a curve is $κ$-bounded if the sub-curve between two curve points does not go too far from the two points compared to the distance between the two points. In backbone sequences, consecutive points are spaced at approximately equal distances apart, and no two points lie very close together. Recent results suggest that a subquadratic algorithm for DTW or ED is unlikely for an arbitrary pair of point sequences even for $d=1$. Our algorithms work by constructing a small set of rectangular regions that cover the entries of the dynamic programming table commonly used for these distance measures. The weights of entries inside each rectangle are roughly the same, so we are able to use efficient procedures to approximately compute the cheapest paths through these rectangles.
