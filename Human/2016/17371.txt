Highly-Secure Physically Unclonable Cryptographic Primitives Using Nonlinear Conductance and Analog State Tuning in Memristive Crossbar Arrays

The rapidly expanding hardware-intrinsic security primitives are aimed at addressing significant security challenges of a massively interconnected world in the age of information technology. The main idea of such primitives is to employ instance-specific process-induced variations in electronic hardware as a source of cryptographic data. Among the emergent technologies, memristive devices provide unique opportunities for security applications due to the underlying stochasticity in their operation. Herein, we report a prototype of a robust, dense, and reconfigurable physical unclonable function primitives based on the three-dimensional passive metal-oxide memristive crossbar circuits, by making positive use of process-induced variations in the devices' nonlinear I-Vs and their analog tuning. We first characterize security metrics for a basic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with monolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits. The experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity, measured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total, is close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The uniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances of crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50% +/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability, measured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5% +/- 1%. We then utilize multiple instances of the basic block to demonstrate physically unclonable functional primitive with 10-bit hidden challenge generation that encodes more than 10^19 challenge response pairs and has comparable uniformity, diffusiveness, and bit error rate.
