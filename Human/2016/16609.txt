Recursion-Free Online Multiple Incremental/Decremental Analysis Based on Ridge Support Vector Learning

This study presents a rapid multiple incremental and decremental mechanism based on Weight-Error Curves (WECs) for support-vector analysis. Recursion-free computation is proposed for predicting the Lagrangian multipliers of new samples. This study examines Ridge Support Vector Models, subsequently devising a recursion-free function derived from WECs. With the proposed function, all the new Lagrangian multipliers can be computed at once without using any gradual step sizes. Moreover, such a function relaxes a constraint, where the increment of new multiple Lagrangian multipliers should be the same in the previous work, thereby easily satisfying the requirement of KKT conditions. The proposed mechanism no longer requires typical bookkeeping strategies, which compute the step size by checking all the training samples in each incremental round.
