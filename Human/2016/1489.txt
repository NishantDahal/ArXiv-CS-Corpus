Associative Memories and Human-Robot Social Interaction

In this position paper, we discuss how the use of a cognitive architecture based on unsupervised clustering (the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map) enables us to meet our goals of efficient action selection in a mobile robot. This architecture provides several opportunities for human-robot interaction, and we discuss how its features facilitate these interactions.
