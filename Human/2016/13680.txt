Location-Based and Audience-Aware Storytelling

While the daily user of digital, Internet-enabled devices has some explicit control over what they read and see, the providers fulfilling searches, offering options, and presenting material are using increasingly sophisticated real-time algorithms that tune and target content for the particular user. They redefine the historical relationships between tellers and users, providing a responsiveness paralleled only by forms of live performance incorporating elements of improvisation and audience interaction. The general accessibility of algorithmically driven content delivery techniques suggests significant untapped potential for new approaches to narrative beyond advertising and commercially orientated customization.
