Correlation-Aware Distributed Caching and Coded Delivery

Cache-aided coded multicast leverages side information at wireless edge caches to efficiently serve multiple groupcast demands via common multicast transmissions, leading to load reductions that are proportional to the aggregate cache size. However, the increasingly unpredictable and personalized nature of the content that users consume challenges the efficiency of existing caching-based solutions in which only exact content reuse is explored. This paper generalizes the cache-aided coded multicast problem to a source compression with distributed side information problem that specifically accounts for the correlation among the content files. It is shown how joint file compression during the caching and delivery phases can provide load reductions that go beyond those achieved with existing schemes. This is accomplished through a lower bound on the fundamental rate-memory trade-off as well as a correlation-aware achievable scheme, shown to significantly outperform state-of-the-art correlation-unaware solutions, while approaching the limiting rate-memory trade-off.
