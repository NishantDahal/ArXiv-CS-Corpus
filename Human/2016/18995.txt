Perfect Sequences and Arrays over the Unit Quaternions

We introduce several new constructions for perfect periodic autocorrelation sequences and arrays over the unit quaternions. This paper uses both mathematical proofs and com- puter experiments to prove the (bounded) array constructions have perfect periodic auto- correlation. Furthermore, the first sequence construction generates odd-perfect sequences of unbounded lengths, with good ZCZ.
