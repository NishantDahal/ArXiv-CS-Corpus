Dynamic Proximity-aware Resource Allocation in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications

In this paper, a novel proximity and load-aware resource allocation for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is proposed. The proposed approach exploits the spatio-temporal traffic patterns, in terms of load and vehicles' physical proximity, to minimize the total network cost which captures the tradeoffs between load (i.e., service delay) and successful transmissions while satisfying vehicles's quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To solve the optimization problem under slowly varying channel information, it is decoupled the problem into two interrelated subproblems. First, a dynamic clustering mechanism is proposed to group vehicles in zones based on their traffic patterns and proximity information. Second, a matching game is proposed to allocate resources for each V2V pair within each zone. The problem is cast as many-to-one matching game in which V2V pairs and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another in order to minimize their service delay. The proposed game is shown to belong to the class of matching games with externalities. To solve this game, a distributed algorithm is proposed using which V2V pairs and RBs interact to reach a stable matching. Simulation results for a Manhattan model shown that the proposed scheme yields a higher percentage of V2V pairs satisfying QoS as well as significant gain in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as compared to a state-of-art resource allocation baseline.
