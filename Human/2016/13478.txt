Redefining Binarization and the Visual Archetype

Although binarization is considered passe, it still remains a highly popular research topic. In this paper we propose a rethinking of what binarization is. We introduce the notion of the visual archetype as the ideal form of any one document. Binarization can be defined as the restoration of the visual archetype for a class of images. This definition broadens the scope of what binarization means but also suggests ground-truth should focus on the foreground.
