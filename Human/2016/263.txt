Linear code derived from the primage of quadratic function

Linear codes have been an interesting topic in both theory and practice for many years. In this paper, for an odd prime power $q$, we construct some class of linear code over finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with defining set be the preimage of general quadratic form function and determine the explicit complete weight enumerators of the linear codes. Our construction cover all the corresponding result with quadratic form function and they may have applications in cryptography and secret sharing schemes.
