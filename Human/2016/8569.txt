Benchmarking Python Tools for Automatic Differentiation

In this paper we compare several Python tools for automatic differentiation. In order to assess the difference in performance and precision, the problem of finding the optimal geometrical structure of the cluster with identical atoms is used as follows. First, we compare performance of calculating gradients for the objective function. We showed that the PyADOL-C and PyCppAD tools have much better performance for big clusters than the other ones. Second, we assess precision of these two tools by calculating the difference between the obtained at the optimal configuration gradient norms. We conclude that PyCppAD has the best performance among others, while having almost the same precision as the second- best performing tool - PyADOL-C.
