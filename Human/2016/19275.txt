New Convolutional Codes Derived from Algebraic Geometry Codes

In this paper, we construct new families of convolutional codes. Such codes are obtained by means of algebraic geometry codes. Additionally, more families of convolutional codes are constructed by means of puncturing, extending, expanding and by the direct product code construction applied to algebraic geometry codes. The parameters of the new convolutional codes are better than or comparable to the ones available in literature. In particular, a family of almost near MDS codes is presented.
