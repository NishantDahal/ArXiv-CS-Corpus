Analysis of friendship network from MMORPG based data

This work analyzes friendship network from a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). The network is based on data from a private server that was active from 2007 until 2011. The work conducts a standard analysis of the network and then divides players according to different groups based on their activity. Work checks how friendship network can be correlated to the clan (a self-organized group of players who often form a league and play on the same side in a match) network. Main part of the work is the recommendation method for players that are not part of any clan and it is based on communities of friendship network.
