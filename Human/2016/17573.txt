Coded Caching with Distributed Storage

Content delivery networks store information distributed across multiple servers, so as to balance the load and avoid unrecoverable losses in case of node or disk failures. Coded caching has been shown to be a useful technique which can reduce peak traffic rates by pre-fetching popular content at the end users and encoding transmissions so that different users can extract different information from the same packet. On one hand, distributed storage limits the capability of combining content from different servers into a single message, causing performance losses in coded caching schemes. But, on the other hand, the inherent redundancy existing in distributed storage systems can be used to improve the performance of those schemes through parallelism.
  This paper designs a scheme combining distributed storage of the content in multiple servers and an efficient coded caching algorithm for delivery to the users. This scheme is shown to reduce the peak transmission rate below that of state-of-the-art algorithms.
