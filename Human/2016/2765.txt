The Stability Region of the Two-User Broadcast Channel

In this paper, we characterize the stability region of the two-user broadcast channel. First, we obtain the stability region in the general case. Second, we consider the particular case where each receiver treats the interfering signal as noise, as well as the case in which the packets are transmitted using superposition coding and successive decoding is employed at the strong receiver.
