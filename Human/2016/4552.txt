Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics Revisited

We derive Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics by Principle of Maximum Entropy applied to two families of entropy functions different from the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy. These entropy functions are identified with special cases of modified Naudts' $Ï†$-entropy.
