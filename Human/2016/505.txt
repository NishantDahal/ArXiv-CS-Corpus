On feasibility of perfect interference alignment in interference networks

Interference alignment(IA) is mostly achieved by coding interference over multiple dimensions. Intuitively, the more interfering signals that need to be aligned, the larger the number of dimensions needed to align them. This dimensionality requirement poses a major challenge for IA in practical systems. This work evaluates the necessary and sufficient conditions on channel structure of a 3 user interference channel(IC) to make perfect IA feasible within limited number of channel extensions. It is shown that if only one of interfering channel coefficients can be designed to a specific value, interference would be aligned perfectly at all receivers.
