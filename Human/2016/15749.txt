Privacy-preserving schemes for Ad Hoc Social Networks: A survey

In this paper, we review the state of the art of privacy-preserving schemes for ad hoc social networks, including, mobile social networks (MSNs) and vehicular social networks (VSNs). Specifically, we select and in-detail examine thirty-three privacy preserving schemes developed for or applied in the context of ad hoc social networks. These schemes are published between 2008 and 2016. Based on this existing privacy preservation schemes, we survey privacy preservation models, including location privacy, identity privacy, anonymity, traceability, interest privacy, backward privacy, and content oriented privacy. The recent important attacks of leaking privacy, countermeasures, and game theoretic approaches in VSNs and MSNs are summarized in form of tables. In addition, an overview of recommendations for further research is also provided. With this survey, readers can have a more thorough understanding of research trends in privacy-preserving schemes for ad hoc social networks
