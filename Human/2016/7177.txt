Achievable Degrees of Freedom of the K-user MISO Broadcast Channel with Alternating CSIT via Interference Creation-Resurrection

Channel state information at the transmitter affects the degrees of freedom of the wireless networks. In this paper, we analyze the DoF for the K-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) with synergistic alternating channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Specifically, the CSIT of each user alternates between three states, namely, perfect CSIT (P), delayed CSIT (D) and no CSIT (N) among different time slots. For the K-user MISO BC, we show that the total achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) are given by $\frac{K^{2}}{2K-1}$ through utilizing the synergistic benefits of CSIT patterns. We compare the achievable DoF with results reported previously in the literature in the case of delayed CSIT and hybrid CSIT models.
