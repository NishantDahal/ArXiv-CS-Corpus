BANDANA -- Body Area Network Device-to-device Authentication using Natural gAit

Secure spontaneous authentication between devices worn at arbitrary location on the same body is a challenging, yet unsolved problem. We propose BANDANA, the first-ever implicit secure device-to-device authentication scheme for devices worn on the same body. Our approach leverages instantaneous variation in acceleration patterns from gait sequences to extract always-fresh secure secrets. It enables secure spontaneous pairing of devices worn on the same body or interacted with. The method is robust against noise in sensor readings and active attackers. We demonstrate the robustness of BANDANA on two gait datasets and discuss the discriminability of intra- and inter-body cases, robustness to statistical bias, as well as possible attack scenarios.
