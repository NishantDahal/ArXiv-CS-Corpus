System for Filtering Messages on Social Media Content

The social networking era has left us with little privacy. The details of the social network users are published on Social Networking sites. Vulnerability has reached new heights due to the overpowering effects of social networking. The sites like Facebook, Twitter are having a huge set of users who publish their files, comments, messages in other users walls. These messages and comments could be of any nature. Even friends could post a comment that would harm a persons integrity. Thus there has to be a system which will monitor the messages and comments that are posted on the walls. If the messages are found to be neutral (does not have any harmful content), then it can be published. If the messages are found to have non-neutral content in them, then these messages would be blocked by the social network manager. The messages that are non-neutral would be of sexual, offensive, hatred, pun intended nature. Thus the social network manager can classify content as neutral and non-neutral and notify the user if there seems to be messages of non-neutral behavior.
