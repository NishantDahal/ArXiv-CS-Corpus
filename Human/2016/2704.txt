Multilayer network decoding versatility and trust

In the recent years, the multilayer networks have increasingly been realized as a more realistic framework to understand emergent physical phenomena in complex real world systems. We analyze a massive time-varying social data drawn from the largest film industry of the world under multilayer network framework. The framework enables us to evaluate the versatility of actors, which turns out to be an intrinsic property of lead actors. Versatility in dimers suggests that working with different types of nodes are more beneficial than with similar ones. However, the triangles yield a different relation between type of co-actor and the success of lead nodes indicating the importance of higher order motifs in understanding the properties of the underlying system. Furthermore, despite the degree-degree correlations of entire networks being neutral, multilayering picks up different values of correlation indicating positive connotations like trust, in the recent years. Analysis of weak ties of the industry uncovers nodes from lower degree regime being important in linking Bollywood clusters. The framework and the tools used herein may be used for unraveling the complexity of other real world systems.
