A computational intuition pump to examine group creativity: building on the ideas of others

This paper presents a computational approach to modelling group creativity. It presents an analysis of two studies of group creativity selected from different research cultures and identifies a common theme ("idea build-up") that is then used in the formalisation of an agent-based model used to support reasoning about the complex dynamics of building on the ideas of others.
