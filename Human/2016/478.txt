Towards an objective evaluation of underactuated gripper designs

In this paper we explore state-of-the-art underactuated, compliant robot gripper designs through looking at their performance on a generic grasping task. Starting from a state of the art open gripper design, we propose design modifications,and importantly, evaluate all designs on a grasping experiment involving a selection of objects resulting in 3600 object-gripper interactions. Interested in non-planned grasping but rather on a design's generic performance, we explore the influence of object shape, pose and orientation relative to the gripper and its finger number and configuration. Using open-loop grasps we achieved up to 75% success rate over our trials. The results indicate and support that under motion constraints and uncertainties and without involving grasp planning, a 2-fingered underactuated compliant hand outperforms higher multi-fingered configurations. To our knowledge this is the first extended objective comparison of various multi-fingered underactuated hand designs under generic grasping conditions.
