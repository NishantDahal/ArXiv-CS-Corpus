ChinMotion Rapidly Enables 3D Computer Interaction after Tetraplegia

Individuals with severe paralysis require hands-free interfaces to control assistive devices that can improve their quality of life. We present ChinMotion, an interface that noninvasively harnesses preserved chin, lip and tongue sensorimotor function after tetraplegia to convey intuitive control commands. After two hours of practice, ChinMotion enables superior point-and-click performance over existing interfaces and it facilitates accurate 3D control of a virtual robotic arm.
