On Determining the Fair Bandwidth Share for ABR Connections in ATM Networks

In a multi-service network such as ATM, adaptive data services(such as ABR) share the bandwidth unused by higher priority services. The network indicates to the ABR sources the fair and efficient rates at which they should transmit to minimize their cell loss. In this paper, we propose a new method for determining the "effective" number of active connections, and the fair bandwidth share for each connection.
