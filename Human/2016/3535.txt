A BP-MF-EP Based Iterative Receiver for Joint Phase Noise Estimation, Equalization and Decoding

In this work, with combined belief propagation (BP), mean field (MF) and expectation propagation (EP), an iterative receiver is designed for joint phase noise (PN) estimation, equalization and decoding in a coded communication system. The presence of the PN results in a nonlinear observation model. Conventionally, the nonlinear model is directly linearized by using the first-order Taylor approximation, e.g., in the state-of-the-art soft-input extended Kalman smoothing approach (soft-in EKS). In this work, MF is used to handle the factor due to the nonlinear model, and a second-order Taylor approximation is used to achieve Gaussian approximation to the MF messages, which is crucial to the low-complexity implementation of the receiver with BP and EP. It turns out that our approximation is more effective than the direct linearization in the soft-in EKS with similar complexity, leading to significant performance improvement as demonstrated by simulation results.
