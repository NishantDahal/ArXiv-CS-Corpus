A 3-D Spatial Model for In-building Wireless Networks with Correlated Shadowing

Consider orthogonal planes in the 3-D space representing floors and walls in a large building. These planes divide the space into rooms where a wireless infrastructure is deployed. This paper is focused on the analysis of the correlated shadowing field created by this wireless infrastructure through the set of walls and floors. When the locations of the planes and of the wireless nodes are governed by Poisson processes, we obtain a simple stochastic model which captures the non-uniform nature of node deployment and room sizes. This model, which we propose to call the Poisson building, captures the complex in-building shadowing correlations, is scalable in the number of dimensions and is tractable for network performance analysis. It allows an exact mathematical characterization of the interference distribution in both infinite and finite buildings, which further leads to closed-form expressions for the coverage probabilities in in-building cellular networks and the success probability of in-building underlay D2D transmissions.
