Computing Educator Attitudes about Motivation

While motivation is of great interest to computing educators, relatively little work has been done on understanding faculty attitudes toward student motivation. Two previous qualitative studies of instructor attitudes found results identical to those from other disciplines, but neither study considered whether instructors perceive student motivation to be more important in certain computing classes. In this work we present quantitative results about the perceived importance of student motivation in computing courses on the part of computing educators. Our survey results show that while a majority of respondents believe student motivation is necessary in all computing courses, the structure and audience in certain computing classes elevate the importance of student motivation.
