Steganography between Silence Intervals of Audio in Video Content Using Chaotic Maps

Steganography is the art of hiding data, in such a way that it is undetectable under traffic-pattern analysis and the data hidden is only known to the receiver and the sender. In this paper new method of text steganography over the silence interval of audio in a video file, is presented. In the proposed method first the audio signal is extracted from the video. After doing audio enhancement, the data on the audio signal is steganographed using new technique and then audio signal is rewritten in video file again. http://www.learnrnd.com/All_latest_research_findings.php
  To enhance the security level we apply chaotic maps on arbitrary text. Furthermore, the algorithm in this paper, gives a technique which states that undetectable stegotext and cover-text has same probability distribution and no statistical test can detect the presence of the hidden message. http://www.learnrnd.com/detail.php?id=Biohack_Eyes_through_Chlorin_e6_eye_drop_:Stanford_University_Research
  Moreover, hidden message does not affect the transmission rate of video file at all.
