Immunization and targeted destruction of networks using explosive percolation

A new method (`explosive immunization' (EI)) is proposed for immunization and targeted destruction of networks. It combines the explosive percolation (EP) paradigm with the idea of maintaining a fragmented distribution of clusters. The ability of each node to block the spread of an infection (or to prevent the existence of a large cluster of connected nodes) is estimated by a score. The algorithm proceeds by first identifying low score nodes that should not be vaccinated/destroyed, analogously to the links selected in EP if they do not lead to large clusters. As in EP, this is done by selecting the worst node (weakest blocker) from a finite set of randomly chosen `candidates'. Tests on several real-world and model networks suggest that the method is more efficient and faster than any existing immunization strategy. Due to the latter property it can deal with very large networks.
