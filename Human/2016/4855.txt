Augmented Body: Changing Interactive Body Play

This paper investigates the player's body as a system capable of unfamiliar interactive movement achieved through digital mediation in a playful environment. Body interactions in both digital and non-digital environments can be considered as a perceptually manipulative exploration of self. This implies a player may alter how they perceive their body and its operations in order to create a new playful and original experience. This paper therefore questions how player interaction can change as their perception of their body changes using augmentative technology.
