Toward a Science of Autonomy for Physical Science: Healthcare

In Star Wars Episode V, we see Luke Skywalker being repaired by a surgical robot. In the context of the movie, this doesn't seem surprising or disturbing. After all, it is a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It would never happen here. Or could it? Would we accept a robot as our doctor, our surgeon, or our in-home care specialist? Imagine walking into an operating room and no one was there. You are instructed to lie down on the operating table, and the OR system takes over. Would you feel comfortable with this possible future world?
