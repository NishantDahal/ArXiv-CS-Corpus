A FIRM Approach to Software-Defined Service Composition

Service composition is an aggregate of services often leveraged to automate the enterprise business processes. While Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been a forefront of service composition, services can be realized as efficient distributed and parallel constructs such as MapReduce, which are not typically exploited in service composition. With the advent of Software\-Defined Networking (SDN), global view and control of the entire network is made available to the networking controller, which can further be leveraged in application level. This paper presents FIRM, an approach for Software-Defined Service Composition by leveraging SDN and MapReduce. FIRM comprises Find, Invoke, Return, and Manage, as the core procedures in achieving a QoS-Aware Service Composition.
