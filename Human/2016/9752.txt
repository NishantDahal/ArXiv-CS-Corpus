Unrestricted State Complexity of Binary Operations on Regular Languages

I study the state complexity of binary operations on regular languages over different alphabets. It is well known that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are languages restricted to be over the same alphabet, with $m$ and $n$ quotients, respectively, the state complexity of any binary boolean operation on $L'_m$ and $L_n$ is $mn$, and that of the product (concatenation) is $(m-1)2^n +2^{n-1}$. In contrast to this, I show that if $L'_m$ and $L_n$ are over their own different alphabets, the state complexity of union and symmetric difference is $mn+m+n+1$, that of intersection is $mn$, that of difference is $mn+m$, and that of the product is $m2^n+2^{n-1}$.
