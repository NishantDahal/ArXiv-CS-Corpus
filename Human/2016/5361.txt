SymNet: scalable symbolic execution for modern networks

We present SymNet, a network static analysis tool based on symbolic execution. SymNet quickly analyzes networks by injecting symbolic packets and tracing their path through the network. Our key novelty is SEFL, a language we designed for network processing that is symbolic-execution friendly.
  SymNet is easy to use: we have developed parsers that automatically generate SEFL models from router and switch tables, firewall configurations and arbitrary Click modular router configurations. Most of our models are exact and have optimal branching factor. Finally, we built a testing tool that checks SEFL models conform to the real implementation. SymNet can check networks containing routers with hundreds of thousands of prefixes and NATs in seconds, while ensuring packet header memory-safety and capturing network functionality such as dynamic tunneling, stateful processing and encryption. We used SymNet to debug middlebox interactions documented in the literature, to check our department's network and the Stanford backbone network. Results show that symbolic execution is fast and more accurate than existing static analysis tools.
