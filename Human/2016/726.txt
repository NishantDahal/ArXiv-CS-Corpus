Kernelized LRR on Grassmann Manifolds for Subspace Clustering

Low rank representation (LRR) has recently attracted great interest due to its pleasing efficacy in exploring low-dimensional sub- space structures embedded in data. One of its successful applications is subspace clustering, by which data are clustered according to the subspaces they belong to. In this paper, at a higher level, we intend to cluster subspaces into classes of subspaces. This is naturally described as a clustering problem on Grassmann manifold. The novelty of this paper is to generalize LRR on Euclidean space onto an LRR model on Grassmann manifold in a uniform kernelized LRR framework. The new method has many applications in data analysis in computer vision tasks. The proposed models have been evaluated on a number of practical data analysis applications. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform a number of state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.
