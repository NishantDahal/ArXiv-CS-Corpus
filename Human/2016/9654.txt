Cellular Automata on Group Sets and the Uniform Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon Theorem

We introduce cellular automata whose cell spaces are left homogeneous spaces and prove a uniform as well as a topological variant of the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem. Examples of left homogeneous spaces are spheres, Euclidean spaces, as well as hyperbolic spaces acted on by isometries; vertex-transitive graphs, in particular, Cayley graphs, acted on by automorphisms; groups acting on themselves by multiplication; and integer lattices acted on by translations.
