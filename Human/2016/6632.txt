Bayesian Model Selection of Stochastic Block Models

A central problem in analyzing networks is partitioning them into modules or communities. One of the best tools for this is the stochastic block model, which clusters vertices into blocks with statistically homogeneous pattern of links. Despite its flexibility and popularity, there has been a lack of principled statistical model selection criteria for the stochastic block model. Here we propose a Bayesian framework for choosing the number of blocks as well as comparing it to the more elaborate degree- corrected block models, ultimately leading to a universal model selection framework capable of comparing multiple modeling combinations. We will also investigate its connection to the minimum description length principle.
