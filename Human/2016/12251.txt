Complex Correntropy: Probabilistic Interpretation and Optimization

Recent studies have demonstrated that correntropy is an efficient tool for analyzing higher-order statistical moments in nonGaussian noise environments. Although correntropy has been used with complex data, no theoretical study was pursued to elucidate its properties, nor how to best use it for optimization. This paper presents a probabilistic interpretation for correntropy using complex-valued data called complex correntropy. A recursive solution for the maximum complex correntropy criterion (MCCC) is introduced based on a fixed point solution. This technique is applied to a simple system identification case study, and the results demonstrate prominent advantages when compared to the complex recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. By using such probabilistic interpretation, correntropy can be applied to solve several problems involving complex data in a more straightforward way. Keywords: complex-valued data correntropy, maximum complex correntropy criterion, fixed-point algorithm.
