Real-Time Contingency Analysis with Corrective Transmission Switching - Part II: Results and Discussion

This paper presents the performance of an AC transmission switching (TS) based real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) tool that is introduced in Part I of this paper. The approach quickly proposes high quality corrective switching actions for relief of potential post-contingency network violations. The approach is confirmed by testing it on actual EMS snapshots of two large-scale systems, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland (PJM) Interconnection; the approach is also tested on data provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The results show that the tool effectively reduces post-contingency violations. Fast heuristics are used along with parallel computing to reduce the computational difficulty of the problem. The tool is able to handle the PJM system in about five minutes with a standard desktop computer. Time-domain simulations are performed to check system stability with corrective transmission switching (CTS). In conclusion, the paper shows that corrective switching is ripe for industry adoption. CTS can provide significant reliability benefits that can be translated into significant cost savings.
