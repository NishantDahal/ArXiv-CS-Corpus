Topological field theory and computing with instantons

Chern-Simons topological field theories TFTs are the only TFTs that have already found application in the description of some exotic strongly-correlated electron systems and the corresponding concept of topological quantum computing. Here, we show that TFTs of another type, specifically the gauge-field-less Witten-type TFTs known as topological sigma models, describe the recently proposed digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) - engineered dynamical systems with point attractors being the solutions of the corresponding logic circuit that solves a specific task. This result derives from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a topological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a DMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time, associated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by instantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons are the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently, despite their non-quantum character. We exemplify these results with the solution of prime factorization.
