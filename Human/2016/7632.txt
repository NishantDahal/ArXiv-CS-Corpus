Back to the Basics: Bayesian extensions of IRT outperform neural networks for proficiency estimation

Estimating student proficiency is an important task for computer based learning systems. We compare a family of IRT-based proficiency estimation methods to Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), a recently proposed recurrent neural network model with promising initial results. We evaluate how well each model predicts a student's future response given previous responses using two publicly available and one proprietary data set. We find that IRT-based methods consistently matched or outperformed DKT across all data sets at the finest level of content granularity that was tractable for them to be trained on. A hierarchical extension of IRT that captured item grouping structure performed best overall. When data sets included non-trivial autocorrelations in student response patterns, a temporal extension of IRT improved performance over standard IRT while the RNN-based method did not. We conclude that IRT-based models provide a simpler, better-performing alternative to existing RNN-based models of student interaction data while also affording more interpretability and guarantees due to their formulation as Bayesian probabilistic models.
