Spectrum Resource Management and Interference Mitigation for D2D Communications with Awareness of BER Constraint in mmWave 5G Underlay Network

The work presented in this paper deals with the issue of massive demands for higher capacity. For that matter, we investigate the spectrum resource management in outdoor mmWave cell for the uplink of cellular and D2D communications. Indeed, we provide a first insight how to optimize the system performance in terms of achievable throughput while realizing a compromise between the large number of admitted devices and the generated interference constraint. We propose a mathematical formulation of the optimization objective which falls in the mixed integer-real optimization scheme. To overcome its complexity, we apply a heuristic algorithm and test its efficiency through simulation results with a particular regard to the BER impact in the QoS.
