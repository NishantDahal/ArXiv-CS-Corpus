Panda: Neighbor Discovery on a Power Harvesting Budget

Object tracking applications are gaining popularity and will soon utilize Energy Harvesting (EH) low-power nodes that will consume power mostly for Neighbor Discovery (ND) (i.e., identifying nodes within communication range). Although ND protocols were developed for sensor networks, the challenges posed by emerging EH low-power transceivers were not addressed. Therefore, we design an ND protocol tailored for the characteristics of a representative EH prototype: the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH. We present a generalized model of ND accounting for unique prototype characteristics (i.e., energy costs for transmission/reception, and transceiver state switching times/costs). Then, we present the Power Aware Neighbor Discovery Asynchronously (Panda) protocol in which nodes transition between the sleep, receive, and transmit states. We analyze \name and select its parameters to maximize the ND rate subject to a homogeneous power budget. We also present Panda-D, designed for non-homogeneous EH nodes. We perform extensive testbed evaluations using the prototypes and study various design tradeoffs. We demonstrate a small difference (less then 2%) between experimental and analytical results, thereby confirming the modeling assumptions. Moreover, we show that Panda improves the ND rate by up to 3x compared to related protocols. Finally, we show that Panda-D operates well under non-homogeneous power harvesting.
