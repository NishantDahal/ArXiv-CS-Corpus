Elaborate lexicon extended language with a lot of conceptual information

The use of model such as LEL (Lexicon Extended Language) in natural language is very interesting in Requirements Engineering. But LEL, even if it is derived from the Universe of Discourse (UofD) does not provide further details on the concepts it describes. However, we believe that the elements inherent in the conceptual level of a system are already defined in the Universe of Discourse. Therefore, in this work we propose a more elaborate natural language model called eLEL. It is a model that describes the concepts in a domain in more detail than the conventional LEL. We also propose a modeling process of a domain using an eLEL model.
