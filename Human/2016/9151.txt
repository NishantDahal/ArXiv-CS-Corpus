Designing an ELearning Portal for Developing Countries: An Action Design Approach

This paper presents the first phase of a study on using course design, including current eLearning and social trends, to overcome challenges in eLearning within developing countries, particularly for vocational/non-mainstream training. The paper outlines the research and development of an ICT artefact using the Action Design Research method. The artefact will later be deployed and evaluated. The paper discusses the previous research that has categorised challenges in eLearning in developing countries and explores how these can be overcome through course and element design. Course design includes training development, platform selection and platform hosting, particularly in the context of developing countries. Element design looks at the creation of content that should be available, practical and viable to both the user and developer through the exploitation of current eLearning and social trends. The paper concludes with the concept of the ICT artefact that has been designed for phase two of the study.
