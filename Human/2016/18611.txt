OpenGeoBase: Information Centric Networking meets Spatial Database applications - Extended Version

This paper explores methodologies, advantages and challenges related to the use of Information Centric Networking (ICN) for realizing distributed spatial databases. Our findings show that the ICN functionality perfectly fits database requirements: routing-by-name can be used to dispatch queries and insertions, in-network caching to accelerate queries, and data-centric security to implement secure multi-tenancy. We present an ICN-based distributed spatial database, named OpenGeoBase, and describe its design choices. Thanks to ICN, OpenGeoBase can quickly and efficiently provide information to database users; easily operate in a distributed way, deploying and using many database engines in parallel; secure every piece of content; naturally slice resources, so that several tenants and users can concurrently and independently use the database. We also show how OpenGeoBase can support a real world Intelligent Transport System application, by enabling discovery of geo-referenced public transportation information.
