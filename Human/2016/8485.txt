Learning Optimal Card Ranking from Query Reformulation

Mobile search has recently been shown to be the major contributor to the growing search market. The key difference between mobile search and desktop search is that information presentation is limited to the screen space of the mobile device. Thus, major search engines have adopted a new type of search result presentation, known as \textit{information cards}, in which each card presents summarized results from one domain/vertical, for a given query, to augment the standard blue-links search results. While it has been widely acknowledged that information cards are particularly suited to mobile user experience, it is also challenging to optimize such result sets. Typically, user engagement metrics like query reformulation are based on whole ranked list of cards for each query and most traditional learning to rank algorithms require per-item relevance labels. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of interpreting query reformulation into effective relevance labels for query-card pairs. We inherit the concept of conventional learning-to-rank, and propose pointwise, pairwise and listwise interpretations for query reformulation. In addition, we propose a learning-to-label strategy that learns the contribution of each card, with respect to a query, where such contributions can be used as labels for training card ranking models. We utilize a state-of-the-art ranking model and demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed mechanisms on a large-scale mobile data from a major search engine, showing that models trained from labels derived from user engagement can significantly outperform ones trained from human judgment labels.
