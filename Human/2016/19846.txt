Safety Verification and Control for Collision Avoidance at Road Intersections

This paper presents the design of a supervisory algorithm that monitors safety at road intersections and overrides drivers with a safe input when necessary. The design of the supervisor consists of two parts: safety verification and control design. Safety verification is the problem to determine if vehicles will be able to cross the intersection without colliding with current drivers' inputs. We translate this safety verification problem into a jobshop scheduling problem, which minimizes the maximum lateness and evaluates if the optimal cost is zero. The zero optimal cost corresponds to the case in which all vehicles can cross each conflict area without collisions. Computing the optimal cost requires solving a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem due to the nonlinear second-order dynamics of the vehicles. We therefore estimate this optimal cost by formulating two related Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that assume simpler vehicle dynamics. We prove that these two MILP problems yield lower and upper bounds of the optimal cost. We also quantify the worst case approximation errors of these MILP problems. We design the supervisor to override the vehicles with a safe control input if the MILP problem that computes the upper bound yields a positive optimal cost. We theoretically demonstrate that the supervisor keeps the intersection safe and is non-blocking. Computer simulations further validate that the algorithms can run in real time for problems of realistic size.
