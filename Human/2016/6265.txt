Spatial Fluid Limits for Stochastic Mobile Networks

We consider Markov models of large-scale networks where nodes are characterized by their local behavior and by a mobility model over a two-dimensional lattice. By assuming random walk, we prove convergence to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) whose size depends neither on the lattice size nor on the population of nodes. This provides a macroscopic view of the model which approximates discrete stochastic movements with continuous deterministic diffusions. We illustrate the practical applicability of this result by modeling a network of mobile nodes with on/off behavior performing file transfers with connectivity to 802.11 access points. By means of an empirical validation against discrete-event simulation we show high quality of the PDE approximation even for low populations and coarse lattices. In addition, we confirm the computational advantage in using the PDE limit over a traditional ordinary differential equation limit where the lattice is modeled discretely, yielding speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude.
