On the Capacity of Diffusion-Based Molecular Timing Channels

This work introduces capacity limits for molecular timing (MT) channels, where information is modulated on the release timing of small information particles, and decoded from the time of arrival at the receiver. It is shown that the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise channel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel, this noise is distributed according to the LÃ©vy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the capacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay associated with the propagation of information particles in the channel is finite. These bounds are also shown to be tight.
