Fuzzy c-Shape: A new algorithm for clustering finite time series waveforms

The existence of large volumes of time series data in many applications has motivated data miners to investigate specialized methods for mining time series data. Clustering is a popular data mining method due to its powerful exploratory nature and its usefulness as a preprocessing step for other data mining techniques. This article develops two novel clustering algorithms for time series data that are extensions of a crisp c-shapes algorithm. The two new algorithms are heuristic derivatives of fuzzy c-means (FCM). Fuzzy c-Shapes plus (FCS+) replaces the inner product norm in the FCM model with a shape-based distance function. Fuzzy c-Shapes double plus (FCS++) uses the shape-based distance, and also replaces the FCM cluster centers with shape-extracted prototypes. Numerical experiments on 48 real time series data sets show that the two new algorithms outperform state-of-the-art shape-based clustering algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Four external cluster validity indices (the Rand index, Adjusted Rand Index, Variation of Information, and Normalized Mutual Information) are used to match candidate partitions generated by each of the studied algorithms. All four indices agree that for these finite waveform data sets, FCS++ gives a small improvement over FCS+, and in turn, FCS+ is better than the original crisp c-shapes method. Finally, we apply two tests of statistical significance to the three algorithms. The Wilcoxon and Friedman statistics both rank the three algorithms in exactly the same way as the four cluster validity indices.
