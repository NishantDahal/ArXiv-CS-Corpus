Aligning Enterprise Systems with the Organisation A Sensemaking Perspective

This paper explores the alignment of enterprise systems and organisations on the post-adoptive phase. A research model is presented focusing on the alignment decisions in the managerial search process for solutions to business problems related to enterprise systems. Based on the research model we propose research questions for future research, particularly to analyse how managerial identity would affect the alignment decisions.
