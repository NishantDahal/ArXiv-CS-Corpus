Time and Space Efficient Quantum Algorithms for Detecting Cycles and Testing Bipartiteness

We study space and time efficient quantum algorithms for two graph problems -- deciding whether an $n$-vertex graph is a forest, and whether it is bipartite. Via a reduction to the s-t connectivity problem, we describe quantum algorithms for deciding both properties in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time and using $O(\log n)$ classical and quantum bits of storage in the adjacency matrix model. We then present quantum algorithms for deciding the two properties in the adjacency array model, which run in time $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d_m})$ and also require $O(\log n)$ space, where $d_m$ is the maximum degree of any vertex in the input graph.
