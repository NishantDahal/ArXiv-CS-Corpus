Exploring the Design Space of Longitudinal Censorship Measurement Platforms

Despite the high perceived value and increasing severity of online information controls, a data-driven understanding of the phenomenon has remained elusive. In this paper, we consider two design points in the space of Internet censorship measurement with particular emphasis on how they address the challenges of locating vantage points, choosing content to test, and analyzing results. We discuss the trade offs of decisions made by each platform and show how the resulting data provides complementary views of global censorship. Finally, we discuss lessons learned and open challenges discovered through our experiences.
