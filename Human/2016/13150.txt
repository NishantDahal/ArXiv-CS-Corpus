GDoF of the MISO BC: Bridging the Gap between Finite Precision and Perfect CSIT

For the $K=2$ user MISO BC, i.e., the wireless broadcast channel where a transmitter equipped with $K=2$ antennas sends independent messages to $K=2$ receivers each of which is equipped with a single antenna, the sum generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) are characterized for arbitrary channel strength and channel uncertainty levels for each of the channel coefficients. The result is extended to $K>2$ users under additional restrictions which include the assumption of symmetry.
