Throughput Analysis of Decentralized Coded Content Caching in Cellular Networks

Decentralized coded content caching for next generation cellular networks is studied. The contents are linearly combined and cached in under-utilized caches of User Terminals (UTs) and its throughput capacity is compared with decentralized uncoded content caching. In both scenarios, we consider multihop Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and the use of femtocaches in the network. It is shown that decentralized coded content caching can increase the network throughput capacity compared to decentralized uncoded caching by reducing the number of hops needed to deliver the desired content. Further, the throughput capacity for Zipfian content request distribution is computed and it is shown that the decentralized coded content cache placement can increase the throughput capacity of cellular networks by a factor of $(\log(n))^2$ where $n$ is the number of nodes served by a femtocache.
