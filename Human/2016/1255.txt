How do you revise your belief set with %$;@*?

In the classic AGM belief revision theory, beliefs are static and do not change their own shape. For instance, if p is accepted by a rational agent, it will remain p to the agent. But such rarely happens to us. Often, when we accept some information p, what is actually accepted is not the whole p, but only a portion of it; not necessarily because we select the portion but because p must be perceived. Only the perceived p is accepted; and the perception is subject to what we already believe (know). What may, however, happen to the rest of p that initially escaped our attention? In this work we argue that the invisible part is also accepted to the agent, if only unconsciously. Hence some parts of p are accepted as visible, while some other parts as latent, beliefs. The division is not static. As the set of beliefs changes, what were hidden may become visible. We present a perception-based belief theory that incorporates latent beliefs.
