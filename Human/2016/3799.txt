Proximal groupoid patterns In digital images

The focus of this article is on the detection and classification of patterns based on groupoids. The approach hinges on descriptive proximity of points in a set based on the neighborliness property. This approach lends support to image analysis and understanding and in studying nearness of image segments. A practical application of the approach is in terms of the analysis of natural images for pattern identification and classification.
