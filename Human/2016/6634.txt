Phase retrieval from multiple-window short-time Fourier measurements

In this paper, we introduce two symmetric directed graphs depending on supports of signals and windows, and we show that the connectivity of those graphs provides either necessary and sufficient conditions to phase retrieval of a signal from magnitude measurements of its multiple-window short-time Fourier transform. Also we propose an algebraic reconstruction algorithm, and provide an error estimate to our algorithm when magnitude measurements are corrupted by deterministic/random noises.
