Construction of Zero Cross Correlation Code using a type of Pascal's Triangle Matrix for Spectral Amplitude Coding Optical Code Division Multiple Access networks

In this paper a new method to construct zero cross correlation code with the help of Pascal's triangle pattern called Pascal's Triangle Matrix Code (PTMC) for Spectral Amplitude Coding Optical Code Division Multiple Access (SAC-OCDMA) system is successfully developed. The advantages of this code are simplicity of code construction, flexibility of choosing code weight and number of users. The numerical comparison shows that the newly constructed code is better in code length than the existing codes such as Optical Orthogonal Code (OOC), Hadamard, Modified Frequency Hopping (MFH) and Modified Double Weight (MDW) codes and it supports more users than other Optical Spectrum Code Division Multiple Access (OSCDMA) codes.
