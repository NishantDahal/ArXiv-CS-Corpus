Are We Approaching the Fundamental Limits of Wireless Network Densification?

The single most important factor behind the data rate increases experienced by users of wireless networks over the past few decades has been densification, namely adding more base stations and access points and thus getting more spatial reuse of the spectrum. This trend is set to continue into 5G and presumably beyond. However, at some point further densification will no longer be able to provide exponentially increasing data rates. Like the end of Moore's Law, this would have massive implications on the entire technology landscape, which depends ever more heavily on wireless connectivity. When and why will this happen? How might we prolong this from occurring for as long as possible? These are the questions explored in this paper.
