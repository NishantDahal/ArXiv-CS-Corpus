Reduction-Based Creative Telescoping for Algebraic Functions

Continuing a series of articles in the past few years on creative telescoping using reductions, we develop a new algorithm to construct minimal telescopers for algebraic functions. This algorithm is based on Trager's Hermite reduction and on polynomial reduction, which was originally designed for hyperexponential functions and extended to the algebraic case in this paper.
