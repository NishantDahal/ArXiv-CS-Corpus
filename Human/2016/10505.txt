Deploying an Information Centric Smart Lighting System in the Wild

In this paper, we present a NDN based smart home lighting solution where lights are automatically controlled in near real time based on occupancy and daylight. We implemented a reliable solution using NDN architecture exploiting the primitive NDN features in push based data dissemination, multicast forwarding through name prefixes and Interest filtering in application layer. Performance was evaluated benchmarking with respect to a cloud based approach in terms of message delivery latency. Scalability of the solution was also analyzed presenting an analysis on FIB scalability based on Interest filtering. Finally, from this study, we recommend and highlight a few requirements that could improve NDN for sustainable IoT applications.
