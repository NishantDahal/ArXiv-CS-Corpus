A data mining-based solution for detecting suspicious money laundering cases in an investment bank

Today, money laundering poses a serious threat not only to financial institutions but also to the nation. This criminal activity is becoming more and more sophisticated and seems to have moved from the clichy of drug trafficking to financing terrorism and surely not forgetting personal gain. Most international financial institutions have been implementing anti-money laundering solutions to fight investment fraud. However, traditional investigative techniques consume numerous man-hours. Recently, data mining approaches have been developed and are considered as well-suited techniques for detecting money laundering activities. Within the scope of a collaboration project for the purpose of developing a new solution for the anti-money laundering Units in an international investment bank, we proposed a simple and efficient data mining-based solution for anti-money laundering. In this paper, we present this solution developed as a tool and show some preliminary experiment results with real transaction datasets.
