Infinite Unlimited Churn

We study unlimited infinite churn in peer-to-peer overlay networks. Under this churn, arbitrary many peers may concurrently request to join or leave the overlay network; moreover these requests may never stop coming. We prove that unlimited adversarial churn, where processes may just exit the overlay network, is unsolvable. We focus on cooperative churn where exiting processes participate in the churn handling algorithm. We define the problem of unlimited infinite churn in this setting. We distinguish the fair version of the problem, where each request is eventually satisfied, from the unfair version that just guarantees progress. We focus on local solutions to the problem, and prove that a local solution to the Fair Infinite Unlimited Churn is impossible. We then present and prove correct an algorithm UIUC that solves the Unfair Infinite Unlimited Churn Problem for a linearized peer-to-peer overlay network. We extend this solution to skip lists and skip graphs.
