Joint MOO of Transmit Precoding and Receiver Design in a Downlink Time Switching MISO SWIPT System

In this paper, we consider a time-switching (TS) co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system consisting of multiple multi-antenna access points which serve multiple single antenna users. In this scenario, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework to design jointly the Pareto optimal beamforming vector and the TS ratio for each receiver. The objective is to maximize the utility vector including the achieved data rates and the harvested energies of all users simultaneously. This problem is a non-convex rank-constrained MOO problem which is relaxed and transformed into a non-convex semidefinite program (SDP) based on the weighted Chebycheff method. The majorization-minimization algorithm is utilized to solve the nonconvex SDP and the optimal solution is proved to satisfy the rank constraint. We also study the problem of optimizing the beamforming vectors in a fixed TS ratio scenario with the same approach. Numerical results are provided for two coordinated access points with MISO configuration. The results illustrate the trade-off between harvested energy and information data rate objectives and show the effect of optimizing the precoding strategy and TS ratio on this trade-off.
