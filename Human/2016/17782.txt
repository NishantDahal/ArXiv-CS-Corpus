Non-ideal memristors for a non-ideal world

Memristors have pinched hysteresis loops in the $V-I$ plane. Ideal memristors are everywhere non-linear, cross at zero and are rotationally symmetric. In this paper we extend memristor theory to produce different types of non-ideality and find that: including a background current (such as an ionic current) moves the crossing point away from zero; including a degradation resistance (that increases with experimental time) leads to an asymmetry; modelling a low resistance filament in parallel describes triangular $V-I$ curves with a straight-line low resistance state. A novel measurement of hysteresis asymmetry was introduced based on hysteresis and it was found that which lobe was bigger depended on the size of the breaking current relative to the memristance. The hysteresis varied differently with each type of non-ideality, suggesting that measurements of several device I-V curves and calculation of these parameters could give an indication of the underlying mechanism.
