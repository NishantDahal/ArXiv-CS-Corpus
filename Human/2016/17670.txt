COOLL: Controlled On/Off Loads Library, a Public Dataset of High-Sampled Electrical Signals for Appliance Identification

This paper gives a brief description of the Controlled On/Off Loads Library (COOLL) dataset. This latter is a dataset of high-sampled electrical current and voltage measurements representing individual appliances consumption. The measurements were taken in June 2016 in the PRISME laboratory of the University of Orl√©ans, France. The appliances are mainly controllable appliances (i.e. we can precisely control their turn-on/off time instants). 42 appliances of 12 types were measured at a 100 kHz sampling frequency.
