Efficient Splitting-based Method for Global Image Smoothing

Edge-preserving smoothing (EPS) can be formulated as minimizing an objective function that consists of data and prior terms. This global EPS approach shows better smoothing performance than a local one that typically has a form of weighted averaging, at the price of high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a highly efficient splitting-based method for global EPS that minimizes the objective function of ${l_2}$ data and prior terms (possibly non-smooth and non-convex) in linear time. Different from previous splitting-based methods that require solving a large linear system, our approach solves an equivalent constrained optimization problem, resulting in a sequence of 1D sub-problems. This enables linear time solvers for weighted-least squares and -total variation problems. Our solver converges quickly, and its runtime is even comparable to state-of-the-art local EPS approaches. We also propose a family of fast iteratively re-weighted algorithms using a non-convex prior term. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach in a range of computer vision and image processing tasks.
