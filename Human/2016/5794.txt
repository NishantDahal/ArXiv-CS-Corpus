Maxwell's demon and information channel width of a black hole

Using a new generalized second law of thermodynamics, the information and entropy of a black hole and its accretion disk are analyzed respectively. We find the bound of the information channel width of a black hole, which is determined by the variation rate of the horizon temperature and the mass of the black hole's shell(the accretion disk close to the horizon).
