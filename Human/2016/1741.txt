JSClassFinder: A Tool to Detect Class-like Structures in JavaScript

With the increasing usage of JavaScript in web applications, there is a great demand to write JavaScript code that is reliable and maintainable. To achieve these goals, classes can be emulated in the current JavaScript standard version. In this paper, we propose a reengineering tool to identify such class-like structures and to create an object-oriented model based on JavaScript source code. The tool has a parser that loads the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of a JavaScript application to model its structure. It is also integrated with the Moose platform to provide powerful visualization, e.g., UML diagram and Distribution Maps, and well-known metric values for software analysis. We also provide some examples with real JavaScript applications to evaluate the tool.
