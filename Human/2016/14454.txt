RRDVCR: Real-Time Reliable Data Delivery Based on Virtual Coordinating Routing for Wireless Sensor Networks

Real-time industrial application requires routing protocol that guarantees data delivery with reliable, efficient and low end-to-end delay. Existing Routing(THVR) [13] is based velocity of Two-Hop Velocity and protocol relates two-hop velocity to delay to select the next forwarding node, that has overhead of exchanging control packets, and depleting the available energy in nodes. We propose a Real-Time Reliable Data delivery based on Virtual Coordinates Routing (RRDVCR) algorithm, based on the number of hops to the destination rather than geographic distance. Selection of forwarding node is based on packet progress offered by two-hops, link quality and available energy at the forwarding nodes. All these metric are co-related by dynamic co-relation factor. The proposed protocol uses selective acknowledgment scheme that results in lower overhead and energy consumption. Simulation results shows that there is about 22% and 9.5% decrease in energy consumption compared to SPEED [8] and THVR [13] respectively, 16% and 38% increase in packet delivery compared to THVR [13] and SPEED[8] respectively, and overhead is reduced by 50%.
