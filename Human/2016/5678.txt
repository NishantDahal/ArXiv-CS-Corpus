New extremal binary self-dual codes of lengths 64 and 66 from bicubic planar graphs

In this work, connected cubic planar bipartite graphs and related binary self-dual codes are studied. Binary self-dual codes of length 16 are obtained by face-vertex incidence matrices of these graphs. By considering their lifts to the ring R_2 new extremal binary self-dual codes of lengths 64 are constructed as Gray images. More precisely, we construct 15 new codes of length 64. Moreover, 10 new codes of length 66 were obtained by applying a building-up construction to the binary codes. Codes with these weight enumerators are constructed for the first time in the literature. The results are tabulated.
