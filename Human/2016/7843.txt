Geometric Aspects of Iterated Matrix Multiplication

This paper studies geometric properties of the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial and the hypersurface that it defines. We focus on geometric aspects that may be relevant for complexity theory such as the symmetry group of the polynomial, the dual variety and the Jacobian loci of the hypersurface, that are computed with the aid of representation theory of quivers.
