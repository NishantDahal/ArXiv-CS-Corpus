Performance Analysis of Project-and-Forward Relaying in Mixed MIMO-Pinhole and Rayleigh Dual-Hop Channel

In this letter, we present an end-to-end performance analysis of dual-hop project-and-forward relaying in a realistic scenario, where the source-relay and the relay-destination links are experiencing MIMO-pinhole and Rayleigh channel conditions, respectively. We derive the probability density function of both the relay post-processing and the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratios, and the obtained expressions are used to derive the outage probability of the analyzed system as well as its end-to-end ergodic capacity in terms of generalized functions. Applying then the residue theory to Mellin-Barnes integrals, we infer the system asymptotic behavior for different channel parameters. As the bivariate Meijer-G function is involved in the analysis, we propose a new and fast MATLAB implementation enabling an automated definition of the complex integration contour. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are invoked to corroborate the analytical results.
