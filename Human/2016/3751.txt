Problem Solving in Sprego

Sprego is a programming tool for novice and end-user programmers within graphical spreadsheet environments. The main idea of Sprego is to use as few general purpose functions as possible, and based on these functions we create multilevel formulas to solve real world programmable spreadsheet problems. Beyond providing the framework for the theoretic background and the tools which support Sprego, in order to demonstrate the power which lies within it, we present a converted authentic table and, based on this table, data retrieval tasks, their algorithms, and coding in full details.
