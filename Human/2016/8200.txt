Extended OOBE Comparisons for OFDM, GFDM and WCP-COQAM at Equal Spectral Efficiency

Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM), windowed cyclic prefix circular offset quadrature amplitude modulation (WCP-COQAM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are among the candidate 5G modulation formats. In this study, we present additional results for the OOBE comparisons between OFDM, GFDM and WCP-COQAM under equal or unequal spectral efficiency conditions for various simulation scenarios.
