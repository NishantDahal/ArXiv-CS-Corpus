A Timed Process Algebra for Wireless Networks

This paper proposes a timed process algebra for wireless networks, an extension of the Algebra for Wireless Networks. It combines treatments of local broadcast, conditional unicast and data structures, which are essential features for the modelling of network protocols. In this framework we model and analyse the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector routing protocol, and show that, contrary to claims in the literature, it fails to be loop free. We also present boundary conditions for a fix ensuring that the resulting protocol is indeed loop free.
