Reduction of Self-heating effect in LDMOS devices

Isotopic purification of group IV elements leads to substantial increase in thermal conductivity due to reduced scattering of the phonons. Based on this concept, a simulation study is used to demonstrate the reduction of at least 25 oC in LDMOS average temperature.
