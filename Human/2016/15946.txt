Fractal Properties of Multiagent News Diffusion Model

The paper deals with fractal characteristics (Hurst exponent) and wavelet-scaleograms of the information distribution model, suggested by the authors. The authors have studied the effect of Hurst exponent change depending upon the model parameters, which have semantic meaning. The paper also considers fractal characteristics of real information streams. It is described, how the Hurst exponent dynamics depends on these information streams state in practice
