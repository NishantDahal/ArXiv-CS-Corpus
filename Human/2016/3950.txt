Semi-Automated Design Space Exploration for Formal Modelling

Refinement based formal methods allow the modelling of systems through incremental steps via abstraction. Discovering the right levels of abstraction, formulating correct and meaningful invariants, and analysing faulty models are some of the challenges faced when using this technique. Here, we propose Design Space Exploration, an approach that aims to assist a designer by automatically providing high-level modelling guidance in real-time. More specifically, through the combination of common patterns of modelling with techniques from automated theory formation and automated reasoning, different design alternatives are explored and suitable models that deal with faults are proposed.
