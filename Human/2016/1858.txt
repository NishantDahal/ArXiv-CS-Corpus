Fast DGT Based Receivers for GFDM in Broadband Channels

Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is a recent multicarrier 5G waveform candidate with flexibility of pulse shaping filters. However, the flexibility of choosing a pulse shaping filter may result in inter carrier interference (ICI) and inter symbol interference (ISI), which becomes more severe in a broadband channel. In order to eliminate the ISI and ICI, based on discrete Gabor transform (DGT), in this paper, a transmit GFDM signal is first treated as an inverse DGT (IDGT), and then a frequency-domain DGT is formulated to recover (as a receiver) the GFDM signal. Furthermore, to reduce the complexity, a suboptimal frequency-domain DGT called local DGT (LDGT) is developed. Some analyses are also given for the proposed DGT based receivers.
