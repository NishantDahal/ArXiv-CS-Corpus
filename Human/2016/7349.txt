ScientoBASE: A Framework and Model for Computing Scholastic Indicators of non-local influence of Journals via Native Data Acquisition algorithms

Defining and measuring internationality as a function of influence diffusion of scientific journals is an open problem. There exists no metric to rank journals based on the extent or scale of internationality. Measuring internationality is qualitative, vague, open to interpretation and is limited by vested interests. With the tremendous increase in the number of journals in various fields and the unflinching desire of academics across the globe to publish in "international" journals, it has become an absolute necessity to evaluate, rank and categorize journals based on internationality. Authors, in the current work have defined internationality as a measure of influence that transcends across geographic boundaries. There are concerns raised by the authors about unethical practices reflected in the process of journal publication whereby scholarly influence of a select few are artificially boosted, primarily by resorting to editorial maneuvres. To counter the impact of such tactics, authors have come up with a new method that defines and measures internationality by eliminating such local effects when computing the influence of journals. A new metric, Non-Local Influence Quotient(NLIQ) is proposed as one such parameter for internationality computation along with another novel metric, Other-Citation Quotient as the complement of the ratio of self-citation and total citation. In addition, SNIP and International Collaboration Ratio are used as two other parameters.
