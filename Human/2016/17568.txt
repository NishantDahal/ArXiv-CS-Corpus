A Business Zone Recommender System Based on Facebook and Urban Planning Data

We present ZoneRec---a zone recommendation system for physical businesses in an urban city, which uses both public business data from Facebook and urban planning data. The system consists of machine learning algorithms that take in a business' metadata and outputs a list of recommended zones to establish the business in. We evaluate our system using data of food businesses in Singapore and assess the contribution of different feature groups to the recommendation quality.
