The "paradox" of computability and a recursive relative version of the Busy Beaver function

In this article, we will show that uncomputability is a relative property not only of oracle Turing machines, but also of subrecursive classes. We will define the concept of a Turing submachine, and a recursive relative version for the Busy Beaver function which we will call Busy Beaver Plus function. Therefore, we will prove that the computable Busy Beaver Plus function defined on any Turing submachine is not computable by any program running on this submachine. We will thereby demonstrate the existence of a "paradox" of computability a la Skolem: a function is computable when "seen from the outside" the subsystem, but uncomputable when "seen from within" the same subsystem. Finally, we will raise the possibility of defining universal submachines, and a hierarchy of negative Turing degrees.
