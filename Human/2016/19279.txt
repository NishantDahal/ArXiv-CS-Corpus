Imaging around corners with single-pixel detector by computational ghost imaging

We have designed a single-pixel camera with imaging around corners based on computational ghost imaging. It can obtain the image of an object when the camera cannot look at the object directly. Our imaging system explores the fact that a bucket detector in a ghost imaging setup has no spatial resolution capability. A series of experiments have been designed to confirm our predictions. This camera has potential applications for imaging around corner or other similar environments where the object cannot be observed directly.
