Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile Display BCI

This chapter presents results of our project, which studied whether contactless and airborne ultrasonic tactile display (AUTD) stimuli delivered to a user's palms could serve as a platform for a brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm. We used six palm positions to evoke combined somatosensory brain responses to implement a novel contactless tactile BCI. This achievement was awarded the top prize in the Annual BCI Research Award 2014 competition. This chapter also presents a comparison with a classical attached vibrotactile transducer-based BCI paradigm. Experiment results from subjects performing online experiments validate the novel BCI paradigm.
