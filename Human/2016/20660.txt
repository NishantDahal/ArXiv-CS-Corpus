Minimal Actuator Placement with Bounds on Control Effort

We address the problem of minimal actuator placement in linear systems so that the volume of the set of states reachable with one unit or less of input energy is lower bounded by a desired value. First, following the recent work of Olshevsky, we prove that this is NP-hard. Then, we provide an efficient algorithm which, for a given range of problem parameters, approximates up to a multiplicative factor of O(logn), n being the network size, any optimal actuator set that meets the same energy criteria; this is the best approximation factor one can achieve in polynomial time, in the worst case. Moreover, the algorithm uses a perturbed version of the involved control energy metric, which we prove to be supermodular. Next, we focus on the related problem of cardinality-constrained actuator placement for minimum control effort, where the optimal actuator set is selected to maximize the volume of the set of states reachable with one unit or less of input energy. While this is also an NP-hard problem, we use our proposed algorithm to efficiently approximate its solutions as well.
