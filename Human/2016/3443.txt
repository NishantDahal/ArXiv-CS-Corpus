TapDrag: An Alternative Dragging Technique on Medium-Sized MultiTouch Displays Reducing Skin Irritation and Arm Fatigue

Medium-sized touch displays, sized 30 to 50 inches, are becoming more affordable and more widely available. Prolonged use of such displays can result in arm fatigue or skin irritation, especially when multiple long distance drags are involved. To address this issue, we present TapDrag, an alternative dragging technique that complements traditional dragging with a simple tapping gesture on both ends of the intended dragging path. Our experimental evaluation suggests that TapDrag is a viable alternative to traditional dragging with faster task completion times for long distances. Qualitative user feedback indicates that TapDrag helps prevent skin irritation. A reduction in arm fatigue remains unconfirmed.
