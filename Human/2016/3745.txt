Enhanced Robot Audition Based on Microphone Array Source Separation with Post-Filter

We propose a system that gives a mobile robot the ability to separate simultaneous sound sources. A microphone array is used along with a real-time dedicated implementation of Geometric Source Separation and a post-filter that gives us a further reduction of interferences from other sources. We present results and comparisons for separation of multiple non-stationary speech sources combined with noise sources. The main advantage of our approach for mobile robots resides in the fact that both the frequency-domain Geometric Source Separation algorithm and the post-filter are able to adapt rapidly to new sources and non-stationarity. Separation results are presented for three simultaneous interfering speakers in the presence of noise. A reduction of log spectral distortion (LSD) and increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of approximately 10 dB and 14 dB are observed.
