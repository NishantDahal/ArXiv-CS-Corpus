The recurrence function of a random Sturmian word

This paper describes the probabilistic behaviour of a random Sturmian word. It performs the probabilistic analysis of the recurrence function which can be viewed as a waiting time to discover all the factors of length $n$ of the Sturmian word. This parameter is central to combinatorics of words. Having fixed a possible length $n$ for the factors, we let $α$ to be drawn uniformly from the unit interval $[0,1]$, thus defining a random Sturmian word of slope $α$. Thus the waiting time for these factors becomes a random variable, for which we study the limit distribution and the limit density.
