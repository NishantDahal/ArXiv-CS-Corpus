Energy Efficient Transmission for Multicast Services in MISO Distributed Antenna Systems

This paper aims to solve the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem for multicast services in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) distributed antenna system (DAS). A novel iterative algorithm is proposed, which consists of solving two subproblems iteratively: the power allocation problem and the beam direction updating problem. The former subproblem can be equivalently transformed into a one-dimension quasi-concave problem that is solved by the golden search method. The latter problem can be efficiently solved by the existing method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant EE performance gains over the existing rate maximization method. In addition, when the backhaul power consumption is low, the EE performance of the DAS is better than that of the centralized antenna system (CAS).
