Probabilistic Models for Computerized Adaptive Testing: Experiments

This paper follows previous research we have already performed in the area of Bayesian networks models for CAT. We present models using Item Response Theory (IRT - standard CAT method), Bayesian networks, and neural networks. We conducted simulated CAT tests on empirical data. Results of these tests are presented for each model separately and compared.
