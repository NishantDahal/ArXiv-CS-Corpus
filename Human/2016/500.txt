Secure Information Sharing in an Industrial Internet of Things

This paper investigates how secure information sharing with external vendors can be achieved in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It also identifies necessary security requirements for secure information sharing based on identified security challenges stated by the industry. The paper then proposes a roadmap for improving security in IIoT which investigates both short-term and long-term solutions for protecting IIoT devices. The short-term solution is mainly based on integrating existing good practices. The paper also outlines a long term solution for protecting IIoT devices with fine-grained access control for sharing data between external entities that would support cloud-based data storage.
