New Architecture for Dynamic Spectrum Allocation in Cognitive Heterogeneous Network using Self Organizing Map

This paper introduces the Hybrid Architecture of Dynamic Spectrum Allocation in the hierarchical network combining centralized and distributed architecture to get optimum allocation of radio resources. It can limit the interference by interacting dynamically and enhance the spectrum efficiency while maintaining the desired QoS in the network. This paper presented dynamic framework for the interaction. The proposed architecture employed simple learning rule based on hebbian learning for sensing the primary network and allocating the spectrum.
