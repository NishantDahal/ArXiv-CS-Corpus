Weighted Linear Dynamic Logic

We introduce a weighted linear dynamic logic (weighted LDL for short) and show the expressive equivalence of its formulas to weighted rational expressions. This adds a new characterization for recognizable series to the fundamental Sch√ºtzenberger theorem. Surprisingly, the equivalence does not require any restriction to our weighted LDL. Our results hold over arbitrary (resp. totally complete) semirings for finite (resp. infinite) words. As a consequence, the equivalence problem for weighted LDL formulas over fields is decidable in doubly exponential time. In contrast to classical logics, we show that our weighted LDL is expressively incomparable to weighted LTL for finite words. We determine a fragment of the weighted LTL such that series over finite and infinite words definable by LTL formulas in this fragment are definable also by weighted LDL formulas.
