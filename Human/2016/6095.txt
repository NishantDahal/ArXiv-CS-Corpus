Towards a Better Understanding of CAR, CDR, CADR and the Others

This paper describes the IBM 704 architecture and the genesis of the names for CAR, and CDR, which, as it turns out, probably don't quite make sense. The paper suggests that this may not be all bad, as the names lend themselves to compounding. Indeed that the compound function names , such as CADR, or even CADADR, etc. may be read as little access programs.
