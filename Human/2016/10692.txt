Enhanced Boolean Correlation Matrix Memory

This paper introduces an Enhanced Boolean version of the Correlation Matrix Memory (CMM), which is useful to work with binary memories. A novel Boolean Orthonormalization Process (BOP) is presented to convert a non-orthonormal Boolean basis, i.e., a set of non-orthonormal binary vectors (in a Boolean sense) to an orthonormal Boolean basis, i.e., a set of orthonormal binary vectors (in a Boolean sense). This work shows that it is possible to improve the performance of Boolean CMM thanks BOP algorithm. Besides, the BOP algorithm has a lot of additional fields of applications, e.g.: Steganography, Hopfield Networks, Bi-level image processing, etc. Finally, it is important to mention that the BOP is an extremely stable and fast algorithm.
