Chinese Postman Problem on Edge-Colored Multigraphs

It is well-known that the Chinese postman problem on undirected and directed graphs is polynomial-time solvable. We extend this result to edge-colored multigraphs. Our result is in sharp contrast to the Chinese postman problem on mixed graphs, i.e., graphs with directed and undirected edges, for which the problem is NP-hard.
