NOP - A Simple Experimental Processor for Parallel Deployment

The design of a parallel computing system using several thousands or even up to a million processors asks for processing units that are simple and thus small in space, to make as many processing units as possible fit on a single die.
  The design presented herewith is far from being optimised, it is not meant to compete with industry performance devices. Its main purpose is to allow for a prototypical implementation of a dynamic software system as a proof of concept.
