Online Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting Operator Performance

This thesis explores a number of online machine learning algorithms. From a theoret- ical perspective, it assesses their employability for a particular function approximation problem where the analytical models fall short. Furthermore, it discusses the applica- tion of theoretically suitable learning algorithms to the function approximation problem at hand through an efficient implementation that exploits various computational and mathematical shortcuts. Finally, this thesis work evaluates the implemented learning algorithms according to various evaluation criteria through rigorous testing.
