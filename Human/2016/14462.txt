Multi-Tenancy Issues with Service Delivery in Developing Economies: Privacy, Trust and Availability Concerns

Cloud computing is a new paradigm and innovation in the technology service delivery. It is utilized for IT-enabled value creation. The capex-free nature of cloud service delivery renders it very attractive to many SMEs. But it is saddled with multi-tenancy issues; prominent under this study are concerns of privacy, trust and availability. How do end-users trust providers with their sensitive data? How secured and confidential are their corporate assets? Amidst the perennial power outages (a.k.a. Dumsor), what is the acceptable available uptime? We sampled and interviewed cloud service providers (CSPs) as well as end-users in Ghana, a developing economy. We also gleaned through some secondary data to ascertain some operational concerns. The results indicate that security and service level agreements (SLAs) are key concerns in respect of privacy and trust issues. Similarly, perennial power outages and security were key availability concerns. This was expected as end-users use cloud services for mission critical information assets, and so requires high availability. The implications are that the cyber-security concerns ought to be addressed if SMEs in developing economies are to adopt and accept cloud computing resources for IT-enabled competitive advantage.
