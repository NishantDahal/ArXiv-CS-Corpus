Human Computer Interaction Using Marker Based Hand Gesture Recognition

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has been redefined in this era. People want to interact with their devices in such a way that has physical significance in the real world, in other words, they want ergonomic input devices. In this paper, we propose a new method of interaction with computing devices having a consumer grade camera, that uses two colored markers (red and green) worn on tips of the fingers to generate desired hand gestures, and for marker detection and tracking we used template matching with kalman filter. We have implemented all the usual system commands, i.e., cursor movement, right click, left click, double click, going forward and backward, zoom in and out through different hand gestures. Our system can easily recognize these gestures and give corresponding system commands. Our system is suitable for both desktop devices and devices where touch screen is not feasible like large screens or projected screens.
