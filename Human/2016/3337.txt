A Light-Weight Forwarding Plane for Content-Centric Networks

We present CCN-DART, a more efficient forwarding approach for content-centric networking (CCN) than named data networking (NDN) that substitutes Pending Interest Tables (PIT) with Data Answer Routing Tables (DART) and uses a novel approach to eliminate forwarding loops. The forwarding state required at each router using CCN-DART consists of segments of the routes between consumers and content providers that traverse a content router, rather than the Interests that the router forwards towards content providers. Accordingly, the size of a DART is proportional to the number of routes used by Interests traversing a router, rather than the number of Interests traversing a router. We show that CCN-DART avoids forwarding loops by comparing distances to name prefixes reported by neighbors, even when routing loops exist. Results of simulation experiments comparing CCN-DART with NDN using the ndnSIM simulation tool show that CCN-DART incurs 10 to 20 times less storage overhead.
