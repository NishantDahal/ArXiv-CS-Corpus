Mapping EU fishing activities using ship tracking data

Information and understanding of fishing activities at sea are fundamental components of marine knowledge and maritime situational awareness. Such information is important to fisheries science, public authorities and policy makers. In this paper we introduce a first map at European scale of EU fishing activities extracted using Automatic Identification System (AIS) ship tracking data. The resulting map is a density of points that identify fishing activities. A measure of the reliability of such information is also presented as a map of coverage reception capabilities.
