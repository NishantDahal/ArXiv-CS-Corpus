Sum-networks: Dependency on Characteristic of the Finite Field under Linear Network Coding

Sum-networks are networks where all the terminals demand the sum of the symbols generated at the sources. It has been shown that for any finite set/co-finite set of prime numbers, there exists a sum-network which has a vector linear solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set. It has also been shown that for any positive rational number $k/n$, there exists a sum-network which has capacity equal to $k/n$. It is a natural question whether, for any positive rational number $k/n$, and for any finite set/co-finite set of primes $\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_l\}$, there exists a sum-network which has a capacity achieving rate $k/n$ fractional linear network coding solution if and only if the characteristic of the finite field belongs to the given set. We show that indeed there exists such a sum-network by constructing such a sum-network.
