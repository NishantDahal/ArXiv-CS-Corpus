Coded Caching for Networks with the Resolvability Property

Coded caching is a recently proposed technique for dealing with large scale content distribution over the Internet. As in conventional caching, it leverages the presence of local caches at the end users. However, it considers coding in the caches and/or coded transmission from the central server and demonstrates that huge savings in transmission rate are possible when the server and the end users are connected via a single shared link. In this work, we consider a more general topology where there is a layer of relay nodes between the server and the users, e.g., combination networks studied in network coding are an instance of these networks. We propose novel schemes for a class of such networks that satisfy a so-called resolvability property and demonstrate that the performance of our scheme is strictly better than previously proposed schemes.
