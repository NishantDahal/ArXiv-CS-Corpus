On the Secure Degrees of Freedom of the K-user MAC and 2-user Interference Channels

We investigate the secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) of the K-user MIMO multiple access (MAC) and the two user MIMO interference channel. An unknown number of eavesdroppers are trying to decode the messages sent by the transmitters. Each eavesdropper is equipped with a number of antennas less than or equal to a known value NE. The legitimate transmitters and receivers are assumed to have global channel knowledge. We present the sum SDoF of the two user MIMO interference channel. We derive an upperbound on the sum SDoF of the K-user MAC channel and present an achievable scheme that partially meets the derived upperbound.
