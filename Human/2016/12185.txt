Critical Points for Two-view Triangulation

Two-view triangulation is a problem of minimizing a quadratic polynomial under an equality constraint. We derive a polynomial that encodes the local minimizers of this problem using the theory of Lagrange multipliers. This offers a simpler derivation of the critical points that are given in Hartley-Sturm [6].
