A Bibliometric Study of Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference from 2010 to 2015

The Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) is a reputed and a long-running conference which has successfully completed more than two decades as of year 2015. We conduct a bibliometric and scientific publication mining based study to how the conference has evolved over the recent past six years (year 2010 to 2015). Our objective is to perform in-depth examination of the state of APSEC so that the APSEC community can identify strengths, areas of improvements and future directions for the conference. Our empirical analysis is based on various perspectives such as: paper submission acceptance rate trends, conference location, scholarly productivity and contributions from various countries, analysis of keynotes, workshops, conference organizers and sponsors, tutorials, identification of prolific authors, computation of citation impact of papers and contributing authors, internal and external collaboration, university and industry participation and collaboration, measurement of gender imbalance, topical analysis, yearly author churn and program committee characteristics.
