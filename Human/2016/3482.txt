Introspectibles: Tangible Interaction to Foster Introspection

Digital devices are now ubiquitous and have the potential to be used to support positive changes in human lives and promote psychological well-being. This paper presents three interactive systems that we created focusing on introspection activities, leveraging tangible interaction and spatial augmented reality. More specifically, we describe anthropomorphic augmented avatars that display the users' inner states using physiological sensors. We also present a first prototype of an augmented sandbox specifically dedicated to promoting mindfulness activities.
