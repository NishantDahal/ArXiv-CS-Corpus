Impact of Mobility on the Sum Rate of NB-OFDMA Based Mobile IoT Networks

In future Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the explosive growth of mobile devices compel us to reconsider the effectiveness of the current frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) schemes. Devices' differentiated mobility features and diversified scattering environments make it more complicated to characterize the multi-user interference. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the impacts of devices' mobility on the inter-sub-carrier interference (ICI) in an IoT system based on the 3GPP narrow-band orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (NB-OFDMA) protocol, and obtain the relationship between the system sum-rate and devices' mobility. Our results may shed some lights on the system design under the mobile scenarios.
