Joint Power and Subcarrier Allocation for Multicarrier Full-Duplex Systems

In this paper, we investigate resource allocation for multicarrier communication systems employing a full-duplex base station for serving multiple half-duplex downlink and uplink users simultaneously. We study the joint power and subcarrier allocation design for the maximization of the weighted sum throughput of the system. The algorithm design is formulated as a mixed combinatorial non-convex optimization problem and obtaining the globally optimal solution may require prohibitively high computational complexity. Therefore, a low computational complexity suboptimal iterative algorithm exploiting successive convex approximation is proposed to obtain a locally optimal solution. Simulation results confirm that the proposed suboptimal algorithm obtains a substantial improvement in system throughput compared to various existing baseline schemes.
