Disjunctive Probabilistic Modal Logic is Enough for Bisimilarity on Reactive Probabilistic Systems

Larsen and Skou characterized probabilistic bisimilarity over reactive probabilistic systems with a logic including true, negation, conjunction, and a diamond modality decorated with a probabilistic lower bound. Later on, Desharnais, Edalat, and Panangaden showed that negation is not necessary to characterize the same equivalence. In this paper, we prove that the logical characterization holds also when conjunction is replaced by disjunction, with negation still being not necessary. To this end, we introduce reactive probabilistic trees, a fully abstract model for reactive probabilistic systems that allows us to demonstrate expressiveness of the disjunctive probabilistic modal logic, as well as of the previously mentioned logics, by means of a compactness argument.
