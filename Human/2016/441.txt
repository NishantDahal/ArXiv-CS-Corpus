Scalability in Neural Control of Musculoskeletal Robots

Anthropomimetic robots are robots that sense, behave, interact and feel like humans. By this definition, anthropomimetic robots require human-like physical hardware and actuation, but also brain-like control and sensing. The most self-evident realization to meet those requirements would be a human-like musculoskeletal robot with a brain-like neural controller. While both musculoskeletal robotic hardware and neural control software have existed for decades, a scalable approach that could be used to build and control an anthropomimetic human-scale robot has not been demonstrated yet. Combining Myorobotics, a framework for musculoskeletal robot development, with SpiNNaker, a neuromorphic computing platform, we present the proof-of-principle of a system that can scale to dozens of neurally-controlled, physically compliant joints. At its core, it implements a closed-loop cerebellar model which provides real-time low-level neural control at minimal power consumption and maximal extensibility: higher-order (e.g., cortical) neural networks and neuromorphic sensors like silicon-retinae or -cochleae can naturally be incorporated.
