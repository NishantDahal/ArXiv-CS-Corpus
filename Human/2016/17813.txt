Stall Pattern Avoidance in Polynomial Product Codes

Product codes are a concatenated error-correction scheme that has been often considered for applications requiring very low bit-error rates, which demand that the error floor be decreased as much as possible. In this work, we consider product codes constructed from polynomial algebraic codes, and propose a novel low-complexity post-processing technique that is able to improve the error-correction performance by orders of magnitude. We provide lower bounds for the error rate achievable under post processing, and present simulation results indicating that these bounds are tight.
