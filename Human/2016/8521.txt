Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Physics and Computation

This volume constitutes the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Physics and Computation (PC 2016). The workshop was held on the 14th of July 2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.
  The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and, in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems. Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.
