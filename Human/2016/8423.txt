Joint User Association and Downlink Beamforming for Green Cloud-RANs with Limited Fronthaul

With the explosive growth of smart devices and mobile data traffic, limited fronthaul capacity has become a notable bottleneck of green communication access networks, such as cloud radio access networks(C-RANs). In this paper, we proposed a joint user association and downlink beamforming scheme for green C-RANs to minimize the network power consumption with the limited fronthaul links. We first formulate the design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), and then transformed the MINLP problem into a mixed integer second-order cone program (MI-SOCP) which is a convex program when the integer variables are fixed. By relaxing the integer variables to continuous ones, an inflation algorithm, which can be finished within polynomial time, was proposed to solved the problem. The simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared with the the scheme adopted by LTE-A.
