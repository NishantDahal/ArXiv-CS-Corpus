Grid-Based Multichannel Access in Vehicular Networks

In vehicular networks, vehicles exchange messages with each other as well as infrastructure to prevent accidents or enhance driver's and passenger's experience. In this paper, we propose a grid-based multichannel access scheme to enhance the performance of a vehicular network. To determine the feasibility of our scheme, we obtained preliminary results using the OPNET simulation tool.
