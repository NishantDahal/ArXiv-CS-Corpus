Measurement-Based Wideband Analysis of Dynamic Multipath Propagation in Vehicular Communication Scenarios

Realistic propagation modeling requires a detailed understanding and characterization of the radio channel properties. This paper is based on channel sounder measurements with 1 GHz bandwidth at a carrier frequency of 5.7 GHz and particular tracking methods. We present statistical models for the number of, birth rate, lifetime, excess delay and relative Doppler frequency of individual multipath components (MPCs). Our findings are concluded from 72 measurement runs in eight relevant vehicular communication scenarios and reveal wide insights into the dynamic propagation process in vehicular communication scenarios.
