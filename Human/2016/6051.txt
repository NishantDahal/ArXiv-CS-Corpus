Analysis of a Planetary Scale Scientific Collaboration Dataset Reveals Novel Patterns

Scientific collaboration networks are an important component of scientific output and contribute significantly to expanding our knowledge and to the economy and gross domestic product of nations. Here we examine a dataset from the Mendeley scientific collaboration network. We analyze this data using a combination of machine learning techniques and dynamical models. We find interesting clusters of countries with different characteristics of collaboration. Some of these clusters are dominated by developed countries that have higher number of self connections compared with connections to other countries. Another cluster is dominated by impoverished nations that have mostly connections and collaborations with other countries but fewer self connections. We also propose a complex systems dynamical model that explains these characteristics. Our model explains how the scientific collaboration networks of impoverished and developing nations change over time. We also find interesting patterns in the behaviour of countries that may reflect past foreign policies and contemporary geopolitics. Our model and analysis gives insights and guidelines into how scientific development of developing countries can be guided. This is intimately related to fostering economic development of impoverished nations and creating a richer and more prosperous society.
