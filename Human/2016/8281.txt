Beamforming for Full-Duplex Multiuser MIMO Systems

We solve a sum rate maximization problem of full-duplex (FD) multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Since additional self-interference (SI) in the uplink channel and co-channel interference (CCI) in the downlink channel are coupled in FD communication, the downlink and uplink multiuser beamforming vectors are required to be jointly designed. However, the joint optimization problem is non-convex and hard to solve due to the coupled effect. To properly address the coupled design issue, we reformulate the problem into an equivalent uplink channel problem, using the uplink and downlink channel duality known as MAC-BC duality. Then, using minorization maximization (MM) algorithm based on an affine approximation, we obtain a solution for the reformulated problem. In addition, without any approximation and thus performance degradation, we develop an alternating algorithm based on iterative water-filling (IWF) to solve the non-convex problem. The proposed algorithms warrant fast convergence and low computational complexity.
