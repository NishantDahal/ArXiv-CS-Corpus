Fast Image Classification by Boosting Fuzzy Classifiers

This paper presents a novel approach to visual objects classification based on generating simple fuzzy classifiers using local image features to distinguish between one known class and other classes. Boosting meta learning is used to find the most representative local features. The proposed approach is tested on a state-of-the-art image dataset and compared with the bag-of-features image representation model combined with the Support Vector Machine classification. The novel method gives better classification accuracy and the time of learning and testing process is more than 30% shorter.
