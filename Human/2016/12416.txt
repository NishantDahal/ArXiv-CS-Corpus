On Minimal Accuracy Algorithm Selection in Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems

In this paper we discuss certain theoretical properties of algorithm selection approach to image processing and to intelligent system in general. We analyze the theoretical limits of algorithm selection with respect to the algorithm selection accuracy. We show the theoretical formulation of a crisp bound on the algorithm selector precision guaranteeing to always obtain better than the best available algorithm result.
