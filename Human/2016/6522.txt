The Many Worlds of Modal λ-calculi: I. Curry-Howard for Necessity, Possibility and Time

This is a survey of λ-calculi that, through the Curry-Howard isomorphism, correspond to constructive modal logics. We cover the prehistory of the subject and then concentrate on the developments that took place in the 1990s and early 2000s. We discuss logical aspects, modal λ-calculi, and their categorical semantics. The logics underlying the calculi surveyed are constructive versions of K, K4, S4, and LTL.
