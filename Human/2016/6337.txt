Investigating the Impact of Learners Learning Styles on the Acceptance of Open Learner Models for Information Sharing

Individual differences in learners learning styles can have a significant effect on their acceptance of collaboration technologies to facilitate the sharing of learning information in technology-based collaborative learning. There is, however, a lack of research in exploring the impact of learning styles on the acceptance of open learner models for information sharing in this area. This study investigates the impact of learners learning styles on their acceptance of open learner models for information sharing. A total of 240 undergraduate students in a university in Malaysia have participated in the online survey. A chi-square test is performed to explore the relationship between learning styles and the acceptance of open learner models for information sharing in a higher education setting. The result reveals that learning styles have no significant impact on learners acceptance of open learner models for information sharing. The implications of this study can assist education instructors to apply appropriate instructional strategies in adopting open learner models for improving the performance of technology-mediated learning.
