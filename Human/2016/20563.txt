Multiclass Classification of Cervical Cancer Tissues by Hidden Markov Model

In this paper, we report a hidden Markov model based multiclass classification of cervical cancer tissues. This model has been validated directly over time series generated by the medium refractive index fluctuations extracted from differential interference contrast images of healthy and different stages of cancer tissues. The method shows promising results for multiclass classification with higher accuracy.
