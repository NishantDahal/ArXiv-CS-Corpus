Some Closed Classes of Three-Valued Logic Generated by Periodic Symmetric Functions

Closed classes of three-valued logic generated by periodic symmetric funtions that equal $1$ in tuples from $\{1,2\}^n$ and equal $0$ on the rest tuples are considered. Criteria for bases existence and finite bases existence for these classes is obtained.
