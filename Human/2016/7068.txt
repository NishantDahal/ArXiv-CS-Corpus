Deformable Parts Correlation Filters for Robust Visual Tracking

Deformable parts models show a great potential in tracking by principally addressing non-rigid object deformations and self occlusions, but according to recent benchmarks, they often lag behind the holistic approaches. The reason is that potentially large number of degrees of freedom have to be estimated for object localization and simplifications of the constellation topology are often assumed to make the inference tractable. We present a new formulation of the constellation model with correlation filters that treats the geometric and visual constraints within a single convex cost function and derive a highly efficient optimization for MAP inference of a fully-connected constellation. We propose a tracker that models the object at two levels of detail. The coarse level corresponds a root correlation filter and a novel color model for approximate object localization, while the mid-level representation is composed of the new deformable constellation of correlation filters that refine the object location. The resulting tracker is rigorously analyzed on a highly challenging OTB, VOT2014 and VOT2015 benchmarks, exhibits a state-of-the-art performance and runs in real-time.
