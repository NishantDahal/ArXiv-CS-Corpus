Mobile Instant Video Clip Sharing: Modeling and Enhancing View Experience

With the rapid development of wireless networking and mobile devices, anytime and anywhere data access becomes readily available nowadays. Given the crowdsourced content capturing and sharing, the preferred content length becomes shorter and shorter, even for such multimedia data as video. A representative is Twitter's Vine service, which, mainly targeting mobile users, enables them to create ultra-short video clips and instantly post and share with their followers. In this paper, we present an initial study on this new generation of instant video clip sharing service enabled by mobile platforms and explore the potentials towards its further enhancement. We closely investigate its unique mobile interface, revealing the key differences between Vine-enabled anytime anywhere data access patterns and that of traditional counterparts. We then examine the scheduling policy to maximize the user watching experience as well as the efficiency on the monetary and energy costs. We show that the generic scheduling problem involves two subproblems, namely, pre-fetching scheduling and watch-time download scheduling, and develop effective solutions towards both of them. The superiority of our solution is demonstrated by extensive trace-driven simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on modeling and optimizing the instant video clip sharing on mobile devices.
