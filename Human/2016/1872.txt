State Space Analysis of Memristor Based Series and Parallel RLCM Circuits

The present paper investigates state space analysis of memristor based series and parallel RLCM circuits. The stability analysis is carried out with the help of eigenvalues formulation method, pole-zero plot and transient response of system. The state space analysis is successfully applied and eigenvalues of the two circuits are calculated. It is found that the, system follows negative real part of eigenvalues. The result clearly shows that addition of memristor in circuits will not alter the stability of system. It is found that systems poles located at left hand side of the S plane, which indicates stable performance of system. It clearly evident that eigenvalues has negative real part hence two systems are internally stable.
