Hybrid Video Signal Coding Technologies: Past, Current and Future

The growing needs for high-quality video applications have resulted in a lot of studies and developments in video signal coding. This chapter presents some advanced techniques in enhancing the rate-distortion performance of the block-based hybrid video coding systems. Additionally, as can be seen from the developments of H.264/AVC and HEVC, most of the current coding tools, such as prediction, transformation and entropy coding, have less room to improve in the compression performance. On the other hand, loop filer in the modern video standards shows the promising results. Thus, we believe that loop filter can be the candidate in contributing to higher video compression for the next-generation video coding. Specifically, improvements on ALF and SAO are also introduced, and the simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the existing method, which offer new degrees of freedom to improve the overall rate-distortion performance. As a result, they can be the candidate coding tools for the next-generation video codec.
