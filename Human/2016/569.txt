Benchmarking, System Design and Case-studies for Multi-core based Embedded Automotive Systems

In this paper, using of automotive use cases as benchmarks for real-time system design has been proposed. The use cases are described in a format supported by AMALTHEA platform, which is a model based open source development environment for automotive multi-core systems. An example of a simple Electronic Control Unit has been analysed and presented with enough details to reconstruct this system in any format. For researchers willing to use AMALTHEA file format directly, an appropriate parser has been developed and offered. An example of applying this parser and benchmark for optimising makespan while not violating the timing constraints by allocating functionality to different Network on Chip resource is demonstrated.
