Highly Efficient Regression for Scalable Person Re-Identification

Existing person re-identification models are poor for scaling up to large data required in real-world applications due to: (1) Complexity: They employ complex models for optimal performance resulting in high computational cost for training at a large scale; (2) Inadaptability: Once trained, they are unsuitable for incremental update to incorporate any new data available. This work proposes a truly scalable solution to re-id by addressing both problems. Specifically, a Highly Efficient Regression (HER) model is formulated by embedding the Fisher's criterion to a ridge regression model for very fast re-id model learning with scalable memory/storage usage. Importantly, this new HER model supports faster than real-time incremental model updates therefore making real-time active learning feasible in re-id with human-in-the-loop. Extensive experiments show that such a simple and fast model not only outperforms notably the state-of-the-art re-id methods, but also is more scalable to large data with additional benefits to active learning for reducing human labelling effort in re-id deployment.
