CoALP-Ty'16

This volume constitutes the pre-proceedings of the Workshop on Coalgebra, Horn Clause Logic Programming and Types (CoALP-Ty'16), held on 28--29 November 2016 in Edinburgh as a mark of the end of the EPSRC Grant Coalgebraic Logic Programming for Type Inference, by E. Komendantskaya and J. Power. This volume consists of extended abstracts describing current research in the following areas:
  Semantics: Lawvere theories and Coalgebra in Logic and Functional Programming
  Programming languages: Horn Clause Logic for Type Inference in Functional Languages and Beyond
  After discussion at the workshop authors of the extended abstracts will be invited to submit a full paper to go through a second round of refereeing and selection for the formal proceedings.
