Sensitivity Conjecture and Log-rank Conjecture for functions with small alternating numbers

The Sensitivity Conjecture and the Log-rank Conjecture are among the most important and challenging problems in concrete complexity. Incidentally, the Sensitivity Conjecture is known to hold for monotone functions, and so is the Log-rank Conjecture for $f(x \wedge y)$ and $f(x\oplus y)$ with monotone functions $f$, where $\wedge$ and $\oplus$ are bit-wise AND and XOR, respectively. In this paper, we extend these results to functions $f$ which alternate values for a relatively small number of times on any monotone path from $0^n$ to $1^n$. These deepen our understandings of the two conjectures, and contribute to the recent line of research on functions with small alternating numbers.
