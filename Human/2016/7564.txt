An optimized round robin cpu scheduling algorithm with dynamic time quantum

CPU scheduling is one of the most crucial operations performed by operating system. Different algorithms are available for CPU scheduling amongst them RR (Round Robin) is considered as optimal in time shared environment. The effectiveness of Round Robin completely depends on the choice of time quantum. In this paper a new CPU scheduling algorithm has been proposed, named as DABRR (Dynamic Average Burst Round Robin). That uses dynamic time quantum instead of static time quantum used in RR. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally compared with traditional RR and some existing variants of RR. The results of our approach presented in this paper demonstrate improved performance in terms of average waiting time, average turnaround time, and context switching.
