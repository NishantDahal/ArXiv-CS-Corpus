Resiliency and Robustness of Complex, Multi-Genre Networks

We explore the resiliency and robustness of systems while viewing them as complex, multi-genre networks. The term "complex, multi-genre networks" refers to networks that combine several distinct genres - networks of physical resources, communication networks, information networks, and social and cognitive networks. We show that this perspective is fruitful and adds to our understanding of fundamental challenges and tradeoffs in robustness and resiliency, as well as potential solutions to the challenges. Study of systems as multi-genre networks is relatively uncommon; instead, it is customary in research and engineering literature to focus on a view of a network comprised of homogeneous elements, (e.g., a network of communication devices, or a network of social beings). Yet, most if not all real-world networks are multi-genre - it is hard to find any real system of a significant complexity that does not include a combination of interconnected physical elements, communication devices and channels, data collections, and human users forming an integrated, inter-dependent whole. Most approaches to improving resiliency and robustness involve compromises, and the key challenge is to find a favorable compromise. Such compromises involve reducing or managing the complexity of the network: coupling, rigidity and dependency. We discuss several of these compromises, e.g., performance vs resiliency; resiliency to one type of disruption vs resiliency to another disruption type; and complexity vs resiliency.
