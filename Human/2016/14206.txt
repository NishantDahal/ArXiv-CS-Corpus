Construction of Gray maps for groups of order 16

In this paper we consider Type 1 Gray maps and Type 2 Gray maps for groups of order 16. First, we confirm that we can construct Type 1 Gray maps for all groups of order 16, and we actually construct them. Next, we confirm that we can construct Type 2 Gray maps for several groups of order 16, and we construct all such maps. Finally we reveal why the other groups do not admit Gray maps.
