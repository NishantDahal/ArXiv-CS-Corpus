Factorization of Z-homogeneous polynomials in the First (q)-Weyl Algebra

We present algorithms to factorize weighted homogeneous elements in the first polynomial Weyl algebra and $q$-Weyl algebra, which are both viewed as a $\mathbb{Z}$-graded rings. We show, that factorization of homogeneous polynomials can be almost completely reduced to commutative univariate factorization over the same base field with some additional uncomplicated combinatorial steps. This allows to deduce the complexity of our algorithms in detail. Furthermore, we will show for homogeneous polynomials that irreducibility in the polynomial first Weyl algebra also implies irreducibility in the rational one, which is of interest for practical reasons. We report on our implementation in the computer algebra system \textsc{Singular}. It outperforms for homogeneous polynomials currently available implementations dealing with factorization in the first Weyl algebra both in speed and elegancy of the results.
