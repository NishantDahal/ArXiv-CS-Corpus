A short review and primer on the use of human voice in human computer interaction applications

The application of psychophysiologicy in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Human speech affords, alongside linguistic content, rich information in the intonation, voice quality, prosody, and rhythmic variation of utterances, allowing listeners to recognise numerous distinct emotional states in the speaker. Several types of factors affect speech, ranging from emotions to cognitive load and pathological conditions, providing a promising non-intrusive source for online understanding of context and psychophysiological state.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
