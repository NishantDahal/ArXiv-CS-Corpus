SDxVPN: A Software-Defined Solution for VPN Service Providers

BGP/MPLS IP VPN and VPLS services are considered to be widely used in IP/MPLS networks for connecting customers' remote sites. However, service providers struggle with many challenges to provide these services. Management complexity, equipment costs, and last but not least, scalability issues emerging as the customers increase in number, are just some of these problems. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that can solve aforementioned issues using a logically centralized controller for network devices. In this paper, we propose a SDN-based solution called SDxVPN which considerably lowers the complexity of VPN service definition and management. Our method eliminates complex and costly device interactions that used to be done through several control plane protocols and enables customers to determine their service specifications, define restriction policies and even interconnect with other customers automatically without operator's intervention. We describe our prototype implementation of SDxVPN and its scalability evaluations under several representative scenarios. The results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed solution for deployment to provide large scale VPN services.
