Millimeter Wave Communications with OAM-SM Scheme for Future Mobile Networks

The orbital angular momentum (OAM) technique provides a new degree of freedom for information transmissions in millimeter wave communications. Considering the spatial distribution characteristics of OAM beams, a new OAM spatial modulation (OAM-SM) millimeter wave communication system is first proposed for future mobile networks. Furthermore, the capacity, average bit error probability and energy efficiency of OAM-SM millimeter wave communication systems are analytically derived for performance analysis. Compared with the conventional multi-input multi-output (MIMO) millimeter wave communication systems, the maximum capacity and energy efficiency of OAM-SM millimeter wave communication systems are improved by 36% and 472.3%, respectively. Moreover, numerical results indicate that the proposed OAM-SM millimeter wave communication systems are more robust to path-loss attenuations than the conventional MIMO millimeter wave communication systems, which makes it suitable for long-range transmissions. Therefore, OAM-SM millimeter wave communication systems provide a great growth space for future mobile networks.
