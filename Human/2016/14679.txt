Group Rotation Type Crowdsourcing

A common workflow to perform a continuous human task stream is to divide workers into groups, have one group perform the newly-arrived task, and rotate the groups. We call this type of workflow the group rotation. This paper addresses the problem of how to manage Group Rotation Type Crowdsourcing, the group rotation in a crowdsourcing setting. In the group-rotation type crowdsourcing, we must change the group structure dynamically because workers come in and leave frequently. This paper proposes an approach to explore a design space of methods for group restructuring in the group rotation type crowdsourcing.
