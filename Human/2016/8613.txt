Some experiments in number theory

We experiment with some topics in elementary number theory. For matrices defined by Gaussian primes we observe a circular spectral law for the eigenvalues. We look at matrices defined by Gaussian primes and look at the growth of the determinant, trace. We experiment with various Goldbach conjectures for Gaussian primes, Eisenstein primes, Hurwitz primes or Octavian primes. These conjectures relate with Landau or Bunyakovsky or Andrica type conjectures for rational primes. We also look at some graphs finite simple defined by primes. Finally we look at some spectra of almost periodic pseudo random matrices defined by Diophantine irrational rotations, where fractal spectral phenomena occur. The matrix is the real part of a van der Monde matrix.
