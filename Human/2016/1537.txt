The Potential of Resource Sharing in 5G Millimeter-Wave Bands

With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, the millimeter (mmWave) frequencies, roughly above 10~GHz, have been attracting growing attention for next-generation micro- and pico- cellular wireless networks. A fundamental and open question is how these bands should be used by cellular operators. Cellular spectrum has been traditionally allocated following an exclusive ownership model. However, in this paper we argue that the distinct nature of mmWave communication -- the massive bandwidth degrees of freedom, directional isolation and high susceptibility to blockage -- suggest that spectrum and infrastructure sharing between multiple operators may be necessary to exploit the full potential of these bands. High-level capacity analyses are presented that reveal significant possible gains under spectrum and infrastructure sharing, even under minimal coordination between operators. Moreover, we discuss how network technologies including software defined networks (SDNs) and network function virtualization (NFV) can easily enable resource sharing by having a programmable core entity provide transparent inter-operator access to the end user.
