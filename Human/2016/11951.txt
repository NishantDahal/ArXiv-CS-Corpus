Low Complexity Power Allocation Schemes in Regenerative Multi-user Relay Networks

In relay assisted wireless communications, the multi-source, single relay and single destination system (an $M$-1-1 system) is of growing importance, due to the increased demand for higher network throughput and connectivity. Previously, power allocation in $M$-1-1 systems have assumed availability of instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is rather idealistic. In this paper we consider an $M$-1-1 Decode-and-Forward (DF), Full-Duplex, orthogonal frequencey division multiple access (OFDMA) based relay system with statistical-CSI and analyze the achievable rate $R$ of such a system. We show how $R$ can only be maximized by numerical power allocation schemes which has a high-complexity of order $\mathcal O(M^3)$. By introducing a rational approximation in the achievable rate analysis, we develop two low-complexity power allocation schemes that can obtain a system achievable rate very close to the maximum $R$. Most importantly, we show that the complexity of our power allocation schemes is of order $\mathcal O(M\log M)$. We then show how our power allocation schemes are suitable for a multi-user relay system, where either the priority is to maximize system throughput, or where lower computations in power allocation scheme are essential. The work we present in this paper will be of value to the design and implementation of real-time multi-user relay systems operating under realistic channel conditions.
