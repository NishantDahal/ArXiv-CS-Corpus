Sentiment/Subjectivity Analysis Survey for Languages other than English

Subjective and sentiment analysis have gained considerable attention recently. Most of the resources and systems built so far are done for English. The need for designing systems for other languages is increasing. This paper surveys different ways used for building systems for subjective and sentiment analysis for languages other than English. There are three different types of systems used for building these systems. The first (and the best) one is the language specific systems. The second type of systems involves reusing or transferring sentiment resources from English to the target language. The third type of methods is based on using language independent methods. The paper presents a separate section devoted to Arabic sentiment analysis.
