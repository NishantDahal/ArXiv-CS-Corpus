Length of the continued logarithm algorithm on rational inputs

The continued logarithm algorithm was introduced by Gosper around 1978, and recently studied by Borwein, Calkin, Lindstrom, and Mattingly. In this note I show that the continued logarithm algorithm terminates in at most 2 log_2 p + O(1) steps on input a rational number p/q >= 1. Furthermore, this bound is tight, up to an additive constant.
