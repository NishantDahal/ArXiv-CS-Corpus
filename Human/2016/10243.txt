Regular Behaviours with Names

Nominal sets provide a framework to study key notions of syntax and semantics such as fresh names, variable binding and $α$-equivalence on a conveniently abstract categorical level. Coalgebras for endofunctors on nominal sets model, e.g., various forms of automata with names as well as infinite terms with variable binding operators (such as $λ$-abstraction). Here, we first study the behaviour of orbit-finite coalgebras for functors $\bar F$ on nominal sets that lift some finitary set functor $F$. We provide sufficient conditions under which the rational fixpoint of $\bar F$, i.e. the collection of all behaviours of orbit-finite $\bar F$-coalgebras, is the lifting of the rational fixpoint of $F$. Second, we describe the rational fixpoint of the quotient functors: we introduce the notion of a sub-strength of an endofunctor on nominal sets, and we prove that for a functor $G$ with a sub-strength the rational fixpoint of each quotient of $G$ is a canonical quotient of the rational fixpoint of $G$. As applications, we obtain a concrete description of the rational fixpoint for functors arising from so-called binding signatures with exponentiation, such as those arising in coalgebraic models of infinitary $λ$-terms and various flavours of automata.
