Multi-layer Mechanism for Multicast Routing in Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks

Multicast routing is considered as one of the most important process in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) to enable video sharing and data dissemination. Multicast routing can be used without any difficulties if a medium can be accessed by any transmitter at any given time. Unfortunately, challenges such as the unexpected behavior of primary users (PUs) and their access priority as well as network heterogeneity may appear in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this thesis, we propose a multi-layer multicast routing protocol for multi-hop mobile Ad Hoc CRN based on the concept of the minimum spanning tree (MST) and the shortest path tree (SPT). The proposed algorithm employs the probability of success (POS) metric in performing the channel assignment process. Simulations experiments were conducted, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the-state-of-the-art schemes, and study the performance of the proposed scheme under various network conditions in terms of throughput and packet delivery rate (PDR). Simulations results show that the SPT outperforms MST in term of throughput all the time.
