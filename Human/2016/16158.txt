Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications with Urban Intersection Path Loss Models

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication can improve road safety and traffic efficiency, particularly around critical areas such as intersections. We analytically derive V2V success probability near an urban intersection, based on empirically supported line-of-sight (LOS), weak-line-of-sight (WLOS), and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel models. The analysis can serve as a preliminary design tool for performance assessment over different system parameters and target performance requirements.
