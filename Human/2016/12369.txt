Lossy Asymptotic Equipartition property for Hierarchical Data Structures

This paper presents a rate-distortion theory for hierarchical networked data structures modelled as tree-indexed multitype process. To be specific, this paper gives a generalized Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) for the Process. The general methodology of proof of the AEP are process level large deviation principles for suitably defined empirical measures for muiltitype Galton-Watson trees.
