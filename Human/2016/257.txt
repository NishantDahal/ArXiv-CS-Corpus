Finite Blocklength Achievable Rates for Energy Harvesting AWGN Channels with Infinite Buffer

We consider an additive White Gaussian channel where the transmitter is powered by an energy harvesting source. For such a system, we provide a lower bound on the maximal code book at finite code lengths that improves upon previously known bounds.
