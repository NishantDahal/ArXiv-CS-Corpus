Maximum Leaf Spanning Trees of Growing Sierpinski Networks Models

The dynamical phenomena of complex networks are very difficult to predict from local information due to the rich microstructures and corresponding complex dynamics. On the other hands, it is a horrible job to compute some stochastic parameters of a large network having thousand and thousand nodes. We design several recursive algorithms for finding spanning trees having maximal leaves (MLS-trees) in investigation of topological structures of Sierpinski growing network models, and use MLS-trees to determine the kernels, dominating and balanced sets of the models. We propose a new stochastic method for the models, called the edge-cumulative distribution, and show that it obeys a power law distribution.
