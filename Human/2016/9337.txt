Appropriation of social media for knowledge sharing by patients with chronic illness

Social media technologies are increasingly utilized by patients, leading to development of online social groups where patients share experiences and offer support to their peers on these platforms. There is limited research investigating actual use of social media platforms by patients, issues faced in using such platforms and how appropriation of these platforms impact patient outcomes. A conceptual model based on social support theory and model of technology appropriation is proposed in order to investigate factors that influence this phenomenon. The authors propose that social support theory and model of technology appropriation could explain the determining factors, both enablers and barriers that drive appropriation and knowledge sharing behaviours of patients on social media platforms.
