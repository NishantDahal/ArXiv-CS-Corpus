Achieving Shannon Capacity in a Wiretap Channel via Previous Messages

In this paper we consider a wiretap channel with a secret key buffer. We use the coding scheme of [1] to enhance the secrecy rate to the capacity of the main channel, while storing each securely transmitted message in the secret key buffer. We use the oldest secret bits from the buffer to be used as a secret key to transmit a message in a slot and then remove those bits. With this scheme we are able to prove stronger results than those in [1]. i.e., not only the message which is being transmitted currently, but all the messages transmitted in last $N_1$ slots are secure with respect to all the information that the eavesdropper possesses, where $N_1$ can be chosen arbitrarily large.
