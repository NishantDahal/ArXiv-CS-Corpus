Non-volatile spin wave majority gate at the nanoscale

A spin wave majority fork-like structure with feature size of 40\,nm, is presented and investigated, through micromagnetic simulations. The structure consists of three merging out-of-plane magnetization spin wave buses and four magneto-electric cells serving as three inputs and an output. The information of the logic signals is encoded in the phase of the transmitted spin waves and subsequently stored as direction of magnetization of the magneto-electric cells upon detection. The minimum dimensions of the structure that produce an operational majority gate are identified. For all input combinations, the detection scheme employed manages to capture the majority phase result of the spin wave interference and ignore all reflection effects induced by the geometry of the structure.
