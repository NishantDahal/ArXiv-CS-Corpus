On the Grundy number of Cameron graphs

The Grundy number of a graph is the maximal number of colors attained by a first-fit coloring of the graph. The class of Cameron graphs is the Seidel switching class of cographs. In this paper we show that the Grundy number is computable in polynomial time for Cameron graphs.
