NebulOS: A Big Data Framework for Astrophysics

We introduce NebulOS, a Big Data platform that allows a cluster of Linux machines to be treated as a single computer. With NebulOS, the process of writing a massively parallel program for a datacenter is no more complicated than writing a Python script for a desktop computer. The platform enables most pre-existing data analysis software to be used, as scale, in a datacenter without modification. The shallow learning curve and compatibility with existing software greatly reduces the time required to develop distributed data analysis pipelines. The platform is built upon industry-standard, open-source Big Data technologies, from which it inherits several fault tolerance features. NebulOS enhances these technologies by adding an intuitive user interface, automated task monitoring, and other usability features. We present a summary of the architecture, provide usage examples, and discuss the system's performance scaling.
