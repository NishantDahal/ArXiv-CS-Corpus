Quantum Cognition Beyond Hilbert Space I: Fundamentals

The formalism of quantum theory in Hilbert space has been applied with success to the modeling and explanation of several cognitive phenomena, whereas traditional cognitive approaches were problematical. However, this 'quantum cognition paradigm' was recently challenged by its proven impossibility to simultaneously model 'question order effects' and 'response replicability'. In Part I of this paper we describe sequential dichotomic measurements within an operational and realistic framework for human cognition elaborated by ourselves, and represent them in a quantum-like 'extended Bloch representation' where the Born rule of quantum probability does not necessarily hold. In Part II we apply this mathematical framework to successfully model question order effects, response replicability and unpacking effects, thus opening the way toward quantum cognition beyond Hilbert space.
