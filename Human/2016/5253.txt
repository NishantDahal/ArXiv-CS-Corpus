Resource Allocation with Population Dynamics

Many analyses of resource-allocation problems employ simplistic models of the population. Using the example of a resource-allocation problem of Marecek et al. [arXiv:1406.7639], we introduce rather a general behavioural model, where the evolution of a heterogeneous population of agents is governed by a Markov chain. Still, we are able to show that the distribution of agents across resources converges in distribution, for suitable means of information provision, under certain assumptions. The model and proof techniques may have wider applicability.
