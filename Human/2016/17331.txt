Massive MIMO Pilot Retransmission Strategies for Robustification against Jamming

This letter proposes anti-jamming strategies based on pilot retransmission for a single user uplink massive MIMO under jamming attack. A jammer is assumed to attack the system both in the training and data transmission phases. We first derive an achievable rate which enables us to analyze the effect of jamming attacks on the system performance. Counter-attack strategies are then proposed to mitigate this effect under two different scenarios: random and deterministic jamming attacks. Numerical results illustrate our analysis and benefit of the proposed schemes.
