On the Spectral Efficiency of Massive MIMO Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs

The low-resolution analog-to-digital convertor (ADC) is a promising solution to significantly reduce the power consumption of radio frequency circuits in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this letter, we investigate the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of massive MIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs over Rician fading channels, where both perfect and imperfect channel state information are considered. By modeling the quantization noise of low-resolution ADCs as an additive quantization noise, we derive tractable and exact approximation expressions of the uplink SE of massive MIMO with the typical maximal-ratio combining (MRC) receivers. We also analyze the impact of the ADC resolution, the Rician $K$-factor, and the number of antennas on the uplink SE. Our derived results reveal that the use of low-cost and low-resolution ADCs can still achieve satisfying SE in massive MIMO systems.
