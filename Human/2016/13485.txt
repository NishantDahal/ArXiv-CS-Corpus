Design and Analysis of Deadline and Budget Constrained Autoscaling (DBCA) Algorithm for 5G Mobile Networks

In cloud computing paradigm, virtual resource autoscaling approaches have been intensively studied recent years. Those approaches dynamically scale in/out virtual resources to adjust system performance for saving operation cost. However, designing the autoscaling algorithm for desired performance with limited budget, while considering the existing capacity of legacy network equipment, is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose a Deadline and Budget Constrained Autoscaling (DBCA) algorithm for addressing the budget-performance tradeoff. We develop an analytical model to quantify the tradeoff and cross-validate the model by extensive simulations. The results show that the DBCA can significantly improve system performance given the budget upper-bound. In addition, the model provides a quick way to evaluate the budget-performance tradeoff and system design without wide deployment, saving on cost and time.
