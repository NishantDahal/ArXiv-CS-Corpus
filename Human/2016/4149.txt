Massive MIMO Relaying with Hybrid Processing

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying is a promising technological paradigm which can offer high spectral efficiency and substantially improved coverage. Yet, these configurations face some formidable challenges in terms of digital signal processing (DSP) power consumption and circuitry complexity, since the number of radio frequency (RF) chains may scale with the number of antennas at the relay station. In this paper, we advocate that performing a portion of the power-intensive DSP in the analog domain, using simple phase shifters and with a reduced number of RF paths, can address these challenges. In particular, we consider a multipair amplify-and-forward (AF) relay system with maximum ratio combining/transmission (MRC/MRT) and we determine the asymptotic spectral efficiency for this hybrid analog/digital architecture. After that, we extend our analytical results to account for heavily quantized analog phase shifters and show that the performance loss with 2 quantization bits is only 10%.
