On the Capacity of Joint Fading and Two-path Shadowing Channels

The ergodic and outage channel capacity of different optimal and suboptimal combinations of transmit power and modulation rate adaptation strategies over a joint fading and two-path shadowing (JFTS) fading/shadowing channel is studied in this paper. Analytically tractable expressions for channel capacity are obtained, assuming perfect channel side information (CSI) at the receiver and/or the transmitter with negligible feedback delay. Furthermore, the impacts of the JFTS parameters on the channel capacity achieved by these adaptive transmission techniques are determined.
