Joint Pushing and Caching with a Finite Receiver Buffer: Optimal Policies and Throughput Analysis

Pushing and caching hold the promise of significantly increasing the throughput of content-centric wireless networks. However, the throughput gain of these techniques is limited by the buffer size of the receiver. To overcome this, this paper presents a Joint Pushing and Caching (JPC) method that jointly determines the contents to be pushed to, and to be removed from, the receiver buffer in each timeslot. An offline and two online JPC policies are proposed respectively based on noncausal, statistical, and causal content Request Delay Information (RDI), which predicts a user's request time for certain content. It is shown that the effective throughput of JPC is increased with the receiver buffer size and the pushing channel capacity. Furthermore, the causal feedback of user requests is found to greatly enhance the performance of online JPC without inducing much signalling overhead in practice.
