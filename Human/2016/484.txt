Adjacencies in Permutations

A permutation on an alphabet $ Σ$, is a sequence where every element in $ Σ$ occurs precisely once. Given a permutation $ π$= ($π_{1} $, $ π_{2} $, $ π_{3} $,....., $ π_{n} $) over the alphabet $ Σ$ =$\{ $0, 1, . . . , n$-$1 $\}$ the elements in two consecutive positions in $ π$ e.g. $ π_{i} $ and $ π_{i+1} $ are said to form an \emph{adjacency} if $ π_{i+1} $ =$ π_{i} $+1. The concept of adjacencies is widely used in computation. The set of permutations over $ Σ$ forms a symmetric group, that we call P$ _{n} $. The identity permutation, I$ _{n}$ $\in$ P$_{n}$ where I$_{n}$ =(0,1,2,...,n$-$1) has exactly n$ - $1 adjacencies. Likewise, the reverse order permutation R$_{n} (\in P_{n})$=(n$-$1, n$-$2, n$-$3, n$-$4, ...,0) has no adjacencies. We denote the set of permutations in P$_{n} $ with exactly k adjacencies with P$_{n} $(k). We study variations of adjacency. % A transposition exchanges adjacent sublists; when one of the sublists is restricted to be a prefix (suffix) then one obtains a prefix (suffix) transposition. We call the operations: transpositions, prefix transpositions and suffix transpositions as block-moves. A particular type of adjacency and a particular block-move are closely related. In this article we compute the cardinalities of P$_{n}$(k) i.e. $ \forall_k \mid $P$ _{n} $ (k) $ \mid $ for each type of adjacency in $O(n^2)$ time. Given a particular adjacency and the corresponding block-move, we show that $\forall_{k} \mid P_{n}(k)\mid$ and the expected number of moves to sort a permutation in P$_{n} $ are closely related. Consequently, we propose a model to estimate the expected number of moves to sort a permutation in P$_{n} $ with a block-move. We show the results for prefix transposition. Due to symmetry, these results are also applicable to suffix transposition.
