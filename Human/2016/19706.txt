Improved Algorithms for Decremental Single-Source Reachability on Directed Graphs

Recently we presented the first algorithm for maintaining the set of nodes reachable from a source node in a directed graph that is modified by edge deletions with $o(mn)$ total update time, where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph [Henzinger et al. STOC 2014]. The algorithm is a combination of several different algorithms, each for a different $m$ vs. $n$ trade-off. For the case of $m = Θ(n^{1.5})$ the running time is $O(n^{2.47})$, just barely below $mn = Θ(n^{2.5})$. In this paper we simplify the previous algorithm using new algorithmic ideas and achieve an improved running time of $\tilde O(\min(m^{7/6} n^{2/3}, m^{3/4} n^{5/4 + o(1)}, m^{2/3} n^{4/3+o(1)} + m^{3/7} n^{12/7+o(1)}))$. This gives, e.g., $O(n^{2.36})$ for the notorious case $m = Θ(n^{1.5})$. We obtain the same upper bounds for the problem of maintaining the strongly connected components of a directed graph undergoing edge deletions. Our algorithms are correct with high probabililty against an oblivious adversary.
