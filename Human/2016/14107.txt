SCTP User Message Interleaving Integration and Validation

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a connection and message oriented transport protocol. It supports multiple uni-directional streams in each direction allowing user message sequence preservation within each stream. This minimizes the re-sequencing delay at the receiver side in case of message loss. The base protocol, although being optimized for small messages, supports arbitrary large user messages by using fragmentation and reassembly at the cost of adding delays at the sender side. To overcome this limitation, a protocol extension called User Message Interleaving is currently being specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This paper describes the new extension, its integration and validation in the context of the INET framework.
