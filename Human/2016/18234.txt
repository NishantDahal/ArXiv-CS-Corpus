Remarks on Propositional Logics and the categorial relationship between Institutions and Π-Institutions

In this work we explore some applications of the notions of Institution and Π-Institution in the setting of propositional logics and establish a precise categorial relation between these notions, i.e., we provide a pair of functors that establishes an adjunction between the categories Inst and Π-Inst.
