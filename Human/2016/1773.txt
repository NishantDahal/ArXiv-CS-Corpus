Packet Error Rate Performance of IEEE802.11g under Bluetooth Interface

This study approaches the issues concerning the coexistence of the IEEE 802.11g wireless networks and the adhoc Bluetooth networks that operate within the same 2.4 GHz band. The performance of 802.11g is evaluated by simulating the PER (Packet Error Rate) parameter and coverage area. The simulation experiments are based on the worst case scenario presumption, which entails the transmission of HV1 packet which HV1 link requires transmission on 100% of the Bluetooth (BT) time slots using the maximum hop rate of 1600 hops per sec. The paper suggests a practical approach to mitigate the interference using symbol erasures technique through the assessment of the PER parameter at various Eb/No values. The results show that the symbol erasures can effectively mitigate the interference and enhance the performance of the 802.11g.
