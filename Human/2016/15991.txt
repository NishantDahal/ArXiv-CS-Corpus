Complexities Approach to Two Problems In Number Theory

By Kolmogorov Complexity,two number-theoretic problems are solved in different way than before,one problem is Maxim Kontsevich and Don Bernard Zagier's Problem 3 \emph{Exhibit at least one number which does not belong to} $ \mathcal{P}$ (period number) in their paper,another is the problem about existence of bounded coefficients of continued fraction expansion of transcendental number.Thus we show a new approach to mathematical problems in the non-logical discipline.Futhermore,we show that resource-bounded Kolmogorov Complexity and computational complexity can at least provide tips or principles to mathematical problems in the non-traditional or logical discipline.
