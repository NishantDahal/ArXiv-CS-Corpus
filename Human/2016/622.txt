A Unified Inner Bound for the Two-Receiver Memoryless Broadcast Channel with Channel State and Message Side Information

We consider the two-receiver memoryless broadcast channel with states where each receiver requests both common and private messages, and may know part of the private message requested by the other receiver as receiver message side information (RMSI). We address two categories of the channel (i) channel with states known causally to the transmitter, and (ii) channel with states known non-causally to the transmitter. Starting with the channel without RMSI, we first propose a transmission scheme and derive an inner bound for the causal category. We then unify our inner bound for the causal category and the best-known inner bound for the non-causal category, although their transmission schemes are different. Moving on to the channel with RMSI, we first apply a pre-coding to the transmission schemes of the causal and non-causal categories without RMSI. We then derive a unified inner bound as a result of having a unified inner bound when there is no RMSI, and applying the same pre-coding to both categories. We show that our inner bound is tight for some new cases as well as the cases whose capacity region was known previously.
