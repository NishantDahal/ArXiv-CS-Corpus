The "Sprekend Nederland" project and its application to accent location

This paper describes the data collection effort that is part of the project Sprekend Nederland (The Netherlands Talking), and discusses its potential use in Automatic Accent Location. We define Automatic Accent Location as the task to describe the accent of a speaker in terms of the location of the speaker and its history. We discuss possible ways of describing accent location, the consequence these have for the task of automatic accent location, and potential evaluation metrics.
