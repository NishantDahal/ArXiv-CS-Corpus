Lower Bounds for On-line Interval Coloring with Vector and Cardinality Constraints

We propose two strategies for Presenter in the on-line interval graph coloring games. Specifically, we consider a setting in which each interval is associated with a $d$-dimensional vector of weights and the coloring needs to satisfy the $d$-dimensional bandwidth constraint, and the $k$-cardinality constraint. Such a variant was first introduced by Epstein and Levy and it is a natural model for resource-aware task scheduling with $d$ different shared resources where at most $k$ tasks can be scheduled simultaneously on a single machine.
  The first strategy forces any on-line interval coloring algorithm to use at least $(5m-3)\frac{d}{\log d + 3}$ different colors on an $m(\frac{d}{k} + \log{d} + 3)$-colorable set of intervals. The second strategy forces any on-line interval coloring algorithm to use at least $\lfloor\frac{5m}{2}\rfloor\frac{d}{\log d + 3}$ different colors on an $m(\frac{d}{k} + \log{d} + 3)$-colorable set of unit intervals.
