Compressive Change Retrieval for Moving Object Detection

Change detection, or anomaly detection, from street-view images acquired by an autonomous robot at multiple different times, is a major problem in robotic mapping and autonomous driving. Formulation as an image comparison task, which operates on a given pair of query and reference images is common to many existing approaches to this problem. Unfortunately, providing relevant reference images is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for change detection, termed compressive change retrieval, which can operate on a query image and similar reference images retrieved from the web. Compared to previous formulations, there are two sources of difficulty. First, the retrieved reference images may frequently contain non-relevant reference images, because even state-of-the-art place-recognition techniques suffer from retrieval noise. Second, image comparison needs to be conducted in a compressed domain to minimize the storage cost of large collections of street-view images. To address the above issues, we also present a practical change detection algorithm that uses compressed bag-of-words (BoW) image representation as a scalable solution. The results of experiments conducted on a practical change detection task, "moving object detection (MOD)," using the publicly available Malaga dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
