Bandwidth and delay issue s on the network routing

N/W has always been intended to be incredibly strong. H/W and software changes affect basic structure on the N/W capacity. N/W-Routing-protocols have been used to determine the shortest path as the goal. N/W information is deployed using dominant interior N/W-Routing-protocols. Although in N/W little instability is associated with bandwidth and latency this requires analysis. Statistical analysis of the samples have been taken for identifying the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Study has been made to see the relations with the delay, bandwidth, and N/W-Routing stability to draw to the conclusions for a positive relationship. Thus, for getting the better performance and results, bandwidth and delay should be reduced, as suggested in this paper.
