Building an Internet Radio System with Interdisciplinary factored system for automatic content recommendation

Automatic systems for music content recommendation have assumed a new role in recent years. These systems have transformed from being just a convenient, standalone tool into an inseparable element of modern living. In addition, not only do these systems strongly influence human moods and feelings with the selection of proper music content, but they also provide significant commercial and advertising opportunities. This research aims to examine and implement two such systems available for the automatic recognition and recommendation of music and advertisement content for Internet radio. Through analysis of the practical issues of application fields and spheres of influence, conclusions will be drawn about the possible perspectives on and future role of such systems. Other content adaptation that is based on music genres will be discussed, as wellAnother aim of this study is to provide an innovative Internet radio implementation as compared to traditional radio and other Internet broadcast solutions. This will include automatic content recommendation systems for listeners and marketing companies, as well as the usage of a voice synthesizer in in automatic program scheduling.
