Understanding Deep Convolutional Networks

Deep convolutional networks provide state of the art classifications and regressions results over many high-dimensional problems. We review their architecture, which scatters data with a cascade of linear filter weights and non-linearities. A mathematical framework is introduced to analyze their properties. Computations of invariants involve multiscale contractions, the linearization of hierarchical symmetries, and sparse separations. Applications are discussed.
