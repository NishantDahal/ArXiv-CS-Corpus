The ND-IRIS-0405 Iris Image Dataset

The Computer Vision Research Lab at the University of Notre Dame began collecting iris images in the spring semester of 2004. The initial data collections used an LG 2200 iris imaging system for image acquisition. Image datasets acquired in 2004-2005 at Notre Dame with this LG 2200 have been used in the ICE 2005 and ICE 2006 iris biometric evaluations. The ICE 2005 iris image dataset has been distributed to over 100 research groups around the world. The purpose of this document is to describe the content of the ND-IRIS-0405 iris image dataset. This dataset is a superset of the iris image datasets used in ICE 2005 and ICE 2006. The ND 2004-2005 iris image dataset contains 64,980 images corresponding to 356 unique subjects, and 712 unique irises. The age range of the subjects is 18 to 75 years old. 158 of the subjects are female, and 198 are male. 250 of the subjects are Caucasian, 82 are Asian, and 24 are other ethnicities.
