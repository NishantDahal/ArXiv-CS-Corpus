Big Data Analytics in Cloud environment using Hadoop

The Big Data management is a problem right now. The Big Data growth is very high. It is very difficult to manage due to various characteristics. This manuscript focuses on Big Data analytics in cloud environment using Hadoop. We have classified the Big Data according to its characteristics like Volume, Value, Variety and Velocity. We have made various nodes to process the data based on their volume, velocity, value and variety. In this work we have classify the input data and routed to various processing node. At the last after processing from each node, we can combine the output of all nodes to get the final result. We have used Hadoop to partition the data as well as process it.
