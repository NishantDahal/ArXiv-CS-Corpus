Convergence and Density Evolution of a Low-Complexity MIMO Detector based on Forward-Backward Recursion over a Ring

Convergence and density evolution of a low complexity, iterative MIMO detection based on belief propagation (BP) over a ring-type pair-wise graph are presented in this paper. The detection algorithm to be considered is effectively a forward-backward recursion and was originally proposed in [13], where the link level performance and the convergence for Gaussian input were analyzed. Presented here are the convergence proof for discrete alphabet and the density evolution framework for binary input to give an asymptotic performance in terms of average SINR and bit error rate (BER) without channel coding. The BER curve obtained via density evolution shows a good match with simulation results, verifying the effectiveness of the density evolution analysis and the performance of the detection algorithm.
