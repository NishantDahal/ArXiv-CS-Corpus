Stirling's approximation for central extended binomial coefficients

We derive asymptotic formulas for central extended binomial coefficients, which are generalizations of binomial coefficients. To do so, we relate the exact distribution of the sum of independent discrete uniform random variables to the asymptotic distribution, obtained from the Central Limit Theorem and a local limit variant.
