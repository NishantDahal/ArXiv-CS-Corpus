Statistical QoS Analysis of Full Duplex and Half Duplex Heterogeneous Cellular Networks

In this paper, statistical Quality of Service provisioning in next generation heterogeneous mobile cellular networks is investigated. To this aim, any active entity of the cellular network is regarded as a queuing system, whose statistical QoS requirements depend on the specific application. In this context, by quantifying the performance in terms of effective capacity, we introduce a lower bound for the system performance that facilitates an efficient analysis. We exploit this analytical framework to give insights about the possible improvement of the statistical QoS experienced by the users if the current heterogeneous cellular network architecture migrates from a Half Duplex to a Full Duplex mode of operation. Numerical results and analysis are provided, where the network is modeled as a Mat√©rn point processes with a hard core distance. The results demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed scheme, especially in large scale wireless systems.
