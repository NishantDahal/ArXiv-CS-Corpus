Cournot-Nash Equilibria for Bandwidth Allocation under Base-Station Cooperation

-In this paper, a novel resource allocation scheme based on discrete Cournot-Nash equilibria and optimal transport theory is proposed. The originality of this framework lies in the joint optimization of downlink bandwidth allocation and cooperation between base stations. A tractable formalization is given in the form of a quadratic optimization problem. A low complexity approximate solution is derived and theoretically characterized. Simulations highlight the existence of an optimal working point, that maximizes user satisfaction ratio and network load. The impact of the network deployment on the optimum is numerically investigated, thanks to the $β$-Ginibre model. Indeed, base stations are assumed to be drawn according to $β$-Ginibre point processes. Numerical analysis shows that the network performance increases with $β$ going to one.
