Towards Designing PLC Networks for Ubiquitous Connectivity in Enterprises

Powerline communication (PLC) provides inexpensive, secure and high speed network connectivity, by leveraging the existing power distribution networks inside the buildings. While PLC technology has the potential to improve connectivity and is considered a key enabler for sensing, control, and automation applications in enterprises, it has been mainly deployed for improving connectivity in homes. Deploying PLCs in enterprises is more challenging since the power distribution network is more complex as compared to homes. Moreover, existing PLC technologies such as HomePlug AV have not been designed for and evaluated in enterprise deployments. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive measurement study of PLC performance in enterprise settings, by analyzing PLC channel characteristics across space, time, and spectral dimensions, using commodity HomePlug AV PLC devices. Our results uncover the impact of distribution lines, circuit breakers, AC phases and electrical interference on PLC performance. Based on our findings, we show that careful planning of PLC network topology, routing and spectrum sharing can significantly boost performance of enterprise PLC networks. Our experimental results show that multi-hop routing can increase throughput performance by 5x in scenarios where direct PLC links perform poorly. Moreover, our trace driven simulations for multiple deployments, show that our proposed fine-grained spectrum sharing design can boost the aggregated and per-link PLC throughput by more than 20% and 100% respectively, in enterprise PLC networks.
