Active Canny: Edge Detection and Recovery with Open Active Contour Models

We introduce an edge detection and recovery framework based on open active contour models (snakelets). This is motivated by the noisy or broken edges output by standard edge detection algorithms, like Canny. The idea is to utilize the local continuity and smoothness cues provided by strong edges and grow them to recover the missing edges. This way, the strong edges are used to recover weak or missing edges by considering the local edge structures, instead of blindly linking them if gradient magnitudes are above some threshold. We initialize short snakelets on the gradient magnitudes or binary edges automatically and then deform and grow them under the influence of gradient vector flow. The output snakelets are able to recover most of the breaks or weak edges, and they provide a smooth edge representation of the image; they can also be used for higher level analysis, like contour segmentation.
