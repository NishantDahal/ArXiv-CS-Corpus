Probabilistic Cooperation of a Full-Duplex Relay in Random Access Networks

In this work, we analyze the probabilistic cooperation of a full-duplex relay in a multiuser random-access network. The relay is equipped with on/off modes for the receiver and the transmitter independently. These modes are modeled as probabilities by which the receiver and the transmitter are activated. We provide analytical expressions for the performance of the relay queue, such as arrival and service rates, stability conditions, and the average queue size. We optimize the relay's operation setup to maximize the network-wide throughput while, simultaneously, we keep the relay's queue stable and minimize the consumed energy. Furthermore, we study the effect of the SINR threshold and the self-interference (SI) coefficient on the per-user and network-wide throughput. For low SINR threshold, we show under which circumstances it is beneficial to switch off the relay completely, or switch off the relay's receiver only.
