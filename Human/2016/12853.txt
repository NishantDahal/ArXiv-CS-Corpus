Parametric, Probabilistic, Timed Resource Discovery System

This paper presents a fully distributed resource discovery and reservation system. Verification of such a system is important to ensure the execution of distributed applications on a set of resources in appropriate conditions. A semi-formal model for his system is presented using probabilistic timed automata. This model is timed, parametric and probabilistic, making it a challenge to the parameter synthesis community.
