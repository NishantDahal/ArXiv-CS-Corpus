An Appropriate Sensor Distribution Technique in Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is pertinent to many applications with varied network parameters. Sensor node placement in the application region whether it is indoor or outdoor is a major task as well as plays very remarkable role in the network performance. Node placement is carried out according to the region where it is applied, either deterministic or non deterministic. Because of the need for different sensing probability or detection probability, same approach of sensor placement may not be suited for all the applications. Some of the applications are well formed and give better performance with the uniform distribution of sensors but few need intense distribution of nodes in particular sensitive places especially those applications meant for intrusion detection. An application which needs high level intrusion detection and a suitable sensor distribution methodology, known as Half-Normal Distribution (Half-Gaussian) based deployment, have been set forth in this paper. We have also discussed the theoretical comparison for detection probability with the uniform distribution in terms of number of sensor nodes.
