Adaptive Mesh Booleans

We present a new method for performing Boolean operations on volumes represented as triangle meshes. In contrast to existing methods which treat meshes as 3D polyhedra and try to partition the faces at their exact intersection curves, we treat meshes as adaptive surfaces which can be arbitrarily refined. Rather than depending on computing precise face intersections, our approach refines the input meshes in the intersection regions, then discards intersecting triangles and fills the resulting holes with high-quality triangles. The original intersection curves are approximated to a user-definable precision, and our method can identify and preserve creases and sharp features. Advantages of our approach include the ability to trade speed for accuracy, support for open meshes, and the ability to incorporate tolerances to handle cases where large numbers of faces are slightly inter-penetrating or near-coincident.
