A representation of a compressed de Bruijn graph for pan-genome analysis that enables search

Recently, Marcus et al. (Bioinformatics 2014) proposed to use a compressed de Bruijn graph to describe the relationship between the genomes of many individuals/strains of the same or closely related species. They devised an $O(n \log g)$ time algorithm called splitMEM that constructs this graph directly (i.e., without using the uncompressed de Bruijn graph) based on a suffix tree, where $n$ is the total length of the genomes and $g$ is the length of the longest genome. In this paper, we present a construction algorithm that outperforms their algorithm in theory and in practice. Moreover, we propose a new space-efficient representation of the compressed de Bruijn graph that adds the possibility to search for a pattern (e.g. an allele - a variant form of a gene) within the pan-genome.
