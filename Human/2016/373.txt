A New Converse Bound for Coded Caching

An information-theoretic lower bound is developed for the caching system studied by Maddah-Ali and Niesen. By comparing the proposed lower bound with the decentralized coded caching scheme of Maddah-Ali and Niesen, the optimal memory--rate tradeoff is characterized to within a multiplicative gap of $4.7$ for the worst case, improving the previous analytical gap of $12$. Furthermore, for the case when users' requests follow the uniform distribution, the multiplicative gap is tightened to $4.7$, improving the previous analytical gap of $72$. As an independent result of interest, for the single-user average case in which the user requests multiple files, it is proved that caching the most requested files is optimal.
