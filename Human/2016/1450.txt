Opportunistic Jamming for Enhancing Security: Stochastic Geometry Modeling and Analysis

This correspondence studies the secrecy communication of the single-input single-output multi-eavesdropper (SISOME) channel with multiple single-antenna jammers, where the jammers and eavesdroppers are distributed according to the independent two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). For enhancing the physical layer security, we propose an opportunistic multiple jammer selection scheme, where the jammers whose channel gains to the legitimate receiver less than a threshold, are selected to transmit independent and identically distributed (\emph{i.i.d.}) Gaussian jamming signals to confound the eavesdroppers. We characterize the secrecy throughput achieved by our proposed jammer selection scheme, and show that the secrecy throughput is a quasi-concave function of the selection threshold.
