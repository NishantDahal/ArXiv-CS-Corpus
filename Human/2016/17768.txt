Scalable and Robust Local Community Detection via Adaptive Subgraph Extraction and Diffusions

Local community detection, the problem of identifying a set of relevant nodes nearby a small set of input seed nodes, is an important graph primitive with a wealth of applications and research activity. Recent approaches include using local spectral information, graph diffusions, and random walks to determine a community from input seeds. As networks grow to billions of nodes and exhibit diverse structures, it is important that community detection algorithms are not only efficient, but also robust to different structural features.
  Toward this goal, we explore pre-processing techniques and modifications to existing local methods aimed at improving the scalability and robustness of algorithms related to community detection. Experiments show that our modifications improve both speed and quality of existing methods for locating ground truth communities, and are more robust across graphs and communities of varying sizes, densities, and diameters. Our subgraph extraction method uses adaptively selected PageRank parameters to improve on the recall and runtime of a walk-based pre-processing technique of Li et al. for extracting subgraphs before searching for a community. We then use this technique to enable the first scalable implementation of the recent Local Fiedler method of Mahoney et al. Our experimental evaluation shows our pre-processed version of Local Fiedler, as well as our novel simplification of the LEMON community detection framework of Li et al., offer significant speedups over their predecessors and obtain cluster quality competitive with the state of the art.
