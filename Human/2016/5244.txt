Metrics for Community Analysis: A Survey

Detecting and analyzing dense groups or communities from social and information networks has attracted immense attention over last one decade due to its enormous applicability in different domains. Community detection is an ill-defined problem, as the nature of the communities is not known in advance. The problem has turned out to be even complicated due to the fact that communities emerge in the network in various forms - disjoint, overlapping, hierarchical etc. Various heuristics have been proposed depending upon the application in hand. All these heuristics have been materialized in the form of new metrics, which in most cases are used as optimization functions for detecting the community structure, or provide an indication of the goodness of detected communities during evaluation. There arises a need for an organized and detailed survey of the metrics proposed with respect to community detection and evaluation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive and structured overview of the start-of-the-art metrics used for the detection and the evaluation of community structure. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world networks to present a comparative analysis of these metrics in measuring the goodness of the underlying community structure.
