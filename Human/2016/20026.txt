On the Capacity of Discrete-Time Laguerre Channel

In this paper, new upper and lower bounds are proposed for the capacity of discrete-time Laguerre channel. Laguerre behavior is used to model various types of optical systems and networks such as optical amplifiers, short distance visible light communication systems with direct detection and coherent code division multiple access (CDMA) networks. Bounds are derived for short distance visible light communication systems and coherent CDMA networks. These bounds are separated in three main cases: when both average and peak power constraints are imposed, when peak power constraint is inactive and when only peak power constraint is active.
