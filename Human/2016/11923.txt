Minimizing Outage Probability by Exploiting CSI in Wireless Powered Cooperative Networks

In this work, we address the relay selection problem for the wireless powered communication networks, where the relays harvest energy from the source radio frequency signals. A single source-destination pair is considered without a direct link. The connecting relay nodes are equipped with storage batteries of infinite size. We assume that the channel state information (CSI) on the source-relay link is available at the relay nodes. Depending on the availability of the CSI on the relay-destination link at the relay node, we propose different relay selection schemes and evaluate the outage probability. The availability of the CSI at the relay node on the relay-destination link considerably improves the performance due to additional flexibility in the relay selection mechanism. We numerically quantify the performance for the proposed schemes and compare the outage probability for fixed and equal number of wireless powered forwarding relays.
