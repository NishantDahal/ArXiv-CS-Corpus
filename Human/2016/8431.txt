Energy Saving of Base Stations Sleep Scheduling for Multi-Hop Vehicular Networks

This paper investigates the energy saving of base station (BS) deployed in a 1-D multi-hop vehicular network with sleep scheduling strategy. We consider cooperative BS scheduling strategy where BSs can switch between sleep and active modes to reduce the average energy consumption utilizing the information of vehicular speeds and locations. Assuming a Poisson distribution of vehicles, we derive an appropriate probability distribution function of distance between two adjacent cluster heads, where a cluster is a maximal set of vehicles in which every two adjacent vehicles can communicate directly when their Euclidean distance is less than or equal to a threshold, known as the communication range of vehicles. Furthermore, the expected value of the sojourn time in the sleep mode and energy saving are obtained. The numerical results show that the sleep scheduling strategy significantly reduces the energy consumption of the base stations.
