Bayesian data assimilation based on a family of outer measures

A flexible representation of uncertainty that remains within the standard framework of probabilistic measure theory is presented along with a study of its properties. This representation relies on a specific type of outer measure that is based on the measure of a supremum, hence combining additive and highly sub-additive components. It is shown that this type of outer measure enables the introduction of intuitive concepts such as pullback and general data assimilation operations.
