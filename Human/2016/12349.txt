Narumi-Katayama Index of Total Transformation Graphs

The Narumi-Katayama index of a graph was introduced in 1984 for representing the carbon skeleton of a saturated hydrocarbons and is defined as the product of degrees of all the vertices of the graph. In this paper, we examine the Narumi-Katayama index of different total transformation graphs.
