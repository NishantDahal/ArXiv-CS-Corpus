Coherent Product Superposition for Downlink Multiuser MIMO

In a two-user broadcast channel where one user has full CSIR and the other has none, a recent result showed that TDMA is strictly suboptimal and a product superposition requiring non-coherent signaling achieves DoF gains under many antenna configurations. This work introduces product superposition in the domain of coherent signaling with pilots, demonstrates the advantages of product superposition in low-SNR as well as high-SNR, and establishes DoF gains in a wider set of receiver antenna configurations. Two classes of decoders, with and without interference cancellation, are studied. Achievable rates are established by analysis and illustrated by simulations.
