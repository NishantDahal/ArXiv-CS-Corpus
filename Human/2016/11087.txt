Amplify-and-Forward Full-Duplex Relay with Power Splitting-Based SWIPT

This paper proposes a virtual harvest-transmit model and a harvest-transmit-store model for amplify-and-forward full-duplex relay (FDR) networks with power splitting-based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. The relay node employs a battery group consisting of two rechargeable batteries. By switching periodically between two batteries for charging and discharging in two consecutive time slots of each transmission block, all the harvested energy in each block has been applied for full duplex transmission in the virtual harvest-transmit model. By employing energy scheduling, the relay node switches among the harvesting, relaying, harvesting-relaying, and idle behaviors at a block level, so that a part of the harvested energy in a block can be scheduled for future usage in the harvest-transmit-store model. A greedy switching policy is designed to implement the harvest-transmit-store model, where the FDR node transmits when its residual energy ensures decoding at the destination. Numerical results verify the outage performance of the proposed schemes.
