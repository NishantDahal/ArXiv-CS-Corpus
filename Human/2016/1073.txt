Finding structure in data using multivariate tree boosting

Technology and collaboration enable dramatic increases in the size of psychological and psychiatric data collections, but finding structure in these large data sets with many collected variables is challenging. Decision tree ensembles like random forests (Strobl, Malley, and Tutz, 2009) are a useful tool for finding structure, but are difficult to interpret with multiple outcome variables which are often of interest in psychology. To find and interpret structure in data sets with multiple outcomes and many predictors (possibly exceeding the sample size), we introduce a multivariate extension to a decision tree ensemble method called Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (Friedman, 2001). Our method, multivariate tree boosting, can be used for identifying important predictors, detecting predictors with non-linear effects and interactions without specification of such effects, and for identifying predictors that cause two or more outcome variables to covary without parametric assumptions. We provide the R package 'mvtboost' to estimate, tune, and interpret the resulting model, which extends the implementation of univariate boosting in the R package 'gbm' (Ridgeway, 2013) to continuous, multivariate outcomes. To illustrate the approach, we analyze predictors of psychological well-being (Ryff and Keyes, 1995). Simulations verify that our approach identifies predictors with non-linear effects and achieves high prediction accuracy, exceeding or matching the performance of (penalized) multivariate multiple regression and multivariate decision trees over a wide range of conditions.
