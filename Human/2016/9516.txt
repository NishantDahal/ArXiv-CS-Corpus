Decentralized Control of Three-Dimensional Mobile Robotic Sensor Networks

Decentralized control of mobile robotic sensor networks is a fundamental problem in robotics that has attracted intensive research in recent decades. Most of the existing works dealt with two-dimensional spaces. This report is concerned with the problem of decentralized self-deployment of mobile robotic sensor networks in three-dimensional environments. The first part of the report investigates the problem of complete sensing coverage in three-dimensional spaces. We propose a decentralized random algorithm to drive mobile robotic sensors on the vertices of a truncated octahedral grid for complete sensing coverage of a bounded 3D area. In the second part, we present a distributed random algorithm for search in bounded three-dimensional environments. Third, we study the problem of locating static and mobile targets in a bounded 3D space by a network of mobile robotic sensors. We introduce a novel decentralized bio-inspired random search algorithm for finding static and mobile objects in 3D areas. This algorithm combines the Levy flight random search mechanism with a 3D covering grid. This report studies the problem of 3D formation building in 3D spaces by a network of mobile robotic sensors. Decentralized consensus-based control law for the multi-robot system which results in forming a given geometric configuration from any initial positions in 3D environments is proposed. Convergence of the mobile robotic sensors to the given configurations are shown by extensive simulations. Moreover, a mathematically rigorous proof of convergence of the proposed algorithms to the given configurations are given.
