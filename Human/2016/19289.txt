Robust Learning with Kernel Mean p-Power Error Loss

Correntropy is a second order statistical measure in kernel space, which has been successfully applied in robust learning and signal processing. In this paper, we define a nonsecond order statistical measure in kernel space, called the kernel mean-p power error (KMPE), including the correntropic loss (CLoss) as a special case. Some basic properties of KMPE are presented. In particular, we apply the KMPE to extreme learning machine (ELM) and principal component analysis (PCA), and develop two robust learning algorithms, namely ELM-KMPE and PCA-KMPE. Experimental results on synthetic and benchmark data show that the developed algorithms can achieve consistently better performance when compared with some existing methods.
