Grounded Lexicon Acquisition - Case Studies in Spatial Language

This paper discusses grounded acquisition experiments of increasing complexity. Humanoid robots acquire English spatial lexicons from robot tutors. We identify how various spatial language systems, such as projective, absolute and proximal can be learned. The proposed learning mechanisms do not rely on direct meaning transfer or direct access to world models of interlocutors. Finally, we show how multiple systems can be acquired at the same time.
