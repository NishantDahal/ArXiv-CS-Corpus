Polar Coding for Empirical Coordination of Signals and Actions over Noisy Channels

-We develop a polar coding scheme for empirical coordination in a two-node network with a noisy link in which the input and output signals have to be coordinated with the source and the reconstruction. In the case of non-causal encoding and decoding, we show that polar codes achieve the best known inner bound for the empirical coordination region, provided that a vanishing rate of common randomness is available. This scheme provides a constructive alternative to random binning and coding proofs.
