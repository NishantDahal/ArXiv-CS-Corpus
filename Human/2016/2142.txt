Tumour ROI Estimation in Ultrasound Images via Radon Barcodes in Patients with Locally Advanced Breast Cancer

Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) methods provide a promising framework that can non-invasively and inexpensively be used to predict or assess the tumour response to cancer treatment. The first step in using the QUS methods is to select a region of interest (ROI) inside the tumour in ultrasound images. Manual segmentation, however, is very time consuming and tedious. In this paper, a semi-automated approach will be proposed to roughly localize an ROI for a tumour in ultrasound images of patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Content-based barcodes, a recently introduced binary descriptor based on Radon transform, were used in order to find similar cases and estimate a bounding box surrounding the tumour. Experiments with 33 B-scan images resulted in promising results with an accuracy of $81\%$.
