Distributed Power Control in Interference Channels with QoS Constraints and RF Energy Harvesting: A Game-Theoretic Approach

This paper develops a new distributed power control scheme for a power splitting-based interference channel (IFC) with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The considered IFC consists of multiple source-destination pairs. Each destination splits its received signal into two parts for information decoding and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. Each pair adjusts its transmit power and power splitting ratio to meet both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and EH constraints at its corresponding destination. To characterize rational behaviors of source-destination pairs, we formulate a non-cooperative game for the considered system, where each pair is modeled as a strategic player who aims to minimize its own transmit power under both SINR and EH constraints at the destination. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game. The best response strategy of each player is derived and then the NE can be achieved iteratively. Numerical results show that the proposed game-theoretic approach can achieve a near-optimal performance under various SINR and EH constraints.
