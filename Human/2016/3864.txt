PCF Scheme for Periodic Data Transmission in Smart Metering Network with Cognitive Radio

The next generation Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), with the aid of two-way Smart Metering Network (SMN), is expected to support many advanced functions. In this work, we focus on the application of remote periodic energy consumption reporting, which is a fundamental and significant component of Demand Response and Load Management. In order to support this periodic application with satisfactory communication performance, a well-suited Media Access Control (MAC) protocol needs to be designed. Because the number of Smart Meters (communication nodes) involved in SMN are much larger than that in today's local area networks, the traditional taking-turns MAC protocol, such as Point Coordination Function (PCF) in WiFi is unlikely to perform well. In order to solve this problem, we propose a modified PCF scheme with the combination of Cognitive Radio technology, in which the Smart Meters may use the free channels (white space) to report energy consumption data to the Local Collector when the Primary Users are not occupying the channels. We also conduct comprehensive throughput analysis on the proposed scheme. The numerical results and simulation results through NS-3 show that the PCF scheme with Cognitive Radio significantly outperform the traditional one in a densely populated network like SMN.
