Scala-gopher: CSP-style programming techniques with idiomatic Scala

Cala-gopher is a library-level Scala implementation of communication sequence process constructs: channels, selectors (similar to analogical constructs in Limbo or Go) transputers (similar to Occam proc) and a set of high-level operations on top of akka and SIP-22 async. The framework integrates CSP-style programming into standard Scala concurrency environment via idiomatic API. This allows usage of communication patterns, well known in Go world, but not easy expressable in mainstream scala concurrency frameworks, along with algebraic approach for composing computation builders. Besides, we want to discuss current implementation issues and future directions in the context of evolving of compiler and libraries ecosystem.
