Axiomatization and complexity of modal logic with knowing-what operator on model class K

Standard epistemic logic studies propositional knowledge, yet many other types of knowledge such as "knowing whether", "knowing what", "knowing how" are frequently and widely used in everyday life as well as academic fields. In "Conditionally Knowing What" by Wang and Fan, an axiomatization of the epistemic logic with both regular "knowing that" operator and "conditionally knowing what" operator is given. Then the decidability and complexity of this logic command our study. In this paper, we direct our attention to the arbitrary models instead of epistemic models, thus making things clearer, and then give a axiomatization and a tableau for the modal logic with same operators on arbitrary Kripke models. Given the tableau of this logic, the complexity of the satisfiability problem of this logic is PSPACE-complete.
