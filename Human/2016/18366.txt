End-to-End Architecture Modularisation and Slicing for Next Generation Networks

The journey towards the deployment of next generation networks has recently accelerated, driven by the joint effort of research and standards organisations. Despite this fact, the overall picture is still unclear as prioritization and understanding on several key concepts are not yet agreed by major vendors and network providers. Network Slicing is one of the central topics of the debate, and it is expected to become the key feature of next generation networks, providing the flexibility required to support the variety of 5G use cases and business. Network slices are seen as network operator business, offering the possibility to provide flexible services and even infrastructures to vertical industries and classical Telco customers alike. Another key ingredient is the Architecture Modularisation concept, discussed in this paper and regarded by the authors as the essential design principle to build a flexible network architecture natively supporting Network Slicing. According to this concept, conventional monolithic network functions, often corresponding to physical network elements in the existing systems, are to split into basic building blocks defined with the proper granularity, allowing the definition of different logical architectures (i.e. different Network Slices). In this paper, we further discuss a modularisation methodology as a criteria to define the right set of basic building blocks. Defined through this proposed methodology, the set of basic building blocks and the relating interfacing model are discussed. The paper concludes by proposing a modular 5G network architecture as candidate for next generation network standards.
