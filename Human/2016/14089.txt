Results of a Collective Awareness Platforms Investigation

In this paper we provide two introductory analyses of CAPs, based exclusively on the analysis of documents found on the Internet. The first analysis allowed us to investigate the world of CAPs, in particular for what concerned their status (dead or alive), the scope of those platforms and the typology of users. In order to develop a more accurate model of CAPs, and to understand more deeply the motivation of the users and the type of expected payoff, we analysed those CAPs from the above list that are still alive and we used two models developed for what concerned the virtual community and the collective intelligence.
