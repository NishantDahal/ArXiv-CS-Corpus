Proceedings 7th International Workshop on Formal Methods and Analysis in Software Product Line Engineering

In Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE), a portfolio of similar systems is developed from a shared set of software assets. Claimed benefits of SPLE include reductions in the portfolio size, cost of software development and time to production, as well as improvements in the quality of the delivered systems. Yet, despite these benefits, SPLE is still in the early adoption stage. We believe that automated approaches, tools and techniques that provide better support for SPLE activities can further facilitate its adoption in practice and increase its benefits.
  To promote work in this area, the FMSPLE'16 workshop focuses on automated analysis and formal methods, which can (1) lead to a further increase in development productivity and reduction in maintenance costs associated with management of the SPLE artifacts, and (2) provide proven guarantees for the correctness and quality of the delivered systems.
