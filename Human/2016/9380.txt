BES with FEM: Building Energy Simulation using Finite Element Methods

An overall objective of energy efficiency in the built environment is to improve building and systems performances in terms of durability, comfort and economics. In order to predict, improve and meet a certain set of performance requirements related to the indoor climate of buildings and the associated energy demand, building energy simulation (BES) tools are indispensable. Due to the rapid development of FEM software and the Multiphysics approaches, it should possible to build and simulate full 3D models of buildings regarding the energy demand. The paper presents a methodology for performing building energy simulation with Comsol. The method was applied to an international test box experiment. The results showed an almost perfect agreement between the used BES model and Comsol. These preliminary results confirm the great opportunities to use FEM related software for building energy performance simulation.
