Facility Leasing with Penalties

In this paper we study the facility leasing problem with penalties. We present a primal-dual algorithm which is a 3-approximation, based on the algorithm by Nagarajan and Williamson for the facility leasing problem and on the algorithm by Charikar et al. for the facility location problem with penalties.
