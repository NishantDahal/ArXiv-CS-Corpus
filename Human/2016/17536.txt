A randomized polynomial kernelization for Vertex Cover with a smaller parameter

In the Vertex Cover problem we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and an integer $k$ and have to determine whether there is a set $X\subseteq V$ of size at most $k$ such that each edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $X$. The problem can be easily solved in time $O^*(2^k)$, making it fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to $k$. While the fastest known algorithm takes only time $O^*(1.2738^k)$, much stronger improvements have been obtained by studying parameters that are smaller than $k$. Apart from treewidth-related results, the arguably best algorithm for Vertex Cover runs in time $O^*(2.3146^p)$, where $p=k-LP(G)$ is only the excess of the solution size $k$ over the best fractional vertex cover (Lokshtanov et al.\ TALG 2014). Since $p\leq k$ but $k$ cannot be bounded in terms of $p$ alone, this strictly increases the range of tractable instances.
  Recently, Garg and Philip (SODA 2016) greatly contributed to understanding the parameterized complexity of the Vertex Cover problem. They prove that $2LP(G)-MM(G)$ is a lower bound for the vertex cover size of $G$, where $MM(G)$ is the size of a largest matching of $G$, and proceed to study parameter $\ell=k-(2LP(G)-MM(G))$. They give an algorithm of running time $O^*(3^\ell)$, proving that Vertex Cover is FPT in $\ell$. It can be easily observed that $\ell\leq p$ whereas $p$ cannot be bounded in terms of $\ell$ alone. We complement the work of Garg and Philip by proving that Vertex Cover admits a randomized polynomial kernelization in terms of $\ell$, i.e., an efficient preprocessing to size polynomial in $\ell$. This improves over parameter $p=k-LP(G)$ for which this was previously known (Kratsch and Wahlstr√∂m FOCS 2012).
