CNSMO: A Network Services Manager/Orchestrator Tool for Cloud Federated Environments

Application service providers (ASPs) now develop, deploy, and maintain complex computing platforms within multiple cloud infrastructures to improve resilience, responsiveness and elasticity of their applications. On the other hand, complex applications have little control and visibility over network resources, and need to use low-level hacks to extract network properties and prioritize traffic. This biased view, limits tenants flexibility while deploying their applications and prevents them from implementing part of the application logic in the network. In this paper, we propose the CNSMO (CYCLONE Network Services Manager/Orchestrator) tool to bring the innovation at federated cloud environments by bridging these network service capabilities to cloud based services as part of the overall CYCLONE solution. The integration of networking aspects with purely federated clouds, will allow users to request specific infrastructures and manage their dedicated set of coordinated network and IT resources in an easy and transparent way while operating dynamic deployments of distributed applications.
