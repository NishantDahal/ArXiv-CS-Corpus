Secure and Dependable Virtual Network Embedding

One of the fundamental problems in network virtualization is Virtual Network Embedding (VNE). The VNE problem deals with finding an effective mapping of the virtual nodes & links onto the substrate network. The recent advances in network virtualization gave cloud operators the ability to extend their cloud computing offerings with virtual networks. This trend, jointly with the increasing evidence of incidents in cloud facilities demonstrate that security and dependability is becoming a critical factor that should be considered by VNE algorithms. In this abstract we propose a VNE solution that considers security and dependability as first class citizens. The resiliency properties of our solution are enhanced by assuming a multiple cloud provider model.
