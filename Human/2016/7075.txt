Energy-aware Traffic Engineering in Hybrid SDN/IP Backbone Networks

Software Defined Networking (SDN) can effectively improve the performance of traffic engineering and has promising application foreground in backbone networks. Therefore, new energy saving schemes must take SDN into account, which is extremely important considering the rapidly increasing energy consumption from Telecom and ISP networks. At the same time, the introduction of SDN in a current network must be incremental in most cases, for both technical and economic reasons. During this period, operators have to manage hybrid networks, where SDN and traditional protocols coexist. In this paper, we study the energy efficient traffic engineering problem in hybrid SDN/IP networks. We first formulate the mathematic optimization model considering SDN/IP hybrid routing mode. As the problem is NP-hard, we propose the fast heuristic algorithm named HEATE (Hybrid Energy-Aware Traffic Engineering). In our proposed HEATE algorithm, the IP routers perform the shortest path routing using the distribute OSPF link weight optimization. The SDNs perform the multi-path routing with traffic flow splitting by the global SDN controller. The HEATE algorithm finds the optimal setting of OSPF link weight and splitting ratio of SDNs. Thus traffic flow is aggregated onto partial links and the underutilized links can be turned off to save energy. By computer simulation results, we show that our algorithm has a significant improvement in energy efficiency in hybrid SDN/IP networks.
