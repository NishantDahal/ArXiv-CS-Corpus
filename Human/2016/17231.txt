Transmission Policies for Interference Management in Full-Duplex D2D Communication

Full-Duplex (FD) wireless and Device-to-Device (D2D) communication are two promising technologies that aspire to enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency of wireless networks, thus fulfilling key requirements of the 5th generation (5G) of mobile networks. Both technologies, however, generate excessive interference, which, if not managed effectively, threatens to compromise system performance. To this direction, we propose two transmission policies that enhance the communication of two interfering FD-enabled D2D pairs, derived from game theory and optimization theory. The game-theoretic policy allows the pairs to choose their transmission modes independently and the optimal policy to maximize their throughput, achieving significant gains when the pairs interfere strongly with each other.
