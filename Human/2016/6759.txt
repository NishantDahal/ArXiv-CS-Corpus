Hardware-Based ADMM-LP Decoding

In this paper we present an FPGA-based implementation of linear programming (LP) decoding. LP decoding frames error correction as an optimization problem. This is in contrast to variants of belief propagation (BP) decoding that view error correction as a problem of graphical inference. There are many advantages to taking the optimization perspective: convergence guarantees, improved performance in certain regimes, and a methodology for incorporating the latest developments in optimization techniques. However, LP decoding, when implemented with standard LP solvers, does not easily scale to the blocklengths of modern error-correction codes. In earlier work, we showed that by drawing on decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we could build an LP decoding solver that was competitive with BP, both in terms of performance and speed. We also observed empirically that LP decoders have much better high-SNR performance in the "error floor" regime, a trait of particular relevance to optical transport and storage applications. While our previous implementation was in floating point, in this paper we report initial results of a fixed-point, hardware-based realization of our ADMM-LP decoder.
