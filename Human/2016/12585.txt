Holophrasm: a neural Automated Theorem Prover for higher-order logic

I propose a system for Automated Theorem Proving in higher order logic using deep learning and eschewing hand-constructed features. Holophrasm exploits the formalism of the Metamath language and explores partial proof trees using a neural-network-augmented bandit algorithm and a sequence-to-sequence model for action enumeration. The system proves 14% of its test theorems from Metamath's set.mm module.
