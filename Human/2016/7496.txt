Block Shelves for Visual Programming Languages

The blocks editor, such as the editor in Scratch, is widely applied for visual programming languages (VPL) nowadays. Despite it's friendly for non-programmers, it exists three main limitations while displaying block codes: (1) the readability, (2) the program structure, and (3) the re-use. To cope with these issues, we introduce a novel formatting tool, block shelves, into the editor for organizing blocks. A user could utilize shelves to constitute a user-defined structure for the VPL projects. Based on the experiment results, block shelves improves the block code navigating and searching significantly. Besides, for achieving code re-use, users could use shelf export/import to share/re-use their block codes between projects in the file format of eXtensible Markup Language (xml.) All functions were demonstrated on MIT App inventor 2, while all modifications were made in Google Blockly.
