Knowledge Ratings in MetaboLights

This technical report presents an evaluation of the ontology annotations in the metadata of a subset of entries of MetaboLights, a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The work includes a manual analysis of the entries and a comprehensive qualitative evaluation of their annotations, together with the evaluation guide and its rationale, that was defined and followed. The approach was also implemented as a software script that given a MetaboLights entry returns a quantitative evaluation of the quality of its annotations (available on request).
