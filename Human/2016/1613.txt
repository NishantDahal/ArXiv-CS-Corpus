Synthesis of fast multiplication algorithms for arbitrary tensors

A method of fast linear transform algorithm synthesis for an arbitrary tensor, matrix, or vector is proposed. The method is based on factorization of a tensor and using the factors for building computational structures performing fast tensor - vector multiplication on a computer or dedicated hardware platform.
