Large Scale Business Discovery from Street Level Imagery

Search with local intent is becoming increasingly useful due to the popularity of the mobile device. The creation and maintenance of accurate listings of local businesses worldwide is time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically discover businesses that are visible on street level imagery. Precise business store front detection enables accurate geo-location of businesses, and further provides input for business categorization, listing generation, etc. The large variety of business categories in different countries makes this a very challenging problem. Moreover, manual annotation is prohibitive due to the scale of this problem. We propose the use of a MultiBox based approach that takes input image pixels and directly outputs store front bounding boxes. This end-to-end learning approach instead preempts the need for hand modeling either the proposal generation phase or the post-processing phase, leveraging large labelled training datasets. We demonstrate our approach outperforms the state of the art detection techniques with a large margin in terms of performance and run-time efficiency. In the evaluation, we show this approach achieves human accuracy in the low-recall settings. We also provide an end-to-end evaluation of business discovery in the real world.
