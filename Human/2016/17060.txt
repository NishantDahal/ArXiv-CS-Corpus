Spontaneous Proximity Clouds: Making Mobile Devices to Collaborate for Resource and Data Sharing

The base motivation of Mobile Cloud Computing was empowering mobile devices by application offloading onto powerful cloud resources. However, this goal can't entirely be reached because of the high offloading cost imposed by the long physical distance between the mobile device and the cloud. To address this issue, we propose an application offloading onto a nearby mobile cloud composed of the mobile devices in the vicinity-a Spontaneous Proximity Cloud. We introduce our proposed dynamic, ant-inspired, bi-objective offloading middleware-ACOMMA, and explain its extension to perform a close mobile application offloading. With the learning-based offloading decision-making process of ACOMMA, combined to the collaborative resource sharing, the mobile devices can cooperate for decision cache sharing. We evaluate the performance of ACOMMA in collaborative mode with real benchmarks Face Recognition and Monte-Carlo algorithms-and achieve 50% execution time gain.
