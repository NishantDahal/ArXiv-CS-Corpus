Detector Based Radio Tomographic Imaging

Received signal strength based radio tomographic imaging is a popular device-free indoor localization method which reconstructs the spatial loss field of the environment using measurements from a dense wireless network. Existing methods solve an associated inverse problem using algebraic or compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms. We propose an alternative imaging method that reconstructs spatial field of occupancy using a back-projection based reconstruction algorithm. The introduced system has the following advantages over the other imaging based methods: i.) significantly lower computational complexity such that no floating point multiplication is required; ii.) each link's measured data is compressed to a single bit, providing improved scalability; iii.) physically significant and repeatable parameters. The proposed method is validated using measurement data. Results show that the proposed method achieves the above advantages without loss of accuracy compared to the other available methods.
