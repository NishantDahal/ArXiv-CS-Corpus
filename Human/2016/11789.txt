Probabilistically Robust SWIPT for Secrecy MISOME Systems

This paper considers simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink system consisting of one multi-antenna transmitter, one single-antenna information receiver (IR), multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers (Eves) and multiple single-antenna energy-harvesting receivers (ERs). The main objective is to keep the probability of the legitimate user's achievable secrecy rate outage as well as the ERs' harvested energy outage caused by channel state information (CSI) uncertainties below some prescribed thresholds. As is well known, the secrecy rate outage constraints present a significant analytical and computational challenge. Incorporating the energy harvesting (EH) outage constraints only intensifies that challenge. In this paper, we address this challenging issue using convex restriction approaches which are then proved to yield rank-one optimal beamforming solutions. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.
