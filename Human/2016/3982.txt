Chromatic number of ordered graphs with forbidden ordered subgraphs

It is well-known that the graphs not containing a given graph H as a subgraph have bounded chromatic number if and only if H is acyclic. Here we consider ordered graphs, i.e., graphs with a linear ordering on their vertex set, and the function f(H) = sup{chi(G) | G in Forb(H)} where Forb(H) denotes the set of all ordered graphs that do not contain a copy of H. If H contains a cycle, then as in the case of unordered graphs, f(H) is infinity. However, in contrast to the unordered graphs, we describe an infinite family of ordered forests H with infinite f(H). An ordered graph is crossing if there are two edges uv and u'v' with u < u' < v < v'. For connected crossing ordered graphs H we reduce the problem of determining whether f(H) is finite to a family of so-called monotonically alternating trees. For non-crossing H we prove that f(H) is finite if and only if H is acyclic and does not contain a copy of any of the five special ordered forests on four or five vertices, which we call bonnets. For such forests H, we show that f(H) <= 2^|V(H)| and that f(H) <= 2|V(H)|-3 if H is connected.
