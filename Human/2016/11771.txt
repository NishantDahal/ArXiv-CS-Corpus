Implementation of Electrical Feedback Technologies in 5 Households in Ankara Turkey

Most people do not know how much energy they are spending for different purposes and also they are unaware of potential electrical consumption reduction level they could make by changing their consumption behaviors or investing in new efficient technology products. Providing electrical consumption information to household and make the consumption information tangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in households. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on electrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy turning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is possible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in order to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the knowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities. Monitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption and comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized. Households received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral change associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It is also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption display have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in households. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1, house 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that further attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying different type of monitor designs and implication of special designed stimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with their current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time periods in order to analyze and try to reveal specific time periods for specific consumption behaviors.
