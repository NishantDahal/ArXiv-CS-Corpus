Multiuser Resource Allocation for Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading

Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) offloads intensive mobile computation to clouds located at the edges of cellular networks. Thereby, MECO is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we consider resource allocation in a MECO system comprising multiple users that time share a single edge cloud and have different computation loads. The optimal resource allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for minimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under constraint on computation latency and for both the cases of infinite and finite edge cloud computation capacities. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based structure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields priorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing energy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Computing the threshold requires iterative computation. To reduce the complexity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is proposed and shown by simulation to have close-to-optimal performance.
