Ordering Unicyclic Graphs with Respect to F-index

F-index of a graph is the sum of the cube of the degrees of the vertices. In this paper, we investigate the F-indices of unicyclic graphs by introducing some transformation, and characterize the unicyclic graphs with the first five largest F-indices and the unicyclic graphs with the first two smallest F-indices, respectively.
