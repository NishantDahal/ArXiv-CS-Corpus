MIMO Architectures for Efficient Communication in Space

The characteristics of a space-to-space multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) communication channel that distinguish it from terrestrial MIMO communication channels are summarized and discussed primarily from an information-theoretic viewpoint. The implications of these characteristics for the design and application of future space-based communication systems are also discussed, and it is shown that in general, either energy-efficient or spectrally-efficient communication in space can only be achieved using a distributed MIMO architecture.
