On the Number of Cycles in a Graph

There is a sizable literature on investigating the minimum and maximum numbers of cycles in a class of graphs. However, the answer is known only for special classes. This paper presents a result on the smallest number of cycles in hamiltonian 3-connected cubic graphs. Further, it describes a proof technique that could improve an upper bound of the largest number of cycles in a hamiltonian graph.
