Studies on Brutal Contraction and Severe Withdrawal: Preliminary Report

In this paper we study the class of brutal base contractions that are based on a bounded ensconcement and also the class of severe withdrawals which are based on bounded epistemic entrenchment relations that are defined by means of bounded ensconcements (using the procedure proposed by Mary-Anne Williams). We present axiomatic characterizations for each one of those classes of functions and investigate the interrelation among them.
