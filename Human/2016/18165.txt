EpistAid: Interactive Interface for Document Filtering in Evidence-based Health Care

Evidence-based health care (EBHC) is an important practice of medicine which attempts to provide systematic scientific evidence to answer clinical questions. In this context, Epistemonikos (www.epistemonikos.org) is one of the first and most important online systems in the field, providing an interface that supports users on searching and filtering scientific articles for practicing EBHC. The system nowadays requires a large amount of expert human effort, where close to 500 physicians manually curate articles to be utilized in the platform. In order to scale up the large and continuous amount of data to keep the system updated, we introduce EpistAid, an interactive intelligent interface which supports clinicians in the process of curating documents for Epistemonikos within lists of papers called evidence matrices. We introduce the characteristics, design and algorithms of our solution, as well as a prototype implementation and a case study to show how our solution addresses the information overload problem in this area.
