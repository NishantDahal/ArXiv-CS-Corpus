Connectivity Scaling Laws in Wireless Networks

We present scaling laws that dictate both local and global connectivity properties of bounded wireless networks. These laws are defined with respect to the key system parameters of per-node transmit power and the number of antennas exploited for diversity coding and/or beamforming at each node. We demonstrate that the local probability of connectivity scales like $\mathcal{O}(z^\mathcal C)$ in these parameters, where $\mathcal C$ is the ratio of the dimension of the network domain to the path loss exponent, thus enabling efficient boundary effect mitigation and network topology control.
