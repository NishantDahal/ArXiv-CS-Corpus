Multi-class classification: mirror descent approach

We consider the problem of multi-class classification and a stochastic opti- mization approach to it. We derive risk bounds for stochastic mirror descent algorithm and provide examples of set geometries that make the use of the algorithm efficient in terms of error in k.
