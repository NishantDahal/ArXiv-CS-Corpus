A Performance Evaluation of Container Technologies on Internet of Things Devices

The use of virtualization technologies in different contexts - such as Cloud Environments, Internet of Things (IoT), Software Defined Networking (SDN) - has rapidly increased during the last years. Among these technologies, container-based solutions own characteristics for deploying distributed and lightweight applications. This paper presents a performance evaluation of container technologies on constrained devices, in this case, on Raspberry Pi. The study shows that, overall, the overhead added by containers is negligible.
