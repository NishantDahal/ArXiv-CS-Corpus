On Optimal Family of Codes for Archival DNA Storage

DNA based storage systems received attention by many researchers. This includes archival and re-writable random access DNA based storage systems. In this work, we have developed an efficient technique to encode the data into DNA sequence by using non-linear families of ternary codes. In particular, we proposes an algorithm to encode data into DNA with high information storage density and better error correction using a sub code of Golay code. Theoretically, 115 exabytes (EB) data can be stored in one gram of DNA by our method.
