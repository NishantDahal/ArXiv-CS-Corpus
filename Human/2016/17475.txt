Identity Testing for +-Regular Noncommutative Arithmetic Circuits

An efficient randomized polynomial identity test for noncommutative polynomials given by noncommutative arithmetic circuits remains an open problem. The main bottleneck to applying known techniques is that a noncommutative circuit of size $s$ can compute a polynomial of degree exponential in $s$ with a double-exponential number of nonzero monomials. In this paper, we report some progress by dealing with two natural subcases (both allow for polynomials of exponential degree and a double exponential number of monomials): (1) We consider \emph{$+$-regular} noncommutative circuits: these are homogeneous noncommutative circuits with the additional property that all the $+$-gates are layered, and in each $+$-layer all gates have the same syntactic degree. We give a \emph{white-box} polynomial-time deterministic polynomial identity test for such circuits. Our algorithm combines some new structural results for $+$-regular circuits with known results for noncommutative ABP identity testing [RS05PIT], rank bound of commutative depth three identities [SS13], and equivalence testing problem for words [Loh15, MSU97, Pla94]. (2) Next, we consider $ΣΠ^*Σ$ noncommutative circuits: these are noncommutative circuits with layered $+$-gates such that there are only two layers of $+$-gates. These $+$-layers are the output $+$-gate and linear forms at the bottom layer; between the $+$-layers the circuit could have any number of $\times$ gates. We given an efficient randomized \emph{black-box} identity testing problem for $ΣΠ^*Σ$ circuits. In particular, we show if $f\in F<Z>$ is a nonzero noncommutative polynomial computed by a $ΣΠ^*Σ$ circuit of size $s$, then $f$ cannot be a polynomial identity for the matrix algebra $\mathbb{M}_s(F)$, where the field $F$ is a sufficiently large extension of $F$ depending on the degree of $f$.
