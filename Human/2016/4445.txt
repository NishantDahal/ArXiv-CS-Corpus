Anisotropic Mesh Adaptation for Image Representation

Triangular meshes have gained much interest in image representation and have been widely used in image processing. This paper introduces a framework of anisotropic mesh adaptation (AMA) methods to image representation and proposes a GPRAMA method that is based on AMA and greedy-point removal (GPR) scheme. Different than many other methods that triangulate sample points to form the mesh, the AMA methods start directly with a triangular mesh and then adapt the mesh based on a user-defined metric tensor to represent the image. The AMA methods have clear mathematical framework and provides flexibility for both image representation and image reconstruction. A mesh patching technique is developed for the implementation of the GPRAMA method, which leads to an improved version of the popular GPRFS-ED method. The GPRAMA method can achieve better quality than the GPRFS-ED method but with lower computational cost.
