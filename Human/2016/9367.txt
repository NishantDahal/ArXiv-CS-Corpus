A Conceptual Framework to Assess the Effectiveness of Rubric Tool

Rubrics are being used in a wide variety of disciplines in higher education to evaluate assessments and provide feedback to students. Rubrics are traditionally implemented as paper-based table format to grade assessments and provide feedback. The advancement of technology has integrated Rubric Tool into Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Blackboard to facilitate online marking. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of Rubric Tool. We propose an integrated conceptual framework using various theories from extant literature to assess the effectiveness of Rubric Tool. Further, this framework has been applied in an undergraduate course at the Asian campus of an Australian International University. This is a research in progress paper which adds to the literature on integrating information systems theory, learning theory, political philosophy and communication theory to examine the effectiveness of Rubric Tool in student learning.
