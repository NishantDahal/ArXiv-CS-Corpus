On the Limits of Coexisting Coverage and Capacity in Multi-RAT Heterogeneous Networks

This paper devises a general modeling and analyzing framework for a heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) in which several wireless subnetworks coexist and use multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs). The coexisting coverage and network capacity in such a multi-RAT HetNet are hardly investigated in prior works. To characterize the coexisting interactions in a multi-RAT HetNet, in this paper we consider a HetNet consisting of K-tier APs and two different RATs, RAT-L and RAT-U, are adopted in the HetNet. RAT-L is adopted by the access points (APs) in the first K-1 tiers and APs in the Kth tier only use RAT-U. Both noncrossing-RAT and crossing-RAT user association scenarios are considered. In each scenario, the void probability and channel access probability of the APs in each tier are first found and then the tight lower bounds and their lowest limits on the proposed coexisting coverage and network capacity are derived. We show that multi-RAT networks in general can achieve higher link coverage and capacity by using opportunistic CSMA/CA that avoids/alleviates severe interfering between all coexisting APs. Also, crossing-RAT user association is shown to achieve much higher coexisting coverage and network capacity than noncrossing-RAT user association. Finally, numerical simulations for the LTE-U and WiFi networks coexisting in the HetNet validate our findings.
