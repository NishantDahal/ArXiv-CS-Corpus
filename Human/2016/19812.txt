Blind Identification of SM and Alamouti STBC-OFDM Signals

This paper proposes an efficient identification algorithm for spatial multiplexing (SM) and Alamouti (AL) coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals. The cross-correlation between the received signals from different antennas is exploited to provide a discriminating feature to identify SM-OFDM and AL-OFDM signals. The proposed algorithm requires neither estimation of the channel coefficients and noise power, nor the modulation of the transmitted signal. Moreover, it does not need space-time block code (STBC) or OFDM block synchronization. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive simulation experiments in the presence of diverse transmission impairments, such as time and frequency offsets, Doppler frequency, and spatially correlated fading.
