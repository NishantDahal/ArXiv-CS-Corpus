Panel dataset description for econometric analysis of the ISP-OTT relationship in the years 2008-2013

The latest technological advancements in the telecommunications domain (e.g., widespread adoption of mobile devices, introduction of 5G wireless communications, etc.) have brought new stakeholders into the spotlight. More specifically, Over-the-Top (OTT) providers have recently appeared, offering their services over the existing deployed telecommunication networks. The entry of the new players has changed the dynamics in the domain, as it creates conflicting situations with the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), who traditionally dominate the area, motivating the necessity for novel analytical studies for this relationship. However, despite the importance of accessing real observational data, there is no database with the aggregate information that can serve as a solid base for this research. To that end, this document provides a detailed summary report for financial and statistic data for the period 2008-2013 that can be exploited for realistic econometric models that will provide useful insights on this topic. The document summarizes data from various sources with regard to the ISP revenues and Capital Expenditures (CAPEX), the OTT revenues, the Internet penetration and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), taking into account three big OTT providers (i.e., Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp) and ten major ISPs that operate in seven different countries.
