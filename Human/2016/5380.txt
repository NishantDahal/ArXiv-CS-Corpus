Study of Distributed Spectrum Estimation Using Alternating Mixed Discrete-Continuous Adaptation

This paper proposes a distributed alternating mixed discrete-continuous (DAMDC) algorithm to approach the oracle algorithm based on the diffusion strategy for parameter and spectrum estimation over sensor networks. A least mean squares (LMS) type algorithm that obtains the oracle matrix adaptively is developed and compared with the existing sparsity-aware and conventional algorithms. The proposed algorithm exhibits improved performance in terms of mean square deviation and power spectrum estimation accuracy. Numerical results show that the DAMDC algorithm achieves excellent performance.
