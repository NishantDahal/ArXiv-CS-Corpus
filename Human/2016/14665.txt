A short review and primer on electroencephalography in human computer interaction applications

The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Methods to study central nervous system (CNS) are usually expensive and laborious. However, electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most affordable and ambulatory methodologies for CNS research. It is in use in various clinical studies and have been broadly studied over decades. Despite that the recorded EEG signals are quite prone to noise and environmental factors it is the most widely used method in study of brain-computer interaction (BCI). Here we discuss briefly on various aspects of the recorded signals, their interpretation, and usage in the field of interaction studies.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
