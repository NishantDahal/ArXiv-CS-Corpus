Mobile Privacy-Preserving Crowdsourced Data Collection in the Smart City

Smart cities rely on dynamic and real-time data to enable smart urban applications such as intelligent transport and epidemics detection. However, the streaming of big data from IoT devices, especially from mobile platforms like pedestrians and cars, raises significant privacy concerns.
  Future autonomous vehicles will generate, collect and consume significant volumes of data to be utilized in delivering safe and efficient transportation solutions. The sensed data will, inherently, contain personally identifiable and attributable information - both external (other vehicles, environmental) and internal (driver, passengers, devices).
  The autonomous vehicles are connected to the infrastructure cloud (e.g., Amazon), the edge cloud, and also the mobile cloud (vehicle to vehicle). Clearly these different entities must co-operate and interoperate in a timely fashion when routing and transferring the highly dynamic data. In order to maximise the availability and utility of the sensed data, stakeholders must have confidence that the data they transmit, receive, aggregate and reason on is appropriately secured and protected throughout. There are many different metaphors for providing end-to-end security for data exchanges, but they commonly require a management and control sidechannel.
  This work proposes a scalable smart city privacy-preserving architecture named Authorized Analytics that enables each node (e.g. vehicle) to divulge (contextually) local privatised data. Authorized Analytics is shown to scale gracefully to IoT scope deployments.
