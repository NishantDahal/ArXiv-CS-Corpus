RNA as a Nanoscale Data Transmission Medium: Error Analysis

RNA can be used as a high-density medium for data storage and transmission; however, an important RNA process -- replication -- is noisy. This paper presents an error analysis for RNA as a data transmission medium, analyzing how deletion errors increase in a collection of replicated DNA strands over time.
