Report on Dirty Paper Coding Estimation with multidimensional lattices

In this report we include some derivations on a channel estimation method based on the use of Dirty Paper Coding. Specifically, we analyze the proposed method, named Dirty Paper-based Channel Estimation (DPCE), when the considered codebooks are high-dimensional lattices.
