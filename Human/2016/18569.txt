Query Clustering using Segment Specific Context Embeddings

This paper presents a novel query clustering approach to capture the broad interest areas of users querying search engines. We make use of recent advances in NLP - word2vec and extend it to get query2vec, vector representations of queries, based on query contexts, obtained from the top search results for the query and use a highly scalable Divide & Merge clustering algorithm on top of the query vectors, to get the clusters. We have tried this approach on a variety of segments, including Retail, Travel, Health, Phones and found the clusters to be effective in discovering user's interest areas which have high monetization potential.
