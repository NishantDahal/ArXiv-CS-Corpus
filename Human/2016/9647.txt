All binomial identities are orderable

The main result of this paper is to show that all binomial identities are orderable. This is a natural statement in the combinatorial theory of finite sets, which can also be applied in distributed computing to derive new strong bounds on the round complexity of the weak symmetry breaking task.
  Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a fundamental binomial identity and find an infinite family of values, other than the prime powers, for which no fundamental binomial identity can exist.
