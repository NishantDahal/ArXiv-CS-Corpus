Transmit Beamforming for Interference Exploitation in the Underlay Cognitive Radio Z-channel

This paper introduces novel transmit beamforming approaches for the cognitive radio (CR) Z-channel. The proposed transmission schemes exploit non-causal information about the interference at the SBS to re-design the CR beamforming optimization problem. This is done with the objective to improve the quality of service (QoS) of secondary users by taking advantage of constructive interference in the secondary link. The beamformers are designed to minimize the worst secondary user's symbol error probability (SEP) under constraints on the instantaneous total transmit power, and the power of the instantaneous interference in the primary link. The problem is formulated as a bivariate probabilistic constrained programming (BPCP) problem. We show that the BPCP problem can be transformed for practical SEPs into a convex optimization problem that can be solved, e.g., by the barrier method. A computationally efficient tight approximate approach is also developed to compute the near-optimal solutions. Simulation results and analysis show that the average computational complexity per downlink frame of the proposed approximate problem is comparable to that of the conventional CR downlink beamforming problem. In addition, both the proposed methods offer significant performance improvements as compared to the conventional CR downlink beamforming, while guaranteeing the QoS of primary users on an instantaneous basis, in contrast to the average QoS guarantees of conventional beamformers.
