Improved Non-Malleable Extractors, Non-Malleable Codes and Independent Source Extractors

In this paper we give improved constructions of several central objects in the literature of randomness extraction and tamper-resilient cryptography. Our main results are:
  (1) An explicit seeded non-malleable extractor with error $ε$ and seed length $d=O(\log n)+O(\log(1/ε)\log \log (1/ε))$, that supports min-entropy $k=Ω(d)$ and outputs $Ω(k)$ bits. Combined with the protocol in \cite{DW09}, this gives a two round privacy amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss in the presence of an active adversary, for all security parameters up to $Ω(k/\log k)$.
  (2) An explicit non-malleable two-source extractor for min-entropy $k \geq (1-γ)n$, some constant $γ>0$, that outputs $Ω(k)$ bits with error $2^{-Ω(n/\log n)}$. Combined with the connection in \cite{CG14b} this gives a non-malleable code in the two-split-state model with relative rate $Ω(1/\log n)$. This exponentially improves previous constructions, all of which only achieve rate $n^{-Ω(1)}$.\footnote{The work of Aggarwal et. al \cite{ADKO15} had a construction which "achieves" constant rate, but recently the author found an error in their proof.}
  (3)A two-source extractor for min-entropy $O(\log n \log \log n)$, which also implies a $K$-Ramsey graph on $N$ vertices with $K=(\log N)^{O(\log \log \log N)}$. We also obtain a seeded non-malleable $9$-source extractor with optimal seed length, which in turn gives a $10$-source extractor for min-entropy $O(\log n)$. Previously the best known extractor for such min-entropy requires $O(\log \log n)$ sources \cite{CohL16}.
  Independent of our work, Cohen \cite{Cohen16} obtained similar results to (1) and the two-source extractor, except the dependence on $ε$ is $\log(1/ε)(\log \log (1/ε))^{O(1)}$ and the two-source extractor requires min-entropy $\log n (\log \log n)^{O(1)}$.
