Acyclic chromatic index of triangle-free 1-planar graphs

An acyclic edge coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper edge coloring such that every cycle is colored with at least three colors. The acyclic chromatic index $\chiup_{a}'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the least number of colors in an acyclic edge coloring of $G$. It was conjectured that $\chiup'_{a}(G)\leq Δ(G) + 2$ for any simple graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ(G)$. A graph is {\em $1$-planar} if it can be drawn on the plane such that every edge is crossed by at most one other edge. In this paper, we prove that every triangle-free $1$-planar graph $G$ has an acyclic edge coloring with $Δ(G) + 16$ colors.
