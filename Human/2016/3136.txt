Simulation Platform for Multi Agent Based Manufacturing Control System Based on The Hybrid Agent

Agent based distributed manufacturing control and scheduling systems are subsets of new manufacturing systems. Multi agent systems (MAS) not only drive design and engineering control solutions but also influence flexibility, agility, and re-configurability, which makes MASs a better centralized systems than its traditional counterparts. However, implementation of all MASs in the real factories are timely, also extremely costly. A simulation environment that would allow independent development and testing of the services and business processes of the related manufacturing hardware is needed. This paper presents the design and implementation of a userfriendly simulation platform for multi agent based manufacturing control systems by considering the shop floor level. The proposed simulation platform can simulate the software level of the factory by considering the hardware level of the mentioned factory. An example of the simulation platform is presented for a flexible manufacturing system, which is located in EMU CIM lab.
