LITMUS: An Open Extensible Framework for Benchmarking RDF Data Management Solutions

Developments in the context of Open, Big, and Linked Data have led to an enormous growth of structured data on the Web. To keep up with the pace of efficient consumption and management of the data at this rate, many data Management solutions have been developed for specific tasks and applications. We present LITMUS, a framework for benchmarking data management solutions. LITMUS goes beyond classical storage benchmarking frameworks by allowing for analysing the performance of frameworks across query languages. In this position paper we present the conceptual architecture of LITMUS as well as the considerations that led to this architecture.
