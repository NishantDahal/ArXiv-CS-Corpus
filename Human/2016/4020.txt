Some Proof Derivations and Further Simulation Results for "Semidefinite Relaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for Relay Beamforming Networks"

This is a companion technical report of the main manuscript "Semidefinite Relaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for Relay Beamforming Networks". The report serves to give detailed derivations of Lemma 1-2 in the main manuscript, which are too long to be included in the latter. In addition, more simulation results are presented to verify the viability of the BF Alamouti AF schemes developed in the main manuscript.
