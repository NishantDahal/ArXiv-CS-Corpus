Command injection attacks, continuations, and the Lambek calculus

This paper shows connections between command injection attacks, continuations, and the Lambek calculus: certain command injections, such as the tautology attack on SQL, are shown to be a form of control effect that can be typed using the Lambek calculus, generalizing the double-negation typing of continuations. Lambek's syntactic calculus is a logic with two implicational connectives taking their arguments from the left and right, respectively. These connectives describe how strings interact with their left and right contexts when building up syntactic structures.  The calculus is a form of propositional logic without structural rules, and so a forerunner of substructural logics like Linear Logic  and Separation Logic.
