Linear Programming Heuristics for the Graph Isomorphism Problem

An isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection between their vertices that preserves the edges. We consider the problem of determining whether two finite undirected weighted graphs are isomorphic, and finding an isomorphism relating them if the answer is positive. In this paper we introduce effective probabilistic linear programming (LP) heuristics to solve the graph isomorphism problem. We motivate our heuristics by showing guarantees under some conditions, and present numerical experiments that show effectiveness of these heuristics in the general case.
