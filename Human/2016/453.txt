Constrained Multi-user Multi-server Max-Min Fair Queuing

In this paper, a multi-user multi-server queuing system is studied in which each user is constrained to get service from a subset of servers. In the studied system, rate allocation in the sense of max-min fairness results in multi-level fair rates. To achieve such fair rates, we propose $CM^4FQ$ algorithm. In this algorithm users are chosen for service on a packet by packet basis. The priority of each user $i$ to be chosen at time $t$ is determined based on a parameter known as service tag (representing the amount of work counted for user $i$ till time $t$). Hence, a free server will choose to serve an eligible user with the minimum service tag. Based on such simple selection criterion, $CM^4FQ$ aims at guaranteed fair throughput for each demanding user without explicit knowledge of each server service rate. We argue that $CM^4FQ$ can be applied in a variety of practical queuing systems specially in mobile cloud computing architecture.
