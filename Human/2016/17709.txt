A Prudent-Precedence Concurrency Control Protocol for High Data Contention Database Enviornments

In this paper, we propose a concurrency control protocol, called the Prudent-Precedence Concurrency Control (PPCC) protocol, for high data contention database environments. PPCC is prudently more aggressive in permitting more serializable schedules than two-phase locking. It maintains a restricted precedence among conflicting transactions and commits the transactions according to the serialization order established in the executions. A detailed simulation model has been constructed and extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the two-phase locking and optimistic concurrency control in all ranges of system workload.
