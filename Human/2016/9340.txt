Leveraging ERP Implementation to Create Intellectual Capital: the Role of Organizational Learning Capability

The extent to which enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems deliver value for organizations has been debated. In this study, we argue that the presence of appropriate organizational resources is essential for capturing the potential of ERP implementation. We investigate the relationship between ERP implementation and two organizational resources, specifically, Intellectual Capital (IC) and Organizational Learning Capability (OLC) to enrich the understanding of the way the value of ERP implementations can be realized. A sample of 226 manufacturing firms in Vietnam was surveyed to test the theoretical model. Structural equation modelling with partial least square method and two approaches for moderation analysis were used to analyze the data. The results indicate that ERP implementation scope has a positive impact on intellectual capital (IC). However, firms need to build a certain level of OLC to utilize ERP implementation for the enhancement of IC.
