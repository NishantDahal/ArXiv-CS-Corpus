SEAL's operating manual: a Spatially-bounded Economic Agent-based Lab

This text reports in detail how SEAL, a modeling framework for the economy based on individual agents and firms, works. Thus, it aims to be an usage manual for those wishing to use SEAL or SEAL's results. As a reference work, theoretical and research studies are only cited. SEAL is thought as a Lab that enables the simulation of the economy with spatially bounded microeconomic-based computational agents. Part of the novelty of SEAL comes from the possibility of simulating the economy in space and the instantiation of different public offices, i.e. government institutions, with embedded markets and actual data. SEAL is designed for Public Policy analysis, specifically those related to Public Finance, Taxes and Real Estate.
