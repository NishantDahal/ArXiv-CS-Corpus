Notes on socio-economic transparency mechanisms

Clearly, socio-economic freedom requires some extent of transparency regarding the implications of choices. In this paper, we review some established mechanisms for achieving such transparency, without any claim to completeness, and briefly discuss potential future directions. Our investigation is structured by four "challenges" under which we subsume the various requirements on, and approaches to, socio-economic transparency mechanisms. One main focus is on the inference, i.e., statistical, aspect of such mechanisms.
