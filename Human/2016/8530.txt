Enabling Effective FPGA Debug using Overlays: Opportunities and Challenges

FPGAs are going mainstream. Major companies that were not traditionally FPGA-focused are now seeking ways to exploit the benefits of reconfigurable technology and provide it to their customers. In order to do so, a debug ecosystem that provides for effective visibility into a working design and quick debug turn-around times is essential. Overlays have the opportunity to play a key role in this ecosystem. In this overview paper, we discuss how an overlay fabric that allows the user to rapidly add debug instrumentation to a design can be created and exploited. We discuss the requirements of such an overlay and some of the research challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed. To make our exposition concrete, we use two previously-published examples of overlays that have been developed to implement debug instrumentation.
