An algebraic framework for end-to-end physical-layer network coding

We propose an algebraic setup for end-to-end physical-layer network coding based on submodule transmission. We introduce a distance function between modules, describe how it relates to information loss and errors, and show how to compute it. Then we propose a definition of submodule error-correcting code, and investigate bounds and constructions for such codes.
