Quantum error-correcting codes from Algebraic Geometry codes of Castle type

We study Algebraic Geometry codes producing quantum error-correcting codes by the CSS construction. We pay particular attention to the family of Castle codes. We show that many of the examples known in the literature in fact belong to this family of codes. We systematize these constructions by showing the common theory that underlies all of them.
