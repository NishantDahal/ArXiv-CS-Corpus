The Entity Registry System. From concept to deployment

The entity registry system (ERS) is a decentralized entity registry that can be used to replace the Web as a platform for publishing linked data when the latter is not available. In developing countries, where off-line is the default mode of operation, centralized linked data solutions fail to address the needs of the communities. Although the features are mostly completed, the system is not yet ready for deployment. This project aims to provide extensive tests and scalability investigations that would make it ready for a real scenario.
