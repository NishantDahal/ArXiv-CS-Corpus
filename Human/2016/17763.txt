Leveraging Decoupling in Enabling Energy Aware D2D Communications

Downlink/Uplink decoupling (DUDe) in LTE net- works has caught the attention of researchers as it provides better uplink SINR and reduced power consumption per device due to decoupled connection of a device with the Macro (in downlink) and a small cell (in uplink). These characteristics of DUDe can be exploited to encourage more D2D communications in the network. This paper first proposes a model to estimate decoupling region within which a device is allowed to perform DUDe. Then, it formulates an equation to calculate the total power saved by devices due to decoupling. Finally, the extra area due to decoupling which can be used to enable D2D pairs is calculated. Simulation results are shown based on different simulation scenarios for different objectives for better understanding the idea proposed.
