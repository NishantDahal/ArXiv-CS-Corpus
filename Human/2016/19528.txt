Development of a Real-time Colorectal Tumor Classification System for Narrow-band Imaging zoom-videoendoscopy

Colorectal endoscopy is important for the early detection and treatment of colorectal cancer and is used worldwide. A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that provides an objective measure to endoscopists during colorectal endoscopic examinations would be of great value. In this study, we describe a newly developed CAD system that provides real-time objective measures. Our system captures the video stream from an endoscopic system and transfers it to a desktop computer. The captured video stream is then classified by a pretrained classifier and the results are displayed on a monitor. The experimental results show that our developed system works efficiently in actual endoscopic examinations and is medically significant.
