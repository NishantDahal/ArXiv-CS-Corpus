Robust Beamforming Against Direction-of-Arrival Mismatch Using Subspace-Constrained Diagonal Loading

In this study, a new subspace-constrained diagonal loading (SSC-DL) method is presented for robust beamforming against the issue of a mismatched direction of arrival (DoA), based on an extension to the well known diagonal loading (DL) technique. One important difference of the proposed SSC-DL from conventional DL is that it imposes an additional constraint to restrict the optimal weight vector within a subspace whose basis vectors are determined by a number of angles neighboring to the estimated DoA. Unlike many existing methods which resort to a beamwidth expansion, the weight vector produced by SSC-DL has a relatively small beamwidth around the DoA of the target signal. Yet, the SSC-DL beamformer has a great interference suppression level, thereby achieving an improved overall SINR performance. Simulation results suggest the proposed method has a near-to-optimal SINR performance.
