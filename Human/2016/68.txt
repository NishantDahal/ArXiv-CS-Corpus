Efficient Robust Mean Value Calculation of 1D Features

A robust mean value is often a good alternative to the standard mean value when dealing with data containing many outliers. An efficient method for samples of one-dimensional features and the truncated quadratic error norm is presented and compared to the method of channel averaging (soft histograms).
