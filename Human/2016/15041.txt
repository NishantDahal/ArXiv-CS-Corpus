Understanding Symmetric Smoothing Filters: A Gaussian Mixture Model Perspective

Many patch-based image denoising algorithms can be formulated as applying a smoothing filter to the noisy image. Expressed as matrices, the smoothing filters must be row normalized so that each row sums to unity. Surprisingly, if we apply a column normalization before the row normalization, the performance of the smoothing filter can often be significantly improved. Prior works showed that such performance gain is related to the Sinkhorn-Knopp balancing algorithm, an iterative procedure that symmetrizes a row-stochastic matrix to a doubly-stochastic matrix. However, a complete understanding of the performance gain phenomenon is still lacking.
  In this paper, we study the performance gain phenomenon from a statistical learning perspective. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp is equivalent to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm of learning a Gaussian mixture model of the image patches. By establishing the correspondence between the steps of Sinkhorn-Knopp and the EM algorithm, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the symmetrization process. This observation allows us to develop a new denoising algorithm called Gaussian mixture model symmetric smoothing filter (GSF). GSF is an extension of the Sinkhorn-Knopp and is a generalization of the original smoothing filters. Despite its simple formulation, GSF outperforms many existing smoothing filters and has a similar performance compared to several state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.
