Posting with credibility in Micro-blogging systems using Digital Signatures and Watermarks: A case study on Twitter

Micro-blogs are contemporary broadcasting services for exchanging small elements of content, including video and images. Despite its popularity, micro-blogging is not without issues. So far, various security concerns, such as: privacy and confidentiality of micro-blogging systems have attracted the interest of the scientific community. Nevertheless, in this document we refer to a security issue that is concerned with the posting and circulation of fake messages. With the aim to make micro-blogs a credible source of information, in this work we propose a protocol, as a solution, that can be easily adapted to existing services such as: Twitter and Facebook. With the main keys of the solution being the employment of digital signatures and watermarks, the protocol can serve postings of various types of content. Finally, the solution serves the dual purpose of proofing the fake messages as well as the repudiation of postings.
