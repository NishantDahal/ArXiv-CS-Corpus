LMS Moodle: Distance international education in cooperation of higher education institutions of different countries

The development of international cooperation requires cooperation in the sphere of education. An enhanced sharing of experience in the sphere of practical teaching activities implies the increase of the quality of teaching process and of scientific cooperation. Sharing of experience in educational activities implies understanding among representatives of different nations anywhere in the world. It means that through LSM teaching the principle of social constructivism is realized, when participants together create a narrow culture of common objects and senses. The article presents an example of practical application of electronic media to the process of a real lesson. The article describes the process of teaching students from different countries using the system of LMS MOODLE, beginning with preparing study materials, giving lectures by foreign lecturers, practical tasks and ending with passing an examination. Training has included some full-time students from the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Dagestan and the Republic of Kazakhstan, and has been realized by applying the method of distance learning (LMS).
