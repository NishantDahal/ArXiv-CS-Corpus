On deep holes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes

Determining deep holes is an important topic in decoding Reed-Solomon codes. In a previous paper [8], we showed that the received word $u$ is a deep hole of the standard Reed-Solomon codes $[q-1, k]_q$ if its Lagrange interpolation polynomial is the sum of monomial of degree $q-2$ and a polynomial of degree at most $k-1$. In this paper, we extend this result by giving a new class of deep holes of the generalized Reed-Solomon codes.
