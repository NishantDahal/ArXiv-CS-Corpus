Analysis of Network Coding in a Slotted ALOHA-based Two-Way Relay Network

This paper deals with a two-way relay network (TWRN) based on a slotted ALOHA protocol which utilizes network coding to exchange the packets. We proposed an analytical approach to study the behavior of such networks and the effects of network coding on the throughput, power, and queueing delay of the relay node. In addition, when end nodes are not saturated, our approach enables us to achieve the stability region of the network in different situations. Finally, we carry out some simulation to confirm the validity of the proposed analytical approach.
