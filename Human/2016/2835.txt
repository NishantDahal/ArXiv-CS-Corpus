Information-based measure of nonlocality

Quantum nonlocality concerns correlations among spatially separated systems that cannot be classically explained without post-measurement communication among the parties. Thus, a natural measure of nonlocal correlations is provided by the minimal amount of communication required for classically simulating them. In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal communication cost, which we call nonlocal capacity, for any general nonsignaling correlations. This measure turns out to have an important role in communication complexity and can be used to discriminate between local and nonlocal correlations, as an alternative to the violation of Bell's inequalities.
