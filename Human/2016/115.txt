On weighted Fisher information matrix properties

In this paper, we review Fisher information matrices properties in weighted version and discuss inequalities/bounds on it by using reduced weight functions. In particular, an extended form of the Fisher information inequality previously established in [6] is given. Further, along with generalized De-Bruijn's identity, we provide new interpretation of the concavity for the entropy power.
