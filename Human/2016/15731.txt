Safeguarding Decentralized Wireless Networks Using Full-Duplex Jamming Receivers

In this paper, we study the benefits of full-duplex (FD) receiver jamming in enhancing the physical-layer security of a two-tier decentralized wireless network with each tier deployed with a large number of pairs of a single-antenna transmitter and a multi-antenna receiver. In the underlying tier, the transmitter sends unclassified information, and the receiver works in the halfduplex (HD) mode receiving the desired signal. In the overlaid tier, the transmitter deliveries confidential information in the presence of randomly located eavesdroppers, and the receiver works in the FD mode radiating jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers and receiving the desired signal simultaneously. We provide a comprehensive performance analysis and network design under a stochastic geometry framework. Specifically, we consider the scenarios where each FD receiver uses single- and multi-antenna jamming, and analyze the connection probability and the secrecy outage probability of a typical FD receiver by providing accurate expressions and more tractable approximations for the two metrics. We further determine the optimal deployment of the FD-mode tier in order to maximize networkwide secrecy throughput subject to constraints including the given dual probabilities and the network-wide throughput of the HD-mode tier. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our theoretical findings, and show that network-wide secrecy throughput is significantly improved by properly deploying the FD-mode tier.
