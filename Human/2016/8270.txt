Interpreting extracted rules from ensemble of trees: Application to computer-aided diagnosis of breast MRI

High predictive performance and ease of use and interpretability are important requirements for the applicability of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to human reading studies. We propose a CAD system specifically designed to be more comprehensible to the radiologist reviewing screening breast MRI studies. Multiparametric imaging features are combined to produce a CAD system for differentiating cancerous and non-cancerous lesions. The complete system uses a rule-extraction algorithm to present lesion classification results in an easy to understand graph visualization.
