Robust Max-Min Fairness Energy Harvesting in Secure MISO Cognitive Radio With SWIPT

A multiple-input single-output cognitive radio downlink network is studied with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In this network, a secondary user coexists with multiple primary users and multiple energy harvesting receivers. In order to guarantee secure communication and energy harvesting, the problem of robust secure artificial noise-aided beamforming and power splitting design is investigated under imperfect channel state information. Specifically, the max-min fairness energy harvesting problem is formulated under the bounded channel state information error model. A one-dimensional search algorithm based on ${\cal S}\text{-Procedure} $ is proposed to solve the problem. It is shown that the optimal robust secure beamforming can be achieved. A tradeoff is elucidated between the secrecy rate of the secondary user receiver and the energy harvested by the energy harvesting receivers under a max-min fairness criterion.
