Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Multi-Antenna Two-Tier Cellular Networks

In this paper, we study the key properties of multi-antenna two-tier networks under different system configurations. Based on stochastic geometry, we derive the expressions and approximations for the users' average data rate. Through the more tractable approximations, the theoretical analysis can be greatly simplified. We find that the differences in density and transmit power between two tiers, together with range expansion bias significantly affect the users' data rate. Besides, for the purpose of area spectral efficiency (ASE) maximization, we find that the optimal number of active users for each tier is approximately fixed portion of the sum of the number of antennas plus one. Interestingly, the optimal settings are insensitive to different configurations between two tiers. Last but not the least, if the number of antennas of macro base stations (MBSs) is sufficiently larger than that of small cell base stations (SBSs), we find that range expansion will improve ASE.
