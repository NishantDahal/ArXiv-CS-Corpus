SPAM: Signal Processing to Analyze Malware

In this article, we explored orthogonal methods to analyze malware motivated by signal and image processing. Malware samples are represented as images or signals. Image and signal-based features are extracted to characterize malware. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on malware classification and retrieval. We believe that our techniques will open the scope of signal-and image-based methods to broader fields in computer security.
