A High-Throughput Energy-Efficient Implementation of Successive-Cancellation Decoder for Polar Codes Using Combinational Logic

This paper proposes a high-throughput energy-efficient Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder architecture for polar codes based on combinational logic. The proposed combinational architecture operates at relatively low clock frequencies compared to sequential circuits, but takes advantage of the high degree of parallelism inherent in such architectures to provide a favorable tradeoff between throughput and energy efficiency at short to medium block lengths. At longer block lengths, the paper proposes a hybrid-logic SC decoder that combines the advantageous aspects of the combinational decoder with the low-complexity nature of sequential-logic decoders. Performance characteristics on ASIC and FPGA are presented with a detailed power consumption analysis for combinational decoders. Finally, the paper presents an analysis of the complexity and delay of combinational decoders, and of the throughput gains obtained by hybrid-logic decoders with respect to purely synchronous architectures.
