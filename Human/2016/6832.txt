Beamwidth Optimization in Millimeter Wave Small Cell Networks with Relay Nodes: A Swarm Intelligence Approach

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have been postulated as one of the most disruptive technologies for future 5G systems. Among mmWave bands the 60-GHz radio technology is specially suited for ultradense small cells and mobile data offloading scenarios. Many challenges remain to be addressed in mmWave communications but among them deafness, or misalignment between transmitter and receivers beams, and interference management lie among the most prominent ones. In the recent years, scenarios considering negligible interference on mmWave resource allocation have been rather common in literature. To this end, interestingly, many open issues still need to be addressed such as the applicability of noise-limited regime for mmWave. Furthermore, in mmWave the beam-steering mechanism imposes a forced silence period, in the course of which no data can be conveyed, that should not be neglected in throughput/delay calculations. This paper introduces mmWave enabled Small Cell Networks (SCNs) with relaying capabilities where as a result of a coordinated meta-heuristically optimized beamwidth/alignment-delay approach overall system throughput is optimized. Simulations have been conveyed for three transmitter densities under TDMA and naive 'all-on' scheduling producing average per node throughput increments of up to 248%. The paper further elaborates on the off-balancing impact of alignment delay and time-multiplexing strategies by illustrating how the foreseen transition that increasing the number of transmitters produces in the regime of a fixed-node size SCN in downlink operation fades out by a poor choice in the scheduling strategy.
