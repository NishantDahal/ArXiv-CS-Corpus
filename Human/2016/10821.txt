The SensorCloud Protocol: Securely Outsourcing Sensor Data to the Cloud

The increasing deployment of sensor networks, ranging from home networks to industrial automation, leads to a similarly growing demand for storing and processing the collected sensor data. To satisfy this demand, the most promising approach to date is the utilization of the dynamically scalable, on-demand resources made available via the cloud computing paradigm. However, prevalent security and privacy concerns are a huge obstacle for the outsourcing of sensor data to the cloud. Hence, sensor data needs to be secured properly before it can be outsourced to the cloud. When securing the outsourcing of sensor data to the cloud, one important challenge lies in the representation of sensor data and the choice of security measures applied to it. In this paper, we present the SensorCloud protocol, which enables the representation of sensor data and actuator commands using JSON as well as the encoding of the object security mechanisms applied to a given sensor data item. Notably, we solely utilize mechanisms that have been or currently are in the process of being standardized at the IETF to aid the wide applicability of our approach.
