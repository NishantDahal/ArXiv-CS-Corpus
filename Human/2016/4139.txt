Multimodal sparse representation learning and applications

Unsupervised methods have proven effective for discriminative tasks in a single-modality scenario. In this paper, we present a multimodal framework for learning sparse representations that can capture semantic correlation between modalities. The framework can model relationships at a higher level by forcing the shared sparse representation. In particular, we propose the use of joint dictionary learning technique for sparse coding and formulate the joint representation for concision, cross-modal representations (in case of a missing modality), and union of the cross-modal representations. Given the accelerated growth of multimodal data posted on the Web such as YouTube, Wikipedia, and Twitter, learning good multimodal features is becoming increasingly important. We show that the shared representations enabled by our framework substantially improve the classification performance under both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further show how deep architectures built on the proposed framework are effective for the case of highly nonlinear correlations between modalities. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated experimentally in image denoising, multimedia event detection and retrieval on the TRECVID dataset (audio-video), category classification on the Wikipedia dataset (image-text), and sentiment classification on PhotoTweet (image-text).
