Engagement dynamics and sensitivity analysis of YouTube videos

YouTube, with millions of content creators, has become the preferred destination for watching videos online. Through the Partner program, YouTube allows content creators to monetize their popular videos. Of significant importance for content creators is which meta-level features (e.g. title, tag, thumbnail) are most sensitive for promoting video popularity. The popularity of videos also depends on the social dynamics, i.e. the interaction of the content creators (or channels) with YouTube users. Using real-world data consisting of about 6 million videos spread over 25 thousand channels, we empirically examine the sensitivity of YouTube meta-level features and social dynamics. The key meta-level features that impact the view counts of a video include: first day view count , number of subscribers, contrast of the video thumbnail, Google hits, number of keywords, video category, title length, and number of upper-case letters in the title respectively and illustrate that these meta-level features can be used to estimate the popularity of a video. In addition, optimizing the meta-level features after a video is posted increases the popularity of videos. In the context of social dynamics, we discover that there is a causal relationship between views to a channel and the associated number of subscribers. Additionally, insights into the effects of scheduling and video playthrough in a channel are also provided. Our findings provide a useful understanding of user engagement in YouTube.
