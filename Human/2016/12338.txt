Distributed Space-Time Coding Techniques with Dynamic Buffers for Cooperative DS-CDMA Systems

In this work, we propose a dynamic buffer-aided distributed space-time coding (DSTC) scheme for cooperative direct-sequence code-division multiple access systems. We first devise a relay selection algorithm that can automatically select the optimum set of relays among both the source-relay phase and the relay-destination phase for DSTC transmission according to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. Multiple relays equipped with dynamic buffers are introduced in the network, which allows the relays to store data received from the sources and wait until the most appropriate time for transmission. The proposed technique improves the quality of the transmission with an acceptable delay as the buffer size is adjustable. Simulation results show that the proposed dynamic buffer-aided DSTC scheme and algorithm outperforms prior art.
