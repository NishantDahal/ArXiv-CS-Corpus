A Unified Multicarrier Modulation Framework

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been recently recognized as inadequate to meet the increased requirements of the next generation of communication systems. A number of alternative modulation solutions, based on the use of filter banks, have thus been proposed and are currently being considered as candidate waveforms for the envisaged air interface of the future networks. A unified view of these schemes would largely facilitate a systematic comparison of their pros and cons as well as the study of methods for related signal processing problems. To this end, a generic modulator is developed in this paper, following a structured matrix formulation. With appropriate parameter settings, existing modulation schemes can result as special cases. Three such popular examples are presented in detail.
