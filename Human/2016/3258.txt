An Optimal Polarization Tracking Algorithm for Lithium-Niobate-based Polarization Controllers

We present an optimal algorithm for the three-stage arbitrary polarization tracking using Lithium-Niobate-based Polarization Controllers: device calibration, polarization state rotation, and stabilization. The theoretical model representing the lithium-niobate-based polarization controller is derived and the methodology is successfully applied. Results are numerically simulated in the MATLAB environment.
