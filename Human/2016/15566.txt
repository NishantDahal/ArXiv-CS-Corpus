A 481pJ/decision 3.4M decision/s Multifunctional Deep In-memory Inference Processor using Standard 6T SRAM Array

This paper describes a multi-functional deep in-memory processor for inference applications. Deep in-memory processing is achieved by embedding pitch-matched low-SNR analog processing into a standard 6T 16KB SRAM array in 65 nm CMOS. Four applications are demonstrated. The prototype achieves up to 5.6X (9.7X estimated for multi-bank scenario) energy savings with negligible (<1%) accuracy degradation in all four applications as compared to the conventional architecture.
