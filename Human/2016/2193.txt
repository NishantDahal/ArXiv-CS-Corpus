Constructions of q-ary entanglement-assisted quantum MDS codes with minimum distance greater than q + 1

The entanglement-assisted stabilizer formalism provides a useful framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes (QECC), which can transform arbitrary classical linear codes into entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) by using pre-shared entanglement between the sender and the receiver. In this paper, we construct five classes of entanglement-assisted quantum MDS (EAQMDS) codes based on classical MDS codes by exploiting one or more pre-shared maximally entangled states. We show that these EAQMDS codes have much larger minimum distance than the standard quantum MDS (QMDS) codes of the same length, and three classes of these EAQMDS codes consume only one pair of maximally entangled states.
