Anti-Jamming Strategy for Distributed Microgrid Control based on Power Talk Communication

In standard implementations of distributed secondary control for DC MicroGrids (MGs), the exchange of local measurements among neighboring control agents is enabled via off-the-shelf wireless solutions, such as IEEE 802.11. However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through jamming prevents the secondary control system from performing its main tasks, which might compromise the stability of the MG. In this paper, we propose novel, robust and secure secondary control reconfiguration strategy, tailored to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the wireless interface, the jammed secondary control agent notifies its peers via a secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the secondary control by switching to current source mode, and are replaced by nonjammed current sources that switch to voltage source mode and join the secondary control. The strategy fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary control loops. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the solution and prove that the MG resilience and performance can be indeed improved via software-defined networking approaches.
