Distributed Power Allocation and Channel Access Probability Assignment for Cognitive Radio

In this paper, we present a framework for distributively optimizing the transmission strategies of secondary users in an ad hoc cognitive radio network. In particular, the proposed approach allows secondary users to set their transmit powers and channel access probabilities such that, on average, the quality of service of both the primary and secondary networks are satisfied. The system under consideration assumes several primary and secondary transceiver pairs and assumes no cooperation or information exchange between neither primary and secondary users nor among secondary users. The outage probability, and consequently the connection probability, is derived for the system and is used in defining a new performance metric in the optimization problem using tools from stochastic geometry. We refer to this metric as the spatial density of successful transmission. We corroborate our derivations through numerical evaluations. We further demonstrate that even in the absence of any form of cooperation, an acceptable quality of service can be attained in the cognitive radio environment.
