Evolutionary Demographic Algorithms

Most of the problems in genetic algorithms are very complex and demand a large amount of resources that current technology can not offer. Our purpose was to develop a Java-JINI distributed library that implements Genetic Algorithms with sub-populations (coarse grain) and a graphical interface in order to configure and follow the evolution of the search. The sub-populations are simulated/evaluated in personal computers connected trough a network, keeping in mind different models of sub-populations, migration policies and network topologies. We show that this model delays the convergence of the population keeping a higher level of genetic diversity and allows a much greater number of evaluations since they are distributed among several computers compared with the traditional Genetic Algorithms.
