Towards End-to-End Audio-Sheet-Music Retrieval

This paper demonstrates the feasibility of learning to retrieve short snippets of sheet music (images) when given a short query excerpt of music (audio) -- and vice versa --, without any symbolic representation of music or scores. This would be highly useful in many content-based musical retrieval scenarios. Our approach is based on Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and learns correlated latent spaces allowing for cross-modality retrieval in both directions. Initial experiments with relatively simple monophonic music show promising results.
