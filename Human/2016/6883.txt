User Scheduling and Optimal Power Allocation for Full-Duplex Cellular Networks

The problem of user scheduling and power allocation in full-duplex (FD) cellular networks is considered, where a FD base station communicates simultaneously with one half-duplex (HD) user on each downlink and uplink channel. First, we propose low complexity user scheduling algorithms aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the considered FD system. Second, we derive the optimal power allocation for the two communication links, which is then exploited to introduce efficient metrics for FD/HD mode switching in the scheduling procedure, in order to further boost the system rate performance. We analyze the average sum rate of the proposed algorithms over Rayleigh fading and provide closed-form expressions. Our representative performance evaluation results for the algorithms with and without optimal power control offer useful insights on the interplay among rate, transmit powers, self-interference (SI) cancellation capability, and available number of users in the system.
