Lossy Asymptotic Equipartition property for Networked Data Structures

In this article we prove a Generalized Asypmtotic Equipartition Property for Networked Data Structures modelled as coloured random graphs. The main techniques in this article remains large deviation principles for suitably defined empirical measures on coloured random graphs. We apply our main result to a concrete example from the field of Biology.
