Propositional dynamic logic with Belnapian truth values

We introduce BPDL, a combination of propositional dynamic logic PDL with the basic four-valued modal logic BK studied by Odintsov and Wansing (`Modal logics with Belnapian truth values', J. Appl. Non-Class. Log. 20, 279--301 (2010)). We modify the standard arguments based on canonical models and filtration to suit the four-valued context and prove weak completeness and decidability of BPDL.
