Bandwidth-aware Service Placement in Community Network Clouds

Seamless computing and service sharing in community networks have been gaining momentum due to the emerging technology of community network micro-clouds (CNMCs). However, running services in CNMCs can face enormous challenges such as the dynamic nature of micro-clouds, limited capacity of nodes and links, asymmetric quality of wireless links for services, deployment mod- els based on geographic singularities rather than network QoS, and etc. CNMCs have been increasingly used by network-intensive services that exchange significant amounts of data between the nodes on which they run, therefore the performance heavily relies on the available bandwidth resource in a network. This paper proposes a novel bandwidth-aware service placement algorithm which out- performs the current random placement adopted by Guifi.net. Our preliminary results show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the current random placement adopted in Guifi.net by 35% regarding its bandwidth gain. More importantly, as the number of services increases, the gain tends to increase accordingly.
