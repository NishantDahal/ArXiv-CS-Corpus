High Level Synthesis with a Dataflow Architectural Template

In this work, we present a new approach to high level synthesis (HLS), where high level functions are first mapped to an architectural template, before hardware synthesis is performed. As FPGA platforms are especially suitable for implementing streaming processing pipelines, we perform transformations on conventional high level programs where they are turned into multi-stage dataflow engines [1]. This target template naturally overlaps slow memory data accesses with computations and therefore has much better tolerance towards memory subsystem latency. Using a state-of-the-art HLS tool for the actual circuit generation, we observe up to 9x improvement in overall performance when the dataflow architectural template is used as an intermediate compilation target.
