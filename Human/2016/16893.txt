Formal Solutions of Completely Integrable Pfaffian Systems With Normal Crossings

In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing a fundamental matrix of formal solutions of completely integrable Pfaffian systems with normal crossings in several variables. This algorithm is a generalization of a method developed for the bivariate case based on a combination of several reduction techniques and is implemented in the computer algebra system Maple.
