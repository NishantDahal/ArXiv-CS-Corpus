Android and Wireless data-extraction using Wi-Fi

Today, mobile phones are very popular, fast growing technology. Mobile phones of the present day are more and more like small computers. The so-called "smartphones" contain a wealth of information each. This information has been proven to be very useful in crime investigations, because relevant evidence can be found in data retrieved from mobile phones used by criminals. In traditional methods, the data from mobile phones can be extracted using an USB-cable. However, for some reason this USB-cable connection cannot be made, the data should be extracted in an alternative way. In this paper, we study the possibility of extracting data from mobile devices using a Wi-Fi connection. We describe our approach on mobile devices containing the Android Operating System. Through our experiments, we also give recommendation on which application and protocol can be used best to retrieve data.
