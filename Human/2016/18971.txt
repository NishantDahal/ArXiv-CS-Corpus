Power Networks: The Digital Approach

In the current analog grid, power is available at all times, to all users, indiscriminately. This makes the grid vulnerable to demand fluctuations and much effort has been invested to mitigate their effect. The Digital Power Network (DPN) is an energy-on-demand approach to power grids. In the new (digital) approach, the user initiates an energy request. This action alleviates uncertainties in energy demands. The service provider may grant the request fully or partially. Energy is then transmitted in discrete units, analogous to packets of data over a computer network. The packetized energy is routed to the user address. Because energy demands are known ahead of time, the energy provider may optimize the power distribution of the entire power network and isolate pockets of instabilities. For example, under severe energy constraints the energy provider may queue some energy requests and grant these requests later. Alternative energy resources may be seamlessly incorporated into the power network as yet another address in the system and since their energy is coded, they would be connected to specific users directly. In its simplest form, this grid can be realized by overlaying an auxiliary (communication) network on top of an energy delivery network (the current transmission lines) and coupling the two through an array of addressable digital power switches. Optimization of energy requests is the topic of this paper. We investigate the role of the network queue and provide a snapshot of its behavior in time. The DPN with a limited channel capacity and the optimal path for energy flow in a standard IEEE 39 bus are considered, as well.
