A low-cost indoor and outdoor terrestrial autonomous navigation model

In this paper, a method for low-cost system design oriented to indoor and outdoor autonomous navigation is illustrated. In order to provide a motivation for the solution here presented, a brief discussion of the typical drawbacks of state-of-the-art technologies is reported. Finally, an application of such a method for the design of a navigation system for blindfolded people is shown.
