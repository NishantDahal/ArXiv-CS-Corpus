A deterministic algorithm to compute approximate roots of polynomial systems in polynomial average time

We describe a deterministic algorithm that computes an approximate root of n complex polynomial equations in n unknowns in average polynomial time with respect to the size of the input, in the Blum-Shub-Smale model with square root. It rests upon a derandomization of an algorithm of Beltr√°n and Pardo and gives a deterministic affirmative answer to Smale's 17th problem. The main idea is to make use of the randomness contained in the input itself.
