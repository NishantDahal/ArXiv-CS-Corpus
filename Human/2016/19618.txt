A Dual-Directional Path-loss Model in 5G Wireless Fractal Small Cell Networks

With the anticipated increase in the number of low power base stations (BSs) deployed in small cell networks, blockage effects becoming more sensitive on wireless transmissions over high spectrums, variable propagation fading scenarios make it hard to describe coverage of small cell networks. In this paper, we propose a dual-directional path loss model cooperating with Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) transmissions for the fifth generation (5G) fractal small cell networks. Based on the proposed path loss model, a LoS transmission probability is derived as a function of the coordinate azimuth of the BS and the distance between the mobile user (MU) and the BS. Moreover, the coverage probability and the average achievable rate are analyzed for 5G fractal small cell networks. Numerical results imply that the minimum intensity of blockages and the maximum intensity of BSs can not guarantee the maximum average achievable rate in 5G fractal small cell networks. Our results explore the relationship between the anisotropic path loss fading and the small cell coverage in 5G fractal small cell networks.
