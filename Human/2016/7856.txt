On The Secrecy of the Cognitive Interference Channel with Partial Channel States

The secrecy problem in the state-dependent cognitive interference channel is considered in this paper. In our model, there are a primary and a secondary (cognitive) transmitter-receiver pairs, in which the cognitive transmitter has the message of the primary one as side information. In addition, the channel is affected by a channel state sequence which is estimated partially at the cognitive transmitter and the corresponding receiver. The cognitive transmitter wishes to cooperate with the primary one, and it sends its individual message which should be confidential at the primary receiver. The achievable equivocation-rate regions for this channel are derived using two approaches: the binning scheme coding, and superposition coding. Then the outer bounds on the capacity are proposed and the results are extended to the Gaussian examples.
