A short review and primer on eye tracking in human computer interaction applications

The application of psychophysiologicy in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Eye tracking is a widely used method for tracking user attention with gaze location, but also provides information on the internal cognitive and contextual state, intention, and the locus of the user's visual attention in interactive settings through a number of eye and eyelid movement related parameters. This paper presents a short review on the application of eye tracking in human-computer interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
