Comparative study and enhancement of Camera Tampering Detection algorithms

Recently the use of video surveillance systems is widely increasing. Different places are equipped by camera surveillances such as hospitals, schools, airports, museums and military places in order to ensure the safety and security of the persons and their property. Therefore it becomes significant to guarantee the proper working of these systems. Intelligent video surveillance systems equipped by sophisticated digital camera can analyze video information s and automatically detect doubtful actions. The camera tampering detection algorithms may indicate that accidental or suspicious activities have occurred and that causes the abnormality works of the video surveillance.
  Camera Tampering Detection uses several techniques based on image processing and computer vision. In this paper, comparative study of performance of three algorithms that can detect abnormal disturbance for video surveillance is presented.
