Energy Allocation Policy for Cellular Networks Powered by Renewable Energy

The explosive wireless data service requirement accompanied with carbon dioxide emission and consumption of traditional energy has put pressure on both industry and academia. Wireless networks powered with the uneven and intermittent generated renewable energy have been widely researched and lead to a new research paradigm called green communication. In this paper, we comprehensively consider the total generated renewable energy, QoS requirement and channel quality, then propose a utility based renewable energy allocation policy. The utility here means the satisfaction degree of users with a certain amount allocated renewable energy. The energy allocation problem is formulated as a constraint optimization problem and a heuristic algorithm with low complexity is derived to solve the raised problem. Numerical results show that the renewable energy allocation policy is applicable for any situation. When the renewable energy is very scarce, only users with good channel quality can achieve allocated energy.
