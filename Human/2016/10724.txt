8th European Conference on Python in Science (EuroSciPy 2015)

The 8th edition of the European Conference on Python in Science, EuroSciPy was held for the second time in the beautiful city of Cambridge, UK from August, 26th to 29th, 2014. More than 200 participants, both from academia and industry, attended the conference.
  As usual, the conference kicked off with two days of tutorials, divided into an introductory and an advanced track. The introductory track, presented by Joris Vankerschaver, Valerio Maggio Joris Van den Bossche, Stijn Van Hoey and Nicolas Rougier, gave a quick but thorough overview of the SciPy stack, while the experience track focused on different advanced topics. This second track began with an introduction to Bokeh, by Bryan Van den Ven, followed by an image processing tutorial with scikit-image by Emmanuelle Gouillart and Juan Nunez-Iglesias. The afternoon continued with two tutorials on data analysis: the first, intitulated "How 'good' is your model, and how can you make it better?" (by Chih-Chun Chen, Dimitry Foures, Elena Chatzimichali, Giuseppe Vettigli) focused on the challenges face while attempting model selections, and the first day concluded with a statistics in python tutorial by Gael Varoquaux. During the second day, the attendees tackled an in depth 4 hour tutorial on Cython, presented by Stefan Behnel, and a crash course on "Evidence-Based Teaching: What We Know and How to Use It", by Greg Wilson.
