An Improved DOA Estimation Algorithm for Circular and Non-Circular Signals with High Resolution

In this paper, an improved direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm for circular and non-circular signals is proposed. Most state-of-the-art algorithms only deal with the DOA estimation problem for the maximal non-circularity rated and circular signals. However, common non-circularity rated signals are not taken into consideration. The proposed algorithm can estimates not only the maximal non-circularity rated and circular signals, but also the common non-circularity rated signals. Based on the property of the non-circularity phase and rate, the incident signals can be divided into three types as mentioned above, which can be estimated separately. The interrelationship among these signals can be reduced significantly, which means the resolution performance among different types of signals is improved. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
