Combinatorial Constructions of Optimal $(m, n,4,2)$ Optical Orthogonal Signature Pattern Codes

Optical orthogonal signature pattern codes (OOSPCs) play an important role in a novel type of optical code-division multiple-access (CDMA) network for 2-dimensional image transmission. There is a one-to-one correspondence between an $(m, n, w, λ)$-OOSPC and a $(λ+1)$-$(mn,w,1)$ packing design admitting an automorphism group isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_n$. In 2010, Sawa gave the first infinite class of $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPCs by using $S$-cyclic Steiner quadruple systems. In this paper, we use various combinatorial designs such as strictly $\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_n$-invariant $s$-fan designs, strictly $\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_n$-invariant $G$-designs and rotational Steiner quadruple systems to present some constructions for $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPCs. As a consequence, our new constructions yield more infinite families of optimal $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPCs. Especially, we shall see that in some cases an optimal $(m, n, 4, 2)$-OOSPC can not achieve the Johnson bound.
