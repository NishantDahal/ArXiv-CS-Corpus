Multi-Antenna Transmission in Downlink Heterogeneous Cellular Networks under A Threshold-based Mobile Association Policy

With the recent emergence of 5G era, heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) have invoked a popular research interest. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis for multiantenna transmissions in a multi-tier downlink HCN. We first propose a reliability-oriented threshold-based mobile association policy, where each user connects to the strongest base station from which this user can obtain the largest truncated long-term received power. Under our mobile association policy, we derive analytical expressions for the exact outage probability of an arbitrary randomly located user, along with computationally convenient lower and upper bounds. Asymptotic analysis on the outage probability shows that introducing a large access threshold into mobile association significantly decreases the outage probability. We further investigate the spectrum efficiency and the energy efficiency of the HCN. Our theoretic analysis and numerical validations show that both the spectrum and energy efficiencies can be improved by properly choosing the access threshold.
