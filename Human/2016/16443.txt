FogMQ: A Message Broker System for Enabling Distributed, Internet-Scale IoT Applications over Heterogeneous Cloud Platforms

Excessive tail end-to-end latency occurs with conventional message brokers as a result of having massive numbers of geographically distributed devices communicate through a message broker. On the other hand, broker-less messaging systems, though ensure low latency, are highly dependent on the limitation of direct device-to-device (D2D) communication technologies, and cannot scale well as large numbers of resource-limited devices exchange messages. In this paper, we propose FogMQ, a cloud-based message broker system that overcomes the limitations of conventional systems by enabling autonomous discovery, self-deployment, and online migration of message brokers across heterogeneous cloud platforms. For each device, FogMQ provides a high capacity device cloning service that subscribes to device messages. The clones facilitate near-the-edge data analytics in resourceful cloud compute nodes. Clones in FogMQ apply Flock, an algorithm mimicking flocking-like behavior to allow clones to dynamically select and autonomously migrate to different heterogeneous cloud platforms in a distributed manner.
