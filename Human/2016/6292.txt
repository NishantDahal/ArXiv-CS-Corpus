A Survey: Embedded Systems Supporting By Different Operating Systems

In these days embedded system have an important role in different Fields and applications like Network embedded system , Real-time embedded systems which supports the mission-critical domains, mostly having the time constraints, Stand-alone systems which includes the network router etc. A great deployment in the processors made for completing the demanding needs of the users. There is also a large-scale deployment occurs in sensor networks for providing the advance facilities, for handled such type of embedded systems a specific operating system must provide. This paper presents some software infrastructures that have the ability of supporting such types of embedded systems.
