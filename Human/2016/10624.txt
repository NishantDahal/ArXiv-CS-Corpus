New Software Metrics for Evaluation and Comparison of Advanced Power Management Systems

A set of software metrics for the evaluation of power management systems (PMSs) is presented. Such systems for managing power need to be autonomous, scalable, low in complexity, and comprised of portable algorithms in order to be well applied across the varying implementations that utilize power systems. Although similar metrics exist for software in general, their definitions do not readily lend themselves to the unique characteristics of power management systems or systems of similar architecture.
