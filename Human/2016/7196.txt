Analysis of SQL Injection Detection Techniques

SQL Injection is one of the vulnerabilities in OWASPs Top Ten List for Web Based Application Exploitation.These types of attacks takes place on Dynamic Web applications as they interact with the databases for the various operations.Current Content Management System like Drupal, Joomla or Wordpress have all the information stored in their databases. A single intrusion into these types of websites can lead to overall control of websites by the attacker.

Over here, we present the extensive review for the Advanced SQL Injection attack such as Fast Flux Sql Injection, Compounded SQL Injection and Deep Blind SQL Injection. We also analyze the detection and prevention using the classical methods as well as modern approaches. We will be discussing the Comparative Evaluation for prevention of SQL Injection.
