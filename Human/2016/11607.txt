Recognizing and Drawing IC-planar Graphs

IC-planar graphs are those graphs that admit a drawing where no two crossed edges share an end-vertex and each edge is crossed at most once. They are a proper subfamily of the 1-planar graphs. Given an embedded IC-planar graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we present an $O(n)$-time algorithm that computes a straight-line drawing of $G$ in quadratic area, and an $O(n^3)$-time algorithm that computes a straight-line drawing of $G$ with right-angle crossings in exponential area. Both these area requirements are worst-case optimal. We also show that it is NP-complete to test IC-planarity both in the general case and in the case in which a rotation system is fixed for the input graph. Furthermore, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a set of matching edges can be added to a triangulated planar graph such that the resulting graph is IC-planar.
