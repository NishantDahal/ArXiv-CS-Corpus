Research on Information Security Enhancement Approaches and the Applications on HCI Systems

With rapid development of computer techniques, the human computer interaction scenarios are becoming more and more frequent. The development history of the human-computer interaction is from a person to adapt to the computer to the computer and continually adapt to the rapid development. Facing the process of human-computer interaction, information system daily operation to produce huge amounts of data, how to ensure human-computer interaction interface clear, generated data safe and reliable, has become a problem to be solved in the world of information. To deal with the challenging, we propose the information security enhancement approaches and the core applications on HCI systems. Through reviewing the other state-of-the-art methods, we propose the data encryption system to deal with the issues that uses mixed encryption system to make full use of the symmetric cipher algorithm encryption speed and encryption intensity is high while the encryption of large amounts of data efficiently. Our method could enhance the general safety of the HCI system, the experimental result verities the feasibility and general robustness of our approach.
