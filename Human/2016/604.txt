Weightless neural network parameters and architecture selection in a quantum computer

Training artificial neural networks requires a tedious empirical evaluation to determine a suitable neural network architecture. To avoid this empirical process several techniques have been proposed to automatise the architecture selection process. In this paper, we propose a method to perform parameter and architecture selection for a quantum weightless neural network (qWNN). The architecture selection is performed through the learning procedure of a qWNN with a learning algorithm that uses the principle of quantum superposition and a non-linear quantum operator. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it performs a global search in the space of qWNN architecture and parameters rather than a local search.
