A Power Law Approach to Estimating Fake Social Network Accounts

This paper presents a method to validate the true patrons of a brand, group, artist or any other entity on the social networking site Twitter. We analyze the trend of total number of tweets, average retweets and total number of followers for various nodes for different social and political backgrounds. We argue that average retweets to follower ratio reveals the overall value of the individual accounts and helps estimate the true to fake account ratio.
