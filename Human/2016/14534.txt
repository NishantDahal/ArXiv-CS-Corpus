Incentive Engineering Framework for Crowdsourcing Systems

Significant effort has been made to understand user motivation and to elicit user participation in crowdsourcing systems. However, incentive engineering, i.e., designing incentives that can purposefully motivate users, is still an open question and remains one of the key challenges of crowdsourcing initiatives. In this work in progress, we propose a general and systematic incentive engineering framework that system designers can use to implement appropriate incentives in order to effect desirable user behaviours.
