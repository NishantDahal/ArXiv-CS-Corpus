Inscribed Matter Communication: Part II

This paper is Part II of a two-paper set which develops a finest-grain per-molecule timing treatment of molecular communication. We first consider a simple one-molecule timing channel with a molecule launch deadline, similar to but different from previous work ("Bits Through Queues") where the constraint was mean launch time. We also derive a number of results related to the {\em ordering entropy}, a key quantity which undergirds the capacity bounds for the molecular timing channel, both with and without token data payloads. We then conclude with an upper bound on molecular timing-channel capacity.
