Propositional Logics of Dependence

In this paper, we study logics of dependence on the propositional level. We prove that several interesting propositional logics of dependence, including propositional dependence logic, propositional intuitionistic dependence logic as well as propositional inquisitive logic, are expressively complete and have disjunctive or conjunctive normal forms. We provide deduction systems and prove the completeness theorems for these logics.
