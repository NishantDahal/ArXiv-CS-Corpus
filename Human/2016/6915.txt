Well-Posed Models of Memristive Devices

Existing compact models for memristive devices (including RRAM and CBRAM) all suffer from issues related to mathematical ill-posedness and/or improper implementation. This limits their value for simulation and design and in some cases, results in qualitatively unphysical predictions. We identify the causes of ill-posedness in these models. We then show how memristive devices in general can be modelled using only continuous/smooth primitives in such a way that they always respect physical bounds for filament length and also feature well-defined and correct DC behaviour. We show how to express these models properly in languages like Verilog-A and ModSpec (MATLAB). We apply these methods to correct previously published RRAM and memristor models and make them well posed. The result is a collection of memristor models that may be dubbed "simulation-ready", i.e., that feature the right physical characteristics and are suitable for robust and consistent simulation in DC, AC, transient, etc., analyses. We provide implementations of these models in both ModSpec/MATLAB and Verilog-A.
