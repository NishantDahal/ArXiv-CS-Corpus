4D Cardiac Ultrasound Standard Plane Location by Spatial-Temporal Correlation

Echocardiography plays an important part in diagnostic aid in cardiac diseases. A critical step in echocardiography-aided diagnosis is to extract the standard planes since they tend to provide promising views to present different structures that are benefit to diagnosis. To this end, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal embedding framework to extract the standard view planes from 4D STIC (spatial-temporal image corre- lation) volumes. The proposed method is comprised of three stages, the frame smoothing, spatial-temporal embedding and final classification. In first stage, an L 0 smoothing filter is used to preprocess the frames that removes the noise and preserves the boundary. Then a compact repre- sentation is learned via embedding spatial and temporal features into a latent space in the supervised scheme considering both standard plane information and diagnosis result. In last stage, the learned features are fed into support vector machine to identify the standard plane. We eval- uate the proposed method on a 4D STIC volume dataset with 92 normal cases and 93 abnormal cases in three standard planes. It demonstrates that our method outperforms the baselines in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.
