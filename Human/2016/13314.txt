A few reflections on the quality of emergence in complex collective systems

A number of elements towards a classification of the quality of emergence in emergent collective systems are provided. By using those elements, several classes of emergent systems are exemplified, ranging from simple aggregations of simple parts up to complex organizations of complex collective systems. In so doing, the factors likely to play a a significant role in the persistence of emergence and its opposite are highlighted. From this, new elements for discussion are identified also considering elements from the System of Leibniz.
