Convergence radius and sample complexity of ITKM algorithms for dictionary learning

In this work we show that iterative thresholding and K-means (ITKM) algorithms can recover a generating dictionary with K atoms from noisy $S$ sparse signals up to an error $\tilde \varepsilon$ as long as the initialisation is within a convergence radius, that is up to a $\log K$ factor inversely proportional to the dynamic range of the signals, and the sample size is proportional to $K \log K \tilde \varepsilon^{-2}$. The results are valid for arbitrary target errors if the sparsity level is of the order of the square root of the signal dimension $d$ and for target errors down to $K^{-\ell}$ if $S$ scales as $S \leq d/(\ell \log K)$.
