Copycat: A High Precision Real Time NAND Simulator

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a high precision real time NAND simulator called Copycat that runs on a commodity multi-core desktop environment. This NAND simulator facilitates the development of embedded flash memory management software such as the flash translation layer (FTL). The simulator also allows a comprehensive fault injection for testing the reliability of the FTL. Compared against a real FPGA implementation, the simulator's response time deviation is under 0.28% on average, with a maximum of 10.12%.
