On Duality Of Multiple Target Tracking and Segmentation

Traditionally, object tracking and segmentation are treated as two separate problems and solved independently. However, in this paper, we argue that tracking and segmentation are actually closely related and solving one should help the other. On one hand, the object track, which is a set of bounding boxes with one bounding box in every frame, would provide strong high-level guidance for the target/background segmentation task. On the other hand, the object segmentation would separate object from other objects and background, which will be useful for determining track locations in every frame. We propose a novel framework which combines online multiple target tracking and segmentation in a video. In our approach, the tracking and segmentation problems are coupled by Lagrange dual decomposition, which leads to more accurate segmentation results and also \emph{helps resolve typical difficulties in multiple target tracking, such as occlusion handling, ID-switch and track drifting}. To track targets, an individual appearance model is learned for each target via structured learning and network flow is employed to generate tracks from densely sampled candidates. For segmentation, multi-label Conditional Random Field (CRF) is applied to a superpixel based spatio-temporal graph in a segment of video to assign background or target labels to every superpixel. The experiments on diverse sequences show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for multiple target tracking as well as segmentation.
