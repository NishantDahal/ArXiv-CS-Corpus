Some Counterexamples for Compatible Triangulations

We consider the conjecture by Aichholzer, Aurenhammer, Hurtado, and Krasser that any two points sets with the same cardinality and the same size convex hull can be triangulated in the "same" way, more precisely via \emph{compatible triangulations}. We show counterexamples to various strengthened versions of this conjecture.
