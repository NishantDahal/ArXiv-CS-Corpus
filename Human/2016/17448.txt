Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for Downlink Multiuser MIMO Systems: User Clustering, Beamforming, and Power Allocation

We investigate the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive interference cancellation (SIC) in downlink multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular systems, where the total number of receive antennas at user equipment (UE) ends in a cell is more than the number of transmit antennas at the base station (BS). We first dynamically group the UE receive antennas into a number of clusters equal to or more than the number of BS transmit antennas. A single beamforming vector is then shared by all the receive antennas in a cluster. We propose a linear beamforming technique in which all the receive antennas can significantly cancel the inter-cluster interference. On the other hand, the receive antennas in each cluster are scheduled on power domain NOMA basis with SIC at the receiver ends. For inter-cluster and intra-cluster power allocation, we provide dynamic power allocation solutions with an objective to maximizing the overall cell capacity. An extensive performance evaluation is carried out for the proposed MIMO-NOMA system and the results are compared with those for conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based MIMO systems and other existing MIMO-NOMA solutions. The numerical results quantify the capacity gain of the proposed MIMO-NOMA model over MIMO-OMA and other existing MIMO-NOMA solutions.
