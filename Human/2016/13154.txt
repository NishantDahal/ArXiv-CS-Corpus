C-planarity of Embedded Cyclic c-Graphs

We show that c-planarity is solvable in quadratic time for flat clustered graphs with three clusters if the combinatorial embedding of the underlying graph is fixed. In simpler graph-theoretical terms our result can be viewed as follows. Given a graph $G$ with the vertex set partitioned into three parts embedded on a 2-sphere, our algorithm decides if we can augment $G$ by adding edges without creating an edge-crossing so that in the resulting spherical graph the vertices of each part induce a connected sub-graph. We proceed by a reduction to the problem of testing the existence of a perfect matching in planar bipartite graphs. We formulate our result in a slightly more general setting of cyclic clustered graphs, i.e., the simple graph obtained by contracting each cluster, where we disregard loops and multi-edges, is a cycle.
