Knowledge Retention through Low-Tech Knowledge Sharing Channels in Loosely-Coupled Networks: A Human-Based Approach

This study examines a human-based approach for knowledge retention that is evolving through various knowledge sharing channels in a low-technology environment with a strong emphasis on social networks in a loosely-coupled inter-organisational government-industry collaboration focused on regional sustainability. Using social network analysis combined with interview and observational analysis, our results show that a combination of close-knit community ties and group interaction promote the development of strong personal networks that provide continued access to group memory to retain the groups knowledge.
