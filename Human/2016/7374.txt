PipeGen: Data Pipe Generator for Hybrid Analytics

We develop a tool called PipeGen for efficient data transfer between database management systems (DBMSs). PipeGen targets data analytics workloads on shared-nothing engines. It supports scenarios where users seek to perform different parts of an analysis in different DBMSs or want to combine and analyze data stored in different systems. The systems may be colocated in the same cluster or may be in different clusters. To achieve high performance, PipeGen leverages the ability of all DBMSs to export, possibly in parallel, data into a common data format, such as CSV or JSON. It automatically extends these import and export functions with efficient binary data transfer capabilities that avoid materializing the transmitted data on the file system. We implement a prototype of PipeGen and evaluate it by automatically generating data pipes between five different DBMSs. Our experiments show that PipeGen delivers speedups up to 3.8x compared with manually exporting and importing data across systems using CSV.
