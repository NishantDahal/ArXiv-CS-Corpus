Eco-Strategy: Towards a New Generation Managerial Model Based on Green IT and CSR

The sustainable development strategy in the management of information and communication technology (ICT) is an advanced research sector which provides a theoretical framework for integrating social and environmental responsibilities of business in the development and implementation of the management strategy. This article offers an original management model that integrates the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach and Green IT, which enables decision makers, governance and strategic alignment of ICT, business and sustainability. The model offers a new vision of decision making through economic opportunities and increasing pressure from stakeholders. This paper reveals the strategic relevance of the model, on the basis of a literature review, and provides guidelines for sustainable business development of effective management systems, and improvement of the economic, social and environmental performance of companies. The proposed framework provides a new generation managerial approach to ICT management strategy that we call "Eco-Strategy".
