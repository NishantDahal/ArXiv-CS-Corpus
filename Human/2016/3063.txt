Optimal Joint Power and Subcarrier Allocation for MC-NOMA Systems

In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation algorithm design for multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) systems. The proposed algorithm is obtained from the solution of a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the weighted system throughput. We employ monotonic optimization to develop the optimal joint power and subcarrier allocation policy. The optimal resource allocation policy serves as a performance benchmark due to its high complexity. Furthermore, to strike a balance between computational complexity and optimality, a suboptimal scheme with low computational complexity is proposed. Our simulation results reveal that the suboptimal algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance and MC-NOMA employing the proposed resource allocation algorithm provides a substantial system throughput improvement compared to conventional multicarrier orthogonal multiple access (MC-OMA).
