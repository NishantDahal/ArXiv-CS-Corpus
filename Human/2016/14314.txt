Numerical Characterization of In Vivo Wireless Communication Channels

In this paper, we numerically investigated the in vivo wireless communication channel for the human male torso at 915 MHz. The results show that in vivo channel is different from the classical communication channel, and location dependency is very critical for link budget calculations. A statistical path loss model based on the angle, depth and body region is introduced for near and far field regions. Furthermore, multipath characteristics are investigated using a power delay profile as well.
