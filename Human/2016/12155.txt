Pilot Testing an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm That Selects Homeless Youth Peer Leaders Who Promote HIV Testing

Objective. To pilot test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that selects peer change agents (PCA) to disseminate HIV testing messaging in a population of homeless youth. Methods. We recruited and assessed 62 youth at baseline, 1 month (n = 48), and 3 months (n = 38). A Facebook app collected preliminary social network data. Eleven PCAs selected by AI attended a 1-day training and 7 weekly booster sessions. Mixed-effects models with random effects were used to assess change over time. Results. Significant change over time was observed in past 6-month HIV testing (57.9%, 82.4%, 76.3%; p < .05) but not condom use (63.9%, 65.7%, 65.8%). Most youth reported speaking to a PCA about HIV prevention (72.0% at 1 month, 61.5% at 3 months). Conclusions. AI is a promising avenue for implementing PCA models for homeless youth. Increasing rates of regular HIV testing is critical to HIV prevention and linking homeless youth to treatment.
