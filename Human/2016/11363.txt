Detection and Combining Techniques for Asynchronous Random Access with Time Diversity

Asynchronous random access (RA) protocols are particularly attractive for their simplicity and avoidance of tight synchronization requirements. Recent enhancements have shown that the use of successive interference cancellation (SIC) can largely boost the performance of these schemes. A further step forward in the performance can be attained when diversity combining techniques are applied. In order to enable combining, the detection and association of the packets to their transmitters has to be done prior to decoding. We present a solution to this problem, that articulates into two phases. Non-coherent soft-correlation as well as interference-aware soft-correlation are used for packet detection. We evaluate the detection capabilities of both solutions via numerical simulations. We also evaluate numerically the spectral efficiency achieved by the proposed approach, highlighting its benefits.
