Drone Streaming with Wi-Fi Grid Aggregation for Virtual Tour

To provide a live, active and high-quality virtual touring streaming experience, we propose an unmanned drone stereoscopic streaming paradigm using a control and streaming infrastructure of a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi grid. Our system allows users to actively control the streaming captured by a drone, receive and watch the streaming using a head mount display (HMD); a Wi-Fi grid is deployed across the remote scene with multi-channel support to enable high-bitrate stream- ing broadcast from the drones. The system adopt a joint view adaptation and drone control scheme to enable fast viewer movement including both head rotation and touring. We implement the prototype on Dji M100 quadcopter and HTC Vive in a demo scene.
