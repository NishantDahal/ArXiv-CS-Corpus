Timed Automata Approach for Motion Planning Using Metric Interval Temporal Logic

In this paper, we consider the robot motion (or task) planning problem under some given time bounded high level specifications. We use metric interval temporal logic (MITL), a member of the temporal logic family, to represent the task specification and then we provide a constructive way to generate a timed automaton and methods to look for accepting runs on the automaton to find a feasible motion (or path) sequence for the robot to complete the task.
