Model-Checking of Linear-Time Properties Based on Possibility Measure

We study the LTL model-checking in possibilistic Kripke structure using possibility measure. First, the notion of possibilistic Kripke structure and the related possibility measure are introduced, then model-checking of reachability and repeated reachability linear-time properties in finite possibilistic Kripke structure are studied. Standard safety property and -regular property in possibilistic Kripke structure are introduced, the verification of regular safety property and -regular property using finite automata are thoroughly studied. It has been shown that the verification of regular safety property and -regular property in finite possibilistic Kripke structure can be transformed into the verification of reachability property and repeated reachability property in the product possibilistic Kripke structure introduced in this paper. Several examples are given to illustrate the methods presented in the paper.
