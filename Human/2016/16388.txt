Access Control in Internet of Things: A Survey

Cheating is a real problem in the Internet of Things. The fundamental question that needs to be answered is how we can trust the validity of the data being generated in the first place. The problem, however, isn't inherent in whether or not to embrace the idea of an open platform and open-source software, but to establish a methodology to verify the trustworthiness and control any access. This paper focuses on building an access control model and system based on trust computing. This is a new field of access control techniques which includes Access Control, Trust Computing, Internet of Things, network attacks, and cheating technologies. Nevertheless, the target access control systems can be very complex to manage. This paper presents an overview of the existing work on trust computing, access control models and systems in IoT. It not only summarizes the latest research progress, but also provides an understanding of the limitations and open issues of the existing work. It is expected to provide useful guidelines for future research.
