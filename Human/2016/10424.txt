On Optimal Heterogeneous Regenerating Codes

Heterogeneous Distributed Storage Systems (DSSs) are close to the real world applications for data storage. Each node of the considered DSS, may store different number of packets and each having different repair bandwidth with uniform repair traffic. For such heterogeneous DSS, a failed node can be repaired with the help of some specific nodes. In this work, a family of codes based on graph theory, is constructed which achieves the fundamental bound on file size for the particular heterogeneous DSS.
