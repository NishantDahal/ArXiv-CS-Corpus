Human Computer Symbiosis

Human Computer Symbiosis is similar to Human Computer Interaction in the sense that it is about how humans and computer interact with each other. For this interaction to be made there needs to be a symbiotic relationship between man and computer. Man can interact with computer in many ways, either just by typing with the keyboard or surfing the web. The cyber-physical-socio space is an important aspect to be looked into when referring to the interaction between man and computer. This paper investigates various aspects related to human computer symbiosis. Alongside the aspects related to the topic, this paper would also look into the limitations of Human Computer Symbiosis and evaluate some previously proposed solutions.
