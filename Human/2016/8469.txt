Bias Correction in Saupe Tensor Estimation

Estimation of the Saupe tensor is central to the determination of molecular structures from residual dipolar couplings (RDC) or chemical shift anisotropies. Assuming a given template structure, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method proposed in Losonczi et al. 1999 has been used traditionally to estimate the Saupe tensor. Despite its simplicity, whenever the template structure has large structural noise, the eigenvalues of the estimated tensor have a magnitude systematically smaller than their actual values. This leads to systematic error when calculating the eigenvalue dependent parameters, magnitude and rhombicity. We propose here a Monte Carlo simulation method to remove such bias. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the setting when the eigenvalue estimates from multiple template protein fragments are available and their average is used as an improved eigenvalue estimator. For both synthetic and experimental RDC datasets of ubiquitin, when using template fragments corrupted by large noise, the magnitude of our proposed bias-reduced estimator generally reaches at least 90% of the actual value, whereas the magnitude of SVD estimator can be shrunk below 80% of the true value.
