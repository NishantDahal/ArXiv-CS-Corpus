Wireless Caching: Technical Misconceptions and Business Barriers

Caching is a hot research topic and poised to develop into a key technology for the upcoming 5G wireless networks. The successful implementation of caching techniques however, crucially depends on joint research developments in different scientific domains such as networking, information theory, machine learning, and wireless communications. Moreover, there exist business barriers related to the complex interactions between the involved stakeholders, the users, the cellular operators, and the Internet content providers. In this article we discuss several technical misconceptions with the aim to uncover enabling research directions for caching in wireless systems. Ultimately we make a speculative stakeholder analysis for wireless caching in 5G.
