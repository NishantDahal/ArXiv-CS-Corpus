Joint Antenna Selection and Spatial Switching for Energy Efficient MIMO SWIPT System

In this paper, we investigate joint antenna selection and spatial switching (SS) for quality-of-service (QoS)-constrained energy efficiency (EE) optimization in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. A practical linear power model taking into account the entire transmit-receive chain is accordingly utilized. The corresponding fractional-combinatorial and non-convex EE problem, involving joint optimization of eigen-channel assignment, power allocation, and active receive antenna set selection, subject to satisfying minimum sum-rate and power transfer constraints, is extremely difficult to solve directly. In order to tackle this, we separate the eigen-channel assignment and power allocation procedure with the antenna selection functionality. In particular, we first tackle the EE maximization problem under fixed receive antenna set using Dinkelbach-based convex programming, iterative joint eigen-channel assignment and power allocation, and low-complexity multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based approach. On the other hand, the number of active receive antennas induces a trade-off in the achievable sum-rate and power transfer versus the transmit-independent power consumption. We provide a fundamental study of the achievable EE with antenna selection and accordingly develop dynamic optimal exhaustive search and Frobenius-norm-based schemes. Simulation results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithms can efficiently approach the optimal EE.
