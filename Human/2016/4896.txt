Optimal Caching and User Association in Cache-enabled Heterogeneous Wireless Networks

Heterogenous wireless networks (Hetnets) provide a powerful approach to meet the massive growth in traffic demands, but also impose a significant challenge on backhaul. Caching at small base stations (BSs) and wireless small cell backhaul have been proposed as attractive solutions to address this new challenge. In this paper, we consider the optimal caching and user association to minimize the total time to satisfy the average demands in cached-enabled Hetnets with wireless backhaul. We formulate this problem as a mixed discrete-continuous optimization for given bandwidth and cache resources. First, we characterize the structure of the optimal solution. Specifically, we show that the optimal caching is to store the most popular files at each pico BS, and the optimal user association has a threshold form. We also obtain the closed-form optimal solution in the homogenous scenario of pico cells. Then, we analyze the impact of bandwidth and cache resources on the minimum total time to satisfy the average demands. Finally, using numerical simulations, we verify the analytical results.
