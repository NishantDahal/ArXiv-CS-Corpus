Modeling and Analyzing the Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum

We leverage stochastic geometry to characterize key performance metrics for neighboring Wi-Fi and LTE networks in unlicensed spectrum. Our analysis focuses on a single unlicensed frequency band, where the locations for the Wi-Fi access points (APs) and LTE eNodeBs (eNBs) are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. Three LTE coexistence mechanisms are investigated: (1) LTE with continuous transmission and no protocol modifications; (2) LTE with discontinuous transmission; and (3) LTE with listen-before-talk (LBT) and random back-off (BO). For each scenario, we have derived the medium access probability (MAP), the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability, the density of successful transmissions (DST), and the rate coverage probability for both Wi-Fi and LTE. Compared to the baseline scenario where one Wi-Fi network coexists with an additional Wi-Fi network, our results show that Wi-Fi performance is severely degraded when LTE transmits continuously. However, LTE is able to improve the DST and rate coverage probability of Wi-Fi while maintaining acceptable data rate performance when it adopts one or more of the following coexistence features: a shorter transmission duty cycle, lower channel access priority, or more sensitive clear channel assessment (CCA) thresholds.
