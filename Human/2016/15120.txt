Mean Capacity of Spatially Semi-Correlated MIMO Fading Channel

This study investigates the mean capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for spatially semi-correlated flat fading channels. In reality, the capacity degrades dramatic due to the channel covariance (CC) when correlations exist at the transmitter or receiver or on both sides. Most existing works have so far considered the traditional channel covariance matrices that have not been entirely constructed. Thus, we propose an iterative channel covariance (ICC) matrix using a matrix splitting (MS) technique with a guaranteed zero correlations coefficient in the case of the downlink correlated MIMO channel, to maximize the mean capacity. Our numerical results show that the proposed ICC method achieves the maximum channel gains with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.
