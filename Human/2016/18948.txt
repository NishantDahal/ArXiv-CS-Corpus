Symbolic Abstractions of Networked Control Systems

The last decade has witnessed significant attention on networked control systems (NCS) due to their ubiquitous presence in industrial applications, and, in the particular case of wireless NCS, because of their architectural flexibility and low installation and maintenance costs. In wireless NCS the communication between sensors, controllers, and actuators is supported by a communication channel that is likely to introduce variable communication delays, packet losses, limited bandwidth, and other practical non-idealities leading to numerous technical challenges. Although stability properties of NCS have been investigated extensively in the literature, results for NCS under more complex and general objectives, and in particular results dealing with verification or controller synthesis for logical specifications, are much more limited. This work investigates how to address such complex objectives by constructively deriving symbolic models of NCS, while encompassing the mentioned network non-idealities. The obtained abstracted (symbolic) models can then be employed to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing rich logical specifications over the concrete NCS models. Examples of such general specifications include properties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata on infinite strings. We thus provide a general synthesis framework that can be flexibly adapted to a number of NCS setups. We illustrate the effectiveness of the results over some case studies.
