Code Drones

We propose and explore a new paradigm called Code Drones in which every software artifact such as a class is an intelligent and socially active entity. In this paradigm, humanized artifacts take the lead and choreograph (socially, in collaboration with other intelligent software artifacts and humans) automated software engineering solutions to a myriad of development and maintenance challenges, including API migration, reuse, documentation, testing, patching, and refactoring. We discuss the implications of having social and intelligent/cognitive software artifacts that guide their own self-improvement.
