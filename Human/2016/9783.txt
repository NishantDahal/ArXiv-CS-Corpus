Publication boost in Web of Science journals and its effect on citation distributions

In this paper we show that the dramatic increase in the number of research articles indexed in the Web of Science database impacts the commonly observed distributions of citations within these articles. First, we document that the growing number of physics articles in recent years is due to existing journals publishing more and more papers rather than more new journals coming into being as it happens in computer science. And second, even though the references from the more recent papers generally cover a longer time span, the newer papers are cited more frequently than the older ones if the uneven paper growth is not corrected for. Nevertheless, despite this change in the distribution of citations, the citation behavior of scientists does not seem to have changed.
