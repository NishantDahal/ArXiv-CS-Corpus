Non-linear Barrier Coverage using Mobile Wireless Sensors

A belt region is said to be k-barrier covered by a set of sensors if all paths crossing the width of the belt region intersect the sensing regions of at least k sensors. Barrier coverage can be achieved from a random initial deployment of mobile sensors by suitably relocating the sensors to form a barrier. Reducing the movement of the sensors is important in such scenarios due to the energy constraints of sensor devices. In this paper, we propose a centralized algorithm which achieves 1-barrier coverage by forming a non-linear barrier from a random initial deployment of sensors in a belt. The algorithm uses a novel idea of physical behavior of chains along with the concept of virtual force. Formation of non-linear barrier reduces the movement of the sensors needed as compared to linear barriers. Detailed simulation results are presented to show that the proposed algorithm achieves barrier coverage with less movement of sensors compared to other existing algorithms in the literature.
