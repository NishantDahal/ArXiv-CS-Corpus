Towards the Modeling of Behavioral Trajectories of Users in Online Social Media

In this paper, we introduce a methodology that allows to model behavioral trajectories of users in online social media. First, we illustrate how to leverage the probabilistic framework provided by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to represent users by embedding the temporal sequences of actions they performed online. We then derive a model-based distance between trained HMMs, and we use spectral clustering to find homogeneous clusters of users showing similar behavioral trajectories. To provide platform-agnostic results, we apply the proposed approach to two different online social media --- i.e. Facebook and YouTube. We conclude discussing merits and limitations of our approach as well as future and promising research directions.
