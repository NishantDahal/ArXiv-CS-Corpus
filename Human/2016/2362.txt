The Physical Web is a generic term describes interconnection of physical objects and web. The Physical Web lets present physical objects in a web. There are different ways to do that and we will discuss them in our paper. Usually, the web presentation for a physical object could be implemented with the help of mobile devices. The basic idea behind the Physical Web is to navigate and control physical objects in the world surrounding mobile devices with the help of web technologies. Of course, there are different ways to identify and enumerate physical objects. In this paper, we describe the existing models as well as related challenges. In our analysis, we will target objects enumeration and navigation as well as data retrieving and programming for the Physical Web.
