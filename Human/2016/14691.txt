A Colored Petri Net Model of Simulation for Performance Evaluation for IEEE 802.22 based Network

Cognitive Radio is a new concept that allows radio devices access to licensed bands since they do not cause harmful interferences to systems that hold the license of use. The main motivation for the increase of research on Cognitive Radio is the scarcity of non-licensed bands due to the large employment of wireless networks on cities. In this paper, we describe a Cognitive Radio Model of Simulation designed through the Colored Petri Net Formalism. This represents an effort to deliver to scientific community a model of simulation that is easily extensible and graphically validated. Through comparison with literature, we have demonstrated that this model is not invalid.
