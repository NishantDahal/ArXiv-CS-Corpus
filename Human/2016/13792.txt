Total Order Reliable Convergecast in WBAN

This paper is the first extensive work on total order reliable convergecast in multi-hop Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Convergecast is a many-to-one cooperative scheme where each node of the network transmits data towards the same sink. Our contribution is threefold. First, we stress existing WBAN convergecast strategies with respect to their capacity to be reliable and to ensure the total order delivery at sink. That is, packets sent in a specific order should be received in the same order by the sink. When stressed with transmission rates up to 500 packets per second the performances of these strategies decrease dramatically (more than 90% of packets lost). Secondly, we propose a new posture-centric model for WBAN. This model offers a good characterization of the path availability which is further used to fine tune the retransmission rate thresholds. Third, based on our model we propose a new mechanism for reliability and a new converge-cast strategy that outperforms WBAN dedicated strategies but also strategies adapted from DTN and WSN areas. Our extensive performance evaluations use essential parameters for WBAN: packet lost, total order reliability (messages sent in a specific order should be delivered in that specific order) and various human body postures. In particular, our strategy ensures zero packet order inversions for various transmission rates and mobility postures. Interestingly, our strategy respects this property without the need of additional energy-guzzler mechanisms.
