A Reconfigurable FIR Filter with Memristor-Based Weights

We report on experimental demonstration of a mixed-signal 6-tap finite-impulse response (FIR) filter in which weights are implemented with titanium dioxide memristive devices. In the proposed design weight of a tap is stored with a relatively high precision in a memristive device that can be configured in field. Such approach enables efficient implementation of the most critical operation of an FIR filter, i.e. multiplication of the input signal with the tap weights and summation of the products from taps, in analog domain. As a result, the proposed design, when implemented with fully integrated hybrid CMOS/memristor circuit, is expected to be much more compact and energy efficient as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
