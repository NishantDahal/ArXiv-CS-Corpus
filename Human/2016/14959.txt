Post-processing procedure for industrial quantum key distribution systems

We present algorithmic solutions aimed on post-processing for industrial quantum key distribution systems with hardware sifting. The main steps of the procedure are error correction, parameter estimation, and privacy amplification. Authentication of a classical public communication channel is also considered.
