Proceedings First Workshop on Pre- and Post-Deployment Verification Techniques

The PrePost (Pre- and Post-Deployment Verification Techniques) workshop aimed at bringing together researchers working in the field of computer-aided validation and verification to discuss the connections and interplay between pre- and post-deployment verification techniques. Examples of the topics covered by the workshop are the relationships between classic model checking and testing on the one hand and runtime verification and statistical model checking on the other, and between type systems that may be checked either statically or dynamically through techniques such as runtime monitoring.
