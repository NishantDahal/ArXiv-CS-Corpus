Rigid Multiview Varieties

The multiview variety from computer vision is generalized to images by $n$ cameras of points linked by a distance constraint. The resulting five-dimensional variety lives in a product of $2n$ projective planes. We determine defining polynomial equations, and we explore generalizations of this variety to scenarios of interest in applications.
