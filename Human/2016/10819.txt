SCOR: Software-defined Constrained Optimal Routing Platform for SDN

A Software-defined Constrained Optimal Routing (SCOR) platform is introduced as a Northbound interface in SDN architecture. It is based on constraint programming techniques and is implemented in MiniZinc modelling language. Using constraint programming techniques in this Northbound interface has created an efficient tool for implementing complex Quality of Service routing applications in a few lines of code. The code includes only the problem statement and the solution is found by a general solver program. A routing framework is introduced based on SDN's architecture model which uses SCOR as its Northbound interface and an upper layer of applications implemented in SCOR. Performance of a few implemented routing applications are evaluated in different network topologies, network sizes and various number of concurrent flows.
