Physical Computation, P/poly and P/log*

In this paper we give a framework for describing how abstract systems can be used to compute if no randomness or error is involved. Using this we describe a class of classical "physical" computation systems whose computational capabilities in polynomial time are equivalent to P/poly. We then extend our framework to describe how measurement and transformation times may vary depending on their input. Finally we describe two classes of classical "physical" computation systems in this new framework whose computational capabilities in polynomial time are equivalent to P/poly and P/log*.
