RemIX: A Distributed Internet Exchange for Remote and Rural Networks

The concept of the IXP, an Ethernet fabric central to the structure of the global Internet, is largely absent from the development of community-driven collaborative network infrastructure. The reasons for this are two-fold. IXPs exist in central, typically urban, environments where strong network infrastructure ensures high levels of connectivity. Between rural and remote regions, where networks are separated by distance and terrain, no such infrastructure exists. In this paper we present RemIX a distributed IXPs architecture designed for the community network environment. We examine this praxis using an implementation in Scotland, with suggestions for future development and research.
