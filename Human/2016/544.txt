Stability and instability of a random multiple access model with adaptive energy harvesting

We introduce a model for the classical synchronised multiple access system with a single transmission channel and a randomised transmission protocol (ALOHA). We assume in addition that there is an energy harvesting mechanism, and any message transmission requires a unit of energy. Units of energy arrive randomly and independently of anything else. We analyse stability and instability conditions for this model.
