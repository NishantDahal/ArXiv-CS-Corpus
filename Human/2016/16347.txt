Decision problems on unary probabilistic and quantum automata

It is well known that the emptiness problem for binary probabilistic automata and so for quantum automata is undecidable. We present the current status of the emptiness problems for unary probabilistic and quantum automata with connections with Skolem's and positivity problems. We also introduce the concept of linear recurrence automata in order to show the connection naturally. Then, we also give possible generalizations of linear recurrence relations and automata on vectors.
