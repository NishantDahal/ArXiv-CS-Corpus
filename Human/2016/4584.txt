Stable Throughput Region of the Two-User Broadcast Channel

In this paper we consider the two-user broadcast channel and we characterize its stable throughout region. We start the analysis by providing the stability region for the general case without any specific considerations on transmission and reception mechanisms. We also provide conditions for the stable throughput region to be convex. Subsequently, we consider the case where the transmitter uses superposition coding and we consider two special cases for the receivers. The first one is when both receivers treat interference as noise. The second is when the user with a better channel uses successive decoding and the other receiver treats interference as noise.
