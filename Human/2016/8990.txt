Alternative Technique to Asymmetry Analysis-Based Overlapping for Foot Ulcer Examination: Scalable Scanning

Asymmetry analysis based on the overlapping of thermal images proved able to detect inflammation and, predict foot ulceration. This technique involves three main steps: segmentation, geometric transformation, and overlapping. However, the overlapping technique, which consists of subtracting the intensity levels of the right foot from those of the left foot, can also detect false abnormal areas if the projections of the left and right feet are not the same. In this paper, we present an alternative technique to asymmetry analysis-based overlapping. The proposed technique, scalable scanning, allows for an effective comparison even if the shapes and sizes of the feet projections appear differently in the image. The tested results show that asymmetry analysis- based scalable scanning provides fewer false abnormal areas than does asymmetry analysis -based overlapping.
