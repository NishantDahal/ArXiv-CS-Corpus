On the Performance of Mobile Visible Light Communications

We experimentally characterize the performance of mobile VLC and propose using OCT precoding to combat mobility-induced performance degradation. Results show that for approximate 300-Mb/s mobile VLC transmission, OCT precoding outperforms adaptive-loaded DMT and offers significant packet loss rate reduction.
