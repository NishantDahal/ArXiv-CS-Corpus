Lossy Data Compression Using Logarithm

Lossy compression algorithms take advantage of the inherent limitations of the human eye and discard information that cannot be seen. In the present paper, a technique termed as Lossy Data Compression using Logarithm (LDCL) is proposed to compress incoming binary data in the form of a resultant matrix containing the logarithmic values of different chosen numeric sets. The proposed method is able to achieve compression ratio up to 60 in many major cases.
