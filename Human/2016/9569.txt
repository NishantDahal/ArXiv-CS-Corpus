The Largest Respectful Function

Respectful functions were introduced by Sangiorgi as a compositional tool to formulate short and clear bisimulation proofs. Usually, the larger the respectful function, the easier the bisimulation proof. In particular the largest respectful function, defined as the pointwise union of all respectful functions, has been shown to be very useful. We here provide an explicit and constructive characterization of it.
