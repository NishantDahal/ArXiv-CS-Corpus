Language recognition power and succintness of affine automata

In this work we study a non-linear generalization based on affine transformations of probabilistic and quantum automata proposed recently by Díaz-Caro and Yakaryılmaz \cite{DCY16A} referred as affine automata. First, we present efficient simulations of probabilistic and quantum automata by means of affine automata which allows us to characterize the class of exclusive stochastic languages. Then, we initiate a study on the succintness of affine automata. In particular, we show that an infinite family of unary regular languages can be recognized by 2-state affine automata but the state numbers of quantum and probabilistic automata cannot be bounded. Finally, we present the characterization of all (regular) unary languages recognized by two-state affine automata.
