Analytical and Simulation Performance of a Typical User in Random Cellular Network

Spatial Poisson Point Process (PPP) network, whose Base Stations (BS)s are distributed according to a Poisson distribution, is currently used as a accurate model to analyse the performance of a cellular network. Most current work on evaluation of PPP network in Rayleigh fading channels are usually assumed that the BSs have fixed transmission power levels and there is only a Resource Block (RB) or a user in each cell. In this paper, the Rayleigh-Lognormal fading channels are considered, and it is assumed that each cell is allocated $N$ Resource Blocks (RB) to serve M users. Furthermore, the serving and interfering BS of a typical user are assumed to transmit at different power levels. The closed-form expression for the network coverage probability for both low and high SNR is derived by using Gauss-Legendre approximation. The analytical results indicates that the performance of the typical user is proportional to the transmission power and density of BSs when SNR<10 dB and λ<1, and reaches the upper bound when SNR>10 dB or λ>1. The variance of Monte Carlo simulation is considered to verify the stability and accuracy of simulation results.
