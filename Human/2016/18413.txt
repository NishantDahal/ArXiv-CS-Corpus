Joint Optimization of Data Sponsoring and Edge Caching for Mobile Video Delivery

In this work, we study the joint optimization of edge caching and data sponsoring for a video content provider (CP), aiming at reducing the content delivery cost and increasing the CP's revenue. Specifically, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a two-stage decision problem for the CP. In Stage I, the CP determines the edge caching policy (for a relatively long time period). In Stage II, the CP decides the real-time data sponsoring strategy for each content request within the period. We first propose a Lyapunov-based online sponsoring strategy in Stage II, which reaches 90% of the offline maximum performance (benchmark). We then solve the edge caching problem in Stage I based on the online sponsoring strategy proposed in Stage II, and show that the optimal caching policy depends on the aggregate user request for each content in each location. Simulations show that such a joint optimization can increase the CP's revenue by 30%~100%, comparing with the purely data sponsoring (i.e., without edge caching).
