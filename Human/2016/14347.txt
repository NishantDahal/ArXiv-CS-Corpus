Increasing Wireless Sensor Networks Lifetime with New Method

One of the most important issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is severe energy restrictions. As the performance of Sensor Networks is strongly dependence to the network lifetime, researchers seek a way to use node energy supply effectively and increasing network lifetime. As a consequence, it is crucial to use routing algorithms result in decrease energy consumption and better bandwidth utilization. The purpose of this paper is to increase Wireless Sensor Networks lifetime using LEACH-algorithm. So before clustering Network environment, it is divided into two virtual layers (using distance between sensor nodes and base station) and then regarding to sensors position in each of two layers, residual energy of sensor and distance from base station is used in clustering. In this article, we compare proposed algorithm with well-known LEACH and ELEACH algorithms in homogeneous environment (with equal energy for all sensors) and heterogeneous one (energy of half of sensors get doubled), also for static and dynamic situation of base station. Results show that our proposed algorithm delivers improved performance.
