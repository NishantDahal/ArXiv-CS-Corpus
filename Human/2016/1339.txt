Message Encoding and Retrieval for Spread and Cyclic Orbit Codes

Spread codes and cyclic orbit codes are special families of constant dimension subspace codes. These codes have been well-studied for their error correction capability, transmission rate and decoding methods, but the question of how to encode and retrieve messages has not been investigated. In this work we show how a message set of consecutive integers can be encoded and retrieved for these two code families.
