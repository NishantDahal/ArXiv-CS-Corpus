Bayesian Inference of Bijective Non-Rigid Shape Correspondence

Many algorithms for the computation of correspondences between deformable shapes rely on some variant of nearest neighbor matching in a descriptor space. Such are, for example, various point-wise correspondence recovery algorithms used as a postprocessing stage in the functional correspondence framework. In this paper, we show that such frequently used techniques in practice suffer from lack of accuracy and result in poor surjectivity. We propose an alternative recovery technique guaranteeing a bijective correspondence and producing significantly higher accuracy. We derive the proposed method from a statistical framework of Bayesian inference and demonstrate its performance on several challenging deformable 3D shape matching datasets.
