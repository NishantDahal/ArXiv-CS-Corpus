Animated 3D Human Models for Use in Person Recognition Experiments

The development of increasingly realistic experimental stimuli and task environments is important for understanding behavior outside the laboratory. We report a process for generating 3D human model stimuli that combines commonly used graphics software and enables the flexible generation of animated human models while providing parametric control over individualized identity features. Our approach creates novel head models using FaceGen Modeller, attaches them to commercially-purchased 3D avatar bodies in 3D Studio Max, and generates Cal3D human models that are compatible with many virtual 3D environments. Stimuli produced by this method can be embedded as animated 3D avatars in interactive simulations or presented as 2D images embedded in scenes for use in traditional laboratory experiments. The inherent flexibility in this method makes the stimuli applicable to a broad range of basic and applied research questions in the domain of person perception. We describe the steps of the stimulus generation process, provide an example of their use in a recognition memory paradigm, and highlight the adaptability of the method for related avenues of research.
