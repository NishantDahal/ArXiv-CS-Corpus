The high-conductance state enables neural sampling in networks of LIF neurons

The apparent stochasticity of in-vivo neural circuits has long been hypothesized to represent a signature of ongoing stochastic inference in the brain. More recently, a theoretical framework for neural sampling has been proposed, which explains how sample-based inference can be performed by networks of spiking neurons. One particular requirement of this approach is that the neural response function closely follows a logistic curve.
  Analytical approaches to calculating neural response functions have been the subject of many theoretical studies. In order to make the problem tractable, particular assumptions regarding the neural or synaptic parameters are usually made. However, biologically significant activity regimes exist which are not covered by these approaches: Under strong synaptic bombardment, as is often the case in cortex, the neuron is shifted into a high-conductance state (HCS) characterized by a small membrane time constant. In this regime, synaptic time constants and refractory periods dominate membrane dynamics.
  The core idea of our approach is to separately consider two different "modes" of spiking dynamics: burst spiking and transient quiescence, in which the neuron does not spike for longer periods. We treat the former by propagating the PDF of the effective membrane potential from spike to spike within a burst, while using a diffusion approximation for the latter. We find that our prediction of the neural response function closely matches simulation data. Moreover, in the HCS scenario, we show that the neural response function becomes symmetric and can be well approximated by a logistic function, thereby providing the correct dynamics in order to perform neural sampling. We hereby provide not only a normative framework for Bayesian inference in cortex, but also powerful applications of low-power, accelerated neuromorphic systems to relevant machine learning tasks.
