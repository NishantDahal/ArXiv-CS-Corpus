Joint Transmit Power and Relay Two-Way Beamforming Optimization for Energy-Harvesting Full-Duplex Communications

This paper studies the joint optimization problem of two-way relay beamforming, the receiver power splitting (PS) ratio as well as the transmit power at the sources to maximize the achievable sum-rate of a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with a full-duplex (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) amplify and forward (AF) relay, assuming perfect channel state information (CSI). In particular, our contribution is an iterative algorithm based on the difference of convex programming (DC) and one dimensional searching to achieve the joint solution. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
