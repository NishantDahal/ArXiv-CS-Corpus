Technical Report: Sleep-Route - Routing through Sleeping Sensors

In this article, we propose an energy-efficient data gathering scheme for wireless sensor network called Sleep-Route, which splits the sensor nodes into two sets - active and dormant (low-power sleep). Only the active set of sensor nodes participate in data collection. The sensing values of the dormant sensor nodes are predicted with the help of an active sensor node. Virtual Sensing Framework (VSF) provides the mechanism to predict the sensing values by exploiting the data correlation among the sensor nodes. If the number of active sensor nodes can be minimized, a lot of energy can be saved. The active nodes' selection must fulfill the following constraints - (i) the set of active nodes are sufficient to predict the sensing values of the dormant nodes, (ii) each active sensor nodes can report their data to the sink node (directly or through some other active node(s)). The goal is to select a minimal number of active sensor nodes so that energy savings can be maximized.
  The optimal set of active node selection raise a combinatorial optimization problem, which we refer as Sleep-Route problem. We show that Sleep-Route problem is NP-hard. Then, we formulate an integer linear program (ILP) to solve the problem optimally. To solve the problem in polynomial time, we also propose a heuristic algorithm that performs near optimally.
