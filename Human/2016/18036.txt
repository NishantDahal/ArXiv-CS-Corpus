VR 'SPACE OPERA': Mimetic Spectralism in an Immersive Starlight Audification System

This paper describes a system designed as part of an interactive VR opera, which immerses a real-time composer and an audience (via a network) in the historical location of Gobeklitepe, in southern Turkey during an imaginary scenario set in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period (8500-5500 BCE), viewed by some to be the earliest example of a temple, or observatory. In this scene music is generated, where the harmonic material is determined based on observations of light variation from pulsating stars, that would have theoretically been overhead on the 1st of October 8000 BC at 23:00 and animal calls based on the reliefs in the temple. Based on the observations of the stars V465 Per, HD 217860, 16 Lac, BG CVn and KIC 6382916, frequency collections were derived and applied to the generation of musical sound and notation sequences within a custom VR environment using a novel method incorporating spectralist techniques. Parameters controlling this 'resynthesis' can be manipulated by the performer using a Leap Motion controller and Oculus Rift HMD, yielding both sonic and visual results in the environment. The final opera is to be viewed via Google Cardboard and delivered over the Internet. This entire process aims to pose questions about real-time composition through time distortion and invoke a sense of wonder and meaningfulness through a ritualistic experience.
