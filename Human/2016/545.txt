On an application of multidimensional arrays

This article discusses some difficulties in the implementation of combinatorial algorithms associated with the choice of all elements with certain properties among the elements of a set with great cardinality.The problem has been resolved by using multidimensional arrays. Illustration of the method is a solution of the problem of obtaining one representative from each equivalence class with respect to the described in the article equivalence relation in the set of all $m\sim n$ binary matrices. This equivalence relation has an application in the mathematical modeling in the textile industry.
