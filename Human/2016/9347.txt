One-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem with Divisible Items

This paper considers the one-dimensional cutting stock problem with divisible items, which is a new problem in the cutting stock literature. The problem exists in steel industries. In the new problem, each item can be divided into smaller pieces, then they can be recombined again by welding. The objective is to minimize both the trim loss and the number of the welds. We present a mathematical model and a dynamic programming based heuristic for the problem. Furthermore, a software, which is based on the proposed heuristic algorithm, is developed to use in MKA company, and its performance is analyzed by solving real-life problems in the steel industry. The computational experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.
