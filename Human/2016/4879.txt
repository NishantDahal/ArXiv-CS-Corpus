Persuasive Technologies for Sustainable Urban Mobility

In recent years, the persuasive interventions for inducing sustainable urban mobility behaviours has become a very active research field. This review paper systematically analyses existing approaches and prototype systems and describes and classifies the persuasive strategies used for changing behaviour in the domain of transport. It also studies the results and recommendations derived from pilot studies, and as a result of this analysis highlights the need for personalizing and tailoring persuasive technology to various user characteristics. We also discuss the possible role of context-aware persuasive systems for increasing the number of sustainable choices. Finally, recommendations for future investigations on scholarly persuasive systems are proposed.
