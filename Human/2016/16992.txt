Online Top-k-Position Monitoring of Distributed Data Streams

Consider n nodes connected to a single coordinator. Each node receives an individual online data stream of numbers and, at any point in time, the coordinator has to know the k nodes currently observing the largest values, for a given k between 1 and n. We design and analyze an algorithm that solves this problem while bounding the amount of messages exchanged between the nodes and the coordinator. Our algorithm employs the idea of using filters which, intuitively speaking, leads to few messages to be sent, if the new input is "similar" to the previous ones. The algorithm uses a number of messages that is on expectation by a factor of O((log Δ + k) log n) larger than that of an offline algorithm that sets filters in an optimal way, where Δ is upper bounded by the largest value observed by any node.
