Some Open Problems related to Creative Telescoping

Creative telescoping is the method of choice for obtaining information about definite sums or integrals. It has been intensively studied since the early 1990s, and can now be considered as a classical technique in computer algebra. At the same time, it is still subject of ongoing research. In this paper, we present a selection of open problems in this context. We would be curious to hear about any substantial progress on any of these problems.
