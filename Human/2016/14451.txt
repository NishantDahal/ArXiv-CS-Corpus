Query Optimization Techniques In Graph Databases

Graph databases (GDB) have recently been arisen to overcome the limits of traditional databases for storing and managing data with graph-like structure. Today, they represent a requirement for many applications that manage graph-like data, like social networks. Most of the techniques, applied to optimize queries in graph databases, have been used in traditional databases, distribution systems... or they are inspired from graph theory. However, their reuse in graph databases should take care of the main characteristics of graph databases, such as dynamic structure, highly interconnected data, and ability to efficiently access data relationships. In this paper, we survey the query optimization techniques in graph databases. In particular, we focus on the features they have introduced to improve querying graph-like data.
