A heuristic scheme for the Cooperative Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows

The Cooperative Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (COPTW)is a class of problems with some important applications and yet has received relatively little attention. In the COPTW a certain number of team members are required to collect the associated reward from each customer simultaneously and cooperatively. This requirement to have one or more team members simultaneously available at a vertex to collect the reward, poses a challenging OR task. Exact methods are not able to handle large scale instances of the COPTW and no heuristic schemes have been developed for this problem so far. In this paper, a new modification to the classical Clarke and Wright saving heuristic is proposed to handle this problem. A new benchmark set generated by adding the resource requirement attribute to the existing benchmarks. The heuristic algorithm followed by boosting operators achieves optimal solutions for 64.5% of instances for which the optimal results are known. The proposed solution approach attains an optimality gap of 2.61% for the same instances and solves benchmarks with realistic size within short computational times.
