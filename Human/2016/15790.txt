Human Task Monitoring and Contextual Analysis for Domain Specific Business Processes

Monitoring the execution of business processes and activities composing them is an essential capability of Business Process Management (BPM) Suites. Human tasks are a particular type of business activities, and the understanding of their execution is essential in effectively managing both the processes and human resources. This paper proposes a monitoring framework with a capability to monitor and analyze the human tasks in a domain specific setting and contextually correlate the task execution patterns to the workload distribution on human users. The framework uses the notion of concept probes that match the business concepts used in definition of business processes. The proposed human task monitoring and contextual analysis (HTMCA) component considers multiple artifacts involved in the execution of a human task, rather than focusing only on classic activity/task metrics retrieved from BPM engines.This approach aspires to provide two main advantages to organizations using it. Firstly, it enhances the understanding of the workload of human users that participate in people-intensive business processes under various roles. Secondly, it gives organizations tools and insight for fine-tuning their user performance taking into account the specific context of their business various artifacts domains. The proposed framework builds on previous work that lays the basis of vendor-independent, concept-centric BPM monitoring, and provides the critical missing element of human task understanding. This has the potential to significantly benefit any BPM deployment and the validation work is in advanced stages of building a full prototype that demonstrates this value in a realistic industrial setting.
