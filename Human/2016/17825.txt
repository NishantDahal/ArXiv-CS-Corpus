The norm of the Fourier transform on compact or discrete abelian groups

We calculate the norm of the Fourier operator from $L^p(X)$ to $L^q(\hat{X})$ when $X$ is an infinite locally compact abelian group that is, furthermore, compact or discrete. This subsumes the sharp Hausdorff-Young inequality on such groups. In particular, we identify the region in $(p,q)$-space where the norm is infinite, generalizing a result of Fournier, and setting up a contrast with the case of finite abelian groups, where the norm was determined by Gilbert and Rzeszotnik. As an application, uncertainty principles on such groups expressed in terms of RÃ©nyi entropies are discussed.
