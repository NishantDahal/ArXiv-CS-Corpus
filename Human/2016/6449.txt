Secure Containers in Android: the Samsung KNOX Case Study

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a growing trend among enterprises, aiming to improve workers' mobility and productivity via their smartphones. The threats and dangers posed by the smartphones to the enterprise are also ever-growing. Such dangers can be mitigated by running the enterprise software inside a "secure container" on the smartphone. In our work we present a systematic assessment of security critical areas in design and implementation of a secure container for Android using reverse engineering and attacker-inspired methods. We do this through a case-study of Samsung KNOX, a real-world product deployed on millions of devices. Our research shows how KNOX security features work behind the scenes and lets us compare the vendor's public security claims against reality. Along the way we identified several design weaknesses and a few vulnerabilities that were disclosed to Samsung.
