Distributed Computation of the Cech Complex and Applications in Wireless Networks

In this paper, we introduce a distributed algorithm to compute thě Cech complex. This algorithm is aimed at solving coverage problems in self organized wireless networks. Two applications based on the distributed computation of thě Cech complex are proposed. The first application detects coverage holes while the later one optimizes coverage of wireless networks.
