Multilevel Threshold Secret and Function Sharing based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem

A recent work of Harn and Fuyou presents the first multilevel (disjunctive) threshold secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this work, we first show that the proposed method is not secure and also fails to work with a certain natural setting of the threshold values on compartments. We then propose a secure scheme that works for all threshold settings. In this scheme, we employ a refined version of Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing with a special and generic Asmuth-Bloom sequence called the {\it anchor sequence}. Based on this idea, we also propose the first multilevel conjunctive threshold secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Lastly, we discuss how the proposed schemes can be used for multilevel threshold function sharing by employing it in a threshold RSA cryptosystem as an example.
