16 QAM Communication with 1-Bit Transmitters

We present a novel non-linear precoding technique for the transmission of 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols in a 1-bit massive multi-user (MU) multipleinput- single-output (MISO) downlink system. We deploy low resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the transmitter for the sake of decreasing the high energy consumption related to the massive MISO system. To mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI) and the distortions due to the low resolution DACs, the minimum bit error ratio (MBER) precoder was introduced in previous work. However, this precoder technique is restricted to quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signaling. Our approach consists in upgrading this method to the transmission of 16 QAM symbols. Simulation results show that the performance in terms of uncoded BER is significantly improved for larger massive MISO gain.
