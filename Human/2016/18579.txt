The Python user interface of the elsA cfd software: a coupling framework for external steering layers

The Python--elsA user interface of the elsA cfd (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software has been developed to allow users to specify simulations with confidence, through a global context of description objects grouped inside scripts. The software main features are generated documentation, context checking and completion, and helpful error management. Further developments have used this foundation as a coupling framework, allowing (thanks to the descriptive approach) the coupling of external algorithms with the cfd solver in a simple and abstract way, leading to more success in complex simulations. Along with the description of the technical part of the interface, we try to gather the salient points pertaining to the psychological viewpoint of user experience (ux). We point out the differences between user interfaces and pure data management systems such as cgns.
