Notes on geometry of locomotion of 3-dimensional version of the Purcell's swimmer

We present a generalized, 3 dimensional version of the Purcell's swimmer which is a planar mechanism locomoting at low Reynlods number regime. We use Cox theory and resistive force theory to come up with the forces acting on the system. We finally come up with a purely kinematic form of the system's equations.
