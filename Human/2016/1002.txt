The rational homology of the outer automorphism group of $F_7$

We compute the homology groups $H_*(\operatorname{Out}(F_7);\mathbb Q)$ of the outer automorphism group of the free group of rank $7$.
  We produce in this manner the first rational homology classes of $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$ that are neither constant ($*=0$) nor Morita classes ($*=2n-4$).
