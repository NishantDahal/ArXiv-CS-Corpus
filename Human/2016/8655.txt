A Consumer Focused Open Data Platform

Open data has been around for many years but with the advancement of technology and its steady adoption by businesses and governments it promises to create new opportunities for the advancement of society as a whole. Many popular open data platforms have focused on solving the problems faced by the data producer and offers limited support for the data consumers in the way of tools and supported processes for easy access, modeling and mining of data within the various platforms. In this paper we present the specifications for a data consumer oriented platform for open data, the Data-TAP. We demonstrate how this platform is able to (a) meet the goal of leveraging the data resources of existing Open Data platforms, (b) provide a means to standardize and structure data to allow for the merging of related data resources and (c) use a rule-based method for parsing resources. This paper will show how Data-TAP provides an easy to use and understand interface for making open data friendlier for consumers.
