Temporal Correlation of Interference in Bounded Mobile Ad Hoc Networks with Blockage

In mobile wireless networks with blockage, different users, and/or a single user at different time slots, may be blocked by some common obstacles. Therefore the temporal correlation of interference does not depend only on the user displacement law but also on the spatial correlation introduced by the obstacles. In this letter, we show that in mobile networks with a high density of users, blockage increases the temporal correlation of interference, while in sparse networks blockage has the opposite effect.
