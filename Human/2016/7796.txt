Achievable Rate Regions for Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channels with Rate-limited Feedback

Achievable rate regions for cooperative relay broadcast channels with rate-limited feedback are proposed. Specifically, we consider two-receiver memoryless broadcast channels where each receiver sends feedback signals to the transmitter through a noiseless and rate-limited feedback link, and meanwhile, acts as relay to transmit cooperative information to the other receiver. It's shown that the proposed rate regions improve on the known regions that consider either relaying cooperation or feedback communication, but not both.
