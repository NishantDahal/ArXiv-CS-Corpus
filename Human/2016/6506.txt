K-method of cognitive mapping analysis

Introduced a new calculation method (K-method) for cognitive maps. K - method consists of two consecutive steps. In the first stage, allocated subgraph composed of all paths from one selected node (concept) to another node (concept) from the cognitive map (directed weighted graph) . In the second stage, after the transition to an undirected graph (symmetrization adjacency matrix) the influence of one node to another calculated with Kirchhoff method. In the proposed method, there is no problem inherent in the impulse method. In addition to "pair" influence of one node to another, the average characteristics are introduced, allowing to calculate the impact of the selected node to all other nodes and the influence of all on the one selected. For impulse method similar to the average characteristics in the case where the pulse method "works" are introduced and compared with the K-method.
