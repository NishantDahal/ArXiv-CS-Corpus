Dynamical Behavior Investigation and Analysis of Novel Mechanism for Simulated Spherical Robot named "RollRoller"

This paper introduces a simulation study of fluid actuated multi-driven closed system as spherical mobile robot called "RollRoller". Robot's mechanism design consists of two essential parts: tubes to lead a core and mechanical controlling parts to correspond movements. Our robot gets its motivation force by displacing the spherical movable mass known as core in curvy manners inside certain pipes. This simulation investigates by explaining the mechanical and structural features of the robot for creating hydraulic-base actuation via force and momentum analysis. Next, we categorize difficult and integrated 2D motions to omit unstable equilibrium points through derived nonlinear dynamics. We propose an algorithmic position control in forward direction that creates hybrid model as solution for motion planning problem in spherical robot. By deriving nonlinear dynamics of the spherical robot and implementing designed motion planning, we show how RollRoller can be efficient in high speed movements in comparison to the other pendulum-driven models. Then, we validate the results of this position control obtained by nonlinear dynamics via Adams/view simulation which uses the imported solid model of RollRoller. Lastly, We have a look to the circular maneuver of this robot by the same simulator.
