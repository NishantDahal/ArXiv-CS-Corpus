A New Energy Efficient MAC Protocol based on Redundant Radix for Wireless Networks

In this paper, we first propose a redundant radix based number (RBN) representation for encoding the data to be transmitted in a wireless network. This RBN encoding uses three possible values - 0, 1 and $\bar 1$, for each digit to be transmitted. We then propose to use silent periods (zero energy transmission) for transmitting the 0's in the RBN encoded data thus obtained. This is in contrast to most conventional communication strategies that utilize energy based transmission (EbT) schemes, where energy expenditure occurs for transmitting both 0 and 1 bit values. The binary to RBN conversion algorithm presented here offers a significant reduction in the number of non-zero bits in the resulting RBN encoded data. As a result, it provides a highly energy-efficient technique for data transmission with silent periods for transmitting 0's. We simulated our proposed technique with ideal radio device characteristics and also with parameters of various commercially available radio devices. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that with ideal as well as some commercial device characteristics, our proposed transmission scheme requires 69% less energy on an average, compared to the energy based transmission schemes. This makes it very attractive for application scenarios where the devices are highly energy constrained. Finally, based on this transmission strategy, we have designed a MAC protocol that would support the communication of such RBN encoded data frames.
