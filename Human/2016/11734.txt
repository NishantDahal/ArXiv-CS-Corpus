Reliable Deniable Communication: Hiding Messages in Noise

A transmitter Alice may wish to reliably transmit a message to a receiver Bob over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), while simultaneously ensuring that her transmission is deniable from an eavesdropper Willie. That is, if Willie listening to Alice's transmissions over a "significantly noisier" BSC than the one to Bob, he should be unable to estimate even whether Alice is transmitting. We consider two scenarios. In our first scenario, we assume that the channel transition probability from Alice to Bob and Willie is perfectly known to all parties. Here, even when Alice's (potential) communication scheme is publicly known to Willie (with no common randomness between Alice and Bob), we prove that over 'n' channel uses Alice can transmit a message of length O(sqrt{n}) bits to Bob, deniably from Willie. We also prove information-theoretic order-optimality of this result. In our second scenario, we allow uncertainty in the knowledge of the channel transition probability parameters. In particular, we assume that the channel transition probabilities for both Bob and Willie are uniformly drawn from a known interval. Here, we show that, in contrast to the previous setting, Alice can communicate O(n) bits of message reliably and deniably (again, with no common randomness). We give both an achievability result and a matching converse for this setting. Our work builds upon the work of Bash et al on AWGN channels (but with common randomness) and differs from other recent works (by Wang et al and Bloch) in two important ways - firstly our deniability metric is variational distance (as opposed to Kullback-Leibler divergence), and secondly, our techniques are significantly different from these works.
