Nonlinear Chaotic Processing Model

Designing chaotic maps with complex dynamics is a challenging topic. This paper introduces the nonlinear chaotic processing (NCP) model, which contains six basic nonlinear operations. Each operation is a general framework that can use existing chaotic maps as seed maps to generate a huge number of new chaotic maps. The proposed NCP model can be easily extended by introducing new nonlinear operations or by arbitrarily combining existing ones. The properties and chaotic behaviors of the NCP model are investigated. To show its effectiveness and usability, as examples, we provide four new chaotic maps generated by the NCP model and evaluate their chaotic performance using Lyapunov exponent, Shannon entropy, correlation dimension and initial state sensitivity. The experimental results show that these chaotic maps have more complex chaotic behaviors than existing ones.
