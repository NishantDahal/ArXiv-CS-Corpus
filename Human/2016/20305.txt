Permutations via linear translators

We show that many infinite classes of permutations over finite fields can be constructed via translators with a large choice of parameters. We first charac- terize some functions having linear translators, based on which several families of permutations are then derived. Extending the results of [10], we give in several cases the compositional inverse of these permutations. The connection with complete permutations is also utilized to provide further infinite classes of permutations. Moreover, we propose new tools to study permutations of the form x is mapped to x+(x^(p^m) - x+ lambda)^s and a few infinite classes of permutations of this form are proposed.
