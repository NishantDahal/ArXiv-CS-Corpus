Optimal Spread in Network Consensus Models

In a model of network communication based on a random walk in an undirected graph, what subset of nodes (subject to constraints on the set size), enable the fastest spread of information? The dynamics of spread is described by a process dual to the movement from informed to uninformed nodes. In this setting, an optimal set $A$ minimizes the sum of the expected first hitting times $F(A)$, of random walks that start at nodes outside the set.
  In this paper,the problem is reformulated so that the search for solutions is restricted to a class of optimal and "near" optimal subsets of the graph. We introduce a submodular, non-decreasing rank function $ρ$, that permits some comparison between the solution obtained by the classical greedy algorithm and one obtained by our methods. The supermodularity and non-increasing properties of $F$ are used to show that the rank of our solution is at least $(1-\frac{1}{e})$ times the rank of the optimal set. When the solution has a higher rank than the greedy solution this constant can be improved to $(1-\frac{1}{e})(1+χ)$ where $χ>0$ is determined a posteriori. The method requires the evaluation of $F$ for sets of some fixed cardinality $m$, where $m$ is much smaller than the cardinality of the optimal set. When $F$ has forward elemental curvature $κ$, we can provide a rough description of the trade-off between solution quality and computational effort $m$ in terms of $κ$.
