On Selecting a Conjunction Operation in Probabilistic Soft Logic

Probabilistic Soft Logic has been proposed and used in several applications as an efficient way to deal with inconsistency, uncertainty and relational representation. In several applications, this approach has led to an adequate description of the corresponding human reasoning. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for one of the semi-heuristic choices made in this approach: namely, we explain the choice of the corresponding conjunction operations. Our explanation leads to a more general family of operations which may be used in future applications of probabilistic soft logic.
