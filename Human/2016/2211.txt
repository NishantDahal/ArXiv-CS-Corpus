Towards Innovative Physical Layer Design for Mobile WSN Platforms

We today live in the era of dynamic and mobile wireless enabled platforms. This kind of stringent communication capability in the face of volatile and turbulent mobility demands a fresh look at physical layer in general and antenna design in particular. The dimension of the antenna is 30x35x1.6 mm^3. Multiplicity of bands is very useful for compatibility purposes where legacy robotic platforms generally operate in MHz range while latest robotic platforms are capable to handle GHz communication regimes and can pump data very at much greater speeds. Seven frequency bands are obtained at 700 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz, 4.37 GHz, 5.8 GHz, 6.93 GHz and 7.7 GHz with bandwidth of 1.1 GHz, 0.7 GHz, 0.8 GHz, 0.23 GHz, 0.90 GHz, 0.19 GHz and 0.12 GHz respectively.
