Thirteen Years of Mining Software Repositories (MSR) Conference - What is the Bibliography Data Telling Us?

The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference is a reputed, long-running and flagship conference in the area of Software Analytics which has successfully completed more than one decade as of year 2016. We conduct a bibliometric and scientific publication mining based study to study how the conference has evolved over the recent past 13 years (from 2004 to 2007 as a workshop and then from 2008 to 2016 as a conference). Our objective is to perform an examination of the state of MSR so that the MSR community can identify strengths, areas of improvements and future directions for the conference.
