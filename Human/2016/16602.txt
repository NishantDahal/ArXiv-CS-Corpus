Borel-piecewise continuous reducibility for uniformization problems

We study a fine hierarchy of Borel-piecewise continuous functions, especially, between closed-piecewise continuity and $G_δ$-piecewise continuity. Our aim is to understand how a priority argument in computability theory is connected to the notion of $G_δ$-piecewise continuity, and then we utilize this connection to obtain separation results on subclasses of $G_δ$-piecewise continuous reductions for uniformization problems on set-valued functions with compact graphs. This method is also applicable for separating various non-constructive principles in the Weihrauch lattice.
