Optimal Resource Allocation for Cellular Networks with MATLAB Instructions

This report presents a more detailed description of the algorithm and simulations published in papers [1, 2]. It includes a step by step description of the algorithm and included the corresponding flow chart. In addition, detailed instructions of the MATLAB code used to simulate the proposed allocation algorithm in [1, 2] is presented. The report starts with a brief motivation of resource allocation problem in wireless networks. Then, some of the prior related work on the subject are mentioned. Finally, we provide the details instructions on MATLAB functions used in our algorithm. More rigorous analysis and proofs of the problem and algorithm are present in [1, 2] and further discussions presented in [3, 4].
