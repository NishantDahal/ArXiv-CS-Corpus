Stream Clustering using Probabilistic Data Structures

Most density based stream clustering algorithms separate the clustering process into an online and offline component. Exact summarized statistics are being employed for defining micro-clusters or grid cells during the online stage followed by macro-clustering during the offline stage. This paper proposes a novel alternative to the traditional two phase stream clustering scheme, introducing sketch-based data structures for assessing both stream density and cluster membership with probabilistic accuracy guarantees. A count-min sketch using a damped window model estimates stream density. Bloom filters employing a variation of active-active buffering estimate cluster membership. Instances of both types of sketches share the same set of hash functions. The resulting stream clustering algorithm is capable of detecting arbitrarily shaped clusters while correctly handling outliers and making no assumption on the total number of clusters. Experimental results over a number of real and synthetic datasets illustrate the proposed algorithm quality and efficiency.
