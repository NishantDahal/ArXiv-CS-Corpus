Joint Source-Channel Decoding of Polar Codes for Language-Based Source

We exploit the redundancy of the language-based source to help polar decoding. By judging the validity of decoded words in the decoded sequence with the help of a dictionary, the polar list decoder constantly detects erroneous paths after every few bits are decoded. This path-pruning technique based on joint decoding has advantages over stand-alone polar list decoding in that most decoding errors in early stages are corrected. In order to facilitate the joint decoding, we first propose a construction of dynamic dictionary using a trie and show an efficient way to trace the dictionary during decoding. Then we propose a joint decoding scheme of polar codes taking into account both information from the channel and the source. The proposed scheme has the same decoding complexity as the list decoding of polar codes. A list-size adaptive joint decoding is further implemented to largely reduce the decoding complexity. We conclude by simulation that the joint decoding schemes outperform stand-alone polar codes with CRC-aided successive cancellation list decoding by over 0.6 dB.
