Biobjective Performance Assessment with the COCO Platform

This document details the rationales behind assessing the performance of numerical black-box optimizers on multi-objective problems within the COCO platform and in particular on the biobjective test suite bbob-biobj. The evaluation is based on a hypervolume of all non-dominated solutions in the archive of candidate solutions and measures the runtime until the hypervolume value succeeds prescribed target values.
