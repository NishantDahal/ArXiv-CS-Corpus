Two-grid algorithms for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems on layer adapted meshes

We propose a new two-grid approach based on Bellman-Kalaba quasilinearization and Axelsson-Xu finite element two-grid method for the solution of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. The algorithms involve solving one inexpensive problem on coarse grid and solving on fine grid one linear problem obtained by quasilinearization of the differential equation about an interpolant of the computed solution on the coarse grid. Different meshes (of Bakhvalov, Shishkin and VulanoviÄ‡ types) are examined. All the schemes are uniformly convergent with respect to the small parameter. We show theoretically and numerically that the global error of the two-grid method is the same as of the nonlinear problem solved directly on the fine layer-adapted mesh.
