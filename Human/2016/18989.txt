Interaktion mit 3D-Objekten in Augmented Reality Anwendungen auf mobilen Android Ger√§ten

This bachelor's thesis describes the conception and implementation of an augmented reality application for the Android platform. The intention is to demonstrate some possibilities of interaction within an augmented reality environment on mobile devices. For that purpose, a 3D-model is displayed on the devices' touchscreen using marker-based tracking. This enables the user to translate, rotate or scale the model as he wishes. He can additionally select and highlight preassigned parts of the model to display specific information for that element. To assist developers in modifying the application for changing requirements without re-writing large portions of the source code, the information for each part have been encapsulated into its own data type. After an introduction to augmented reality, its underlying technology and the Android platform, some possible usage scenarios and the resulting functionalities are outlined. Finally, the design as well as the developed implementation are described.
