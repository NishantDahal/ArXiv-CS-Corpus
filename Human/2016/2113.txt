Minimum Distances of the QC-LDPC Codes in IEEE 802 Communication Standards

This work applies earlier results on Quasi-Cyclic (QC) LDPC codes to the codes specified in six separate IEEE 802 standards, specifying wireless communications from 54 MHz to 60 GHz. First, we examine the weight matrices specified to upper bound the codes' minimum distance independent of block length. Next, we search for the minimum distance achieved for the parity check matrices selected at each block length. Finally, solutions to the computational challenges encountered are addressed.
