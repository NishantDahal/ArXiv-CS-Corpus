A General World Model with Poiesis: Poppers Three Worlds updated with Software

With the famous Three Worlds of Karl Popper as template, the paper rigorously introduces the concept of software to define the counterpart of the physical subworld. Digesting the scientific-technical view of biology and neurology on a high level, results in an updated Three Worlds scheme consistent with an information technical view. Chance and mathematics complete the world model. Some simple examples illustrate the move from Poppers view of the world with physics, psyche and World 3, to a new extended model with physics, extended software (which we call Poiesis), and Geist (the notion which embodies spirit, mind and soul).
