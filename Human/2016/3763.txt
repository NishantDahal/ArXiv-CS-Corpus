Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Full-Duplex Communication Systems

This paper considers the problem of maximizing the sum-rate for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a full-duplex bi-directional communication system subject to energy harvesting and transmit power constraints at both nodes. We investigate the optimum design of the receive power splitters and transmit powers for SWIPT in full-duplex mode. Exploiting rate-split method, an iterative algorithm is derived to solve the non-convex problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is justified through numerical simulations.
