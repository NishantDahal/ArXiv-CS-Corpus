A Mid-level Planning System for Object Reorientation

This paper presents a mid-level planning system for object reorientation. It includes a grasp planner, a placement planner, and a regrasp sequence solver. Given the initial and goal poses of an object, the mid-level planning system finds a sequence of hand configurations that reorient the object from the initial to the goal. This mid-level planning system is open to low-level motion planning algorithm by providing two end-effector poses as the input. It is also open to high-level symbolic planners by providing interface functions like placing an object to a given position at a given rotation. The planning system is demonstrated with several simulation examples and real-robot executions using a Kawada Hiro robot and Robotiq 85 grippers.
