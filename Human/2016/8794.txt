Joint Data Compression and MAC Protocol Design for Smartgrids with Renewable Energy

In this paper, we consider the joint design of data compression and 802.15.4-based medium access control (MAC) protocol for smartgrids with renewable energy. We study the setting where a number of nodes, each of which comprises electricity load and/or renewable sources, report periodically their injected powers to a data concentrator. Our design exploits the correlation of the reported data in both time and space to efficiently design the data compression using the compressed sensing (CS) technique and theMAC protocol so that the reported data can be recovered reliably within minimum reporting time. Specifically, we perform the following design tasks: i) we employ the two-dimensional (2D) CS technique to compress the reported data in the distributed manner; ii) we propose to adapt the 802.15.4 MAC protocol frame structure to enable efficient data transmission and reliable data reconstruction; and iii) we develop an analytical model based on which we can obtain efficient MAC parameter configuration to minimize the reporting delay. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework compared to existing solutions.
