On optimal constacyclic codes

In this paper we investigate the class of constacyclic codes, which is a natural generalization of the class of cyclic and negacyclic codes. This class of codes is interesting in the sense that it contains codes with good or even optimal parameters. In this light, we propose constructions of families of classical block and convolutional maximum-distance-separable (MDS) constacyclic codes, as well as families of asymmetric quantum MDS codes derived from (classical-block) constacyclic codes. These results are mainly derived from the investigation of suitable properties on cyclotomic cosets of these corresponding codes.
