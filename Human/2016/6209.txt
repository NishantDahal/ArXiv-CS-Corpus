Chaotic trigonometric Haar wavelet with focus on image encryption

In this paper, after reviewing the main points of Haar wavelet transform and chaotic trigonometric maps, we introduce a new perspective of Haar wavelet transform. The essential idea of the paper is given linearity properties of the scaling function of the Haar wavelet. With regard to applications of Haar wavelet transform in image processing, we introduce chaotic trigonometric Haar wavelet transform to encrypt the plain images. In addition, the encrypted images based on a proposed algorithm were made. To evaluate the security of the encrypted images, the key space analysis, the correlation coefficient analysis and differential attack were performed. Here, the chaotic trigonometric Haar wavelet transform tries to improve the problem of failure of encryption such as small key space and level of security.
