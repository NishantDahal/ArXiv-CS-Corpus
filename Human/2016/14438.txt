Behavioural Prototypes

We sketch a simple language of concurrent objects which explores the design space between type systems and continuous testing. In our language, programs are collections of communicating automata checked automatically for multiparty compatibility. This property, taken from the session types literature but here applied to terms rather than types, guarantees that no state-related errors arise during execution: no object gets stuck because it was sent the wrong message, and every message is processed.
