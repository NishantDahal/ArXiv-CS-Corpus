Asymptotic sequential Rademacher complexity of a finite function class

For a finite function class we describe the large sample limit of the sequential Rademacher complexity in terms of the viscosity solution of a $G$-heat equation. In the language of Peng's sublinear expectation theory, the same quantity equals to the expected value of the largest order statistics of a multidimensional $G$-normal random variable. We illustrate this result by deriving upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic sequential Rademacher complexity.
