Decoupled Uplink and Downlink in a Wireless System with Buffer-Aided Relaying

The paper treats a multiuser relay scenario where multiple user equipments (UEs) have a two-way communication with a common Base Station (BS) in the presence of a buffer-equipped Relay Station (RS). Each of the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmission can take place over a direct or over a relayed path. Traditionally, the UL and the DL path of a given two-way link are coupled, that is, either both are direct links or both are relayed links. By removing the restriction for coupling, one opens the design space for a decoupled two-way links. Following this, we devise two protocols: orthogonal decoupled UL/DL buffer-aided (ODBA) relaying protocol and non-orthogonal decoupled UL/DL buffer-aided (NODBA) relaying protocol. In NODBA, the receiver can use successive interference cancellation (SIC) to extract the desired signal from a collision between UL and DL signals. For both protocols, we characterize the transmission decision policies in terms of maximization of the average two-way sum rate of the system. The numerical results show that decoupling association and non-orthogonal radio access lead to significant throughput gains for two-way traffic.
