Unconstrained Two-parallel-plane Model for Focused Plenoptic Cameras Calibration

The plenoptic camera can capture both angular and spatial information of the rays, enabling 3D reconstruction by single exposure. The geometry of the recovered scene structure is affected by the calibration of the plenoptic camera significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel unconstrained two-parallel-plane (TPP) model with 7 parameters to describe a 4D light field. By reconstructing scene points from ray-ray association, a 3D projective transformation is deduced to establish the relationship between the scene structure and the TPP parameters. Based on the transformation, we simplify the focused plenoptic camera as a TPP model and calibrate its intrinsic parameters. Our calibration method includes a close-form solution and a nonlinear optimization by minimizing re-projection error. Experiments on both simulated data and real scene data verify the performance of the calibration on the focused plenoptic camera.
