Privacy as a Service in Digital Health

Privacy is a key challenge for continued digitalization of health. The forthcoming European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is transforming this challenge into regulatory directives. User consent provisioning and coordinating across data services will be the keys in addressing this challenge. We suggest a privacy-driven architecture that provides tools for providing user consent as a service. This enables managing and reusing private health information between a large amount of data sources, individuals and services, even when they are not known beforehand. The proposed architecture integrates data security and semantic descriptions into a trust query framework to provide the required interoperability and co-operation support for future health services. This approach provides benefits for all stakeholders through safer data management, cost and process savings, multi-provider services, and services based on emerging new business models.
