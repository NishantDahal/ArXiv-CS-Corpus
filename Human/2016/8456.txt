Domain Name System Security and Privacy: Old Problems and New Challenges

The domain name system (DNS) is an important protocol in today's Internet operation, and is the standard naming convention between domain names, names that are easy to read, understand, and remember by humans, to IP address of Internet resources. The wealth of research activities on DNS in general and security and privacy in particular suggest that all problems in this domain are solved. Reality however is that despite the large body of literature on various aspects of DNS, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we review the various activities in the research community on DNS operation, security, and privacy, and outline various challenges and open research directions that need to be tackled.
