Modeling Information Diffusion in Social Networks

One major feature of social networks (e.g., massive online social networks) is the dissemination of information, such as news, rumors and opinions. Information can be propagated via natural connections in written, oral or electronic forms. The physics of information diffusion has been changed with the mainstream adoption of the Internet and Web. Until a few years ago, the major barrier for someone who wanted a piece of information to spread through a community was the cost of the technical infrastructure required to reach a large number of people. Today, with widespread access to the Internet, this bottleneck has largely been removed. Information diffusion has been one of the focuses in social network research area, due to its importance in social interactions and everyday life. More recently, during the last twenty to thirty years, there has been interest and attention not just in observing information and innovation flow, but also in influencing and creating them. Modeling information diffusion in networks enables us to reason about its spread.
