A Non Linear Approach towards Automated Emotion Analysis in Hindustani Music

In North Indian Classical Music, raga forms the basic structure over which individual improvisations is performed by an artist based on his/her creativity. The Alap is the opening section of a typical Hindustani Music (HM) performance, where the raga is introduced and the paths of its development are revealed using all the notes used in that particular raga and allowed transitions between them with proper distribution over time. In India, corresponding to each raga, several emotional flavors are listed, namely erotic love, pathetic, devotional, comic, horrific, repugnant, heroic, fantastic, furious, peaceful. The detection of emotional cues from Hindustani Classical music is a demanding task due to the inherent ambiguity present in the different ragas, which makes it difficult to identify any particular emotion from a certain raga. In this study we took the help of a high resolution mathematical microscope (MFDFA or Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) to procure information about the inherent complexities and time series fluctuations that constitute an acoustic signal. With the help of this technique, 3 min alap portion of six conventional ragas of Hindustani classical music namely, Darbari Kanada, Yaman, Mian ki Malhar, Durga, Jay Jayanti and Hamswadhani played in three different musical instruments were analyzed. The results are discussed in detail.
