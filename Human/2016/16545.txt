On the cryptanalysis of Fridrich's chaotic image encryption scheme

Utilizing complex dynamics of chaotic maps and systems in encryption was studied comprehensively in the past two and a half decades. In 1989, Fridrich's chaotic image encryption scheme was designed by iterating chaotic position permutation and value substitution some rounds, which received intensive attention in the field of chaos-based cryptography. In 2010, Solak \textit{et al.} proposed a chosen-ciphertext attack on the Fridrich's scheme utilizing influence network between cipher-pixels and the corresponding plain-pixels. Based on their creative work, this paper scrutinized some properties of Fridrich's scheme with concise mathematical language. Then, some minor defects of the real performance of Solak's attack method were given. The work provides some bases for further optimizing attack on the Fridrich's scheme and its variants.
