Using emulation to validate applications on opportunistic networks

The increasing trend on wireless-connected devices makes opportunistic networking a promising alternative to existing infrastructure-based networks. However, on these networks there is neither guarantee about the availability of the connections nor on the topology of the network. The development of opportunistic applications, i.e., applications running over opportunistic networks, is still in early stages. This is due to lack of tools to support the process in such uncertain conditions. Indeed, many tools have been introduced to study and characterize opportunistic networks, but none of them is focused on helping developers to conceive opportunistic applications. In this paper, we argue that the gap between opportunistic applications development and network characterization can be filled with network emulation. First, this position paper points out important challenges about the development of opportunistic applications. Then, in order to cope with these challenges, it details a set of requirements that an emulator should meet to allow the testing of such applications.
