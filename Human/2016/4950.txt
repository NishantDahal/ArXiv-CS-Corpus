A hybrid approach for cooperative output regulation with sampled compensator

This work investigates the cooperative output regulation problem of linear multi-agent systems with hybrid sampled data control. Due to the limited data sensing and communication, in many practical situations, only sampled data are available for the cooperation of multi-agent systems. To overcome this problem, a distributed hybrid controller is presented for the cooperative output regulation, and cooperative output regulation is achieved by well designed state feedback law. Then it proposed a method for the designing of sampled data controller to solve the cooperative output regulation problem with continuous linear systems and discrete-time communication data. Finally, numerical simulation example for cooperative tracking and a simulation example for optimal control of micro-grids are proposed to illustrate the result of the sampled data control law.
