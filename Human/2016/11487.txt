Vectorization of Multibyte Floating Point Data Formats

We propose a scheme for reduced-precision representation of floating point data on a continuum between IEEE-754 floating point types. Our scheme enables the use of lower precision formats for a reduction in storage space requirements and data transfer volume. We describe how our scheme can be accelerated using existing hardware vector units on a general-purpose processor (GPP). Exploiting native vector hardware allows us to support reduced precision floating point with low overhead. We demonstrate that supporting reduced precision in the compiler as opposed to using a library approach can yield a low overhead solution for GPPs.
