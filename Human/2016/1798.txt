Secret Sharing Homomorphism and Secure E-voting

Secure E-voting is a challenging protocol. Several approaches based on homomorphic crypto systems, mix-nets blind signatures are proposed in the literature .But most of them need complicated homomorphic encryption which involves complicated encryption decryption process and key management which is not efficient. In this paper we propose a secure and efficient E-voting scheme based on secret sharing homomorphism. Here E-voting is viewed as special case of multi party computation where several voters jointly compute the result without revealing his vote. Secret sharing schemes are good alternative for secure multi party computation and are computationally efficient and secure compared with the cryptographic techniques. It is the first proposal, which makes use of the additive homomorphic property of the Shamir secret sharing scheme and the encoding decoding of votes to obtain the individual votes obtained by each candidate apart from the election result. We have achieved integrity and privacy while keeping the efficiency of the system.
