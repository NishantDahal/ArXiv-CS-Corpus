A Novel Scene Text Detection Algorithm Based On Convolutional Neural Network

Candidate text region extraction plays a critical role in convolutional neural network (CNN) based text detection from natural images. In this paper, we propose a CNN based scene text detection algorithm with a new text region extractor. The so called candidate text region extractor I-MSER is based on Maximally Stable Extremal Region (MSER), which can improve the independency and completeness of the extracted candidate text regions. Design of I-MSER is motivated by the observation that text MSERs have high similarity and are close to each other. The independency of candidate text regions obtained by I-MSER is guaranteed by selecting the most representative regions from a MSER tree which is generated according to the spatial overlapping relationship among the MSERs. A multi-layer CNN model is trained to score the confidence value of the extracted regions extracted by the I-MSER for text detection. The new text detection algorithm based on I-MSER is evaluated with wide-used ICDAR 2011 and 2013 datasets and shows improved detection performance compared to the existing algorithms.
