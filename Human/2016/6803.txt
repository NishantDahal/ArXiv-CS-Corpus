The Design of the NetBSD I/O Subsystems

This book describes the source code of the NetBSD Operating System Release 1.6 in SUN UltraSPARC 64-bit platform by annotating related excerpts from references and user manuals on the NetBSD Operating System. The goal of this book is to provide necessary information to understand the operation and the implementation of I/O subsystems in the kernel as well as to design and implement a new filesystem on the NetBSD platform.
