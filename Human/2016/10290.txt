Realistic DNA De-anonymization using Phenotypic Prediction

There are a number of vectors for attack when trying to link an individual to a certain DNA sequence. Phenotypic prediction is one such vector; linking DNA to an individual based on their traits. Current approaches are not overly effective, due to a number of real world considerations. This report will improve upon current phenotypic prediction, and suggest a number of methods for defending against such an attack.
