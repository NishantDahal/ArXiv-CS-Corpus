Linear Regression with an Unknown Permutation: Statistical and Computational Limits

Consider a noisy linear observation model with an unknown permutation, based on observing $y = Π^* A x^* + w$, where $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is an unknown vector, $Π^*$ is an unknown $n \times n$ permutation matrix, and $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is additive Gaussian noise. We analyze the problem of permutation recovery in a random design setting in which the entries of the matrix $A$ are drawn i.i.d. from a standard Gaussian distribution, and establish sharp conditions on the SNR, sample size $n$, and dimension $d$ under which $Π^*$ is exactly and approximately recoverable. On the computational front, we show that the maximum likelihood estimate of $Π^*$ is NP-hard to compute, while also providing a polynomial time algorithm when $d =1$.
