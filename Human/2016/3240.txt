Signed Link Analysis in Social Media Networks

Numerous real-world relations can be represented by signed networks with positive links (e.g., trust) and negative links (e.g., distrust). Link analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the link formation and can advance various tasks in social network analysis such as link prediction. The majority of existing works on link analysis have focused on unsigned social networks. The existence of negative links determines that properties and principles of signed networks are substantially distinct from those of unsigned networks, thus we need dedicated efforts on link analysis in signed social networks. In this paper, following social theories in link analysis in unsigned networks, we adopt three social science theories, namely Emotional Information, Diffusion of Innovations and Individual Personality, to guide the task of link analysis in signed networks.
