Distributed Cooperative Detection for Multi-Receiver Molecular Communication

In this paper, a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication system is considered where distributed receivers collaboratively determine a transmitter's signal. In this system, the receivers first make local hard decisions about the current transmitted bit and then report these decisions to a fusion center (FC). The FC combines the local hard decisions to make a global decision using an N-out-of-K fusion rule. Asymmetric and symmetric topologies are considered and for each topology, two reporting scenarios, namely, perfect reporting and noisy reporting, are addressed. Closed-form analytical expressions for the expected global error probability are derived for all considered topologies and scenarios. Numerical and simulation results show that system reliability can be greatly improved by combining the detection information of distributed receivers.
