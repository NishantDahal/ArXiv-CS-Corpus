Stochastic Geometric Analysis of Energy-Efficient Dense Cellular Networks

Dense cellular networks (DenseNets) are fast becoming a reality with the rapid deployment of base stations (BSs) aimed at meeting the explosive data traffic demand. In legacy systems however this comes with the penalties of higher network interference and energy consumption. In order to support network densification in a sustainable manner, the system behavior should be made 'load-proportional' thus allowing certain portions of the network to activate on-demand. In this work, we develop an analytical framework using tools from stochastic geometry theory for the performance analysis of DenseNets where load-awareness is explicitly embedded in the design. The model leverages on a flexible cellular network architecture where there is a complete separation of the data and signaling communication functionalities. Using the proposed model, we identify the most energy- efficient deployment solution for meeting certain minimum service criteria and analyze the corresponding power savings through dynamic sleep modes. Based on state-of-the-art system parameters, a homogeneous pico deployment for the data plane with a separate layer of signaling macro-cells is revealed to be the most energy-efficient solution in future dense urban environments.
