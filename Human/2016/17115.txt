Generic and Efficient Solution Solves the Shortest Paths Problem in Square Runtime

We study a group of new methods to solve an open problem that is the shortest paths problem on a given fix-weighted instance. It is the real significance at a considerable altitude to reach our aim to meet these qualities of generic, efficiency, precision which we generally require to a methodology. Besides our proof to guarantee our measures might work normally, we pay more interest to root out the vital theory about calculation and logic in favor of our extension to range over a wide field about decision, operator, economy, management, robot, AI and etc.
