Condensedly: comprehending article contents through condensed texts

Summary: Abstracts in biomedical articles can provide a quick overview of the articles but detailed information cannot be obtained without reading full-text contents. Full-text articles certainly generate more information and contents; however, accessing full-text documents is usually time consuming. Condensedly is a web-based application, which provides readers an easy and efficient way to access full-text paragraphs using sentences in abstracts as fishing bait to retrieve the big fish reside in full-text. Condensedly is based on the paragraph ranking algorithm, which evaluates and ranks full-text paragraphs based on their association scores with sentences in abstracts.
