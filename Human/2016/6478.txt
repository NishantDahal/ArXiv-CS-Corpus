Performance Enhancement of the Golden Code by Utilizing ORIOL Antenna

In this paper, a novel method is exposed to improve the performance of the Golden code, by using octagonal reconfigurable isolated orthogonal element (ORIOL) antennas, instead of a conventional microstrip patch antenna. The aforementioned antenna, should be employed in both the transmitter and the receiver sides, to approach the mentioned improvement. As a matter fact, in this paper, we recommend space-time-polarization diversity instead of space-time singly; therefore it is obvious that by employing the aforementioned technique, the system obtains more strength against destructive fading. The simulations for different rates have confirmed that, utilizing ORIOL antenna outperforms patch microstrip one, which is roughly about $2$ to $3$ dB, according to the rates.
