Directed graphs and its Boundary Vertices

Suppose that $D=(V,E)$ is a strongly connected digraph. Let $u,v\in V(D)$. The maximum distance $md (u,v)$ is defined as $md(u,v)$=max\{$\overrightarrow{d}(u,v), \overrightarrow{d}(v,u)$\} where $\overrightarrow{d}(u,v)$ denote the length of a shortest directed $u-v$ path in $D$. This is a metric. The boundary, contour, eccentric and peripheral sets of a strong digraph $D$ are defined with respect to this metric. The main aim of this paper is to identify the above said metrically defined sets of a large strong digraph $D$ in terms of its prime factor decomposition with respect to cartesian product.
