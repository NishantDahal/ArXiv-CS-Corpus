Q-Resolution with Generalized Axioms

Q-resolution is a proof system for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) in prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF) which underlies search-based QBF solvers with clause and cube learning (QCDCL). With the aim to derive and learn stronger clauses and cubes earlier in the search, we generalize the axioms of the Q-resolution calculus resulting in an exponentially more powerful proof system. The generalized axioms introduce an interface of Q-resolution to any other QBF proof system allowing for the direct combination of orthogonal solving techniques. We implemented a variant of the Q-resolution calculus with generalized axioms in the QBF solver DepQBF. As two case studies, we apply integrated SAT solving and resource-bounded QBF preprocessing during the search to heuristically detect potential axiom applications. Experiments with application benchmarks indicate a substantial performance improvement.
