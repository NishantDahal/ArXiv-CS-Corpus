Dynamic Scene Deblurring using a Locally Adaptive Linear Blur Model

State-of-the-art video deblurring methods cannot handle blurry videos recorded in dynamic scenes, since they are built under a strong assumption that the captured scenes are static. Contrary to the existing methods, we propose a video deblurring algorithm that can deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic scenes. To handle general and locally varying blurs caused by various sources, such as moving objects, camera shake, depth variation, and defocus, we estimate pixel-wise non-uniform blur kernels. We infer bidirectional optical flows to handle motion blurs, and also estimate Gaussian blur maps to remove optical blur from defocus in our new blur model. Therefore, we propose a single energy model that jointly estimates optical flows, defocus blur maps and latent frames. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to minimize the proposed energy model. By optimizing the energy model, we achieve significant improvements in removing general blurs, estimating optical flows, and extending depth-of-field in blurry frames. Moreover, in this work, to evaluate the performance of non-uniform deblurring methods objectively, we have constructed a new realistic dataset with ground truths. In addition, extensive experimental on publicly available challenging video data demonstrate that the proposed method produces qualitatively superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods which often fail in either deblurring or optical flow estimation.
