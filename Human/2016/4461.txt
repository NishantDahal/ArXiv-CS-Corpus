Brains and pseudorandom generators

In a pioneering classic, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed a model of the central nervous system; motivated by EEG recordings of normal brain activity, Chv\' atal and Goldsmith asked whether or not this model can be engineered to provide pseudorandom number generators. We supply evidence suggesting that the answer is negative.
