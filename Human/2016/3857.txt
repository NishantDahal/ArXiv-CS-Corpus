Inter-User Interference Coordination in Full-Duplex Systems Based on Geographical Context Information

We propose a coordination scheme to minimize the interference between users in a cellular network with full-duplex base stations and half-duplex user devices. Our scheme exploits signal attenuation from obstacles between the users by (i) extracting spatially isolated regions from a radio map and (ii) assigning simultaneous co-channel uplink and downlink transmissions to users in these regions such that inter-user interference is minimized. While adding low computational complexity and insignificant signaling overhead to existing deployments, evaluating our solution with real coverage data shows impressive gains compared to conventional half-duplex and full-duplex operation.
