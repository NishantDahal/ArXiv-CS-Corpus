K-Bit-Swap: A New Operator For Real-Coded Evolutionary Algorithms

There has been a variety of crossover operators proposed for Real-Coded Genetic Algorithms (RCGAs), which recombine values from the same location in pairs of strings. In this article we present a recombination operator for RC- GAs that selects the locations randomly in both parents, and compare it to mainstream crossover operators in a set of experiments on a range of standard multidimensional optimization problems and a clustering problem. We present two variants of the operator, either selecting both bits uniformly at random in the strings, or sampling the second bit from a normal distribution centered at the selected location in the first string. While the operator is biased towards exploitation of fitness space, the random selection of the second bit for swap- ping makes it slightly less exploitation-biased. Extensive statistical analysis using a non-parametric test shows the advantage of the new recombination operators on a range of test functions.
