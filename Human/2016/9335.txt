Thinking Out Loud and e-Health for Coordinated Care Lessons from User Requirements Gathering in the 4C Project

e-Health is a core part of Australias strategy to address rising costs and changing demands for healthcare services. With over $1bn spent and only 6% of Australians registered, the personally controlled electronic health record (PCEHR) suggests user challenges remain. While evidence confirms the benefits from involving users in systems development there is a need for more examples of how to engage effectively in healthcare settings. This research describes the use of an agile development methodology combined with the thinking out loud technique to deliver a solution that exceeded user requirements in supporting a new model of care. The 4C project solution connected Aged Care institutions with general practices, hospitals and specialist services in Tasmanias north-west region. It was underpinned by a model of Technology Mediated Social Participation (TMSP). As a trial project for the PCEHR it remains unclear why lessons learned appear not to have been deployed more explicitly in the National roll-out.
