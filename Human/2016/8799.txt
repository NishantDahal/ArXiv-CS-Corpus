Distance geometry approach for special graph coloring problems

One of the most important combinatorial optimization problems is graph coloring. There are several variations of this problem involving additional constraints either on vertices or edges. They constitute models for real applications, such as channel assignment in mobile wireless networks. In this work, we consider some coloring problems involving distance constraints as weighted edges, modeling them as distance geometry problems. Thus, the vertices of the graph are considered as embedded on the real line and the coloring is treated as an assignment of positive integers to the vertices, while the distances correspond to line segments, where the goal is to find a feasible intersection of them. We formulate different such coloring problems and show feasibility conditions for some problems. We also propose implicit enumeration methods for some of the optimization problems based on branch-and-prune methods proposed for distance geometry problems in the literature. An empirical analysis was undertaken, considering equality and inequality constraints, uniform and arbitrary set of distances, and the performance of each variant of the method considering the handling and propagation of the set of distances involved.
