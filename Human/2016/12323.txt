A Proposal for the Measurement and Documentation of Research Software Sustainability in Interactive Metadata Repositories

This paper proposes an interactive repository type for research software metadata which measures and documents software sustainability by accumulating metadata, and computing sustainability metrics over them. Such a repository would help to overcome technical barriers to software sustainability by furthering the discovery and identification of sustainable software, thereby also facilitating documentation of research software within the framework of software management plans.
