Towards a global scientific brain: Indicators of researcher mobility using co-affiliation data

This paper analyses the potential use of bibliometric data for mapping and applying network analysis to mobility flows. We show case mobility networks at three different levels of aggregation: at the country level, at the city level and at the institutional level. We reflect on the potential uses of bibliometric data to inform research policies with regard to scientific mobility.
