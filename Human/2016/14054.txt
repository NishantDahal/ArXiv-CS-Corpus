Stamp processing with examplar features

Document digitization is becoming increasingly crucial. In this work, we propose a shape based approach for automatic stamp verification/detection in document images using an unsupervised feature learning. Given a small set of training images, our algorithm learns an appropriate shape representation using an unsupervised clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scenarios.
