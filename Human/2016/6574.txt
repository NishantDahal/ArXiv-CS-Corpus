Green Cloudlet Network: A Distributed Green Mobile Cloud Network

This article introduces a Green Cloudlet Network (GCN) architecture in the context of mobile cloud computing. The proposed architecture is aimed at providing seamless and low End-to-End (E2E) delay between a User Equipment (UE) and its Avatar (its software clone) in the cloudlets to facilitate the application workloads offloading process. Furthermore, Software Define Networking (SDN) based core network is introduced in the GCN architecture by replacing the traditional Evolved Packet Core (EPC) in the LTE network in order to provide efficient communications connections between different end points. Cloudlet Network File System (CNFS) is designed based on the proposed architecture in order to protect Avatars' dataset against hardware failure and improve the Avatars' performance in terms of data access latency. Moreover, green energy supplement is proposed in the architecture in order to reduce the extra Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and CO2 footprint incurred by running the distributed cloudlets. Owing to the temporal and spatial dynamics of both the green energy generation and energy demands of Green Cloudlet Systems (GCSs), designing an optimal green energy management strategy based on the characteristics of the green energy generation and the energy demands of eNBs and cloudlets to minimize the on-grid energy consumption is critical to the cloudlet provider.
