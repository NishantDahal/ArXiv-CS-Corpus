Joint Data Detection and Phase Noise Mitigation for Light Field Video Transmission in MIMO-OFDM Systems

Previous studies in the literature for video transmission over wireless communication systems focused on combating the effects of additive channel noise and fading channels without taking the impairments in the physical layer such as phase noise (PHN) into account. Oscillator phase noise impairs the performance of multi-input multi-output- orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems in providing high data rates for video applications and may lead to decoding failure. In this paper, we propose a light field (LF) video transmission system in wireless channels, and analyze joint data detection and phase mitigation in MIMO-OFDM systems for LF video transmission. The signal model and rate-distortion (RD) model for LF video transmission in the presence of multiple PHNs are discussed. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter for joint data detection and PHN tracking. Numerical results show that the proposed detector can significantly improve the average bit-error rate (BER) and peak-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance for LF video transmission compared to existing algorithms. Moreover, the BER and PSNR performance of the proposed system is closer to that of the ideal case of perfect PHN estimation. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed system model and algorithm are well suited for LF video transmission in wireless channels.
