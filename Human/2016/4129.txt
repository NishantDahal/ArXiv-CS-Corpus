Incremental Query Processing on Big Data Streams

This paper addresses online query processing for large-scale, incremental data analysis on a distributed stream processing engine (DSPE). Our goal is to convert any SQL-like query to an incremental DSPE program automatically. In contrast to other approaches, we derive incremental programs that return accurate results, not approximate answers. This is accomplished by retaining a minimal state during the query evaluation lifetime and by using incremental evaluation techniques to return an accurate snapshot answer at each time interval that depends on the current state and the latest batches of data. Our methods can handle many forms of queries on nested data collections, including iterative and nested queries, group-by with aggregation, and equi-joins. Finally, we report on a prototype implementation of our framework, called MRQL Streaming, running on top of Spark and we experimentally validate the effectiveness of our methods.
