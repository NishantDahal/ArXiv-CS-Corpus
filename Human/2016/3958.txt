Some essential skills and their combination in an architecture for a cognitive and interactive robot

The topic of joint actions has been deeply studied in the context of Human-Human interaction in order to understand how humans cooperate. Creating autonomous robots that collaborate with humans is a complex problem, where it is relevant to apply what has been learned in the context of Human-Human interaction. The question is what skills to implement and how to integrate them in order to build a cognitive architecture, allowing a robot to collaborate efficiently and naturally with humans. In this paper, we first list a set of skills that we consider essential for Joint Action, then we analyze the problem from the robot's point of view and discuss how they can be instantiated in human-robot scenarios. Finally, we open the discussion on how to integrate such skills into a cognitive architecture for human-robot collaborative problem solving and task achievement.
