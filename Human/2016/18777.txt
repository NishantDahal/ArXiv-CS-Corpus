Immersive Augmented Reality Training for Complex Manufacturing Scenarios

In the complex manufacturing sector a considerable amount of resources are focused on developing new skills and training workers. In that context, increasing the effectiveness of those processes and reducing the investment required is an outstanding issue. In this paper we present an experiment that shows how modern Human Computer Interaction (HCI) metaphors such as collaborative mixed-reality can be used to transmit procedural knowledge and could eventually replace other forms of face-to-face training. We implement a real-time Immersive Augmented Reality (IAR) setup with see-through cameras that allows for collaborative interactions that can simulate conventional forms of training. The obtained results indicate that people who took the IAR training achieved the same performance than people in the conventional face-to-face training condition. These results, their implications for future training and the use of HCI paradigms in this context are discussed in this paper.
