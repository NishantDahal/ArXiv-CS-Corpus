Scalable Generation of Scale-free Graphs

We explain how massive instances of scale-free graphs following the Barabasi-Albert model can be generated very quickly in an embarrassingly parallel way. This makes this popular model available for studying big data graph problems. As a demonstration, we generated a Petaedge graph in less than an hour.
