Beyond Binary Computers: How To Implement Multi-Switch Computer Hardware and Software and; The Advantage of a Multi-Switched Computer

This paper explores the possibilities of using a computing methodology --hardware and software-- that employs technology other than binary. I refer to this as "supra - binary" computing. Software constructs that use more than binary techniques are discussed. The gains in supra - binary software are demonstrated, which includes supra - binary code being RISC. Possible hardware implementations of a computer with other than binary based architecture are demonstrated and considered. The advantages and possible disadvantages of these hardware implementations are discussed. The gain in computing speed is evaluated and demonstrated. Supra - binary processing would streamline parallel processing and make its implementation a built - in feature of the software and hardware. Also, supra - binary would bring an advancement to neural networking. This is discussed and demonstrated. In addition, possible applications of supra - binary computing to database and neural networking are discussed. Also, the possible implementations could be applied to telecommunications with dramatic results.
