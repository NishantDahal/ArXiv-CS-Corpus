The Bufferbloat Problem over Intermittent Multi-Gbps mmWave Links

Due to massive available spectrum in the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, cellular systems in these frequencies may provides orders of magnitude greater capacity than networks in conventional lower frequency bands. However, due to high susceptibility to blocking, mmWave links can be extremely intermittent in quality. This combination of high peak throughputs and intermittency can cause significant challenges in end-to-end transport-layer mechanisms such as TCP. This paper studies the particularly challenging problem of bufferbloat. Specifically, with current buffering and congestion control mechanisms, high throughput-high variable links can lead to excessive buffers incurring long latency. In this paper, we capture the performance trends obtained while adopting two potential solutions that have been proposed in the literature: Active queue management (AQM) and dynamic receive window. We show that, over mmWave links, AQM mitigates the latency but cannot deliver high throughput. The main reason relies on the fact that the current congestion control was not designed to cope with high data rates with sudden change. Conversely, the dynamic receive window approach is more responsive and therefore supports higher channel utilization while mitigating the delay, thus representing a viable solution.
