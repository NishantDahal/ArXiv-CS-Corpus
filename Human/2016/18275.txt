Managing Quality Requirements Using Activity-Based Quality Models

Managing requirements on quality aspects is an important issue in the development of software systems. Difficulties arise from expressing them appropriately what in turn results from the difficulty of the concept of quality itself. Building and using quality models is an approach to handle the complexity of software quality. A novel kind of quality models uses the activities performed on and with the software as an explicit dimension. These quality models are a well-suited basis for managing quality requirements from elicitation over refinement to assurance. The paper proposes such an approach and shows its applicability in an automotive case study.
