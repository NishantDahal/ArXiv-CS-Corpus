Generalized Analysis of Convergence of Absolute Trust in Peer to Peer Networks

Open and anonymous nature of peer to peer networks provides an opportunity to malicious peers to behave unpredictably in the network. This leads the lack of trust among the peers. To control the behavior of peers in the network, reputation system can be used. In a reputation system, aggregation of trust is a primary issue. Algorithm for aggregation of trust should be designed such that, it can converge to a certain finite value. Absolute Trust is one of the algorithm, which is used for the aggregation of trust in peer to peer networks. In this letter, we present the generalized analysis of convergence of the Absolute Trust algorithm.
