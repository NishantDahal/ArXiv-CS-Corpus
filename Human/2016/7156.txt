Context-Aware Adaptive Framework for e-Health Monitoring

For improving e-health services, we propose a context-aware framework to monitor the activities of daily living of dependent persons. We define a strategy for generating long-term realistic scenarios and a framework containing an adaptive monitoring algorithm based on three approaches for optimizing resource usage. The used approaches provide a deep knowledge about the person's context by considering: the person's profile, the activities and the relationships between activities. We evaluate the performances of our framework and show its adaptability and significant reduction in network, energy and processing usage over a traditional monitoring implementation.
