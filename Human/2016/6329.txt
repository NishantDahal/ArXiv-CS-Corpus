How E-Mental Health Services Benefit University Students with ADHD: A literature Review

E-mental health is an area within e-health in which the key role of IS/IT has not been well established. Both clinicians and scholars are uncertain as to the role of IS/IT and its potential benefits. This research review is introduced to assist in understanding the enabling role in e-mental health and it focused on one area of mental health, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in university students. ADHD is estimated to affect approximately 6% of university students by negatively impacting students' academic performance and social life; hence, fewer of these students complete their degrees as compared to their peers. This review outlines the potentials of using IS/IT in the treatment of ADHD in university students. It also serves to greatly contribute to e-mental health development and thereby to help to uncover further possibilities of IT/IT to support broad areas within mental health disorders and services.
