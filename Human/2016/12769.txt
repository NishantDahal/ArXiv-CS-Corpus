Fast Spherical Quasiconformal Parameterization of Genus-0 Closed Surfaces with Application to Adaptive Remeshing

In this work, we are concerned with the spherical quasiconformal parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces. Given a genus-0 closed triangulated surface and an arbitrary user-defined quasiconformal distortion, we propose a fast algorithm for computing a spherical parameterization of the surface that satisfies the prescribed distortion. The proposed algorithm can be effectively applied to adaptive surface remeshing for improving the visualization in computer graphics and animations. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.
