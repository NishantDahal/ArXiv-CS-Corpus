Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in Dynamic Access Networks: Deployment Challenges, Optimizations, Solutions, and Open Issues

In this paper, we investigate the issue of spectrum assignment in CRNs and examine various opportunistic spectrum access approaches proposed in the literature. We provide insight into the efficiency of such approaches and their ability to attain their design objectives. We discuss the factors that impact the selection of the appropriate operating channel(s), including the important interaction between the cognitive linkquality conditions and the time-varying nature of PRNs. Protocols that consider such interaction are described. We argue that using best quality channels does not achieve the maximum possible throughput in CRNs (does not provide the best spectrum utilization). The impact of guard bands on the design of opportunistic spectrum access protocols is also investigated. Various complementary techniques and optimization methods are underlined and discussed, including the utilization of variablewidth spectrum assignment, resource virtualization, full-duplex capability, cross-layer design, beamforming and MIMO technology, cooperative communication, network coding, discontinuousOFDM technology, and software defined radios. Finally, we highlight several directions for future research in this field.
