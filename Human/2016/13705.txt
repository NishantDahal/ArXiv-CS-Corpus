From Digital computers to quantum computers based on biological paradigms and progress in particle physics

While several paths have emerged in microelectronics and computing as follow-ons to Turing architectures, and have been implemented using essentially silicon circuits, very little beyond Moore research has considered: (1) first biological processes instead of sequential instructions, and, (2) the implementation of these processes exploiting particle physics interactions. This last combination enables native spatial-temporal integration and correlation, but also powerful interference filtering, gating, splitting and more. These biological functions, their realization by quantum and charge carrier interactions, allow proposing a novel computing architecture, with interfaces, information storage, and programmability. The paper presents the underlying biological processes, the particle physics phenomena which are exploited, and the proposed architecture, as well as an algebraic design formalism.
