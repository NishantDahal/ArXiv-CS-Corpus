Coordinated Initial Access in Millimetre Wave Standalone Networks

In this paper, a novel coordinated initial access (IA) scheme for clustered millimeter wave small cells (mmSCs) is proposed for the fifth generation mobile communication networks (5G). This solution is a method for efficient and fast initial access for ultra-dense millimeter wave standalone networks without presence of overlaid legacy networks operating on lower frequency. In contrast to the current full beam sweep scheme, where time consuming exhaustive searching is employed, the mmSCs within one cluster will perform the IA procedure in a coordinated manner based on the power delay profile (PDP) measurement reports shared with each other via the backhaul links and thereby avoiding the full beam sweep. The proposed scheme significantly reduces the initial access time, enhances the access robustness and reduces the cost and complexity of the mobile terminals.
