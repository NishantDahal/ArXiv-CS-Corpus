Effect of Wideband Beam Squint on Codebook Design in Phased-Array Wireless Systems

Analog beamforming with phased arrays is a promising technique for 5G wireless communication at millimeter wave frequencies. Using a discrete codebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain range of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase shifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for sufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually frequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect occurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency independent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear array (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the number of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency. The criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain for a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a target threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and numerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for beam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook design that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a carrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint with this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of the array if the other one is fixed.
