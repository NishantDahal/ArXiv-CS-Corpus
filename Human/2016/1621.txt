Achieving Ultra-Low Latency in 5G Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks

The IMT 2020 requirements of 20 Gbps peak data rate and 1 millisecond latency present significant engineering challenges for the design of 5G cellular systems. Use of the millimeter wave (mmWave) bands above 10 GHz --- where vast quantities of spectrum are available --- is a promising 5G candidate that may be able to rise to the occasion.
  However, while the mmWave bands can support massive peak data rates, delivering these data rates on end-to-end service while maintaining reliability and ultra-low latency performance will require rethinking all layers of the protocol stack. This papers surveys some of the challenges and possible solutions for delivering end-to-end, reliable, ultra-low latency services in mmWave cellular systems in terms of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, congestion control and core network architecture.
