Rolling Horizon Coevolutionary Planning for Two-Player Video Games

This paper describes a new algorithm for decision making in two-player real-time video games. As with Monte Carlo Tree Search, the algorithm can be used without heuristics and has been developed for use in general video game AI. The approach is to extend recent work on rolling horizon evolutionary planning, which has been shown to work well for single-player games, to two (or in principle many) player games. To select an action the algorithm co-evolves two (or in the general case N) populations, one for each player, where each individual is a sequence of actions for the respective player. The fitness of each individual is evaluated by playing it against a selection of action-sequences from the opposing population. When choosing an action to take in the game, the first action is chosen from the fittest member of the population for that player. The new algorithm is compared with a number of general video game AI algorithms on three variations of a two-player space battle game, with promising results.
