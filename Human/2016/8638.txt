How to verify computation with a rational network

The present paper introduces a practical protocol for provably secure, outsourced computation. Our protocol minimizes overhead for verification by requiring solutions to withstand an interactive game between a prover and challenger. For optimization problems, the best or nearly best of all submitted solutions is expected to be accepted by this approach. Financial incentives and deposits are used in order to overcome the problem of fake participants.
