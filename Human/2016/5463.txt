GEMFsim: A Stochastic Simulator for the Generalized Epidemic Modeling Framework

The recently proposed generalized epidemic modeling framework (GEMF) \cite{sahneh2013generalized} lays the groundwork for systematically constructing a broad spectrum of stochastic spreading processes over complex networks. This article builds an algorithm for exact, continuous-time numerical simulation of GEMF-based processes. Moreover the implementation of this algorithm, GEMFsim, is available in popular scientific programming platforms such as MATLAB, R, Python, and C; GEMFsim facilitates simulating stochastic spreading models that fit in GEMF framework. Using these simulations one can examine the accuracy of mean-field-type approximations that are commonly used for analytical study of spreading processes on complex networks.
