An Automatic Identification System (AIS) Database for Maritime Trajectory Prediction and Data Mining

In recent years, maritime safety and efficiency become more and more important across the world. Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks vessel movement by onboard transceiver and terrestrial and/or satellite base station. The data collected by AIS contains broadcast kinematic information and static information. Both of them are useful for anomaly detection and route prediction which are key techniques in intelligent maritime research area. This paper is devoted to construct a standard AIS database for maritime trajectory learning, prediction and data mining. A path prediction algorithm is tested on this AIS database and the testing results show this database can be used as a standardized training resource for different trajectory prediction algorithms and other AIS data mining algorithms.
