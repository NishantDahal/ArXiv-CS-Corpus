A wide diversity of 3D surfaces Generator using a new implicit function

We present in this paper a new family of implicit function for synthesizing a wide variety of 3D surfaces. The basis of this family consists of the usual functions that are: the function rectangular pulses, the function saw-tooth pulses, the function of triangular pulses, the staircase function and the power function. By combining these common functions, named constituent functions, in one implicit function and by varying some parameters of this function we can synthesize a wide variety of 3D surfaces with the possibility to set their deformations.
