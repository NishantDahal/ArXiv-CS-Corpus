On the Coded Caching Delivery Design over Wireless Networks

Coded caching scheme is a promising technique to migrate the network burden in peak hours, which attains more prominent gains than the uncoded caching. The coded caching scheme can be classified into two types, namely, the centralized and the decentralized scheme, according to whether the placement procedures are carefully designed or operated at random. However, most of the previous analysis assumes that the connected links between server and users are error-free. In this paper, we explore the coded caching based delivery design in wireless networks, where all the connected wireless links are different. For both centralized and decentralized cases, we proposed two delivery schemes, namely, the orthogonal delivery scheme and the concurrent delivery scheme. We focus on the transmission time slots spent on satisfying the system requests, and prove that for both the centralized and the decentralized cases, the concurrent delivery always outperforms orthogonal delivery scheme. Furthermore, for the orthogonal delivery scheme, we derive the gap in terms of transmission time between the decentralized and centralized case, which is essentially no more than 1.5.
