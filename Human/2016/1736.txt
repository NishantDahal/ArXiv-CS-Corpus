Encoding Data for HTM Systems

Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a biologically inspired machine intelligence technology that mimics the architecture and processes of the neocortex. In this white paper we describe how to encode data as Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) for use in HTM systems. We explain several existing encoders, which are available through the open source project called NuPIC, and we discuss requirements for creating encoders for new types of data.
