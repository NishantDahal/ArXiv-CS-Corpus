Hierarchical Partition-Based Anonymous Routing Protocol(HPAR) in Manet for Efficient and Secure Transmission

Anonymous routing protocols are used in MANET's to hide the nodes from outsiders in order to protect from various attacks. HPAR partitions the network area dynamically into zones and chooses nodes in zones randomly as intermediate relay nodes .This relay nodes help in secure routing. In HPAR anonymity protection is given to source, destination and route. HPAR have low cost and provide high level of protection. It has techniques to counter various attacks.
