Bring Your Own Devices Classroom: Issues of Digital Divides in Teaching and Learning Contexts

Technology mediated learning provide potentially valuable resources for learners' academic and social development. However, according to recent researches, as the adoption stages of ICTs advance there arise further levels of digital divides in terms of equity of information literacy and learning outcomes. For the last three years we have been working with the first secondary school in New Zealand to introduce a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy. Our research has included a number of methods, including surveys, interviews and classroom observations. In this paper we present the findings from the investigation into BYOD project, which gave us insights into the digital divide issues in the context of technology mediated learning.
