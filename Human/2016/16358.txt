Computationally Secure Optical Transmission Systems with Optical Encryption at Line Rate

We propose a novel system for optical encryption based on an optical XOR and optical Linear Feedback Shift Register (oLFSRs). Though we choose LFSR for its ability to process optical signals at line rate, we consider the fact that it offers no cryptographic security. To address the security shortfall, we propose implementation of parallel oLFSRs, whereby the resulting key-stream at line rate is controlled electronically by a nonlinear random number generator at speeds much lower than the optical line rate, which makes the system practically relevant. The analysis of computational security shows that the proposed system is secure against wiretapping and can be engineered with the state of the art optical components.
