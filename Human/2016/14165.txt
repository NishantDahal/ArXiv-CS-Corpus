Games for Topological Fixpoint Logic

Topological fixpoint logics are a family of logics that admits topological models and where   the fixpoint operators are defined with respect to the topological interpretations. Here we consider a topological fixpoint logic for relational structures based on Stone spaces,   where the fixpoint operators are interpreted via clopen sets.  We develop a game-theoretic semantics for this logic. First we introduce games characterising clopen  fixpoints of monotone operators on Stone spaces. These fixpoint games allow us to characterise the semantics for our topological fixpoint logic using a two-player graph game. Adequacy of this game is the main result of our paper. Finally, we define bisimulations for the topological structures under consideration and  use our game semantics to prove that the truth of a formula of our topological fixpoint logic is bisimulation-invariant.
