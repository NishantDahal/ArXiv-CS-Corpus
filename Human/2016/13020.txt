LightNet: A Versatile, Standalone Matlab-based Environment for Deep Learning

LightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The idea underlying its design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The framework also supports both CPU and GPU computation, and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.
