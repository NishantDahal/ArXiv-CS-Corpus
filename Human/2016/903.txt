Scheduling and Power Allocation to Optimize Service and Queue-Waiting Times in Cognitive Radio Uplinks

In this report, we study the packet delay as a QoS metric in CR systems. The packet delay includes the queue waiting time and the service time. In this work, we study the effect of both the scheduling and the power allocation algorithms on the delay performance of the SUs.
  To study the delay due to the service time we study a multichannel system where the channels are sensed sequentially, we study the tradeoff between throughput and delay. The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping rule problem where there is a tradeoff between the service time and the throughput. This tradeoff results from skipping low-quality channels to seek the possibility of finding high-quality ones in the future at the expense of a higher probability of being blocked from transmission since these future channels might be busy.
  On the other hand, the queue waiting time is studied by considering a multi-user single channel system. Specifically, we study the effect of scheduling and power allocation on the delay performance of all SUs in the system. We propose a delay optimal algorithm that protects the PUs from harmful interference and provides the required delay guarantees to users. Conventional scheduling algorithms do not provide such guarantees if the interference channels are heterogeneous. This is because they are developed for conventional non-CR wireless systems that neglect interference since channels are orthogonal.
  Finally, we present two potential extensions to these studied problems.
