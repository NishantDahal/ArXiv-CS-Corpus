Finite Blocklength Performance of Multi-Terminal Wireless Industrial Networks

This work focuses on the performance of multi-terminal wireless industrial networks, where the transmissions of all terminals are required to be scheduled within a tight deadline. The transmissions thus share a fixed amount of resources, i.e., symbols, while facing short blocklengths due to the low-latency requirement. We investigate two distinct relaying strategies, namely best relay selection among the participating terminals and best antenna selection at the access point of the network. In both schemes, we incorporate the cost of acquiring instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) at the access point within the transmission deadline. An error probability model is developed under the finite blocklength regime to provide accurate performance results. As a reference, this model is compared to the corresponding infinite bocklength error model. Both analytical models are validated by simulation. We show that the average Packet Error Rate (PER) over all terminals is convex in the target error probability at each single link. Moreover, we find that: (i) The reliability behavior is different for the two strategies, while the limiting factors are both finite blocklengths and overhead of acquiring CSI. (ii) With the same order of diversity, best antenna selection is more reliable than best relay selection. (iii) The average PER is increasing in the number of participating terminals unless the terminals also act as relay candidates. In particular, if each participating terminal is a candidate for best relay selection, the PER is convex in the number of terminals.
