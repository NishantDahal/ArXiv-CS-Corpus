Wireless-powered relaying with finite block-length codes

This paper studies the outage probability and the throughput of amplify-and-forward relay networks with wireless information and energy transfer. We use some recent results on finite block-length codes to analyze the system performance in the cases with short codewords. Specifically, the time switching relaying and the power splitting relaying protocols are considered for energy and information transfer. We derive tight approximations for the outage probability/throughput. Then, we analyze the outage probability in asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, we use numerical results to confirm the accuracy of our analysis and to evaluate the system performance in different scenarios. Our results indicate that, in delay-constrained scenarios, the codeword length affects the outage probability/throughput of the joint energy and information transfer systems considerably.
