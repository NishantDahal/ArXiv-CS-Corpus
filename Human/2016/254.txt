On Layered Erasure Interference Channels without CSI at Transmitters

This paper studies a layered erasure model for two-user interference channels, which can be viewed as a simplified version of Gaussian fading interference channel. It is assumed that channel state information~(CSI) is only available at receivers but not at transmitters. Under such assumption, an outer bound is derived for the capacity region of such interference channel. The new outer bound is tight in many circumstances. For the remaining open cases, the outer bound extends previous results.
