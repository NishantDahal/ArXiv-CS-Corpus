Energy Harvesting-Aided Spectrum Sensing and Data Transmission in Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Sensor Network

The incorporation of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Energy Harvesting (EH) capabilities in wireless sensor networks enables spectrum and energy efficient heterogeneous cognitive radio sensor networks (HCRSNs). The new networking paradigm of HCRSNs consists of EH-enabled spectrum sensors and battery powered data sensors. Spectrum sensors can cooperatively scan the licensed spectrum for available channels, while data sensors monitor an area of interest and transmit sensed data to the sink over those channels. In this work, we propose a resource allocation solution for the HCRSN to achieve the sustainability of spectrum sensors and conserve energy of data sensors. The proposed solution is achieved by two algorithms that operate in tandem, a spectrum sensor scheduling algorithm and a data sensor resource allocation algorithm. The spectrum sensor scheduling algorithm allocates channels to spectrum sensors such that the average detected available time for the channels is maximized, while the EH dynamics are considered and PU transmissions are protected. The data sensor resource allocation algorithm allocates the transmission time, power and channels such that the energy consumption of the data sensors is minimized. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the energy consumption of the data sensors can be significantly reduced while maintaining the sustainability of the spectrum sensors.
