The expected bit complexity of the von Neumann rejection algorithm

In 1952, von Neumann introduced the rejection method for random variate generation. We revisit this algorithm when we have a source of perfect bits at our disposal. In this random bit model, there are universal lower bounds for generating a random variate with a given density to within an accuracy $Îµ$ derived by Knuth and Yao, and refined by the authors. In general, von Neumann's method fails in this model. We propose a modification that insures proper behavior for all Riemann-integrable densities on compact sets, and show that the expected number of random bits needed behaves optimally with respect to universal lower bounds. In particular, we introduce the notion of an oracle that evaluates the supremum and infimum of a function on any rectangle of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and develop a quadtree-style extension of the classical rejection method.
