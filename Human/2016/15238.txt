Breaking a novel image encryption scheme based on improved hyperchaotic sequences

Recently, a novel image encryption scheme based on improved hyperchaotic sequences was proposed. A pseudo-random number sequence, generated by a hyper-chaos system, is used to determine two involved encryption functions, bitwise exclusive or (XOR) operation and modulo addition. It was reported that the scheme can be broken with some pairs of chosen plain-images and the corresponding cipherimages. This paper re-evaluates the security of the encryption scheme and finds that the encryption scheme can be broken with only one known plain-image. The performance of the known-plaintext attack, in terms of success probability and computation load, become even much better when two known plain-images are available. In addition, security defects on insensitivity of the encryption result with respect to changes of secret key and plain-image are also reported.
