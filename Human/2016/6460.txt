Stochastic Online Control for Energy-Harvesting Wireless Networks with Battery Imperfections

In energy harvesting (EH) network, the energy storage devices (i.e., batteries) are usually not perfect. In this paper, we consider a practical battery model with finite battery capacity, energy (dis-)charging loss, and energy dissipation. Taking into account such battery imperfections, we rely on the Lyapunov optimization technique to develop a stochastic online control scheme that aims to maximize the utility of data rates for EH multi-hop wireless networks. It is established that the proposed algorithm can provide a feasible and efficient data admission, power allocation, routing and scheduling solution, without requiring any statistical knowledge of the stochastic channel, data-traffic, and EH processes. Numerical results demonstrate the merit of the proposed scheme.
