High Capacity Image Steganography using Adjunctive Numerical Representations with Multiple Bit-Plane Decomposition Methods

LSB steganography is a one of the most widely used methods for implementing covert data channels in image file exchanges [1][2]. The low computational complexity and implementation simplicity of the algorithm are significant factors for its popularity with the primary reason being low image distortion. Many attempts have been made to increase the embedding capacity of LSB algorithms by expanding into the second or third binary layers of the image while maintaining a low probability of detection with minimal distortive effects [2][3][4]. In this paper, we introduce an advanced technique for covertly embedding data within images using redundant number system decomposition over non-standard digital bit planes. Both grayscale and bit-mapped images are equally effective as cover files. It will be shown that this unique steganography method has minimal visual distortive affects while also preserving the cover file statistics, making it less susceptible to most general steganography detection algorithms.
