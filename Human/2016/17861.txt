Interference Cancellation at Receivers in Cache-Enabled Wireless Networks

In this paper, we propose to exploit the limited cache packets as side information to cancel incoming interference at the receiver side. We consider a stochastic network where the random locations of base stations and users are modeled using Poisson point processes. Caching schemes to reap both the local caching gain and the interference cancellation gain for the users are developed based on two factors: the density of different user subsets and the packets cached in the corresponding subsets. The packet loss rate (PLR) is analyzed, which depends on both the cached packets and the channel state information (CSI) available at the receiver. Theoretical results reveal the tradeoff between caching resource and wireless resource. The performance for different caching schemes are analyzed and the minimum achievable PLR for the distributed caching is derived.
