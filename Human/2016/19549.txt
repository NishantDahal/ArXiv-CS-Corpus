Music Generation with Deep Learning

The use of deep learning to solve problems in literary arts has been a recent trend that has gained a lot of attention and automated generation of music has been an active area. This project deals with the generation of music using raw audio files in the frequency domain relying on various LSTM architectures. Fully connected and convolutional layers are used along with LSTM's to capture rich features in the frequency domain and increase the quality of music generated. The work is focused on unconstrained music generation and uses no information about musical structure(notes or chords) to aid learning.The music generated from various architectures are compared using blind fold tests. Using the raw audio to train models is the direction to tapping the enormous amount of mp3 files that exist over the internet without requiring the manual effort to make structured MIDI files. Moreover, not all audio files can be represented with MIDI files making the study of these models an interesting prospect to the future of such models.
