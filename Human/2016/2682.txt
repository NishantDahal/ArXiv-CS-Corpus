The Truncated & Supplemented Pascal Matrix and Applications

In this paper, we introduce the $k\times n$ (with $k\leq n$) truncated, supplemented Pascal matrix which has the property that any $k$ columns form a linearly independent set. This property is also present in Reed-Solomon codes; however, Reed-Solomon codes are completely dense, whereas the truncated, supplemented Pascal matrix has multiple zeros. If the maximal-distance separable code conjecture is correct, then our matrix has the maximal number of columns (with the aformentioned property) that the conjecture allows. This matrix has applications in coding, network coding, and matroid theory.
