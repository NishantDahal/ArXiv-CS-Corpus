The number of satisfying assignments of random regular k-SAT formulas

Let $Î¦$ be a random $k$-SAT formula in which every variable occurs precisely $d$ times positively and $d$ times negatively. Assuming that $k$ is sufficiently large and that $d$ is slightly below the critical degree where the formula becomes unsatisfiable with high probability, we determine the limiting distribution of the logarithm of the number of satisfying assignments.
