Video Key Frame Extraction using Entropy value as Global and Local Feature

Key frames play an important role in video annotation. It is one of the widely used methods for video abstraction as this will help us for processing a large set of video data with sufficient content representation in faster way. In this paper a novel approach for key-frame extraction using entropy value is proposed. The proposed approach classifies frames based on entropy values as global feature and selects frame from each class as representative key-frame. It also eliminates redundant frames from selected key-frames using entropy value as local feature. Evaluation of the approach on several video clips has been presented. Results show that the algorithm is successful in helping annotators automatically identify video key-frames.
