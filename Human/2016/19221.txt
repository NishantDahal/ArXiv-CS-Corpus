Understanding Tree: a tool to estimate one's understanding of knowledge

People learn whenever and wherever possible, and whatever they like or encounter--Mathematics, Drama, Art, Languages, Physics, Philosophy, and so on. With the bursting of knowledge, evaluation of one's possession of knowledge becomes increasingly difficult. There are a lot of demands to evaluate one's understanding of a piece of knowledge. Assessment of understanding of knowledge is conventionally through tests or interviews, but they have some limitations such as low-efficiency and not-comprehensive. This paper proposes a method called Understanding Tree to estimate one's understanding of knowledge, by keeping track of his/her learning activities. It overcomes some limitations of traditional methods, hence complements traditional methods.
