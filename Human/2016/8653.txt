Proceedings of the Workshop on Continuations

The notion of continuation is ubiquitous in many different areas of computer science, including systems programming, programming languages,  algorithmics, semantics, logic, and constructive mathematics. In fact the concept of continuation nicely realizes sophisticated control mechanisms, which are widely used in a variety of applications. Since we cannot escape control features, it becomes a challenge to provide them with sound reasoning principles. 
  Indeed there is much research activity on understanding, representing, and reasoning about elaborated non-local control structures, in particular in declarative programming languages such as functional and logic languages. The proceedings of the Workshop on Continuations 2015, held in London in April 2015, illustrate some of the afore mentioned topics and hopefully they will inspire further research work on the subject.
