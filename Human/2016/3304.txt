A Generalized LDPC Framework for Robust and Sublinear Compressive Sensing

Compressive sensing aims to recover a high-dimensional sparse signal from a relatively small number of measurements. In this paper, a novel design of the measurement matrix is proposed. The design is inspired by the construction of generalized low-density parity-check codes, where the capacity-achieving point-to-point codes serve as subcodes to robustly estimate the signal support. In the case that each entry of the $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse signal lies in a known discrete alphabet, the proposed scheme requires only $O(k \log n)$ measurements and arithmetic operations. In the case of arbitrary, possibly continuous alphabet, an error propagation graph is proposed to characterize the residual estimation error. With $O(k \log^2 n)$ measurements and computational complexity, the reconstruction error can be made arbitrarily small with high probability.
