A Proof-of-Concept Device-to-Device Communication Testbed

This paper presents the design and development of proof-of-concept Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication testbed. This testbed also seeks to address the design issues involved in the implementation of a D2D network in a realistic scenario. The performance of this testbed has been validated by emulating a Cellular network consisting of a Base Staion (BTS) and many D2D devices in its proximity. The devices and the BTS coordinate and communicate with each other to select the optimum communication range, mode of communication and transmit parameters. Through the experimental results it has been shown that the proposed testbed has a communication radius of 120m and a D2D communication range of 62m with over 90% efficiency.
