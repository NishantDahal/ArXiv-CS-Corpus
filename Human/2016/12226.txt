Quantum Entanglement Distribution in Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems

In this work we analyze the distribution of quantum entanglement over communication channels in the millimeter-wave regime. The motivation for such a study is the possibility for next-generation wireless networks (beyond 5G) to accommodate such a distribution directly - without the need to integrate additional optical communication hardware into the transceivers. Future wireless communication systems are bound to require some level of quantum communications capability. We find that direct quantum-entanglement distribution in the millimeter-wave regime is indeed possible, but that its implementation will be very demanding from both a system-design perspective and a channel-requirement perspective.
