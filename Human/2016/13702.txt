A Practical Algorithm for Packing Tubes and Boxes

In this paper we describe a method for packing tubes and boxes in containers. Each container is divided into parts (holders) which are allocated to subsets of objects. The method consists of a recursive procedure which, based on a predefined order for dealing with tubes and boxes, determines the dimensions and position of each holder. Characteristics of the objects to pack and rules limiting their placement make this problem unique. The method devised provides timely and practical solutions.
