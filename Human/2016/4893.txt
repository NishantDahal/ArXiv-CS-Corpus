First Experimental Demonstration of Secure NFV Orchestration over an SDN-Controlled Optical Network with Time-Shared Quantum Key Distribution Resources

We demonstrate, for the first time, a secure optical network architecture that combines NFV orchestration and SDN control with quantum key distribution (QKD) technology. A novel time-shared QKD network design is presented as a cost-effective solution for practical networks.
