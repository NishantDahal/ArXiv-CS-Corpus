Future Network: End-to-End Slicing and Hop-On (a Slice)

The concept of network slice, i.e.,a service customized virtual network (VN) is attracting more and more attentions in the telecommunication industry. A slice is a set of network resources which fits the service attributes and requirements of customer services. The network resources consist of cloud resources and communication link resources. A slice can serve one or more customer services which share the similar service attributes and requirements. To define, create and manage a slice (VN) is one aspect of future networks. Another aspect is the slice operation, i.e., the provisioning of services to customers using created slices. In this paper, the focus is put on the configuration of slices and the operation of slices. In this paper, the detailed description of slice (VN) configuration is provided. A new concept of hop-on (a slice) is described. Given a well defined and configured end-to-end slice (VN), the realtime data traffic delivery over a slice is governed by network operation control entities, which are also pre-configured. Therefore, the procedure of customer traffic delivery over a slice is just like a traveler hopping on tourist bus and then the traffic control officers at key intersections directing the traveler to go through pre-designed routes until the destination is reached.
