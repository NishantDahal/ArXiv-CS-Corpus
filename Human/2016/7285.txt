Asymptotics of Input-Constrained Erasure Channel Capacity

In this paper, we examine an input-constrained erasure channel and we characterize the asymptotics of its capacity when the erasure rate is low. More specifically, for a general memoryless erasure channel with its input supported on an irreducible finite-type constraint, we derive partial asymptotics of its capacity, using some series expansion type formulas of its mutual information rate; and for a binary erasure channel with its first-order Markovian input supported on the $(1, \infty)$-RLL constraint, based on the concavity of its mutual information rate with respect to some parameterization of the input, we numerically evaluate its first-order Markov capacity and further derive its full asymptotics. The asymptotics obtained in this paper, when compared with the recently derived feedback capacity for a binary erasure channel with the same input constraint, enable us to draw the conclusion that feedback may increase the capacity of an input-constrained channel, even if the channel is memoryless.
