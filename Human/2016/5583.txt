Use of Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access in Dual-hop relaying

To improve the sum-rate (SR) of the dual-hop relay system, a novel two-stage power allocation scheme with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed. In this scheme, after the reception of the superposition coded symbol with a power allocation from the source, the relay node forwards a new superposition coded symbol with another power allocation to the destination. By employing the maximum ratio combination (MRC), the destination jointly decodes the information symbols from the source and the relay. Assuming Rayleigh fading channels, closed-form solution of the ergodic SR at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is derived and a practical power allocation is also designed for the proposed NOMA scheme. Through numerical results, it is shown that the performance of the proposed scheme is significantly improved compared with the existing work.
