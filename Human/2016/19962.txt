Memristor Threshold Logic: An Overview to Challenges and Applications

Once referred to as the missing circuit component, memristor has come long way across to be recognized and taken as important to future circuit designs. The memristor due to its ability to memorize the state, switch between different resistance level, smaller size and low leakage currents makes it useful for a wide range of intelligent memory and computing applications. This overview paper highlights broadly provides the uses of memristor in the implementation of cognitive cells for different imaging and pattern matching applications.
