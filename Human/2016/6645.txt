DroidLink: Automated Generation of Deep Links for Android Apps

The mobile application (app) has become the main entrance to access the Internet on handheld devices. Unlike the Web where each webpage has a global URL to reach directly, a specific "content page" of an app can be opened only by exploring the app with several operations from the landing page. The interoperability between apps is quite fixed and thus limits the value-added "linked data" between apps. Recently, deep link has been proposed to enable targeting and opening a specific page of an app externally with an accessible uniform resource identifier (URI). However, implementing deep link for mobile apps requires a lot of manual efforts by app developers, which can be very error-prone and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose DroidLink to automatically generating deep links for existing Android apps. We design a deep link model suitable for automatic generation. Then we explore the transition of pages and build a navigation graph based on static and dynamic analysis of Android apps. Next, we realize an updating mechanism that keeps on revisiting the target app and discover new pages, and thus generates deep links for every single page of the app. Finally, we repackage the app with deep link supports, but requires no additional deployment requirements. We generate deep links for some popular apps and demonstrate the feasibility of DroidLink.
