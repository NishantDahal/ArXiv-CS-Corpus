A Low-Complexity Transceiver Design in Sparse Multipath Massive MIMO Channels

In this letter, we develop a low-complexity transceiver design, referred to as semi-random beam pairing (SRBP), for sparse multipath massive MIMO channels. By exploring a sparse representation of the MIMO channel in the virtual angular domain, we generate a set of transmit-receive beam pairs in a semi-random way to support the simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams. These data streams can be easily separated at the receiver via a successive interference cancelation (SIC) technique, and the power allocation among them are optimized based on the classical waterfilling principle. The achieved degree of freedom (DoF) and capacity of the proposed approach are analyzed. Simulation results show that, compared to the conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based method, the proposed transceiver design can achieve near-optimal DoF and capacity with a significantly lower computational complexity.
