Condorcet's Jury Theorem for Consensus Clustering and its Implications for Diversity

Condorcet's Jury Theorem has been invoked for ensemble classifiers to indicate that the combination of many classifiers can have better predictive performance than a single classifier. Such a theoretical underpinning is unknown for consensus clustering. This article extends Condorcet's Jury Theorem to the mean partition approach under the additional assumptions that a unique ground-truth partition exists and sample partitions are drawn from a sufficiently small ball containing the ground-truth. As an implication of practical relevance, we question the claim that the quality of consensus clustering depends on the diversity of the sample partitions. Instead, we conjecture that limiting the diversity of the mean partitions is necessary for controlling the quality.
