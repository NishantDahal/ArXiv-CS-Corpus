Probabilistic Dimensionality Reduction via Structure Learning

We propose a novel probabilistic dimensionality reduction framework that can naturally integrate the generative model and the locality information of data. Based on this framework, we present a new model, which is able to learn a smooth skeleton of embedding points in a low-dimensional space from high-dimensional noisy data. The formulation of the new model can be equivalently interpreted as two coupled learning problem, i.e., structure learning and the learning of projection matrix. This interpretation motivates the learning of the embedding points that can directly form an explicit graph structure. We develop a new method to learn the embedding points that form a spanning tree, which is further extended to obtain a discriminative and compact feature representation for clustering problems. Unlike traditional clustering methods, we assume that centers of clusters should be close to each other if they are connected in a learned graph, and other cluster centers should be distant. This can greatly facilitate data visualization and scientific discovery in downstream analysis. Extensive experiments are performed that demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to obtain discriminative feature representations, and correctly recover the intrinsic structures of various real-world datasets.
