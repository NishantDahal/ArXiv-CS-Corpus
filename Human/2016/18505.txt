Continuous occurrence theory

Usually gradual and continuous changes in entities will lead to appear events. But usually it is supposed that an event is occurred at once. In this research an integrated framework called continuous occurrence theory (COT) is presented to investigate respective path leading to occurrence of the events in the real world. For this purpose initially fundamental concepts are defined. Afterwards, the appropriate tools such as occurrence variables computations, occurrence dependency function and occurrence model are introduced and explained in a systematic manner. Indeed, COT provides the possibility to: (a) monitor occurrence of events during time; (b) study background of the events; (c) recognize the relevant issues of each event; and (d) understand how these issues affect on the considered event. The developed framework (COT) provides the necessary context to analyze accurately continual changes of the issues and the relevant events in the various branches of science and business. Finally, typical applications of COT and an applied modeling example of it have been explained and a mathematical programming example is modeled in the occurrence based environment.
