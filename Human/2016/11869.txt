Online Monotone Optimization

This paper presents a new framework for analyzing and designing no-regret algorithms for dynamic (possibly adversarial) systems. The proposed framework generalizes the popular online convex optimization framework and extends it to its natural limit allowing it to capture a notion of regret that is intuitive for more general problems such as those encountered in game theory and variational inequalities. The framework hinges on a special choice of a system-wide loss function we have developed. Using this framework, we prove that a simple update scheme provides a no-regret algorithm for monotone systems. While previous results in game theory prove individual agents can enjoy unilateral no-regret guarantees, our result proves monotonicity sufficient for guaranteeing no-regret when considering the adjustments of multiple agent strategies in parallel. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first framework to provide a suitable notion of regret for variational inequalities. Most importantly, our proposed framework ensures monotonicity a sufficient condition for employing multiple online learners safely in parallel.
