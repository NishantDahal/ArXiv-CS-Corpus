Near-Optimal Induced Universal Graphs for Bounded Degree Graphs

A graph $U$ is an induced universal graph for a family $F$ of graphs if every graph in $F$ is a vertex-induced subgraph of $U$. For the family of all undirected graphs on $n$ vertices Alstrup, Kaplan, Thorup, and Zwick [STOC 2015] give an induced universal graph with $O\!\left(2^{n/2}\right)$ vertices, matching a lower bound by Moon [Proc. Glasgow Math. Assoc. 1965].
  Let $k= \lceil D/2 \rceil$. Improving asymptotically on previous results by Butler [Graphs and Combinatorics 2009] and Esperet, Arnaud and Ochem [IPL 2008], we give an induced universal graph with $O\!\left(\frac{k2^k}{k!}n^k \right)$ vertices for the family of graphs with $n$ vertices of maximum degree $D$. For constant $D$, Butler gives a lower bound of $Ω\!\left(n^{D/2}\right)$. For an odd constant $D\geq 3$, Esperet et al. and Alon and Capalbo [SODA 2008] give a graph with $O\!\left(n^{k-\frac{1}{D}}\right)$ vertices. Using their techniques for any (including constant) even values of $D$ gives asymptotically worse bounds than we present.
  For large $D$, i.e. when $D = Ω\left(\log^3 n\right)$, the previous best upper bound was ${n\choose\lceil D/2\rceil} n^{O(1)}$ due to Adjiashvili and Rotbart [ICALP 2014]. We give upper and lower bounds showing that the size is ${\lfloor n/2\rfloor\choose\lfloor D/2 \rfloor}2^{\pm\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{D}\right)}$. Hence the optimal size is $2^{\tilde{O}(D)}$ and our construction is within a factor of $2^{\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{D}\right)}$ from this. The previous results were larger by at least a factor of $2^{Ω(D)}$.
  As a part of the above, proving a conjecture by Esperet et al., we construct an induced universal graph with $2n-1$ vertices for the family of graphs with max degree $2$. In addition, we give results for acyclic graphs with max degree $2$ and cycle graphs. Our results imply the first labeling schemes that for any $D$ are at most $o(n)$ bits from optimal.
