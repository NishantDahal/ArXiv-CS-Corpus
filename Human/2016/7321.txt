Resource allocation in OFDMA networks with half-duplex and imperfect full-duplex users

Recent studies indicate the feasibility of in-band fullduplex (FD) wireless communications, where a wireless radio transmits and receives simultaneously in the same band. Due to its potential to increase the capacity, analyzing the performance of a cellular network that contains full-duplex devices is crucial. In this paper, we consider maximizing the weighted sum-rate of downlink and uplink of a single cell OFDMA network which consists of an imperfect FD base-station (BS) and a mixture of half-duplex and imperfect full-duplex mobile users. To this end, the joint problem of sub-channel assignment and power allocation is investigated and a two-step solution is proposed. A heuristic algorithm to allocate each sub-channel to a pair of downlink and uplink users with polynomial complexity is presented. The power allocation problem is convexified based on the difference of two concave functions approach, for which an iterative solution is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that when all the users and the BS are perfect FD nodes the network throughput could be doubled, Otherwise, the performance improvement is limited by the inter-node interference and the self-interference. We also investigate the effect of the self-interference cancellation capability and the percentage of FD users on the network performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.
