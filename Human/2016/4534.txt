Augmented Reality Oculus Rift

This paper covers the whole process of developing an Augmented Reality Stereoscopig Render Engine for the Oculus Rift. To capture the real world in form of a camera stream, two cameras with fish-eye lenses had to be installed on the Oculus Rift DK1 hardware. The idea was inspired by Steptoe \cite{steptoe2014presence}. After the introduction, a theoretical part covers all the most neccessary elements to achieve an AR System for the Oculus Rift, following the implementation part where the code from the AR Stereo Engine is explained in more detail. A short conclusion section shows some results, reflects some experiences and in the final chapter some future works will be discussed. The project can be accessed via the git repository https://github.com/MaXvanHeLL/ARift.git.
