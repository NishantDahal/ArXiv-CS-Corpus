A Survey of Visual Analysis of Human Motion and Its Applications

This paper summarizes the recent progress in human motion analysis and its applications. In the beginning, we reviewed the motion capture systems and the representation model of human's motion data. Next, we sketched the advanced human motion data processing technologies, including motion data filtering, temporal alignment, and segmentation. The following parts overview the state-of-the-art approaches of action recognition and dynamics measuring since these two are the most active research areas in human motion analysis. The last part discusses some emerging applications of the human motion analysis in healthcare, human robot interaction, security surveillance, virtual reality and animation. The promising research topics of human motion analysis in the future is also summarized in the last part.
