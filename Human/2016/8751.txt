3D zigzag for multislicing, multiband and video processing

We present a 3D zigzag rafter (first in literature) which allows us to obtain the exact sequence of spectral components after application of Discrete Cosine Transform 3D (DCT-2D) over a cube. Such cube represents part of a video or eventually a group of images such as multislicing (e.g., Magnetic Resonance or Computed Tomography imaging) and multi or hyperspectral imagery (optical satellites). Besides, we present a new version of the traditional 2D zigzag, including the case of rectangular blocks. Finally, all the attached code is done in MATLAB, and that code serves both blocks of pixels or blocks of blocks.
