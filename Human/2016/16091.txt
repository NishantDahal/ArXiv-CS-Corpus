Throughput Optimal Listen-Before-Talk for Cellular in Unlicensed Spectrum

The effort to extend cellular technologies to unlicensed spectrum has been gaining high momentum. Listen-before-talk (LBT) is enforced in the regions such as European Union and Japan to harmonize coexistence of cellular and incumbent systems in unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we study throughput optimal LBT transmission strategy for load based equipment (LBE). We find that the optimal rule is a pure threshold policy: The LBE should stop listening and transmit once the channel quality exceeds an optimized threshold. We also reveal the optimal set of LBT parameters that are compliant with regulatory requirements. Our results shed light on how the regulatory LBT requirements can affect the transmission strategies of radio equipment in unlicensed spectrum.
