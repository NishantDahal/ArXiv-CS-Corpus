Corrigendum to "Is the expertise of evaluation panels congruent with the research interests of the research groups: a quantitative approach based on barycenters" [Journal of Informetrics 9(4) (2015) 704-721]

In Rahman, Guns, Rousseau, and Engels (2015) we described several approaches to determine the cognitive distance between two units. One of these approaches was based on what we called barycenters in N dimensions. This note corrects this terminology and introduces the more adequate term 'similarity-adapted publication vectors'.
