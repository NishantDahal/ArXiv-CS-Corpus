Time-Frequency analysis via the Fourier Representation

The nonstationary nature of signals and nonlinear systems require the time-frequency representation. In time-domain signal, frequency information is derived from the phase of the Gabor's analytic signal which is practically obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. This study presents time-frequency analysis by the Fourier transform which maps the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain. In this study, we derive the time information from the phase of the frequency-domain signal and obtain the time-frequency representation. In order to obtain the time information in Fourier domain, we define the concept of `frequentaneous time' which is frequency derivative of phase. This is very similar to the group delay, which is also defined as frequency derivative of phase and it provide physical meaning only when it is positive. The frequentaneous time is always positive or negative depending upon whether signal is defined for only positive or negative times, respectively. If a signal is defined for both positive and negative times, then we divide the signal into two parts, signal for positive times and signal for negative times. The proposed frequentaneous time and Fourier transform based time-frequency distribution contains only those frequencies which are present in the Fourier spectrum. Simulations and numerical results, on many simulated as well as read data, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for the time-frequency analysis of a signal.
