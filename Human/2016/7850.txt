Virtual World, Defined from a Technological Perspective, and Applied to Video Games, Mixed Reality and the Metaverse

There is no generally accepted definition for a virtual world, with many complimentary terms and acronyms having emerged implying a virtual world. Advances in systems architecture techniques such as, host migration of instances, mobile ad-hoc networking, and distributed computing, bring in to question whether those architectures can actually support a virtual world. Without a concrete definition, controversy ensues and it is problematic to design an architecture for a virtual world. Several researchers provided a definition but aspects of each definition are still problematic and simply can not be applied to contemporary technologies. The approach of this article is to sample technologies using grounded theory, and obtain a definition for a `virtual world' that is directly applicable to technology. The obtained definition is compared with related work and used to classify advanced technologies, such as: a pseudo-persistent video game, a MANet, virtual and mixed reality, and the Metaverse. The results of this article include: a break down of which properties set apart the various technologies; a definition that is validated by comparing it with other definitions; an ontology showing the relation of the different complimentary terms and acronyms; and, the usage of pseudo-persistence to categories those technologies which only mimic persistence.
