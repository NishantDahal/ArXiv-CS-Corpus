A unified approach to autocorrelation of Frank, Chu, and Milewski sequences

We construct a family of perfect polyphase sequences that has the Frank sequences, Chu sequences, and Milewski sequences as special cases. This is not the most general construction of this type, but it has a particularly simple form. We also include some remarks about the acyclic autocorrelations of our sequences.
