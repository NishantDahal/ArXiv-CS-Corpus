60 GHz Outdoor Urban Measurement Study of the Feasibility of Multi-Gbps mm-Wave Cellular Networks

Future 5G cellular networks are expected to exploit the abundant spectrum resources of the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands to satisfy demand for multi-Gbps mobile links anticipated by exponential data traffic growth. However, given the directional nature of mm-wave links, the feasibility of mm-wave mobile networks is critically dependent on efficient antenna beamsteering and a rich inventory of strong LOS (line-of-sight) and NLOS (non line-of-sight) paths from effective reflectors in the urban environment. In this paper we report results from detailed angular measurements of 60 GHz links at an example outdoor pico-cellular site in a mixed-use urban environment typical of European cities. Our work is the first to systematically analyze the beamsteering requirements of future mm-wave cellular networks based on real measurements. Our results reveal that the urban environment provides substantial opportunities for multi-Gbps mm-wave connectivity, but that the availability of strong LOS/NLOS links is highly location and orientation-specific. Our results also show that high speed mm-wave links are very sensitive to beam misalignment. This has important implications for practical mm-wave cellular network design: (i) high-precision beamsteering is required to maintain stable data rates even for quasi-stationary users; and (ii) providing seamless high speed service in mobility scenarios will be extremely challenging. Our results thus cast doubt on whether outdoor mm-wave cellular deployments will be feasible in practice, given the high network control overhead of meeting such stringent beamsteering requirements.
