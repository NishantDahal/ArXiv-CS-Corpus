Females' Enrollment and Completion in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Massive Open Online Courses

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have the potential to democratize education by providing learners with access to rich sources of information. However, evidence supporting this democratization across countries is limited. We explored the question of democratization by investigating whether females from different countries were more likely to enroll in and complete STEM MOOCs compared with males. We found that whereas females were less likely to enroll in STEM MOOCs, they were equally likely to complete them. We found smaller gender gaps in STEM MOOC enrollment in less economically developed countries. Further, females were more likely than males to complete STEM MOOCs in countries identified as having a high potential to become the largest economies in the 21st century.
