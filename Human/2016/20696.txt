Separating Bounded Arithmetics by Herbrand Consistency

The problem of $Π_1-$separating the hierarchy of bounded arithmetic has been studied in the paper. It is shown that the notion of Herbrand Consistency, in its full generality, cannot $Π_1-$separate the theory ${\rm IΔ_0+\bigwedge_jΩ_j}$ from ${\rm IΔ_0}$; though it can $Π_1-$separate ${\rm IΔ_0+Exp}$ from ${\rm IΔ_0}$. This extends a result of L. A. Kołodziejczyk (2006), by showing the unprovability of the Herbrand Consistency of ${\rm IΔ_0}$ in the theory ${\rm IΔ_0+\bigwedge_jΩ_j}$.
