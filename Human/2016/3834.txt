Computing Shortest Paths Using A*, Landmarks, and Polygon Inequalities (Abstract)

We introduce a new heuristic for the A* algorithm that references a data structure much smaller than the one required by the ALT heuristic. This heuristic's benefits are permitted by a new approach for computing lower bounds using generalized polygon inequalities, leveraging distance information from two landmarks as opposed to the common single landmark paradigm. In this paper, we demonstrate that this heuristic stores a reduced amount of preprocessing information in comparison to previous landmark algorithms while performing faster search queries.
