Lessons from DEPLOYment

This paper reviews the major lessons learnt during two significant pilot projects by Bosch Research during the DEPLOY project. Principally, the use of a single formalism, even when it comes together with a rigorous refinement methodology like Event-B, cannot offer a complete solution. Unfortunately (but not unexpectedly), we cannot offer a panacea to cover every phase from requirements to code; in fact any specific formalism or language (or tool) should be used only where and when it is really suitable and not necessarily (and somehow forcibly) over the entire lifecycle.
