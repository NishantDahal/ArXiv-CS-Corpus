A 3D Spatial Fluid Model for Wireless Networks

In this article we develop a three dimensional (3D) analytical model of wireless networks. We establish an analytical expression of the SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) of user equipments (UE), by using a 3D fluid model approach of the network. This model enables to evaluate in a simple way the cumulative distribution function of the SINR, and therefore the performance, the quality of service and the coverage of wireless networks, with a high accuracy. The use of this 3D wireless network model, instead of a standard two-dimensional one, in order to analyze wireless networks, is particularly interesting. Indeed, this 3D model enables to establish more accurate performance and quality of services results than a 2D one.
