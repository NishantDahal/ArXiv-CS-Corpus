On Quantitatively Measuring Controllability of Complex Networks

This letter deals with the controllability issue of complex networks. An index is chosen to quantitatively measure the extent of controllability of given network. The effect of this index is analyzed based on empirical studies on various classes of network topologies, such as random network, small-world network, and scale-free network.
