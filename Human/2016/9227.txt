Smart Massive MIMO: An Infrastructure toward 5th Generation Smart Cities Network

On the Optimizing of Wireless Networks and toward improving the future 5th Generation mobile Network Infrastructure, we propose a novel infrastructure that can be the next Smart City Network. Our proposed Infrastructure takes into consideration most future demands and challenges, includes Capacity, Reliability, Scalability, and Flexibility. To deal with this issues we propose a wireless network infrastructure that is based on latest technologies of Massive MIMO systems. We further extend our infrastructure with many smart features, to be capable of coping with Cloud Computing, Smartphones, IoT and other intelligence-based services. The proposed infrastructure uses Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), Software-Defined Networking
  (SDN), Virtual Antenna Arrays (VAA) and Joint Beamforming to afford flexibility. We further propose a Terminal-centric rather than a Cell-centric based Infrastructure, which optimize interference aware environment and lead to higher capacity and reliability. The new infrastructure includes multi-purpose nodes that run a Network Operating System (NOS). This node will afford a scalable and flexible cost effective and semi-distributed network resources. Other propositions that meet Power-Effective, Cost-Effective, and Scenery aware design are discussed. Keywords - Wireless Network Infrastructure, Massive MIMO, Joint Beamforming, Cloud-based Networks, NFV, SDN, Cloud Computing, Grid Computing, and Distributed Systems.
