Distributed Processing of Biosignal-Database for Emotion Recognition with Mahout

This paper investigates the use of distributed processing on the problem of emotion recognition from physiological sensors using a popular machine learning library on distributed mode. Specifically, we run a random forests classifier on the biosignal-data, which have been pre-processed to form exclusive groups in an unsupervised fashion, on a Cloudera cluster using Mahout. The use of distributed processing significantly reduces the time required for the offline training of the classifier, enabling processing of large physiological datasets through many iterations.
