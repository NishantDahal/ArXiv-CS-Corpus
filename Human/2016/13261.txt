Parallel Metric Tree Embedding based on an Algebraic View on Moore-Bellman-Ford

A \emph{metric tree embedding} of expected \emph{stretch~$α\geq 1$} maps a weighted $n$-node graph $G = (V, E, ω)$ to a weighted tree $T = (V_T, E_T, ω_T)$ with $V \subseteq V_T$ such that, for all $v,w \in V$, $\operatorname{dist}(v, w, G) \leq \operatorname{dist}(v, w, T)$ and $operatorname{E}[\operatorname{dist}(v, w, T)] \leq α\operatorname{dist}(v, w, G)$. Such embeddings are highly useful for designing fast approximation algorithms, as many hard problems are easy to solve on tree instances. However, to date the best parallel $(\operatorname{polylog} n)$-depth algorithm that achieves an asymptotically optimal expected stretch of $α\in \operatorname{O}(\log n)$ requires $\operatornameΩ(n^2)$ work and a metric as input.
  In this paper, we show how to achieve the same guarantees using $\operatorname{polylog} n$ depth and $\operatorname{\tilde{O}}(m^{1+ε})$ work, where $m = |E|$ and $ε> 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. Moreover, one may further reduce the work to $\operatorname{\tilde{O}}(m + n^{1+ε})$ at the expense of increasing the expected stretch to $\operatorname{O}(ε^{-1} \log n)$.
  Our main tool in deriving these parallel algorithms is an algebraic characterization of a generalization of the classic Moore-Bellman-Ford algorithm. We consider this framework, which subsumes a variety of previous "Moore-Bellman-Ford-like" algorithms, to be of independent interest and discuss it in depth. In our tree embedding algorithm, we leverage it for providing efficient query access to an approximate metric that allows sampling the tree using $\operatorname{polylog} n$ depth and $\operatorname{\tilde{O}}(m)$ work.
  We illustrate the generality and versatility of our techniques by various examples and a number of additional results.
