On the Construction of High Dimensional Simple Games

Voting is a commonly applied method for the aggregation of the preferences of multiple agents into a joint decision. If preferences are binary, i.e., "yes" and "no", every voting system can be described by a (monotone) Boolean function $χ\colon\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$. However, its naive encoding needs $2^n$ bits. The subclass of threshold functions, which is sufficient for homogeneous agents, allows a more succinct representation using $n$ weights and one threshold. For heterogeneous agents, one can represent $χ$ as an intersection of $k$ threshold functions. Taylor and Zwicker have constructed a sequence of examples requiring $k\ge 2^{\frac{n}{2}-1}$ and provided a construction guaranteeing $k\le {n\choose {\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}\in 2^{n-o(n)}$. The magnitude of the worst-case situation was thought to be determined by Elkind et al.~in 2008, but the analysis unfortunately turned out to be wrong. Here we uncover a relation to coding theory that allows the determination of the minimum number $k$ for a subclass of voting systems. As an application, we give a construction for $k\ge 2^{n-o(n)}$, i.e., there is no gain from a representation complexity point of view.
