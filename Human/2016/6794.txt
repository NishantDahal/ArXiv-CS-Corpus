Coded Pilot Access: A Random Access Solution for Massive MIMO Systems

We present a novel access protocol for crowd scenarios in massive MIMO (Multiple-input multiple-output) systems. Crowd scenarios are characterized by a large number of users with intermittent access behavior, whereby orthogonal scheduling is infeasible. In such scenarios, random access is a natural choice. The proposed access protocol relies on two essential properties of a massive MIMO system, namely asymptotic orthogonality between user channels and asymptotic invariance of channel powers. Signal processing techniques that take advantage of these properties allow us to view a set of contaminated pilot signals as a graph code on which iterative belief propagation can be performed. This makes it possible to decontaminate pilot signals and increase the throughput of the system. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed access protocol increases the throughput with 36%, when having 400 antennas at the base station, compared to the conventional method of slotted ALOHA. With 1024 antennas, the throughput is increased by 85%.
