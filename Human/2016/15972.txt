Metastable Memristive Lines for Signal Transmission and Information Processing Applications

Traditional studies of memristive devices have mainly focused on their applications in non-volatile information storage and information processing. Here, we demonstrate that the third fundamental component of information technologies { the transfer of information { can also be employed with memristive devices. For this purpose, we introduce a metastable memristive circuit. Combining metastable memristive circuits into a line, one obtains an architecture capable of transferring a signal edge from one space location to another. We emphasize that the suggested transmission lines employ only resistive components. Moreover, their networks (for example, Y-connected lines) have an information processing capability.
