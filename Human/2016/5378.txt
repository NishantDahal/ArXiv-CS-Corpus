Trends toward real-time network data steganography

Network steganography has been a well-known covert data channeling method for over three decades. The basic set of techniques and implementation tools have not changed significantly since their introduction in the early 1980's. In this paper, we review the predominant methods of classical network steganography, describing the detailed operations and resultant challenges involved in embedding data in the network transport domain. We also consider the various cyber threat vectors of network steganography and point out the major differences between classical network steganography and the widely known end-point multimedia embedding techniques, which focus exclusively on static data modification for data hiding. We then challenge the security community by introducing an entirely new network dat hiding methodology, which we refer to as real-time network data steganography. Finally we provide the groundwork for this fundamental change of covert network data embedding by forming a basic framework for real-time network data operations that will open the path for even further advances in computer network security.
