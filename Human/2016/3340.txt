Philosophical Solution to P=?NP: P is Equal to NP

The P=?NP problem is philosophically solved by showing P is equal to NP in the random access with unit multiply (MRAM) model. It is shown that the MRAM model empirically best models computation hardness. The P=?NP problem is shown to be a scientific rather than a mathematical problem. The assumptions involved in the current definition of the P?=NP problem as a problem involving non deterministic Turing Machines (NDTMs) from axiomatic automata theory are criticized. The problem is also shown to be neither a problem in pure nor applied mathematics. The details of The MRAM model and the well known Hartmanis and Simon construction that shows how to code and simulate NDTMs on MRAM machines is described. Since the computation power of MRAMs is the same as NDTMs, P is equal to NP. The paper shows that the justification for the NDTM P?=NP problem using a letter from Kurt Godel to John Von Neumann is incorrect by showing Von Neumann explicitly rejected automata models of computation hardness and used his computer architecture for modeling computation that is exactly the MRAM model. The paper argues that Deolalikar's scientific solution showing P not equal to NP if assumptions from statistical physics are used, needs to be revisited.
