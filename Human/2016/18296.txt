Performance of Interoperator Fixed-Mobile Network Sharing

We evaluate the downstream performance of our novel interoperator fixed-mobile network sharing, in which operators exchange data in their access networks. We propose a performance evaluation algorithm, and report credible performance evaluation results obtained for 204600 randomly-generated passive optical networks. We show that with the proposed sharing, operators can increase their access network performance even twofold with software-defined upgrades, and with no or minimal new hardware required.
