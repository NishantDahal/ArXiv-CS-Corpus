Characterizing Interest Aggregation in Content-Centric Networks

The Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCN) architectures advocate Interest aggregation as a means to reduce end-to-end latency and bandwidth consumption. To enable these benefits, Interest aggregation must be realized through Pending Interest Tables (PIT) that grow in size at the rate of incoming Interests to an extent that may eventually defeat their original purpose. A thorough analysis is provided of the Interest aggregation mechanism using mathematical arguments backed by extensive discrete-event simulation results. We present a simple yet accurate analytical framework for characterizing Interest aggregation in an LRU cache, and use our model to develop an iterative algorithm to analyze the benefits of Interest aggregation in a network of interconnected caches. Our findings reveal that, under realistic assumptions, an insignificant fraction of Interests in the system benefit from aggregation, compromising the effectiveness of using PITs as an integral component of Content-Centric Networks.
