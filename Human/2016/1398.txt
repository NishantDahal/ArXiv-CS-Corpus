Facing ADAS validation complexity with usage oriented testing

Validating Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is a strategic issue, since such systems are becoming increasingly widespread in the automotive field. ADAS bring extra comfort to drivers, and this has become a selling point. But these functions, while useful, must not affect the general safety of the vehicle which is the manufacturer's responsibility. A significant number of current ADAS are based on vision systems, and applications such as obstacle detection and detection of pedestrians have become essential components of functions such as automatic emergency braking. These systems that preserve and protect road users take on even more importance with the arrival of the new Euro NCAP protocols. Therefore the robustness and reliability of ADAS functions cannot be neglected and car manufacturers need to have tools to ensure that the ADAS functions running on their vehicles operate with the utmost safety. Furthermore, the complexity of these systems in conjunction with the nearly infinite number of parameter combinations related to the usage profile of functions based on image sensors push us to think about testing optimization methods and tool standards to support the design and validation phases of ADAS systems. The resources required for the validation using current methods make them actually less and less adapted to new active safety features, which induce very strong dependability requirements. Today, to test the camera-based ADAS, test vehicles are equipped with these systems and are performing long hours of driving that can last for years. These tests are used to validate the use of the function and to verify its response to the requirements described in the specifications without considering the functional safety standard ISO26262.
