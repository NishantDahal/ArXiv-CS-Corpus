Papers presented at the 32nd International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2016)

This is the list of the full papers accepted for presentation at the 32nd International Conference on Logic Programming, New York City, USA, October 18-21, 2016.
  In addition to the main conference itself, ICLP hosted four pre-conference workshops, the Autumn School on Logic Programing, and a Doctoral Consortium.
  The final versions of the full papers will be published in a special issue of the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). We received eighty eight abstract submissions, of which twenty seven papers were accepted for publication as TPLP rapid communications.
  Papers deemed of sufficiently high quality to be presented as the conference, but not enough to be appear in TPLP, will be published as Technical Communications in the OASIcs series. Fifteen papers fell into this category.
