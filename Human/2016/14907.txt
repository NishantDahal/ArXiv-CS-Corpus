Mac Williams identities and polarized Riemann-Roch conditions

The present note establishes the equivalence of Mac Williams identities for an additive code C and its dual to Polarized Riemann-Roch Conditions on their Zeta-functions. In such a way, the duality of additive codes appears to be a polarized form of the Serre duality on a smooth irreducible projective curve.
