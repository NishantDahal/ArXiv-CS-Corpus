Experience with Heuristics, Benchmarks & Standards for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition

In the paper which inspired the SC-Square project, [E. Abraham, Building Bridges between Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking, Proc. ISSAC '15, pp. 1-6, ACM, 2015] the author identified the use of sophisticated heuristics as a technique that the Satisfiability Checking community excels in and from which it is likely the Symbolic Computation community could learn and prosper. To start this learning process we summarise our experience with heuristic development for the computer algebra algorithm Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition. We also propose and discuss standards and benchmarks as another area where Symbolic Computation could prosper from Satisfiability Checking expertise, noting that these have been identified as initial actions for the new SC-Square community in the CSA project, as described in [E.~Abraham et al., SC$^2$: Satisfiability Checking meets Symbolic Computation (Project Paper)}, Intelligent Computer Mathematics (LNCS 9761), pp. 28--43, Springer, 2015].
