On weak differential uniformity of vectorial Boolean functions as a cryptographic criterion

We study the relation among some security parameters for vectorial Boolean functions which prevent attacks on the related block cipher. We focus our study on a recently-introduced security criterion, called weak differential uniformity, which prevents the existence of an undetectable trapdoor based on imprimitive group action. We present some properties of functions with low weak differential uniformity, especially for the case of power functions and 4-bit S-Boxes.
