Time Reversal with Post-Equalization for OFDM without CP in Massive MIMO

This paper studies the possibility of eliminating the redundant cyclic prefix (CP) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. The absence of CP increases the bandwidth efficiency in expense of intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI). It is known that in massive MIMO, different types of interference fade away as the number of base station (BS) antennas tends to infinity. In this paper, we investigate if the channel distortions in the absence of CP are averaged out in the large antenna regime. To this end, we analytically study the performance of the conventional maximum ratio combining (MRC) and realize that there always remains some residual interference leading to saturation of signal to interference (SIR). This saturation of SIR is quantified through mathematical equations. Moreover, to resolve the saturation problem, we propose a technique based on time-reversal MRC with zero forcing multiuser detection (TR-ZF). Thus, the SIR of our proposed TR-ZF does not saturate and is a linear function of the number of BS antennas. We also show that TR-ZF only needs one OFDM demodulator per user irrespective of the number of BS antennas; reducing the BS signal processing complexity significantly. Finally, we corroborate our claims as well as analytical results through simulations.
