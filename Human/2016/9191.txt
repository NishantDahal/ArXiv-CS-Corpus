Energy-Efficient Transmission Design in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered as a promising technology for improving the spectral efficiency (SE) in 5G. In this correspondence, we study the benefit of NOMA in enhancing energy efficiency (EE) for a multi-user downlink transmission, where the EE is defined as the ratio of the achievable sum rate of the users to the total power consumption. Our goal is to maximize the EE subject to a minimum required data rate for each user, which leads to a non-convex fractional programming problem. To solve it, we first establish the feasible range of the transmitting power that is able to support each user's data rate requirement. Then, we propose an EE-optimal power allocation strategy that maximizes the EE. Our numerical results show that NOMA has superior EE performance in comparison with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA).
