Performance analysis of smart digital signage system based on software-defined IoT and invisible image sensor communication

Everything in the world is being connected, and things are becoming interactive. The future of the interactive world depends on the future Internet of Things (IoT). Software-defined networking (SDN) technology, a new paradigm in the networking area, can be useful in creating an IoT because it can handle interactivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them, and data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea of invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it, and the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In addition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the user and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a smartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The proposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has the flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any hardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere. A performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT network over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing analysis for a dynamic link allocation process in the case of user access to the IoT network.
