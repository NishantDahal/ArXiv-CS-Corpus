Asynchronous Distributed Hypothesis Testing in the Presence of Crash Failures

This paper addresses the problem of distributed hypothesis testing in multi-agent networks, where agents repeatedly collect local observations about an unknown state of the world, and try to collaboratively detect the true state through information exchange. We focus on the impact of failures and asynchrony (two fundamental factors in distributed systems) on the performance of consensus-based non-Bayesian learning. In particular, we consider the scenario where the networked agents may suffer crash faults, and messages delay can be arbitrarily long but finite. We identify the minimal global detectability of the network for non-Bayesian rule to succeed. In addition, we obtain a generalization of a celebrated result by Wolfowitz and Hajnal to submatrices, which might be of independent interest.
