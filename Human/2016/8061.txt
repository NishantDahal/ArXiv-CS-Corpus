Gesture-based Continuous Authentication for Wearable Devices: the Google Glass Case

We study the feasibility of touch gesture behavioural biometrics for implicit authentication of users on a smartglass (Google Glass) by proposing a continuous authentication system using two classifiers: SVM with RBF kernel, and a new classifier based on Chebyshev's concentration inequality. Based on data collected from 30 volunteers, we show that such authentication is feasible both in terms of classification accuracy and computational load on smartglasses. We achieve a classification accuracy of up to 99% with only 75 training samples using behavioural biometric data from four different types of touch gestures. To show that our system can be generalized, we test its performance on touch data from smartphones and found the accuracy to be similar to smartglasses. Finally, our experiments on the permanence of gestures show that the negative impact of changing user behaviour with time on classification accuracy can be best alleviated by periodically replacing older training samples with new randomly chosen samples.
