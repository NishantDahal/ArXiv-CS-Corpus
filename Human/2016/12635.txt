A Family of Reversible BCH Codes

Cyclic codes are an interesting class of linear codes due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms as well as their theoretical importance. BCH codes form a subclass of cyclic codes and are very important in both theory and practice as they have good error-correcting capability and are widely used in communication systems, storage devices and consumer electronics. However, the dimension and minimum distance of BCH codes are not known in general. The objective of this paper is to study the dimension and minimum distance of a family of BCH codes over finite fields, i.e., a class of reversible BCH codes.
