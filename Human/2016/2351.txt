Algorithms and Heuristics for Scalable Betweenness Centrality Computation on Multi-GPU Systems

Betweenness Centrality (BC) is steadily growing in popularity as a metrics of the influence of a vertex in a graph. The BC score of a vertex is proportional to the number of all-pairs-shortest-paths passing through it. However, complete and exact BC computation for a large-scale graph is an extraordinary challenge that requires high performance computing techniques to provide results in a reasonable amount of time. Our approach combines bi-dimensional (2-D) decomposition of the graph and multi-level parallelism together with a suitable data-thread mapping that overcomes most of the difficulties caused by the irregularity of the computation on GPUs. Furthermore, we propose novel heuristics which exploit the topology information of the graph in order to reduce time and space requirements of BC computation. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world graphs show that the proposed techniques allow the BC computation of graphs which are too large to fit in the memory of a single computational node along with a significant reduction of the computing time.
