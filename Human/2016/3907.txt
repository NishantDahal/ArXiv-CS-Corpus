Analysis of the Packet Loss Probability in Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks

A Markovian battery model is proposed to provide the variation of energy states for energy harvesting (EH) secondary users (SUs) in the EH cognitive radio networks (CRN). Based on the proposed battery model, we derive the packet loss probability in the EH SUs due to sensing inaccuracy and energy outage. With the proposed analysis, the packet loss probability can easily be predicted and utilized to optimize the transmission policy (i.e., opportunities for successful transmission and EH) of EH SUs to improve their throughput. Especially, the proposed method can be applied to upper layer (scheduling and routing) optimization. To this end, we validate the proposed analysis through Monte-Carlo simulation and show an agreement between the analysis and simulations results.
