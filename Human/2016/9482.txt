Data Centers as Dispatchable Loads to Harness Stranded Power

We analyze how both traditional data center integration and dispatchable load integration affect power grid efficiency. We use detailed network models, parallel optimization solvers, and thousands of renewable generation scenarios to perform our analysis. Our analysis reveals that significant spillage and stranded power will be observed in power grids as wind power levels are increased. A counter-intuitive finding is that collocating data centers with inflexible loads next to wind farms has limited impacts on renewable portfolio standard (RPS) goals because it provides limited system-level flexibility and can in fact increase stranded power and fossil-fueled generation. In contrast, optimally placing data centers that are dispatchable (with flexible loads) provides system-wide flexibility, reduces stranded power, and improves efficiency. In short, optimally placed dispatchable computing loads can enable better scaling to high RPS. We show that these dispatchable computing loads are powered to 60~80\% of their requested capacity, indicating that there are significant economic incentives provided by stranded power.
