Wireless Authentication System for Barcode Scanning Using Infrared Communication Technique

This paper presents the verified methodology for wireless authentication system using infrared barcode based scanner. An alternate approach of scanning a barcode using an infrared communication is implemented here, comprises of a card on which a barcode is printed is illuminated with an infrared beam. The reflections from the card are received by an infrared receiver and transmit them to a remote machine over wireless channel where the retrieve information is further processed and converted into the corresponding barcode digits which are further matched against the database stored in the server and the authenticity of the user is established. The system developed is cost-effective, efficient, provide double security and robust.
