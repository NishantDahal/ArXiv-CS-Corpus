Epiphany-V: A 1024 processor 64-bit RISC System-On-Chip

This paper describes the design of a 1024-core processor chip in 16nm FinFet technology. The chip ("Epiphany-V") contains an array of 1024 64-bit RISC processors, 64MB of on-chip SRAM, three 136-bit wide mesh Networks-On-Chip, and 1024 programmable IO pins. The chip has taped out and is being manufactured by TSMC.
