The Ethereum Scratch Off Puzzle

Ethereum represents new innovation in the fields of cryptocurrency which has become relatively stagnate, promising many things, including an entire programming language and development enviroment built into the network. However the current trend is to write implementations and proof of concepts before doing the rigor involved with proving security. Miller's recent thesis is an attempt to remedy this, and we apply his provable security techniques to the algorithm description of CASPER, the new "proof-of-stake" consensus protocol scheme to be implemented in ethereum. We conclude by stating it satisfies almost all the definitions, except one, leaving room for improvement.
