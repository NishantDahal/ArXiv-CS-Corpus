A short review and primer on online processing of multiple signal sources in human computer interaction applications

The application of psychophysiological in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Stream processing sytems (SPS) are emerging computational platforms that can be utilized in human-computer interaction for real-time analysis of high-volume multimodal signals. Usage of complementary information contained in multiple signals is desireable as it can make HCI systems more robust. In this preprint we review existing software and hardware solutions for HCI-centric stream processing systems. The preprint also includes a brief introduction into SPS design considerations and structure from the perspective of analysing physiological signals.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
