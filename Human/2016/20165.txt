Diet2Vec: Multi-scale analysis of massive dietary data

Smart phone apps that enable users to easily track their diets have become widespread in the last decade. This has created an opportunity to discover new insights into obesity and weight loss by analyzing the eating habits of the users of such apps. In this paper, we present diet2vec: an approach to modeling latent structure in a massive database of electronic diet journals. Through an iterative contract-and-expand process, our model learns real-valued embeddings of users' diets, as well as embeddings for individual foods and meals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real dataset of 55K users of the popular diet-tracking app LoseIt\footnote{http://www.loseit.com/}. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest fine-grained diet tracking study in the history of nutrition and obesity research. Our results suggest that diet2vec finds interpretable results at all levels, discovering intuitive representations of foods, meals, and diets.
