On (Secure) Information flow for Multiple-Unicast Sessions: Analysis with Butterfly Network

This paper considers a class of wireline networks, derived from the well-known butterfly network, over which two independent unicast sessions take place simultaneously. The main objectives are to understand when network coding type of operations are beneficial with and without security considerations and to derive the ultimate gains that cooperation among sources and sinks can bring. Towards these goals, the capacity region of the butterfly network with arbitrary edge capacities is first derived. It is then shown that no rate can be guaranteed over this network under security considerations, when an eavesdropper wiretaps any of the links. Three variants of the butterfly network, such as the case of co-located sources, are analyzed as well and their secure and non-secure capacity regions are characterized. By using the butterfly network and its variants as building blocks, these results can be used to design high-throughput achieving transmission schemes for general multiple-unicast networks.
