Cooperative Interference Mitigation Algorithm in Heterogeneous Networks

Heterogeneous hetworks (HetNets) have been introduced as an emerging technology in order to meet the increasing demand for mobile data. HetNets are a combination of multi-layer networks such as macrocells and small cells. In such networks, users may suffer significant cross-layer interference. To manage this interference, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) techniques. Almost Blank SubFrame (ABSF) is one of the time-domain techniques used in eICIC solutions. We propose a dynamically optimal Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR)-based ABSF framework to ensure macro user performance while maintaining small user performance. We also study cooperative mechanisms to help small cells collaborate efficiently in order to reduce mutual interference. Simulations show that our proposed scheme achieves good performance and outperforms the existing ABSF frameworks.
