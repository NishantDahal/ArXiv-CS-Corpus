TeKnowbase: Towards Construction of a Knowledge-base of Technical Concepts

In this paper, we describe the construction of TeKnowbase, a knowledge-base of technical concepts in computer science. Our main information sources are technical websites such as Webopedia and Techtarget as well as Wikipedia and online textbooks. We divide the knowledge-base construction problem into two parts -- the acquisition of entities and the extraction of relationships among these entities. Our knowledge-base consists of approximately 100,000 triples. We conducted an evaluation on a sample of triples and report an accuracy of a little over 90\%. We additionally conducted classification experiments on StackOverflow data with features from TeKnowbase and achieved improved classification accuracy.
