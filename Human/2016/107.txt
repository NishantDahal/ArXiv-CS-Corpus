Flow Control and Scheduling for Shared FIFO Queues over Wireless Networks

We investigate the performance of First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queues over wireless networks. We characterize the stability region of a general scenario where an arbitrary number of FIFO queues, which are served by a wireless medium, are shared by an arbitrary number of flows. In general, the stability region of this system is non-convex. Thus, we develop a convex inner-bound on the stability region, which is provably tight in certain cases. The convexity of the inner bound allows us to develop a resource allocation scheme; dFC. Based on the structure of dFC, we develop a stochastic flow control and scheduling algorithm; qFC. We show that qFC achieves optimal operating point in the convex inner bound. Simulation results show that our algorithms significantly improve the throughput of wireless networks with FIFO queues, as compared to the well-known queue-based flow control and max-weight scheduling.
