A Brief Survey of Non-Residue Based Computational Error Correction

The idea of computational error correction has been around for over half a century. The motivation has largely been to mitigate unreliable devices, manufacturing defects or harsh environments, primarily as a mandatory measure to preserve reliability, or more recently, as a means to lower energy by allowing soft errors to occasionally creep. While residue codes have shown great promise for this purpose, there have been several orthogonal non-residue based techniques. In this article, we provide a high level outline of some of these non-residual approaches.
