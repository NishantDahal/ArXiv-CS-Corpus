Scalable and Cost Efficient Algorithms for Virtual CDN Migration

Virtual Content Delivery Network (vCDN) migration is necessary to optimize the use of resources and improve the performance of the overall SDN/NFV-based CDN function in terms of network operator cost reduction and high streaming quality. It requires intelligent and enticed joint SDN/NFV migration algorithms due to the evident huge amount of traffic to be delivered to end customers of the network. In this paper, two approaches for finding the optimal and near optimal path placement(s) and vCDN migration(s) are proposed (OPAC and HPAC). Moreover, several scenarios are considered to quantify the OPAC and HPAC behaviors and to compare their efficiency in terms of migration cost, migration time, vCDN replication number, and other cost factors. Then, they are implemented and evaluated under different network scales. Finally, the proposed algorithms are integrated in an SDN/NFV framework.
