Effective Road Model for Congestion Control in VANETs

Congestion on the roads is a key problem to deal with, which wastes valuable time.. Due to high mobility rate and relative speed link failure occur very often. VANET is used to tackle the problem of congestion, and make decisions well in advance to avoid traffic congestion. In this paper we proposed a solution to detect and control the traffic congestion by using of both (V2V) and (V2I), as a result the drivers become aware of the location of congestion as well as way to avoid getting stuck in congestion. The congestion is detected by analyzing the data obtained by vehicular communication and road side units to avoid the traffic. Our proposition system is competent of detecting and controlling traffic congestion in real-time. V2V and V2I communication network is used to receive and send the messages. We simulate the result by using Congestion Detection and Control Algorithm (CDCA), and show that this is one effective way to control congestion. The Proposed methodology ensures reliable and timely delivery of messages to know about congestion and avoid it.
