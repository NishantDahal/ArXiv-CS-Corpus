Complexity of Nondeterministic Graph Parameter Testing

We study the sample complexity of nondeterministically testable graph parameters and improve existing bounds on it by several orders of magnitude. The technique used would be also of independent interest. We also discuss the special case of weak nondeterministic testing for uniform hypergraphs of arbitrary order.
