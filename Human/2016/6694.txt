Public Key Encryption in Non-Abelian Groups

In this paper, we propose a brand new public key encryption scheme in the Lie group that is a non-abelian group. In particular, we firstly investigate the intractability assumptions in the Lie group, including the non-abelian factoring assumption and non-abelian inserting assumption. After that, by using the FO technique, a CCA secure public key encryption scheme in the Lie group is proposed. At last, we present the security proof in the random oracle based on the non-abelian inserting assumption.
