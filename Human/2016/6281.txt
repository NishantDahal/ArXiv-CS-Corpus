A partition of the hypercube into maximally nonparallel Hamming codes

By using the Gold map, we construct a partition of the hypercube into cosets of Hamming codes such that for every two cosets the corresponding Hamming codes are maximally nonparallel, that is, their intersection cardinality is as small as possible to admit nonintersecting cosets.
