Clustering Millions of Faces by Identity

In this work, we attempt to address the following problem: Given a large number of unlabeled face images, cluster them into the individual identities present in this data. We consider this a relevant problem in different application scenarios ranging from social media to law enforcement. In large-scale scenarios the number of faces in the collection can be of the order of hundreds of million, while the number of clusters can range from a few thousand to millions--leading to difficulties in terms of both run-time complexity and evaluating clustering and per-cluster quality. An efficient and effective Rank-Order clustering algorithm is developed to achieve the desired scalability, and better clustering accuracy than other well-known algorithms such as k-means and spectral clustering. We cluster up to 123 million face images into over 10 million clusters, and analyze the results in terms of both external cluster quality measures (known face labels) and internal cluster quality measures (unknown face labels) and run-time. Our algorithm achieves an F-measure of 0.87 on a benchmark unconstrained face dataset (LFW, consisting of 13K faces), and 0.27 on the largest dataset considered (13K images in LFW, plus 123M distractor images). Additionally, we present preliminary work on video frame clustering (achieving 0.71 F-measure when clustering all frames in the benchmark YouTube Faces dataset). A per-cluster quality measure is developed which can be used to rank individual clusters and to automatically identify a subset of good quality clusters for manual exploration.
