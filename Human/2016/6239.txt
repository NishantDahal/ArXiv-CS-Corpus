Average-Case Optimal Approximate Circular String Matching

Approximate string matching is the problem of finding all factors of a text t of length n that are at a distance at most k from a pattern x of length m. Approximate circular string matching is the problem of finding all factors of t that are at a distance at most k from x or from any of its rotations. In this article, we present a new algorithm for approximate circular string matching under the edit distance model with optimal average-case search time O(n(k + log m)/m). Optimal average-case search time can also be achieved by the algorithms for multiple approximate string matching (Fredriksson and Navarro, 2004) using x and its rotations as the set of multiple patterns. Here we reduce the preprocessing time and space requirements compared to that approach.
