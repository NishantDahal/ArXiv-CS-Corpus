NIMBUS: A Hybrid Cloud-Crowd Realtime Architecture for Visual Learning in Interactive Domains

Robotic architectures that incorporate cloud-based resources are just now gaining popularity. However, researchers have very few investigations into their capabilities to support claims of their feasibility. We propose a novel method to exchange quality for speed of response. Further, we back this assertion with empirical findings from experiments performed with Amazon Mechanical Turk and find that our method improves quality in exchange for response time in our cognitive architecture.
