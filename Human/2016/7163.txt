Implementation of linear detection techniques to overcome channel effects in MIMO

Spatial diversity technique enables improvement in quality and reliability of wireless link. Antenna diversity along with understanding effects of channel on transmitted signal and methods to overcome the channel impairment plays an important role in wireless communication where sharing of channel occurs between users. In this paper single input single output system (SISO) is compared with multiple input multiple output system (MIMO) in terms of bit error rate performance. Bit error rate performance is also evaluated for MIMO with least squares (LS) and Minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear detection. Further analysis and simulation is done to understand the effect of channel imperfections on BER.
