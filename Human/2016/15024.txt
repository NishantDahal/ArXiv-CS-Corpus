Towards a Constant-Gap Sum-Capacity Result for the Gaussian Wiretap Channel with a Helper

Recent investigations have shown that the sum secure degrees of freedom of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper is $\tfrac{1}{2}$. The achievable scheme for this result is based on the real interference alignment approach. While providing a good way to show degrees of freedom results, this technique has the disadvantage of relying on the Khintchine-Groshev theorem and is therefore limited to {\it almost all channel gains}. This means that there are infinitely many channel gains, where the scheme fails. Furthermore, the real interference alignment approach cannot be used to yield stronger constant-gap results. We approach this topic from a signal-scale alignment perspective and use the linear deterministic model as a first approximation. Here we can show a constant-gap sum capacity for certain channel gain parameters. We transfer these results to the Gaussian model and discuss the results.
