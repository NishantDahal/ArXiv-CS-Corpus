Successive Interference Cancellation in Bipolar Ad Hoc Networks with SWIPT

Successive interference cancellation (SIC) is based on the idea that some interfering signals may be strong enough to decode in order to be removed from the aggregate received signal and thus boost performance. In this letter, we study the SIC technique from a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) standpoint. We consider a bipolar ad hoc network and evaluate the impact of SIC on the SWIPT performance for the power splitting technique. Theoretical and numerical results show that our proposed approach can achieve significant energy gains and under certain scenarios the average harvested energy converges to its upper bound.
