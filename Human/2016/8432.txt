On Improving Capacity of Full-Duplex Small Cells with D2D

The recent developments in full duplex (FD) communication promise doubling the capacity of cellular networks using self interference cancellation (SIC) techniques. FD small cells with device-to-device (D2D) communication links could achieve the expected capacity of the future cellular networks (5G). In this work, we consider joint scheduling and dynamic power algorithm (DPA) for a single cell FD small cell network with D2D links (D2DLs). We formulate the optimal user selection and power control as a non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem to get the optimal user scheduling and transmission power in a given TTI. Our numerical results show that using DPA gives better overall throughput performance than full power transmission algorithm (FPA). Also, simultaneous transmissions (combination of uplink (UL), downlink (DL), and D2D occur 80% of the time thereby increasing the spectral efficiency and network capacity.
