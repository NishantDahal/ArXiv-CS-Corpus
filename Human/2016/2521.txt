Patterns for Learning with Side Information

Supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning estimate a function given input/output samples. Generalization of the learned function to unseen data can be improved by incorporating side information into learning. Side information are data that are neither from the input space nor from the output space of the function, but include useful information for learning it. In this paper we show that learning with side information subsumes a variety of related approaches, e.g. multi-task learning, multi-view learning and learning using privileged information. Our main contributions are (i) a new perspective that connects these previously isolated approaches, (ii) insights about how these methods incorporate different types of prior knowledge, and hence implement different patterns, (iii) facilitating the application of these methods in novel tasks, as well as (iv) a systematic experimental evaluation of these patterns in two supervised learning tasks.
