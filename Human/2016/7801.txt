A Geographic Multi-Copy Routing Scheme for DTNs With Heterogeneous Mobility

Previous geographic routing schemes in Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) only consider the homogeneous scenario where nodal mobility is identical. Motivated by this gap, we turn to design a DTN based geographic routing scheme in heterogeneous scenario. Systematically, our target is achieved via two steps: 1) We first propose "The-Best-Geographic-Relay (TBGR)" routing scheme to relay messages via a limited number of copies, under the homogeneous scenario. We further overcome the local maximum problem of TBGR given a sparse network density, different from those efforts in dense networks like clustered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). 2) We next extend TBGR for heterogeneous scenario, and propose "The-Best-Heterogeneity-Geographic-Relay (TBHGR)" routing scheme considering individual nodal visiting preference (referred to non-identical nodal mobility). Extensive results under a realistic heterogeneous scenario show the advantage of TBHGR over literature works in terms of reliable message delivery, while with low routing overhead.
