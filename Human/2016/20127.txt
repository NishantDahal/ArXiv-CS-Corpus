Density Based Algorithm With Automatic Parameters Generation

The traditional algorithms do not meet the latest multiple requirements simultaneously for objects. Density-based method is one of the methodologies, which can detect arbitrary shaped clusters where clusters are defined as dense regions separated by low density regions. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm to enhance the density-based algorithm DBSCAN. This enables an automatic parameter generation strategy to create clusters with different densities and enables noises recognition, and generates arbitrary shaped clusters. The kdtree is used for increasing the memory efficiency. Experimental result shows that proposed algorithm is capable of handling complex objects with good memory efficiency and accuracy.
