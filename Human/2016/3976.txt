Visualizing source code in 3D Maya software

In this paper is clarify the summaries codes for programmers through three-dimensional shapes, and clearly programmers and developers, scholars and researchers in the field of software engineering, as well as researchers from the representative about threedimensional forms. Through a three-dimensional drawing on a Maya scripts which are based on drawing shapes and three-dimensional stereoscopic show every part of the code, for example, classes, methods, coherence and homogeneity , In these drawings and show clearly and useful.
