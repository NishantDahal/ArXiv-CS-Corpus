An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Massive MIMO Quantization

One of the basic aspects of Massive MIMO (MaMi) that is in the focus of current investigations is its potential of using low-cost and energy-efficient hardware. It is often claimed that MaMi will allow for using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with very low resolutions and that this will result in overall improvement of energy efficiency. In this contribution, we perform a parametric energy efficiency analysis of MaMi uplink for the entire base station receiver system with varying ADC resolutions. The analysis shows that, for a wide variety of system parameters, ADCs with intermediate bit resolutions (4 - 10 bits) are optimal in energy efficiency sense, and that using very low bit resolutions results in degradation of energy efficiency.
