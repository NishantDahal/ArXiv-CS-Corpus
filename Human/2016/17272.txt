Cryptanalysis of Xinyu et al.'s NTRU-Lattice Based Key Exchange Protocol

Xinyu et al. proposed a public key exchange protocol, which is based on the NTRU-lattice based cryptography. In this paper, we show how Xinyu et al.'s NTRU-KE: A lattice based key exchange protocol can be broken, under the assumption that a man-in-the middle attack is used for extracting private keys of users who participate in the key exchange protocol.
