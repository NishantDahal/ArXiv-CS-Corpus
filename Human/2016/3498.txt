The Quadratic Minimum Spanning Tree Problem and its Variations

The quadratic minimum spanning tree problem and its variations such as the quadratic bottleneck spanning tree problem, the minimum spanning tree problem with conflict pair constraints, and the bottleneck spanning tree problem with conflict pair constraints are useful in modeling various real life applications. All these problems are known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we investigate these problems to obtain additional insights into the structure of the problems and to identify possible demarcation between easy and hard special cases. New polynomially solvable cases have been identified, as well as NP-hard instances on very simple graphs. As a byproduct, we have a recursive formula for counting the number of spanning trees on a $(k,n)$-accordion and a characterization of matroids in the context of a quadratic objective function.
