Image segmentation with superpixel-based covariance descriptors in low-rank representation

This paper investigates the problem of image segmentation using superpixels. We propose two approaches to enhance the discriminative ability of the superpixel's covariance descriptors. In the first one, we employ the Log-Euclidean distance as the metric on the covariance manifolds, and then use the RBF kernel to measure the similarities between covariance descriptors. The second method is focused on extracting the subspace structure of the set of covariance descriptors by extending a low rank representation algorithm on to the covariance manifolds. Experiments are carried out with the Berkly Segmentation Dataset, and compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms, both methods are competitive.
