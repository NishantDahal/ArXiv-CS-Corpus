Semantic Folding Theory And its Application in Semantic Fingerprinting

Human language is recognized as a very complex domain since decades. No computer system has been able to reach human levels of performance so far. The only known computational system capable of proper language processing is the human brain. While we gather more and more data about the brain, its fundamental computational processes still remain obscure. The lack of a sound computational brain theory also prevents the fundamental understanding of Natural Language Processing. As always when science lacks a theoretical foundation, statistical modeling is applied to accommodate as many sampled real-world data as possible. An unsolved fundamental issue is the actual representation of language (data) within the brain, denoted as the Representational Problem. Starting with Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) theory, a consistent computational theory of the human cortex, we have developed a corresponding theory of language data representation: The Semantic Folding Theory. The process of encoding words, by using a topographic semantic space as distributional reference frame into a sparse binary representational vector is called Semantic Folding and is the central topic of this document. Semantic Folding describes a method of converting language from its symbolic representation (text) into an explicit, semantically grounded representation that can be generically processed by Hawkins' HTM networks. As it turned out, this change in representation, by itself, can solve many complex NLP problems by applying Boolean operators and a generic similarity function like the Euclidian Distance. Many practical problems of statistical NLP systems, like the high cost of computation, the fundamental incongruity of precision and recall , the complex tuning procedures etc., can be elegantly overcome by applying Semantic Folding.
