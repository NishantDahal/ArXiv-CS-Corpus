A Channelized Binning Method for Extraction of Dominant Color Pixel Value

The Color is one of the most important and easily identifiable features for describing the visual content. The MPEG standard has developed a number of descriptors that covers different aspects of the visual content. The Dominant color descriptor is one of them. This paper proposes a channelized binning approach a novel method for extraction of the dominant color pixel value which is a variant of the dominant color descriptor. The Channelized binning method treats the problem as a statistical problem and tries to avoid color quantization and interpolation guessing of number and centroid of dominant colors. Channelized binning is an iterative approach which automatically estimates the number of dominant pixel values and their centroids. It operates on 24 bit full RGB color space, by considering one color channel at a time and hence avoiding the color quantization. Results show that the proposed method can successfully extract dominant color pixel values.
