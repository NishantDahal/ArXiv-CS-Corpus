PSNR and Jitter Analysis of Routing Protocols for Video Streaming in Sparse MANET Networks, using NS2 and the Evalvid Framework

Advances in multimedia and ad-hoc networking have urged a wealth of research in multimedia delivery over ad-hoc networks. This comes as no surprise, as those networks are versatile and beneficial to a plethora of applications where the use of fully wired network has proved intricate if not impossible, such as prompt formation of networks during conferences, disaster relief in case of flood and earthquake, and also in war activities. It this paper, we aim to investigate the combined impact of network sparsity and network node density on the Peak Signal Noise to Ratio (PSNR) and jitter performance of proactive and reactive routing protocols in ad-hoc networks. We also shed light onto the combined effect of mobility and sparsity on the performance of these protocols. We validate our results through the use of an integrated Simulator-Evaluator environment consisting of the Network Simulator NS2, and the Video Evaluation Framework Evalvid.
