Towards the Formalization of a Factory Demonstrator in BeSpaceD

This report gives an overview of our efforts towards a formalization for a food processing demonstrator plant. Our BeSpaceD framework is used for the formalization. The formalization comprises properties of components and relations between components. We present domain-specific constructs for the formalization of industrial automation facilities and provide some insights into the concrete food processing formalization. We are particularly interested in spatio-temporal and other physical characteristics. Relation- ships are formalized as graphs with annotated edges and components are represented as nodes.
