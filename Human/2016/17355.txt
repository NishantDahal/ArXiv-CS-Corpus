Optimal Codes from Fibonacci Polynomials and Secret Sharing Schemes

In this work, we study cyclic codes that have generators as Fibonacci polynomials over finite fields. We show that these cyclic codes in most cases produce families of maximum distance separable and optimal codes with interesting properties. We explore these relations and present some examples. Also, we present applications of these codes to secret sharing schemes.
