A Technique to Share Multiple Secret Images

Visual Cryptography comes under cryptography domain. It deals with encrypting and decrypting of visual information like pictures, texts, videos $ etc.$ Multi Secret Image Sharing (MSIS) scheme is a part of visual cryptography that provides a protected method to transmit more than one secret images over a communication channel. Conventionally, transmission of a single secret image is possible over a channel at a time. But as technology grows, there emerge a need for sharing more than one secret image. An $(n, n)$-MSIS scheme is used to encrypt $n$ secret images into $n$ meaningless noisy images that are stored over different servers. To recover $n$ secret images all $n$ noisy images are required. At earlier time, the main problem with secret sharing schemes was that attacker can partially figure out secret images, even by getting access of $n-1$ or fewer noisy images. To tackle with this security issue, there arises a need of secure MSIS scheme, so that attacker can not retrieve any information by using less than $n-1$ noisy images. In this paper, we propose a secure $(n, n+1)$-MSIS scheme using additive modulo operation for grayscale and colored images. For checking the effectiveness of proposed scheme; Correlation, MSE and PSNR techniques are used. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is highly secured and altering of noisy images will not reveal any partial information about secret images. The proposed $(n, n+1)$-MSIS scheme outperforms the existing MSIS schemes in terms of security.
