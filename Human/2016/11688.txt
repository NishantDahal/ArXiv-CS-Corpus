A framework for evaluating complex networks measurements

A good deal of current research in complex networks involves the characterization and/or classification of the topological properties of given structures, which has motivated several respective measurements. This letter proposes a framework for evaluating the quality of complex network measurements in terms of their effective resolution, degree of degeneracy and discriminability. The potential of the suggested approach is illustrated with respect to comparing the characterization of several model and real-world networks by using concentric and symmetry measurements. The results indicate a markedly superior performance for the latter type of mapping.
