VNF Placement with Replication for Load Balancing in NFV Networks

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new paradigm, enabling service innovation through virtualization of traditional network functions located flexibly in the network in form of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Since VNFs can only be placed onto servers located in networked data centers, which is the NFV's salient feature, the traffic directed to these data center areas has significant impact on network load balancing. Network load balancing can be even more critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service Function Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. To balance the network load, VNF's can be placed in a smaller cluster of servers in the network thus minimizing the distance to the data center. The optimization of the placement of these clusters is a challenge as also other factors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address this issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and especially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network. We design and compare three optimization methods, including Linear Programing (LP) model, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Fit Placement Algorithm (RFPA) for the allocation and replication of VNFs. Our results show that the optimum placement and replication can significantly improve load balancing, for which we also propose a GA heuristics applicable to larger networks.
