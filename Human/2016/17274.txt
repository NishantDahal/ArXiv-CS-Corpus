Admissibility in Quantitative Graph Games

Admissibility has been studied for games of infinite duration with Boolean objectives. We extend here this study to games of infinite duration with quantitative objectives. First, we show that, un- der the assumption that optimal worst-case and cooperative strategies exist, admissible strategies are guaranteed to exist. Second, we give a characterization of admissible strategies using the no- tion of adversarial and cooperative values of a history, and we characterize the set of outcomes that are compatible with admissible strategies. Finally, we show how these characterizations can be used to design algorithms to decide relevant verification and synthesis problems.
