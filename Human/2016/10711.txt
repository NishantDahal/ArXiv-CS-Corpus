Using Recurrent Neural Network for Learning Expressive Ontologies

Recently, Neural Networks have been proven extremely effective in many natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or machine translation. Aiming to exploit such advantages in the Ontology Learning process, in this technical report we present a detailed description of a Recurrent Neural Network based system to be used to pursue such goal.
