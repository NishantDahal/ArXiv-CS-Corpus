Approximation hardness of Shortest Common Superstring variants

The shortest common superstring (SCS) problem has been studied at great length because of its connections to the de novo assembly problem in computational genomics. The base problem is APX-complete, but several generalizations of the problem have also been studied. In particular, previous results include that SCS with Negative strings (SCSN) is in Log-APX (though there is no known hardness result) and SCS with Wildcards (SCSW) is Poly-APX-hard. Here, we prove two new hardness results: (1) SCSN is Log-APX-hard (and therefore Log-APX-complete) by a reduction from Minimum Set Cover and (2) SCS with Negative strings and Wildcards (SCSNW) is NPOPB-hard by a reduction from Minimum Ones 3SAT.
