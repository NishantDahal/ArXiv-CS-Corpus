Survey of resampling techniques for improving classification performance in unbalanced datasets

A number of classification problems need to deal with data imbalance between classes. Often it is desired to have a high recall on the minority class while maintaining a high precision on the majority class. In this paper, we review a number of resampling techniques proposed in literature to handle unbalanced datasets and study their effect on classification performance.
