Robust Convolutional Neural Networks under Adversarial Noise

Recent studies have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are vulnerable to a small perturbation of input called "adversarial examples". In this work, we propose a new feedforward CNN that improves robustness in the presence of adversarial noise. Our model uses stochastic additive noise added to the input image and to the CNN models. The proposed model operates in conjunction with a CNN trained with either standard or adversarial objective function. In particular, convolution, max-pooling, and ReLU layers are modified to benefit from the noise model. Our feedforward model is parameterized by only a mean and variance per pixel which simplifies computations and makes our method scalable to a deep architecture. From CIFAR-10 and ImageNet test, the proposed model outperforms other methods and the improvement is more evident for difficult classification tasks or stronger adversarial noise.
