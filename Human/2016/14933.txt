Low-Rank Matrix Recovery using Gabidulin Codes in Characteristic Zero

We present a new approach on low-rank matrix recovery (LRMR) based on Gabidulin Codes. Since most applications of LRMR deal with matrices over infinite fields, we use the recently introduced generalization of Gabidulin codes to fields of characterstic zero. We show that LRMR can be reduced to decoding of Gabidulin codes and discuss which field extensions can be used in the code construction.
