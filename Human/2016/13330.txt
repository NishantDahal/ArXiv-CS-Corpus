Some constructions of cyclic and quasi-cyclic subspaces codes

In this paper we construct, using GAP System for Computational Discrete Algebra, some cyclic subspace codes, specially an optimal code over the finite field F_{2^{10}}. Further we present a definition and an example of the $q$-analogous of a $m$-quasi-cyclic subspace code over F_{2^{8}}.
