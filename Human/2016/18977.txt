A Survey on Data Processing Methods and Cloud Computation

As new technologies move to the fore, our understanding of the world may seem to have shrunk in comparison, for despite new developments in research, much of it is reduced or rather, abstracted for marketability. Thus, the purpose of this work is to provide a brief study of current techniques used in data analysis that will yield some clarity and encourage new research. Several applications of which are discussed in relation to the high data volume fields e.g. health care and economics. Particular attention will be given to recent developments in health care.
