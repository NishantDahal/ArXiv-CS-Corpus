Algorithms for the Iterative Estimation of Discrete-Valued Sparse Vectors

In Compressed Sensing, a real-valued sparse vector has to be estimated from an underdetermined system of linear equations. In many applications, however, the elements of the sparse vector are drawn from a finite set. For the estimation of these discrete-valued vectors, matched algorithms are required which take the additional knowledge of the discrete nature into account. In this paper, the estimation problem is treated from a communications engineering point of view. A powerful new algorithm incorporating techniques known from digital communications and information theory is derived. For comparison, Turbo Compressed Sensing is adapted to the discrete setup and a simplified and generalized notation is presented. The performance of the algorithms is covered by numerical simulations.
