Stochastic Variance Reduced Riemannian Eigensolver

We study the stochastic Riemannian gradient algorithm for matrix eigen-decomposition. The state-of-the-art stochastic Riemannian algorithm requires the learning rate to decay to zero and thus suffers from slow convergence and sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address this issue by deploying the variance reduction (VR) technique of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The technique was originally developed to solve convex problems in the Euclidean space. We generalize it to Riemannian manifolds and realize it to solve the non-convex eigen-decomposition problem. We are the first to propose and analyze the generalization of SVRG to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we propose the general variance reduction form, SVRRG, in the framework of the stochastic Riemannian gradient optimization. It's then specialized to the problem with eigensolvers and induces the SVRRG-EIGS algorithm. We provide a novel and elegant theoretical analysis on this algorithm. The theory shows that a fixed learning rate can be used in the Riemannian setting with an exponential global convergence rate guaranteed. The theoretical results make a significant improvement over existing studies, with the effectiveness empirically verified.
