Coverage Analysis In Downlink Poisson Cellular Network With $κ$-$μ$ Shadowed Fading

The downlink coverage probability of a cellular network, when the base station locations are modelled by a Poisson point process (PPP), is known when the desired channel is Nakagami distributed with an integer shape parameter. However, for many interesting fading distributions such as Rician, Rician shadowing, $κ$-$μ$, $η$-$μ$, etc., the coverage probability is unknown. $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading is a generic fading distribution whose special cases are many of these popular distributions known so far. In this letter, we derive the coverage probability when the desired channel experiences $κ$-$μ$ shadowed fading. Using numerical simulations, we verify our analytical expressions.
