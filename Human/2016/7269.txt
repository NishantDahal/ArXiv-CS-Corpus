Real-time collision detection method for deformable bodies

This paper presents a real-time solution for collision detection between objects based on the physics properties. Traditional approaches on collision detection often rely on the geometric relationships that computing the intersections between polygons. Such technique is very computationally expensive when applied for deformable objects. As an alternative, we approximate the 3D mesh in an spherical surface implicitly. This allows us to perform a coarse-level collision detection at extremely fast speed. Then a dynamic programming based procedure is applied to identify the collision in fine details. Our method demonstrates better prevention to collision tunnelling and works more efficiently than the state-of-the-arts.
