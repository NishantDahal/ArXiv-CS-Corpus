Generalized bent functions - sufficient conditions and related constructions

The necessary and sufficient conditions for a class of functions $f:\mathbb{Z}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q$, where $q \geq 2$ is an even positive integer, have been recently identified for $q=4$ and $q=8$. In this article we give an alternative characterization of the generalized Walsh-Hadamard transform in terms of the Walsh spectra of the component Boolean functions of $f$, which then allows us to derive sufficient conditions that $f$ is generalized bent for any even $q$. The case when $q$ is not a power of two, which has not been addressed previously, is treated separately and a suitable representation in terms of the component functions is employed. Consequently, the derived results lead to generic construction methods of this class of functions. The main remaining task, which is not answered in this article, is whether the sufficient conditions are also necessary. There are some indications that this might be true which is also formally confirmed for generalized bent functions that belong to the class of generalized Maiorana-McFarland functions (GMMF), but still we were unable to completely specify (in terms of necessity) gbent conditions.
