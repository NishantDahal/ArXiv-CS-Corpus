Synchronization in Networks of Identical Systems via Pinning: Application to Distributed Secondary Control of Microgrids

Motivated by the need for fast synchronized operation of power microgrids, we analyze the problem of single and multiple pinning in networked systems. We derive lower and upper bounds on the algebraic connectivity of the network with respect to the reference signal. These bounds are utilized to devise a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial complexity to find a suitable set of nodes to pin the network effectively and efficiently. The results are applied to secondary voltage pinning control design for a microgrid in islanded operation mode. Comparisons with existing single and multiple pinning strategies clearly demonstrates the efficacy of the obtained results.
