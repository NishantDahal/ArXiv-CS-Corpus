Naughton's Wisconsin Bibliography: A Brief Guide

Over nearly three decades at the University of Wisconsin, Jeff Naughton has left an indelible mark on computer science. He has been a global leader of the database research field, deepening its core and pushing its boundaries. Many of Naughton's ideas were translated directly into practice in commercial and open-source systems. But software comes and goes. In the end, it is the ideas themselves that have had impact, ideas written down in papers.
  Naughton has been a prolific scholar over the last thirty years, with over 175 publications in his bibliography, covering a wide range of topics. This document does not attempt to enumerate or even summarize the wealth of ideas that Naughton has published over the course of his academic career--the task is too daunting. Instead, the best this short note aims to do is to serve as a rough map of the territory: something to help other researchers navigate the wide spaces of Naughton's work.
