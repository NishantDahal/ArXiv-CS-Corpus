On Mixing in Pairwise Markov Random Fields with Application to Social Networks

We consider pairwise Markov random fields which have a number of important applications in statistical physics, image processing and machine learning such as Ising model and labeling problem to name a couple. Our own motivation comes from the need to produce synthetic models for social networks with attributes. First, we give conditions for rapid mixing of the associated Glauber dynamics and consider interesting particular cases. Then, for pairwise Markov random fields with submodular energy functions we construct monotone perfect simulation.
