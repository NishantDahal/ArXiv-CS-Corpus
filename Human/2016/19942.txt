Cross-Lingual Predicate Mapping Between Linked Data Ontologies

Ontologies in different natural languages often differ in quality in terms of richness of schema or richness of internal links. This difference is markedly visible when comparing a rich English language ontology with a non-English language counterpart. Discovering alignment between them is a useful endeavor as it serves as a starting point in bridging the disparity. In particular, our work is motivated by the absence of inter-language links for predicates in the localised versions of DBpedia. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an ad-hoc system to find possible owl:equivalentProperty links between predicates in ontologies of different natural languages. We seek to achieve this mapping by using pre-existing inter-language links of the resources connected by the given predicate. Thus, our methodology stresses on semantic similarity rather than lexical. Moreover, through an evaluation, we show that our system is capable of outperforming a baseline system that is similar to the one used in recent OAEI campaigns.
