This chapter explores how MOOC Stakeholders may benefit from Learning Analytics as well as it reports an exploratory analysis of some of the offered courses and demonstrate use cases as a typical evaluation of this prototype in order to discover hidden patterns, overture future proper decisions and to optimize learning with applicable and convenient interventions.
