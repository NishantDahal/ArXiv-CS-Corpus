Automatic labeling of molecular biomarkers of whole slide immunohistochemistry images using fully convolutional networks

This paper addresses the problem of quantifying biomarkers in multi-stained tissues, based on color and spatial information. A deep learning based method that can automatically localize and quantify the cells expressing biomarker(s) in a whole slide image is proposed. The deep learning network is a fully convolutional network (FCN) whose input is the true RGB color image of a tissue and output is a map of the different biomarkers. The FCN relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies each cell separately according to the biomarker it expresses. In this study, images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides were collected and used. More than 4,500 RGB images of cells were manually labeled based on the expressing biomarkers. The labeled cell images were used to train the CNN (obtaining an accuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained CNN is then extended to an FCN that generates a map of all biomarkers in the whole slide image acquired by the scanner (instead of classifying every cell image). To evaluate our method, we manually labeled all nuclei expressing different biomarkers in two whole slide images and used theses as the ground truth. Our proposed method for immunohistochemical analysis compares well with the manual labeling by humans (average F-score of 0.96).
