Two-Finger Keyboard Layout Problem: An Application On Turkish Language

Smart phone and tablet usage has sharply increased for the last decade. While entering test on these devices, virtual keyboards are generally used instead of conventional hardware keyboards. In this study, a new problem which is two-finger keyboard layout problem and solution approach is presented for increasing user test entrance performance, especially on virtual keyboards. Defined two-finger keyboard layout problem is modeled as Quadratic Assignment Problem. Because of combinatorial structure of the problem a genetic algorithm is developed. Its result is given to mathematical model as initial solution for finding better solutions with mathematical model. Proposed approach is applied on Turkish language. The new two finger keyboard layout for Turkish language is compared with F and QWERTY keyboard layouts based on certain performance measurement techniques.
