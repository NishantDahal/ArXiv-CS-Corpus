A Review of Pair-wise Testing

In software testing, the large size of the input domain makes exhaustively testing the inputs a daunting and often impossible task. Pair-wise testing is a popular approach to combinatorial testing problems. This paper reviews Pair-wise testing and its history, strengths, weaknesses, and tools for generating test cases.
