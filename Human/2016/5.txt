Bin Packing Problem: A Linear Constant-Space 3/2-Approximation Algorithm

Since the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) is one of the main NP-hard problems, a lot of approximation algorithms have been suggested for it. It has been proven that the best algorithm for BPP has the approximation ratio of 3/2 and the time order of O(n), unless P=NP. In the current paper, a linear 3/2-approximation algorithm is presented. The suggested algorithm not only has the best possible theoretical factors, approximation ratio, space order, and time order, but also outperforms the other approximation algorithms according to the experimental results, therefore, we are able to draw the conclusion that the algorithms is the best approximation algorithm which has been presented for the problem until now. Key words: Approximation Algorithm, Bin Packing Problem, Approximation Ratio, NP-hard.
