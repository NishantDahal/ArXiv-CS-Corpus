Universality of (2+1)-dimensional restricted solid-on-solid models

Extensive dynamical simulations of Restricted Solid on Solid models in $D=2+1$ dimensions have been done using parallel multisurface algorithms implemented on graphics cards. Numerical evidence is presented that these models exhibit KPZ surface growth scaling, irrespective of the step heights $N$. We show that by increasing $N$ the corrections to scaling increase, thus smaller step-sized models describe better the asymptotic, long-wave-scaling behavior.
