Vehicular Communications for 5G Cooperative Small Cell Networks

The cooperative transmission is an effective approach for vehicular communications to improve the wireless transmission capacity and reliability in the fifth generation (5G) small cell networks. Based on distances between the vehicle and cooperative small cell BSs, the cooperative probability and the coverage probability have been derived for 5G cooperative small cell networks where small cell base stations (BSs) follow Poisson point process distributions. Furthermore, the vehicular handoff rate and the vehicular overhead ratio have been proposed to evaluate the vehicular mobility performance in 5G cooperative small cell networks. To balance the vehicular communication capacity and the vehicular handoff ratio, an optimal vehicular overhead ratio can be achieved by adjusting the cooperative threshold of 5G cooperative small cell networks.
