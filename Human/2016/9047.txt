MAC: a novel systematically multilevel cache replacement policy for PCM memory

The rapid development of multi-core system and increase of data-intensive application in recent years call for larger main memory. Traditional DRAM memory can increase its capacity by reducing the feature size of storage cell. Now further scaling of DRAM faces great challenge, and the frequent refresh operations of DRAM can bring a lot of energy consumption. As an emerging technology, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is promising to be used as main memory. It draws wide attention due to the advantages of low power consumption, high density and nonvolatility, while it incurs finite endurance and relatively long write latency. To handle the problem of write, optimizing the cache replacement policy to protect dirty cache block is an efficient way. In this paper, we construct a systematically multilevel structure, and based on it propose a novel cache replacement policy called MAC. MAC can effectively reduce write traffic to PCM memory with low hardware overhead. We conduct simulation experiments on GEM5 to evaluate the performances of MAC and other related works. The results show that MAC performs best in reducing the amount of writes (averagely 25.12%) without increasing the program execution time.
