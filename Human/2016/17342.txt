An Integrated approach for the Secure Transmission of Images based on DNA Sequences

As long as human beings exist on this earth, there will be confidential images intended for limited audience. These images have to be transmitted in such a way that no unauthorized person gets knowledge of them. DNA sequences play a vital role in modern cryptography and DNA sequence based cryptography renders a helping hand for transmission of such confidential images over a public insecure channel as the intended recipient alone can decipher them. This paper outlines an integrated encryption scheme based on DNA sequences and scrambling according to magic square of doubly even order pattern. Since there is negligible correlation between the original and encrypted image this method is robust against any type of crypt attack.
