When more of the same is better

Problem solving (e.g., drug design, traffic engineering, software development) by task forces represents a substantial portion of the economy of developed countries. Here we use an agent-based model of cooperative problem solving systems to study the influence of diversity on the performance of a task force. We assume that agents cooperate by exchanging information on their partial success and use that information to imitate the more successful agent in the system -- the model. The agents differ only in their propensities to copy the model. We find that, for easy tasks, the optimal organization is a homogeneous system composed of agents with the highest possible copy propensities. For difficult tasks, we find that diversity can prevent the system from being trapped in sub-optimal solutions. However, when the system size is adjusted to maximize performance the homogeneous systems outperform the heterogeneous systems, i.e., for optimal performance, sameness should be preferred to diversity.
