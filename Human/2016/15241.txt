Breaking a chaotic image encryption algorithm based on modulo addition and XOR operation

This paper re-evaluates the security of a chaotic image encryption algorithm called MCKBA/HCKBA and finds that it can be broken efficiently with two known plain-images and the corresponding cipher-images. In addition, it is reported that a previously proposed breaking on MCKBA/HCKBA can be further improved by reducing the number of chosen plain-images from four to two. The two attacks are both based on the properties of solving a composite function involving the carry bit, which is composed of the modulo addition and the bitwise OR operations. Both rigorous theoretical analysis and detailed experimental results are provided.
