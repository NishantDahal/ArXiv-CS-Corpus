Low-order continuous finite element spaces on hybrid non-conforming hexahedral-tetrahedral meshes

This article deals with solving partial differential equations with the finite element method on hybrid non-conforming hexahedral-tetrahedral meshes.  By non-conforming, we mean that a quadrangular face of a hexahedron can be connected to two triangular faces of tetrahedra.  We introduce a set of low-order continuous (C0) finite element spaces defined on these meshes.  They are built from standard tri-linear and quadratic Lagrange finite elements with an extra set of constraints at non-conforming hexahedra-tetrahedra junctions to recover continuity.  We consider both the continuity of the geometry and the continuity of the function basis as follows: the continuity of the geometry is achieved by using quadratic mappings for tetrahedra connected to tri-affine hexahedra and the continuity of interpolating functions is enforced in a similar manner by using quadratic Lagrange basis on tetrahedra with constraints at non-conforming junctions to match tri-linear hexahedra.  The so-defined function spaces are validated numerically on simple Poisson and linear elasticity problems for which an analytical solution is known.  We observe that using a hybrid mesh with the proposed function spaces results in an accuracy significantly better than when using linear tetrahedra and slightly worse than when solely using tri-linear hexahedra.  As a consequence, the proposed function spaces may be a promising alternative for complex geometries that are out of reach of existing full hexahedral meshing methods.
