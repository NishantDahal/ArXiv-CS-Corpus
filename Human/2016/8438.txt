Mobile Converged Networks: Framework, Optimization and Challenges

In this paper, a new framework of mobile converged networks is proposed for flexible resource optimization over multi-tier wireless heterogeneous networks. Design principles and advantages of this new framework of mobile converged networks are discussed. Moreover, mobile converged network models based on interference coordination and energy efficiency are presented and the corresponding optimization algorithms are developed. Furthermore, future challenges of mobile converged networks are identified to promote the study in modeling and performance analysis of mobile converged networks.
