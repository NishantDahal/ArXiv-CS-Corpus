Axiomatizing Analog Algorithms

We propose a formalization of generic algorithms that includes analog algorithms. This is achieved by reformulating and extending the framework of abstract state machines to include continuous-time models of computation. We prove that every hybrid algorithm satisfying some reasonable postulates may be expressed precisely by a program in a simple and expressive language.
