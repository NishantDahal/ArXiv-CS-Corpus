Circulant Matrix Representation of PN-sequences with Ideal Autocorrelation Property

In this paper, we investigate PN-sequences with ideal autocorrelation property and the consequences of this property on the number of +1s and -1s and run structure of sequences. We begin by discussing and surveying about the length of PNsequences with ideal autocorrelation property. From our discussion and survey we introduce circulant matrix representation of PN-sequence. Through circulant matrix representation we obtain system of non-linear equations that lead to ideal autocorrelation property. Rewriting PN-sequence and its autocorrelation property in {0,1} leads to a definition based on Hamming weight and Hamming distance and hence we can easily prove some results on the PN-sequences with ideal autocorrelation property.
