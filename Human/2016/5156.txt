Advances in Run-Time Performance and Interoperability for the Adapteva Epiphany Coprocessor

The energy-efficient Adapteva Epiphany architecture exhibits massive many-core scalability in a physically compact 2D array of RISC cores with a fast network-on-chip (NoC). The architecture presents many features and constraints which contribute to software design challenges for the application developer. Addressing these challenges within the software stack that supports application development is critical to improving productivity and expanding the range of applications for the architecture. We report here on advances that have been made in the COPRTHR-2 software stack targeting the Epiphany architecture that address critical issues identified in previous work. Specifically, we describe improvements that bring greater control and precision to the design of compact compiled binary programs in the context of the limited per-core local memory of the architecture. We describe a new design for run-time support that has been implemented to dramatically improve the program load and execute performance and capabilities. Finally, we describe developments that advance host-coprocessor interoperability to expand the functionality available to the application developer.
