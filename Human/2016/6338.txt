The Influence of Trust and subjective Norms on Citizens Intentions to Engage in E-participation on E-government Websites

Advancements in web technology have revolutionised the way citizens interact with governments. Unlike traditional methods of communication between citizens and governments, E-Participation via e-government websites enhances communication and enables citizens to become actively involved in the policy-making process. Despite the growing importance of e-participation, the potential factors influencing citizens engagement in e-participation have not been the subject of investigation. Using responses obtained from Saudi citizens, this study examines a number of factors that may influence the intentions of citizens to engage in e-participation activities on e-government websites. The results suggest that the factors of trust and subjective norms have a significant impact on the intentions of citizens to engage in e-participation activities.
