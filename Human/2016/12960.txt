Verify LTL with Fairness Assumptions Efficiently

This paper deals with model checking problems with respect to LTL properties under fairness assumptions. We first present an efficient algorithm to deal with a fragment of fairness assumptions and then extend the algorithm to handle arbitrary %fairness assumptions ones. Notably, by making use of some syntactic transformations, our algorithm avoids to construct corresponding BÃ¼chi automata for the whole fairness assumptions, which can be very large in practice. We implement our algorithm in NuSMV and consider a large selection of formulas. Our experiments show that in many cases our approach exceeds the automata-theoretic approach up to several orders of magnitude, in both time and memory.
