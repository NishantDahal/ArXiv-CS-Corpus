Evaluating direct transcription and nonlinear optimization methods for robot motion planning

This paper studies existing direct transcription methods for trajectory optimization applied to robot motion planning. There are diverse alternatives for the implementation of direct transcription. In this study we analyze the effects of such alternatives when solving a robotics problem. Different parameters such as integration scheme, number of discretization nodes, initialization strategies and complexity of the problem are evaluated. We measure the performance of the methods in terms of computational time, accuracy and quality of the solution. Additionally, we compare two optimization methodologies frequently used to solve the transcribed problem, namely Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Interior Point Method (IPM). As a benchmark, we solve different motion tasks on an underactuated and non-minimal-phase ball-balancing robot with a 10 dimensional state space and 3 dimensional input space. Additionally, we validate the results on a simulated 3D quadrotor. Finally, as a verification of using direct transcription methods for trajectory optimization on real robots, we present hardware experiments on a motion task including path constraints and actuation limits.
