Subquadratic Algorithms for Algebraic Generalizations of 3SUM

The 3SUM problem asks if an input $n$-set of real numbers contains a triple whose sum is zero. We consider the 3POL problem, a natural generalization of 3SUM where we replace the sum function by a constant-degree polynomial in three variables. The motivations are threefold. Raz, Sharir, and de Zeeuw gave a $O(n^{11/6})$ upper bound on the number of solutions of trivariate polynomial equations when the solutions are taken from the cartesian product of three $n$-sets of real numbers. We give algorithms for the corresponding problem of counting such solutions. Gr√∏nlund and Pettie recently designed subquadratic algorithms for 3SUM. We generalize their results to 3POL. Finally, we shed light on the General Position Testing (GPT) problem: "Given $n$ points in the plane, do three of them lie on a line?", a key problem in computational geometry.
  We prove that there exist bounded-degree algebraic decision trees of depth $O(n^{\frac{12}{7}+\varepsilon})$ that solve 3POL, and that 3POL can be solved in $O(n^2 {(\log \log n)}^\frac{3}{2} / {(\log n)}^\frac{1}{2})$ time in the real-RAM model. Among the possible applications of those results, we show how to solve GPT in subquadratic time when the input points lie on $o({(\log n)}^\frac{1}{6}/{(\log \log n)}^\frac{1}{2})$ constant-degree polynomial curves. This constitutes a first step towards closing the major open question of whether GPT can be solved in subquadratic time.
  To obtain these results, we generalize important tools --- such as batch range searching and dominance reporting --- to a polynomial setting. We expect these new tools to be useful in other applications.
