Secure Analog Network Coding in Layered Networks

We consider a class of Gaussian layered networks where a source communicates with a destination through $L$ intermediate relay layers with $N$ nodes in each layer in the presence of a single eavesdropper which can overhear the transmissions of the nodes in any one layer. The problem of maximum secrecy rate achievable with analog network coding for a unicast communication over such layered wireless relay networks with directed links is considered. A relay node performing analog network coding scales and forwards the signals received at its input. The key contribution of this work is a lemma that provides the globally optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes that maximizes the end-to-end secrecy rate for a class of layered networks. We also show that in the high-SNR regime, ANC achieves secrecy rates within a constant gap of the cutset upper bound on the secrecy capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this work offers the first characterization of the performance of secure ANC in multi-layered networks in the presence of an eavesdropper.
