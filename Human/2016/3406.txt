Self-Interference Cancellation Using Time-Domain Phase Noise Estimation in OFDM Full-Duplex Systems

In full-duplex systems, oscillator phase noise (PN) problem is considered the bottleneck challenge that may face the self-interference cancellation (SIC) stage especially when orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission scheme is deployed. Phase noise degrades the SIC performance significantly, if not mitigated before or during the SIC technique. The presence of the oscillator phase noise has different impacts on the transmitted data symbol like common phase error (CPE) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). However, phase noise can be estimated and mitigated digitally in either time or frequency domain. Through this work, we propose a novel and simple time domain self-interference (SI) phase noise estimation and mitigation technique. The proposed algorithm is inspired from Wiener filtering in time domain. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a superior performance than the already-existing time-domain or frequency domain PN mitigation solutions with a noticeable reduction in the computational complexity.
