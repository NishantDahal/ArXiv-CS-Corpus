Iso-Orthogonality and Type II Duadic Constacyclic Codes

Generalizing even-like duadic cyclic codes and Type-II duadic negacyclic codes, we introduce even-like (i.e.,Type-II) and odd-like duadic constacyclic codes, and study their properties and existence. We show that even-like duadic constacyclic codes are isometrically orthogonal, and the duals of even-like duadic constacyclic codes are odd-like duadic constacyclic codes. We exhibit necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of even-like duadic constacyclic codes. A class of even-like duadic constacyclic codes which are alternant MDS-codes is constructed.
