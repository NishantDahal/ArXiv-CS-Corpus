Order-2 Asymptotic Optimality of the Fully Distributed Sequential Hypothesis Test

This work analyzes the asymptotic performances of fully distributed sequential hypothesis testing procedures as the type-I and type-II error rates approach zero, in the context of a sensor network without a fusion center. In particular, the sensor network is defined by an undirected graph, where each sensor can observe samples over time, access the information from the adjacent sensors, and perform the sequential test based on its own decision statistic. Different from most literature, the sampling process and the information exchange process in our framework take place simultaneously (or, at least in comparable time-scales), thus cannot be decoupled from one another. Two message-passing schemes are considered, based on which the distributed sequential probability ratio test (DSPRT) is carried out respectively. The first scheme features the dissemination of the raw samples. Although the sample propagation based DSPRT is shown to yield the asymptotically optimal performance at each sensor, it incurs excessive inter-sensor communication overhead due to the exchange of raw samples with index information. The second scheme adopts the consensus algorithm, where the local decision statistic is exchanged between sensors instead of the raw samples, thus significantly lowering the communication requirement compared to the first scheme. In particular, the decision statistic for DSPRT at each sensor is updated by the weighted average of the decision statistics in the neighbourhood at every message-passing step. We show that, under certain regularity conditions, the consensus algorithm based DSPRT also yields the order-2 asymptotically optimal performance at all sensors.
