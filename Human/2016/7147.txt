On Stability and Sojourn Time of Peer-to-Peer Queuing Systems

Recent development of peer-to-peer (P2P) services (e.g. streaming, file sharing, and storage) systems introduces a new type of queue systems that receive little attention before, where both job and server arrive and depart randomly. Current study on these models focuses on the stability condition, under exponential workload assumption. This paper extends existing result in two aspects. In the first part of the paper we relax the exponential workload assumption, and study the stability of systems with general workload distribution. The second part of the paper focuses on the job sojourn time. An upper bound and a lower bound for job sojourn time are investigated. We evaluate tightness of the bounds by numerical analysis.
