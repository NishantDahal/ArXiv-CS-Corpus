Influence of Agents Heterogeneity in Cellular Model of Evacuation

The influence of agents heterogeneity on the microscopic characteristics of pedestrian flow is studied via an evacuation simulation tool based on the Floor-Field model. The heterogeneity is introduced in agents velocity, aggressiveness, and sensitivity to occupation. The simulation results are compared to data gathered during an original experiment. The comparison shows that the heterogeneity in aggressiveness and sensitivity occupation enables to reproduce some microscopic aspects. The heterogeneity in velocity seems to be redundant.
