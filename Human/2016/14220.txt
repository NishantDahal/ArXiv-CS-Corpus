Wireless Security with Beamforming Technique

This thesis focuses on the wireless security in the physical layer with beamforming technique. One of the emerging areas is the security enhancement in the physical layer, which exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless medium. Beamforming, which has been proved to have many advantages, can also be applied to enhance the wireless security.
  One of the most common threats, i.e., passive eavesdropping, is addressed in this thesis. To reduce the risk of leaking information to the eavesdroppers, the physical region where the transmission is exposed to eavesdropping has been studied. In this thesis, the exposure region based beamforming technique is proposed to combat the threat from the randomly located eavesdroppers in a fading channel. In this system model, the large-scale path loss and a general Rician fading channel model are considered. The exposure region is established to describe the secrecy performance of the system, based on which the probability that the secrecy outage event occurs is defined to evaluate the security level of the exposure region.
  The antenna array is one of the most important factors that affect the secrecy performance of the exposure region based beamforming technique. The potential of using different array geometry and array configuration to improve security is explored. In this thesis, two common arrays, i.e., linear and circular arrays, are considered.Analytic expressions for general array geometry and for the linear and circular arrays are derived. Based on the empirical results, numerical optimization algorithms are developed to exploit the array configuration to enhance the system security level. In addition, experiments are carried out to study the performance of the beamformer with linear and circular arrays. Especially, the impact of the mutual coupling on the security performance is investigated.
