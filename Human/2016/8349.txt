Networked Control Systems over Correlated Wireless Fading Channels

In this paper, we consider a networked control system (NCS) in which an dynamic plant system is connected to a controller via a temporally correlated wireless fading channel. We focus on communication power design at the sensor to minimize a weighted average state estimation error at the remote controller subject to an average transmit power constraint of the sensor. The power control optimization problem is formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). We propose a novel continuous-time perturbation approach and derive an asymptotically optimal closed-form value function for the MDP. Under this approximation, we propose a low complexity dynamic power control solution which has an event- driven control structure. We also establish technical conditions for asymptotic optimality, and sufficient conditions for NCS stability under the proposed scheme.
