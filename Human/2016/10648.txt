Multiuser Energy Diversity in Energy Harvesting Wireless Communications

Energy harvesting communication has raised great research interests due to its wide applications and feasibility of commercialization. In this paper, we investigate the multiuser energy diversity. Specifically, we reveal the throughput gain coming from the increase of total available energy harvested over time/space and from the combined dynamics of batteries. Considering both centralized and distributed access schemes, the scaling of the average throughput over the number of transmitters is studied, along with the scaling of corresponding available energy in the batteries.
