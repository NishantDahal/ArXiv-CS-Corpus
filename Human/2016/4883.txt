Reconstructing a website's lost past: Methodological issues concerning the history of www.unibo.it

This paper describes how born digital primary sources could be used to reconstruct the recent history of scientific institutions. The case study is an analysis of the first 25 years online of the University of Bologna. The focus of this work is primarily methodological: several different issues are presented, starting with the fact that the University of Bologna website has been excluded for thirteen years from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, and possible solutions are proposed and applied. The article is organised in three parts: in the first one, some of the fundamental concepts on web archives and the preservation of born digital sources are introduced. Then the reconstruction of the University of Bologna web's past is presented. Finally the future of this research is described, presenting a specific case study in which the historian's craft will be challenged by a completely different issue, namely the large amount of data available in the university digital library.
