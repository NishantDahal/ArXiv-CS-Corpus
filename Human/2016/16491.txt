On the complexity of the permanent in various computational models

We answer a question in [Landsberg, Ressayre, 2015], showing the regular determinantal complexity of the determinant det_m is O(m^3). We answer questions in, and generalize results of [Aravind, Joglekar, 2015], showing there is no rank one determinantal expression for perm_m or det_m when m >= 3. Finally we state and prove several "folklore" results relating different models of computation.
