Parameterized vertex deletion problems for hereditary graph classes with a block property

For a class of graphs $\mathcal{P}$, the Bounded $\mathcal{P}$-Block Vertex Deletion problem asks, given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and positive integers $k$ and $d$, whether there is a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that each block of $G-S$ has at most $d$ vertices and is in $\mathcal{P}$. We show that when $\mathcal{P}$ satisfies a natural hereditary property and is recognizable in polynomial time, Bounded $\mathcal{P}$-Block Vertex Deletion can be solved in time $2^{O(k \log d)}n^{O(1)}$. When $\mathcal{P}$ contains all split graphs, we show that this running time is essentially optimal unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. On the other hand, if $\mathcal{P}$ consists of only complete graphs, or only cycle graphs and $K_2$, then Bounded $\mathcal{P}$-Block Vertex Deletion admits a $c^{k}n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for some constant $c$ independent of $d$. We also show that Bounded $\mathcal{P}$-Block Vertex Deletion admits a kernel with $O(k^2 d^7)$ vertices.
