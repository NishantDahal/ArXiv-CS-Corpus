Graph parameters from symplectic group invariants

In this paper we introduce, and characterize, a class of graph parameters obtained from tensor invariants of the symplectic group. These parameters are similar to partition functions of vertex models, as introduced by de la Harpe and Jones, [P. de la Harpe, V.F.R. Jones, Graph invariants related to statistical mechanical models: examples and problems, Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B 57 (1993) 207-227]. Yet they give a completely different class of graph invariants. We moreover show that certain evaluations of the cycle partition polynomial, as defined by Martin [P. Martin, Enumérations eulériennes dans les multigraphes et invariants de Tutte-Grothendieck, Diss. Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble-INPG; Université Joseph-Fourier-Grenoble I, 1977], give examples of graph parameters that can be obtained this way.
