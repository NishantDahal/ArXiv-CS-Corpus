Business Matter Experts do Matter: A Model-Driven Approach for Domain Specific Process Design and Monitoring

Business process design and monitoring are essential elements of Business Process Management (BPM), often relying on Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). However the current BPM approaches and standards have not sufficiently reduced the Business-IT gap. Today's solutions are mostly domain-independent and platform-dependent, which limits the ability of business matter experts to express business intent and enact process change. In contrast, the approach presented in this paper focuses on BPM and SOA environments in a domain-dependent and platform-independent way. We propose to add a domain specific-layer on top of current solutions so business stakeholders can design and understand their processes in a more intuitive way. We rely on previously proposed technical solutions and integrate them in an end-to-end methodology (from design to monitoring and back). The appropriateness and the feasibility of the approach is justified through a use case and a complete prototype implementation.
