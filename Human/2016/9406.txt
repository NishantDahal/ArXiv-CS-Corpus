Automated Road Traffic Congestion Detection and Alarm Systems: Incorporating V2I communications into ATCSs

In this position paper, we address the problems of automated road congestion detection and alerting systems and their security properties. We review different theoretical adaptive road traffic control approaches, and three widely deployed adaptive traffic control systems (ATCSs), namely, SCATS, SCOOT and InSync. We then discuss some related research questions, and the corresponding possible approaches, as well as the adversary model and potential attack scenarios. Two theoretical concepts of automated road congestion alarm systems (including system architecture, communication protocol, and algorithms) are proposed on top of ATCSs, such as SCATS, SCOOT and InSync, by incorporating secure wireless vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Finally, the security properties of the proposed system have been discussed and analysed using the ProVerif protocol verification tool.
