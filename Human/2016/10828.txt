On Deterministic Conditions for Subspace Clustering under Missing Data

In this paper we present deterministic conditions for success of sparse subspace clustering (SSC) under missing data, when data is assumed to come from a Union of Subspaces (UoS) model. We consider two algorithms, which are variants of SSC with entry-wise zero-filling that differ in terms of the optimization problems used to find affinity matrix for spectral clustering. For both the algorithms, we provide deterministic conditions for any pattern of missing data such that perfect clustering can be achieved. We provide extensive sets of simulation results for clustering as well as completion of data at missing entries, under the UoS model. Our experimental results indicate that in contrast to the full data case, accurate clustering does not imply accurate subspace identification and completion, indicating the natural order of relative hardness of these problems.
