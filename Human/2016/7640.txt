On Clustered Statistical MIMO Millimeter Wave Channel Simulation

The use of mmWave frequencies is one of the key strategies to achieve the fascinating 1000x increase in the capacity of future 5G wireless systems. While for traditional sub-6 GHz cellular frequencies several well-developed statistical channel models are available for system simulation, similar tools are not available for mmWave frequencies, thus preventing a fair comparison of independently developed transmission and reception schemes. In this paper we provide a simple albeit accurate statistical procedure for the generation of a clustered MIMO channel model operating at mmWaves, for both the cases of slowly and rapidly time-varying channels. Matlab scripts for channel generation are also provided, along with an example of their use.
