Binary linear codes with at most 4 weights

For the past decades, linear codes with few weights have been widely studied, since they have applications in space communications, data storage and cryptography. In this paper, a class of binary linear codes is constructed and their weight distribution is determined. Results show that they are at most 4-weight linear codes. Additionally, these codes can be used in secret sharing schemes.
