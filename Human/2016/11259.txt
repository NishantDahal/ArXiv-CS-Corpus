Personality, Culture, and System Factors - Impact on Affective Response to Multimedia

Whilst affective responses to various forms and genres of multimedia content have been well researched, precious few studies have investigated the combined impact that multimedia system parameters and human factors have on affect. Consequently, in this paper we explore the role that two primordial dimensions of human factors - personality and culture - in conjunction with system factors - frame rate, resolution, and bit rate - have on user affect and enjoyment of multimedia presentations. To this end, a two-site, cross-cultural study was undertaken, the results of which produced three predictve models. Personality and Culture traits were shown statistically to represent 5.6% of the variance in positive affect, 13.6% in negative affect and 9.3% in enjoyment. The correlation between affect and enjoyment, was significant. Predictive modeling incorporating human factors showed about 8%, 7% and 9% improvement in predicting positive affect, negative affect and enjoyment respectively when compared to models trained only on system factors. Results and analysis indicate the significant role played by human factors in influencing affect that users experience while watching multimedia.
