From Dynamic to Static Semantics, Quantitatively

We exhibit a new relationship between dynamic and static semantics. We define the categorical outlay needed to define Interaction Graphs models, a generalisation of Girard's Geometry of Interaction models, which strongly relate to game semantics. We then show how this category is mapped to weighted relational models of linear logic. This brings into vision a new bridge between the dynamic and static approaches, and provides formal grounds for considering interaction graphs models as quantitative versions of GoI and game semantics models. We finally proceed to show how the interaction graphs models relate to a very general notion of quantitative coherence spaces.
