Generation, Ranking and Unranking of Ordered Trees with Degree Bounds

We study the problem of generating, ranking and unranking of unlabeled ordered trees whose nodes have maximum degree of $Δ$. This class of trees represents a generalization of chemical trees. A chemical tree is an unlabeled tree in which no node has degree greater than 4. By allowing up to $Δ$ children for each node of chemical tree instead of 4, we will have a generalization of chemical trees. Here, we introduce a new encoding over an alphabet of size 4 for representing unlabeled ordered trees with maximum degree of $Δ$. We use this encoding for generating these trees in A-order with constant average time and O(n) worst case time. Due to the given encoding, with a precomputation of size and time O(n^2) (assuming $Δ$ is constant), both ranking and unranking algorithms are also designed taking O(n) and O(nlogn) time complexities.
