Consensus of Dependent Opinions

Providing opinions through labeling of images, tweets, etc. have drawn immense interest in crowdsourcing markets. This invokes a major challenge of aggregating multiple opinions received from different crowd workers for deriving the final judgment. Generally, opinion aggregation models deal with independent opinions, which are given unanimously and are not visible to all. However, in many real-life cases, it is required to make the opinions public as soon as they are received. This makes the opinions dependent and might incorporate some bias. In this paper, we address a novel problem, hereafter denoted as dependent judgment analysis, and discuss the requirements for developing an appropriate model to deal with this problem. The challenge remains to be improving the consensus by revealing true opinions.
