Architecting Data Quality for Continuous Student Behaviour Management

Data capture and use is vital for the continuous improvement of both student learning and behavior management. Previous studies on data use in the education sector have highlighted a number of problems associated with data quality and its subsequent use. These include the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and timeliness of data. Engagement issues with data have centred on the interpretation and application of the knowledge that data can provide. No study to date has investigated the link between IS design and the production of quality data that captures student progression and outcomes in either the learning or behavior management environments. This study reports on the design, development, implementation and evaluation of a novel artefact facilitating quality data for one classroom based education service: pastoral care. This study, using design science research methods, shows that Information Systems Design is a major barrier to teacher adoption and use of classroom based Information Systems.
