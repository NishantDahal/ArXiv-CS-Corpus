The Internet of Things: Perspectives on Security from RFID and WSN

A massive current research effort focuses on combining pre-existing 'Intranets' of Things into one Internet of Things. However, this unification is not a panacea; it will expose new attack surfaces and vectors, just as it enables new applications. We therefore urgently need a model of security in the Internet of Things. In this regard, we note that IoT descends directly from pre-existing research (in embedded Internet and pervasive intelligence), so there exist several bodies of related work: security in RFID, sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and so on. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on RFID and WSN security, as a step to compiling all known attacks and defenses relevant to the Internet of Things.
