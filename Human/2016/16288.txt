Compressive Imaging with Iterative Forward Models

We propose a new compressive imaging method for reconstructing 2D or 3D objects from their scattered wave-field measurements. Our method relies on a novel, nonlinear measurement model that can account for the multiple scattering phenomenon, which makes the method preferable in applications where linear measurement models are inaccurate. We construct the measurement model by expanding the scattered wave-field with an accelerated-gradient method, which is guaranteed to converge and is suitable for large-scale problems. We provide explicit formulas for computing the gradient of our measurement model with respect to the unknown image, which enables image formation with a sparsity- driven numerical optimization algorithm. We validate the method both analytically and with numerical simulations.
