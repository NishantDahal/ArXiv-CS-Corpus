Fragment Allocation Configuration in Distributed Database Systems

In distributed database (DDB) management systems, fragment allocation is one of the most important components that can directly affect the performance of DDB. In this research work, we will show that declarative programming languages, e.g. logic programming languages, can be used to represent different data fragment allocation techniques. Results indicate that, using declarative programming language significantly simplifies the representation of fragment allocation algorithm, thus opens door for any further developments and optimizations. The under consideration case study also show that our approach can be extended to be used in different areas of distributed systems.
