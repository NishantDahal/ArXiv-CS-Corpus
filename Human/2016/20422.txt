Inscribed Matter Communication: Part I

We provide a fundamental treatment of the molecular communication channel wherein "inscribed matter" is transmitted across a spatial gap to provide reliable signaling between a sender and receiver. Inscribed matter is defined as an ensemble of "tokens" (molecules, objects, and so on) and is inspired, at least partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed discrete particles ranging from molecules through membrane-bound structures containing molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and travel to a target -- for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from one cell, tissue or organism diffuse to another. For identical tokens that are neither lost nor modified, we consider messages encoded using three candidate communication schemes: a) token timing (timed release), b) token payload (composition), and c) token timing plus payload. We provide capacity bounds for each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or bin-counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, individual token timing undergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and results about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can inform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in engineering and biology. This work, Part I, focuses on the information theoretic bounds on capacity. Part II develops some of the mathematical and information-theoretic ideas that support the bounds presented here.
