Computer Science Programs, Goals, Student Learning Outcomes and their Assessment

In this paper we describe the process used by MET Computer Science to identify programs, goals, and student learning outcomes for all our programs and graduate certificates. We illustrate how we started the process of assessing learning outcomes for our programs and present actual assessment results from the data collected for two programs that went through accreditation--it describes sample direct and indirect assessment data from two of our programs.
