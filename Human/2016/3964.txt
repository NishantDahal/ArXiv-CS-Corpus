Proceedings of the Eleventh International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models

This volume contains the proceedings of DCM 2015, the 11th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models held on October 28, 2015 in Cali, Colombia. DCM 2015 was organized as a one-day satellite event of the 12th International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC 2015).
  Several new models of computation have emerged in the last few years, and many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of programming languages, and new paradigms of software development.
  The aim of the DCM workshop series is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. Topics of interest include all abstract models of computation and their applications to the development of programming languages and systems.
