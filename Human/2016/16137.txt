LeaveNow: A Social Network-based Smart Evacuation System for Disaster Management

The importance of timely response to natural disasters and evacuating affected people to safe areas is paramount to save lives. Emergency services are often handicapped by the amount of rescue resources at their disposal. We present a system that leverages the power of a social network forming new connections among people based on \textit{real-time location} and expands the rescue resources pool by adding private sector cars. We also introduce a car-sharing algorithm to identify safe routes in an emergency with the aim of minimizing evacuation time, maximizing pick-up of people without cars, and avoiding traffic congestion.
