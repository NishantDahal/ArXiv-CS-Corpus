Possibilistic semantics for a modal KD45 extension of Gödel fuzzy logic

In this paper we provide a simplified semantics for the logic KD45(G), i.e. the many-valued Gödel counterpart of the classical modal logic KD45. More precisely, we characterize KD45(G) as the set of valid formulae of the class of possibilistic Gödel Kripke Frames $\langle W,π\rangle$, where $W$ is a non-empty set of worlds and $π: W \longrightarrow [0, 1]$ is a normalized possibility distribution on $W$.
