Untraceable VoIP Communication based on DC-nets

Untraceable communication is about hiding the identity of the sender or the recipient of a message. Currently most systems used in practice (e.g., TOR) rely on the principle that a message is routed via several relays to obfuscate its path through the network. However, as this increases the end-to-end latency it is not ideal for applications like Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication, where participants will notice annoying delays if the data does not arrive fast enough. We propose an approach based on the paradigm of Dining Cryptographer networks (DC-nets) that can be used to realize untraceable communication within small groups. The main features of our approach are low latency and resilience to packet-loss and fault packets sent by malicious players. We consider the special case of VoIP communication and propose techniques for a P2P implementation. We expose existing problems and sketch possible future large-scale systems composed of multiple groups.
