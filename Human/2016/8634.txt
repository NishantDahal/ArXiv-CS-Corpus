Analytical Coverage Probability of a Typical User In Heterogeneous Cellular Networks

In a Poisson Point Process (PPP) network model, in which the locations of Base Stations (BSs) are randomly distributed according to a Spatial Poisson Process, has been recently used as a tractable stochastic model to analyse the performance of downlink Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCNs). The HCN is modelled as a multi-tier cellular network where each tier is characterised by the transmission power level, propagation path loss exponent and density of BSs. The current works on HCN enabling Intercell Interference Coordination (ICIC) technique usually deal with Strict Frequency Reuse (FR) or Soft FR with a reuse factor of $Δ=1$ in a Rayleigh fading channel. It has been assumed that all Base Stations (BSs) transmit continuously which leads to a reduction on the impact of number of users and RBs on network performance. In this paper, the performance of Soft FR with a reuse factor of $Δ>1$ in Rayleigh-Lognormal fading channel is evaluated. The impact of the number of users and Resource Blocks (RBs) on Intercell Interference (ICI) are presented for Round Robin scheduling and indicator functions. The results show that there are opposite trends between coverage probability of Cell-Center User (CCU) and Cell-Edge User (CEU).
