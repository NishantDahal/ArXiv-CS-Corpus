A Deep Learning Based DDoS Detection System in Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most prevalent attacks that an organizational network infrastructure comes across nowadays. We propose a deep learning based multi-vector DDoS detection system in a software-defined network (SDN) environment. SDN provides flexibility to program network devices for different objectives and eliminates the need for third-party vendor-specific hardware. We implement our system as a network application on top of an SDN controller. We use deep learning for feature reduction of a large set of features derived from network traffic headers. We evaluate our system based on different performance metrics by applying it on traffic traces collected from different scenarios. We observe high accuracy with a low false-positive for attack detection in our proposed system.
