Pattern recognition on the quantum Bloch sphere

We introduce a framework suitable for describing pattern recognition task using the mathematical language of density matrices. In particular, we provide a one-to-one correspondence between patterns and pure density operators. This correspondence enables us to: i) represent the Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC) in terms of quantum objects, ii) introduce a Quantum Classifier (QC). By comparing the QC with the NMC on different 2D datasets, we show the first classifier can provide additional information that are particularly beneficial on a classical computer with respect to the second classifier.
