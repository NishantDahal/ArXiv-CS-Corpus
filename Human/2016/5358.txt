Counting triangulations of some classes of subdivided convex polygons

We compute the number of triangulations of a convex $k$-gon each of whose sides is subdivided by $r-1$ points. We find explicit formulas and generating functions, and we determine the asymptotic behaviour of these numbers as $k$ and/or $r$ tend to infinity. We connect these results with the question of finding the planar set of points in general position that has the minimum possible number of triangulations - a well-known open problem from computational geometry.
