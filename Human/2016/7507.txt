Fast Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes with Unknown Channel

This letter investigates the problem of blind detection of orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) over a quasi-static flat multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh fading channel. We first introduce a core iterative least-squares (ILS) algorithm to blindly detect OSTBC signals without the knowledge of channel state information (SCI) at the receiver. This ILS algorithm has low computational complexity but may converge to local optimum which offers unreliable detection result. Then, in order to improve the detection performance, we propose an enhanced ILS (E-ILS) approach which is based on statistical analysis of repeated independent ILS procedures on received data. Extensive simulation studies prove the efficiency of the proposed E-ILS algorithm with blind detection performance approaching the optimal maximum-likelihood detector with known CSI.
