A Searchlight Factor Model Approach for Locating Shared Information in Multi-Subject fMRI Analysis

There is a growing interest in joint multi-subject fMRI analysis. The challenge of such analysis comes from inherent anatomical and functional variability across subjects. One approach to resolving this is a shared response factor model. This assumes a shared and time synchronized stimulus across subjects. Such a model can often identify shared information, but it may not be able to pinpoint with high resolution the spatial location of this information. In this work, we examine a searchlight based shared response model to identify shared information in small contiguous regions (searchlights) across the whole brain. Validation using classification tasks demonstrates that we can pinpoint informative local regions.
