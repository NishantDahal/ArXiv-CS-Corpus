Universality of the SIS prevalence in networks

Epidemic models are increasingly used in real-world networks to understand diffusion phenomena (such as the spread of diseases, emotions, innovations, failures) or the transport of information (such as news, memes in social on-line networks). A new analysis of the prevalence, the expected number of infected nodes in a network, is presented and physically interpreted. The analysis method is based on spectral decomposition and leads to a universal, analytic curve, that can bound the time-varying prevalence in any finite time interval. Moreover, that universal curve also applies to various types of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) (and Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)) infection processes, with both homogenous and heterogeneous infection characteristics (curing and infection rates), in temporal and even disconnected graphs and in SIS processes with and without self-infections. The accuracy of the universal curve is comparable to that of well-established mean-field approximations.
