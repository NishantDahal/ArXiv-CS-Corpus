An OpenSHMEM Implementation for the Adapteva Epiphany Coprocessor

This paper reports the implementation and performance evaluation of the OpenSHMEM 1.3 specification for the Adapteva Epiphany architecture within the Parallella single-board computer. The Epiphany architecture exhibits massive many-core scalability with a physically compact 2D array of RISC CPU cores and a fast network-on-chip (NoC). While fully capable of MPMD execution, the physical topology and memory-mapped capabilities of the core and network translate well to Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming models and SPMD execution with SHMEM.
