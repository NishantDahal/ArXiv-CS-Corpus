How Useful is Region-based Classification of Remote Sensing Images in a Deep Learning Framework?

In this paper,  we investigate the impact of segmentation algorithms as a preprocessing step for classification of remote sensing images in a deep learning framework. Especially, we address the issue of segmenting the image into regions to be classified using pre-trained deep neural networks as feature extractors for an SVM-based classifier.  An efficient segmentation  as  a  preprocessing  step  helps  learning  by  adding  a spatially-coherent structure to the data.  Therefore, we compare algorithms producing superpixels with more traditional remote  sensing  segmentation  algorithms  and  measure  the variation  in  terms  of  classification  accuracy.   We  establish that  superpixel  algorithms  allow  for  a  better  classification accuracy as a homogenous and compact segmentation favors better generalization of the training samples.
