The Evolutionary Process of Image Transition in Conjunction with Box and Strip Mutation

Evolutionary algorithms have been used in many ways to generate digital art. We study how evolutionary processes are used for evolutionary art and present a new approach to the transition of images. Our main idea is to define evolutionary processes for digital image transition, combining different variants of mutation and evolutionary mechanisms. We introduce box and strip mutation operators which are specifically designed for image transition. Our experimental results show that the process of an evolutionary algorithm in combination with these mutation operators can be used as a valuable way to produce unique generative art.
