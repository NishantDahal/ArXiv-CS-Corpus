A Flexible Primal-Dual Toolbox

\textbf{FlexBox} is a flexible MATLAB toolbox for finite dimensional convex variational problems in image processing and beyond. Such problems often consist of non-differentiable parts and involve linear operators. The toolbox uses a primal-dual scheme to avoid (computationally) inefficient operator inversion and to get reliable error estimates. From the user-side, \textbf{FlexBox} expects the primal formulation of the problem, automatically decouples operators and dualizes the problem. For large-scale problems, \textbf{FlexBox} also comes with a \cpp-module, which can be used stand-alone or together with MATLAB via MEX-interfaces. Besides various pre-implemented data-fidelities and regularization-terms, \textbf{FlexBox} is able to handle arbitrary operators while being easily extendable, due to its object-oriented design. The toolbox is available at \href{http://www.flexbox.im}{http://www.flexbox.im}
