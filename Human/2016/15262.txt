Dependence and Relevance: A probabilistic view

We examine three probabilistic concepts related to the sentence "two variables have no bearing on each other". We explore the relationships between these three concepts and establish their relevance to the process of constructing similarity networks---a tool for acquiring probabilistic knowledge from human experts. We also establish a precise relationship between connectedness in Bayesian networks and relevance in probability.
