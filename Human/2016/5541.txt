Feedback Bits Allocation for Interference Minimization in Cognitive Radio Communications

This letter studies the limited feedback cognitive radio system, where the primary users (PU) are interfered by the secondary transmitter (ST) due to the imperfect beamforming. We propose to allocate the feedback bits among multiple PUs to minimize the maximum interference caused by the ST, by exploiting the heterogeneous average channel gains. In addition, we study the problem of minimizing the total feedback bits under a predefined interference threshold at the PUs. The solutions with low complexity are proposed for the studied problems, and the performances of bit allocations are analyzed. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that the proposed solutions work very well in terms of minimizing the maximum interference caused by the ST and minimizing the total feedback bits under predefined interference threshold at the PUs for limited feedback CR system.
