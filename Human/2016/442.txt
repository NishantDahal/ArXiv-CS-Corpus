The Structure of Z_2[u]Z_2[u, v]-additive Codes

In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of Z_2[u]Z_2[u, v]-additive codes which are Z_2[u, v]-submodules where u^2 = v^2 = 0 and uv = vu. In particular, we determine a Gray map from Z_2[u]Z_2 [u, v] to Z_2^{2Î±+8\b{eta}} and study generator and parity check matrices for these codes. Further we study the structure of Z_2[u]Z_2[u, v]-additive cyclic codes and constacyclic codes.
