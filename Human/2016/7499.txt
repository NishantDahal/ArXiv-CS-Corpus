Obstacle evasion using fuzzy logic in a sliding blades problem environment

This paper discusses obstacle avoidance using fuzzy logic and shortest path algorithm. This paper also introduces the sliding blades problem and illustrates how a drone can navigate itself through the swinging blade obstacles while tracing a semi-optimal path and also maintaining constant velocity
