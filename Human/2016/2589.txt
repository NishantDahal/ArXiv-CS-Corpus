A Semantic Theory of the Internet of Things

We propose a process calculus for modelling systems in the Internet of Things paradigm. Our systems interact both with the physical environment, via sensors and actuators, and with smart devices, via short-range and Internet channels. The calculus is equipped with a standard notion of bisimilarity which is a fully abstract characterisation of a well-known contextual equivalence. We use our semantic proof-methods to prove run-time properties as well as system equalities of non-trivial IoT systems.
