Multimedia Storage in the Cloud using Amazon Web Services: Implications for Online Education

This report is divided into three parts. Firstly, an explanation of the cloud storage products is given, in particular, the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Secondly, the report discusses a case study about SmugMug's migration to the cloud hosted by Amazon. SmugMug is a premium online photo and video sharing service business, and currently has billions of photos and videos from amateur and professional photographers around the world. This report also includes a step by step explanation of how to modify a website and use Amazon S3 to host videos in the cloud. These findings are evaluated in terms of how useful Amazon S3 can be for an e-learning institute, especially one that is geared towards mobile delivery of content. Finally, the paper covers the copyright, and privacy implications, in order to understand the larger context.
