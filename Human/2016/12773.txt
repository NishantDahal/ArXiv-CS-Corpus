Offloading traffic hotspots using moving small cells

In this paper, the concept of moving small cells in mobile networks is presented and evaluated taking into account the dynamics of the system. We consider a small cell moving according to a Manhattan mobility model which is the case when the small cell is deployed on the top of a bus following a predefined trajectory in areas which are generally crowded. Taking into account the distribution of user locations, we study the dynamic level considering a queuing model composed of multi-class Processor Sharing queues. Macro and small cells are assumed to be operating in the same bandwidth. Consequently, they are coupled due to the mutual interferences generated by each cell to the other. Our results show that deploying moving small cells could be an efficient solution to offload traffic hotspots.
