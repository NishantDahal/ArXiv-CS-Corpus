Navigational Rule Derivation: An algorithm to determine the effect of traffic signs on road networks

In this paper we present an algorithm to build a road network map enriched with traffic rules such as one-way streets and forbidden turns, based on the interpretation of already detected and classified traffic signs. Such algorithm helps to automatize the elaboration of maps for commercial navigation systems. Our solution is based on simulating navigation along the road network, determining at each point of interest the visibility of the signs and their effect on the roads. We test our approach in a small urban network and discuss various ways to generalize it to support more complex environments.
