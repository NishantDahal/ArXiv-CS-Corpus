Exact Online String Matching Bibliography

In this short note we present a comprehensive bibliography for the online exact string matching problem. The problem consists in finding all occurrences of a given pattern in a text. It is an extensively studied problem in computer science, mainly due to its direct applications to such diverse areas as text, image and signal processing, speech analysis and recognition, data compression, information retrieval, computational biology and chemistry. Since 1970 more than 120 string matching algorithms have been proposed. In this note we present a comprehensive list of (almost) all string matching algorithms. The list is updated to May 2016.
