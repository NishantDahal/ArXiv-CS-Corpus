On Deductive Systems of AC Semantics for Rough Sets

Antichain based semantics for general rough sets were introduced recently by the present author. In her paper two different semantics, one for general rough sets and another for general approximation spaces over quasi-equivalence relations, were developed. These semantics are improved and studied further from a lateral algebraic logic perspective in this research. The main results concern the structure of the algebras and deductive systems in the context.
