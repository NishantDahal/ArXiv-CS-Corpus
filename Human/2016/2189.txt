A Processing In-Memory Realization Using QCA: Proposal and Implementation

Processing in Memory (PIM) is a computing paradigm that promises enormous gain in processing speed by eradicating latencies in the typical von Neumann architecture. It has gained popularity owing to its throughput by embedding storage and computation of data in a single unit. We portray implementation of Akers array architecture endowed with PIM computation using Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA). We present the proof of concept of PIM with its realization in the QCA designer paradigm. We illustrate implementation of Ex-OR gate with the help of QCA based Akers Array and put forth many interesting potential possibilities.
