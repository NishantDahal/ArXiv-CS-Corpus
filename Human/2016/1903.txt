An Illustrated Introduction to the Truncated Fourier Transform

The Truncated Fourier Transform (TFT) is a variation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT/FFT) that allows for input vectors that do NOT have length $2^n$ for $n$ a positive integer. We present the univariate version of the TFT, originally due to Joris van der Hoeven, heavily illustrating the presentation in order to make these methods accessible to a broader audience.
