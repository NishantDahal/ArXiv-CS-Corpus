Weight Computation of Regular Tree Languages

We present a general framework to define an application-dependent weight measure on terms that subsumes e.g. total simplification orderings, and an O(n log n) algorithm for the simultaneous computation of the minimal weight of a term in the language of each nonterminal of a regular tree grammar, based on Barzdins' liquid-flow technique.
