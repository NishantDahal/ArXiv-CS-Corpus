Modeling the Dynamics of Discussions in Social Networks

In this paper, a method of modeling the dynamics of electronic discussions is proposed based on the so called FOPDT model (First Order Plus Dead Time) known from the process control. Knowledge of the model points to possibility of estimating dynamic movements in discussions as well as understanding and designing their maintaining and guidance. Real discussions are processed.
