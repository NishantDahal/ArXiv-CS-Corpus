Synchronization of Bernoulli sequences on shared letters

The topic of this paper is the distributed and incremental generation of long executions of concurrent systems, uniformly or more generally with weights associated to elementary actions. Synchronizing sequences of letters on alphabets sharing letters are known to produce a trace in the concurrency theoretic sense, i.e., a labeled partially ordered set. We study the probabilistic aspects by considering the synchronization of Bernoulli sequences of letters, under the light of Bernoulli and uniform measures recently introduced for trace monoids. We introduce two algorithms that produce random traces, using only local random primitives. We thoroughly study some specific examples, the path model and the ring model, both of arbitrary size. For these models, we show how to generate any Bernoulli distributed random traces, which includes the case of uniform generation.
