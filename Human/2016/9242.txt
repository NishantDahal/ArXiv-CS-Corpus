Program Derivation by Correctness Enhacements

Relative correctness is the property of a program to be more-correct than another program with respect to a given specification.  Among the many properties of relative correctness, that which we found most intriguing is the property that program P' refines program P if and only if P' is more-correct than P with respect to any specification.  This inspires us to reconsider program derivation by successive refinements: each step of this process mandates that we transform a program P into a program P' that refines P, i.e. P' is more-correct than P with respect to any specification.  This raises the question:  why should we want to make P' more-correct than P with respect to any specification, when we only have to satisfy specification R?  In this paper, we discuss a process of program derivation that replaces traditional sequence of refinement-based correctness-preserving transformations starting from specification R by a sequence of relative correctness-based correctness-enhancing transformations starting from abort.
