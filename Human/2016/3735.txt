An Evolvable Fuzzy Logic System for handoff management in heterogeneous Wireless Networks

One of the features of the Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs) is its heterogeneous communication environment. Heterogeneous networks are ranging from wireless WAN, LAN, MAN and PAN. The most important parameters in this regard are different data rates and coverage of these networks. In this paper, we propose an evolvable fuzzy logic-based algorithm for managing handover process in heterogeneous wireless networks. We use fuzzy logic system to determine the right time of initiating the handoff procedure and utilize Genetic Algorithm (GA) to predict the best form of rules of the fuzzy module. We implement our proposed scheme on a special simulation model and discuss about the impact of evolution on the algorithm.
