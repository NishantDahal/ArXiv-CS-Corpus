Optimal Heavy-Traffic Queue Length Scaling in an Incompletely Saturated Switch

We consider an input queued switch operating under the MaxWeight scheduling algorithm. This system is interesting to study because it is a model for Internet routers and data center networks. Recently, it was shown that the MaxWeight algorithm has optimal heavy-traffic queue length scaling when all ports are uniformly saturated. Here we consider the case when an arbitrary number of ports are saturated (which we call the incompletely saturated case), and each port is allowed to saturate at a different rate. We use a recently developed drift technique to show that the heavy-traffic queue length under the MaxWeight scheduling algorithm has optimal scaling with respect to the switch size even in these cases.
