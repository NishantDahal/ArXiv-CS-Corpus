A note concerning Primary Source Knowledge

We add a small increment to understanding the notion of Primary Source Knowledge, knowledge that the non-expert and the citizen can acquire by assiduously reading the primary scientific journal literature without being embedded in the cultural life of the corresponding technical specialty. This comes from exposing four papers to the automated computer filters used by the physics preprint server arXiv. These filters are used to flag papers in need of further review by human assessors before being promulgated on the server; papers not flagged by the algorithm are generally posted on arXiv without further review. After the filtering, human moderators decide whether papers should be posted based on a relatively low bar of whether they are of interest, relevance and value to the research communities that populate arXiv.
