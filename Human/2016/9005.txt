Disruptive Transformation of Enterprise Supply Chain Performance through Strategic Technology-enabled Networking to Improve Business Value

In a dynamically changing world, businesses must transform themselves to survive. Although the necessity for change may be apparent; how to change is not. Learning from the experiences of successful pioneers in a core business function is useful. Procurement is essential for all organisations. It is how organisations acquire assets and inputs including facilities, materials and people. Traditionally, the business objective from procurement was to increase availability and reduce costs. Subsequently, the objective became more tactical. Leading procurement practice today is disruptive; beyond cost to creating value. The strategy for market leaders has also transformed; from competition to collaboration. Technology-enabled business networks are now driving business disruption globally. Through a rigorous field study of two world-class pioneering corporations, this paper explores how disruption is transforming Enterprise Supply Chains. Lessons, contributions and their implications for current IS theory and practice, are discussed.
