IR-UWB Detection and Fusion Strategies using Multiple Detector Types

Optimal detection of ultra wideband (UWB) pulses in a UWB transceiver employing multiple detector types is proposed and analyzed in this paper. We propose several fusion techniques for fusing decisions made by individual IR-UWB detectors. We assess the performance of these fusion techniques for commonly used detector types like matched filter, energy detector and amplitude detector. In order to perform this, we derive the detection performance equation for each of the detectors in terms of false alarm rate, shape of the pulse and number of UWB pulses used in the detection and apply these in the fusion algorithms. We show that the performance can be improved approximately by 4 dB in terms of signal to noise ratio (SNR) for perfect detectability of a UWB signal in a practical scenario by fusing the decisions from individual detectors.
