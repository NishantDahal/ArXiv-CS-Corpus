Examining Representational Similarity in ConvNets and the Primate Visual Cortex

We compare several ConvNets with different depth and regularization techniques with multi-unit macaque IT cortex recordings and assess the impact of the same on representational similarity with the primate visual cortex. We find that with increasing depth and validation performance, ConvNet features are closer to cortical IT representations.
