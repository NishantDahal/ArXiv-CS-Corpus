Disruptive innovations in RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation League: from Cyberoos'98 to Gliders2016

We review disruptive innovations introduced in the RoboCup 2D Soccer Simulation League over the twenty years since its inception, and trace the progress of our champion team (Gliders). We conjecture that the League has been developing as an ecosystem shaped by diverse approaches taken by participating teams, increasing in its overall complexity. A common feature is that different champion teams succeeded in finding a way to decompose the enormous search-space of possible single- and multi-agent behaviours, by automating the exploration of the problem space with various techniques which accelerated the software development efforts. These methods included interactive debugging, machine learning, automated planning, and opponent modelling. The winning approach developed by Gliders is centred on human-based evolutionary computation which optimised several components such as an action-dependent evaluation function, dynamic tactics with Voronoi diagrams, information dynamics, and bio-inspired collective behaviour.
