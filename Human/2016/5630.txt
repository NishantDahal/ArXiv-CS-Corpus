A Novel Compressive Sensing based Enhanced Multiplexing Scheme for MIMO System

A novel compressive-sensing based signal multiplexing scheme is proposed in this paper to further improve the multiplexing gain for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. At the transmitter side, a Gaussian random measurement matrix in compressive sensing is employed before the traditional spatial multiplexing in order to carry more data streams on the available spatial multiplexing streams of the underlying MIMO system. At the receiver side, it is proposed to reformulate the detection of the multiplexing signal into two steps. In the first step, the traditional MIMO equalization can be used to restore the transmitted spatial multiplexing signal of the MIMO system. While in the second step, the standard optimization based detection algorithm assumed in the compressive sensing framework is utilized to restore the CS multiplexing data streams, wherein the exhaustive over-complete dictionary is used to guarantee the sparse representation of the CS multiplexing signal. In order to avoid the excessive complexity, the sub-block based dictionary and the sub-block based CS restoration is proposed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the feasibility of the proposed CS based enhanced MIMO multiplexing scheme. And our efforts in this paper shed some lights on the great potential in further improving the spatial multiplexing gain for the MIMO system.
