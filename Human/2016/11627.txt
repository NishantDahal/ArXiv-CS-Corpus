Application of Permutation Group Theory in Reversible Logic Synthesis

The paper discusses various applications of permutation group theory in the synthesis of reversible logic circuits consisting of Toffoli gates with negative control lines. An asymptotically optimal synthesis algorithm for circuits consisting of gates from the NCT library is described. An algorithm for gate complexity reduction, based on equivalent replacements of gates compositions, is introduced. A new approach for combining a group-theory-based synthesis algorithm with a Reed-Muller-spectra-based synthesis algorithm is described. Experimental results are presented to show that the proposed synthesis techniques allow a reduction in input lines count, gate complexity or quantum cost of reversible circuits for various benchmark functions.
