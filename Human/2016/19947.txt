On a Well-behaved Relational Generalisation of Rough Set Approximations

We examine non-dual relational extensions of rough set approximations and find an extension which satisfies surprisingly many of the usual rough set properties. We then use this definition to give an explanation for an observation made by Samanta and Chakraborty in their recent paper [P. Samanta and M.K. Chakraborty. Interface of rough set systems and modal logics: A survey. Transactions on Rough Sets XIX, pages 114-137, 2015].
