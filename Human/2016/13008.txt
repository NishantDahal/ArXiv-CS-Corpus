Image Restoration with Locally Selected Class-Adapted Models

State-of-the-art algorithms for imaging inverse problems (namely deblurring and reconstruction) are typically iterative, involving a denoising operation as one of its steps. Using a state-of-the-art denoising method in this context is not trivial, and is the focus of current work. Recently, we have proposed to use a class-adapted denoiser (patch-based using Gaussian mixture models) in a so-called plug-and-play scheme, wherein a state-of-the-art denoiser is plugged into an iterative algorithm, leading to results that outperform the best general-purpose algorithms, when applied to an image of a known class (e.g. faces, text, brain MRI). In this paper, we extend that approach to handle situations where the image being processed is from one of a collection of possible classes or, more importantly, contains regions of different classes. More specifically, we propose a method to locally select one of a set of class-adapted Gaussian mixture patch priors, previously estimated from clean images of those classes. Our approach may be seen as simultaneously performing segmentation and restoration, thus contributing to bridging the gap between image restoration/reconstruction and analysis.
