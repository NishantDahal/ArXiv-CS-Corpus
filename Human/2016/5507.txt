R-FUSE: Robust Fast Fusion of Multi-Band Images Based on Solving a Sylvester Equation

This paper proposes a robust fast multi-band image fusion method to merge a high-spatial low-spectral resolution image and a low-spatial high-spectral resolution image. Following the method recently developed in [1], the generalized Sylvester matrix equation associated with the multi-band image fusion problem is solved in a more robust and efficient way by exploiting the Woodbury formula, avoiding any permutation operation in the frequency domain as well as the blurring kernel invertibility assumption required in [1]. Thanks to this improvement, the proposed algorithm requires fewer computational operations and is also more robust with respect to the blurring kernel compared with the one in [1]. The proposed new algorithm is tested with different priors considered in [1]. Our conclusion is that the proposed fusion algorithm is more robust than the one in [1] with a reduced computational cost.
