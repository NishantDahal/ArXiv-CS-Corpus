Web 2.0 for Small and medium Sized Companies: A practical Case Study

This project is a holistic analysis of web 2.0 and combines ideas from systems theory and organizational theory and goes on to attempt to bridge the gap between the ongoing theoretical discourse and its implications for the development process. The goal is to shift the discussion from a descriptive, highly philosophical one to a prescriptive framework that can directly be applied for the design, evaluation and deployment. Effectively this work posits that unless a practical framework can be synthesized from this rich debate the application and development of web 2.0 is at risk of proceeding haphazardly and this could potentially limit the benefits organizations reap from it. It then establishes the applicability of web 2.0 to the small organization and accordingly applies the framework to a practical case study.
