Hybrid Digital and Analog Beamforming Design for Large-Scale Antenna Arrays

The potential of using of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency for future wireless cellular communication systems has motivated the study of large-scale antenna arrays for achieving highly directional beamforming. However, the conventional fully digital beamforming methods which require one radio frequency (RF) chain per antenna element is not viable for large-scale antenna arrays due to the high cost and high power consumption of RF chain components in high frequencies. To address the challenge of this hardware limitation, this paper considers a hybrid beamforming architecture in which the overall beamformer consists of a low-dimensional digital beamformer followed by an RF beamformer implemented using analog phase shifters. Our aim is to show that such an architecture can approach the performance of a fully digital scheme with much fewer number of RF chains. Specifically, this paper establishes that if the number of RF chains is twice the total number of data streams, the hybrid beamforming structure can realize any fully digital beamformer exactly, regardless of the number of antenna elements. For cases with fewer number of RF chains, this paper further considers the hybrid beamforming design problem for both the transmission scenario of a point-to-point multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) system and a downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) system. For each scenario, we propose a heuristic hybrid beamforming design that achieves a performance close to the performance of the fully digital beamforming baseline. Finally, the proposed algorithms are modified for the more practical setting in which only finite resolution phase shifters are available. Numerical simulations show that the proposed schemes are effective even when phase shifters with very low resolution are used.
