PlÃ¼cker Correction Problem: Analysis and Improvements in Efficiency

A given six dimensional vector represents a 3D straight line in Plucker coordinates if its coordinates satisfy the Klein quadric constraint. In many problems aiming to find the Plucker coordinates of lines, noise in the data and other type of errors contribute for obtaining 6D vectors that do not correspond to lines, because of that constraint. A common procedure to overcome this drawback is to find the Plucker coordinates of the lines that are closest to those vectors. This is known as the Plucker correction problem. In this article we propose a simple, closed-form, and global solution for this problem. When compared with the state-of-the-art method, one can conclude that our algorithm is easier and requires much less operations than previous techniques (it does not require Singular Value Decomposition techniques).
