Secure Parallel Processing of Big Data Using Order-Preserving Encryption on Google BigQuery

With the increase of centralization of resources in IT-infrastructure and the growing amount of cloud services, database management systems (DBMS) will be more and more outsourced to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers. The outsourcing of entire databases, or the computation power for processing Big Data to an external provider also means that the provider has full access to the information contained in the database. In this article we propose a feasible solution with Order-Preserving Encryption (OPE) and further, state of the art, encryption methods to sort and process Big Data on external resources without exposing the unencrypted data to the IaaS provider. We also introduce a proof-of-concept client for Google BigQuery as example IaaS Provider.
