Reliability Testing Strategy - Reliability in Software Engineering

This paper presents the core principles of reliability in software engineering - outlining why reliability testing is critical and specifying the process of measuring reliability. The paper provides insight for both novice and experts in the software engineering field for assessing failure intensity as well as predicting failure of software systems. Measurements are conducted by utilizing information from an operational profile to further enhance a test plan and test cases, all of which this paper demonstrates how to implement.
