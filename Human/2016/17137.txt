A Graph-based Push Service Platform

It is well known that learning customers' preference and making recommendations to them from today's information-exploded environment is critical and non-trivial in an on-line system. There are two different modes of recommendation systems, namely pull-mode and push-mode. The majority of the recommendation systems are pull-mode, which recommend items to users only when and after users enter Application Market. While push-mode works more actively to enhance or re-build connection between Application Market and users. As one of the most successful phone manufactures,both the number of users and apps increase dramatically in Huawei Application Store (also named Hispace Store), which has approximately 0.3 billion registered users and 1.2 million apps until 2016 and whose number of users is growing with high-speed. For the needs of real scenario, we establish a Push Service Platform (shortly, PSP) to discover the target user group automatically from web-scale user operation log data with an additional small set of labelled apps (usually around 10 apps),in Hispace Store. As presented in this work,PSP includes distributed storage layer, application layer and evaluation layer. In the application layer, we design a practical graph-based algorithm (named A-PARW) for user group discovery, which is an approximate version of partially absorbing random walk. Based on I mode of A-PARW, the effectiveness of our system is significantly improved, compared to the predecessor to presented system, which uses Personalized Pagerank in its application layer.
