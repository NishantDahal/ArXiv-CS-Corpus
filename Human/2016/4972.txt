Capacity of Cellular Networks with Femtocache

The capacity of next generation of cellular networks using femtocaches is studied when multihop communications and decentralized cache placement are considered. We show that the storage capability of future network User Terminals (UT) can be effectively used to increase the capacity in random decentralized uncoded caching. We further propose a random decentralized coded caching scheme which achieves higher capacity results than the random decentralized uncoded caching. The result shows that coded caching which is suitable for systems with limited storage capabilities can improve the capacity of cellular networks by a factor of log(n) where n is the number of nodes served by the femtocache.
