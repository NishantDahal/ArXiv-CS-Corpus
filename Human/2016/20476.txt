Info-Clustering: A Mathematical Theory for Data Clustering

We formulate an info-clustering paradigm based on a multivariate information measure, called multivariate mutual information, that naturally extends Shannon's mutual information between two random variables to the multivariate case involving more than two random variables. With proper model reductions, we show that the paradigm can be applied to study the human genome and connectome in a more meaningful way than the conventional algorithmic approach. Not only can info-clustering provide justifications and refinements to some existing techniques, but it also inspires new computationally feasible solutions.
