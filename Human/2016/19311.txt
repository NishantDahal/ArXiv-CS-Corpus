Stateology: State-Level Interactive Charting of Language, Feelings, and Values

People's personality and motivations are manifest in their everyday language usage. With the emergence of social media, ample examples of such usage are procurable. In this paper, we aim to analyze the vocabulary used by close to 200,000 Blogger users in the U.S. with the purpose of geographically portraying various demographic, linguistic, and psychological dimensions at the state level. We give a description of a web-based tool for viewing maps that depict various characteristics of the social media users as derived from this large blog dataset of over two billion words.
