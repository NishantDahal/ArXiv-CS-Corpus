SMIET: Simultaneous Molecular Information and Energy Transfer

The performance of communication systems is fundamentally limited by the loss of energy through propagation and circuit inefficiencies. In this article, we show that it is possible to achieve ultra low energy communications at the nano-scale, if diffusive molecules are used for carrying data. Whilst the energy of electromagnetic waves will inevitably decay as a function of transmission distance and time, the energy in individual molecules does not. Over time, the receiver has an opportunity to recover some, if not all of the molecular energy transmitted. The article demonstrates the potential of ultra-low energy simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer (SMIET) through the design of two different nano-relay systems, and the discusses how molecular communications can benefit more from crowd energy harvesting than traditional wave-based systems.
