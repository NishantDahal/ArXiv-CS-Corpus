Reduction-Based Creative Telescoping for Fuchsian D-finite Functions

Continuing a series of articles in the past few years on creative telescoping using reductions, we adapt Trager's Hermite reduction for algebraic functions to fuchsian D-finite functions and develop a reduction-based creative telescoping algorithm for this class of functions, thereby generalizing our recent reduction-based algorithm for algebraic functions, presented at ISSAC 2016.
