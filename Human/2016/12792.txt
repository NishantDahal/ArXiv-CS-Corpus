Analysis of M2/M2/1/R,N Queuing Model for Multimedia over 3.5G Wireless Network Downlink

Analysis of an M2/M2/1/R, N queuing model for the multimedia transmission over HSDPA/3.5G downlink is presented. The queue models the downlink buffer with source multimedia traffic streams comprising two classes of flows: realtime and non real-time. Time priority is accorded to the real-time flows while the non real-time flows are given buffer space priority. An analytic evaluation of the impact of varying the buffer partition threshold on the QoS performance of both classes of customers is undertaken. The results are validated with a discrete event simulation model developed in C language. Finally, a cost function for the joint optimization of the traffic QoS parameters is derived.
