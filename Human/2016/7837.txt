Distributed protocols for spanning tree construction and leader election

We present fast deterministic distributed protocols in synchronous networks for leader election and spanning tree construction. The protocols are designed under the assumption that nodes in a network have identifiers but the size of an identifier is unlimited. So time bounds of protocols depend on the sizes of identifiers. We present fast protocols running in time $O(D\log L+L)$, where $L$ is the size of the minimal identifier and $D$ is the diameter of a network.
