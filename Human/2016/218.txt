A class of index coding problems with rate 1/3

An index coding problem with $n$ messages has symmetric rate $R$ if all $n$ messages can be conveyed at rate $R$. In a recent work, a class of index coding problems for which symmetric rate $\frac{1}{3}$ is achievable was characterised using special properties of the side-information available at the receivers. In this paper, we show a larger class of index coding problems (which includes the previous class of problems) for which symmetric rate $\frac{1}{3}$ is achievable. In the process, we also obtain a stricter necessary condition for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasibility than what is known in literature.
