Business Intelligence and Supply Chain Agility

Supply Chain Agility is important for organisations to stay competitive in today's dynamic business environment. There is increasing interest in deploying Business Intelligence (BI) in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) context to improve Supply Chain (SC) Agility. However, there is limited research exploring BI contributions to SC Agility. In this research-in-progress paper we propose a model based on a conceptual analysis of the literature showing how BI can help organisations achieve SC Agility by supporting the key areas of SCM (Plan, Source, Make, Deliver and Return). In the next stage of this project, we will conduct a series of case studies investigating how organisations use BI when managing their SC activities and how BI contributes to SC Agility. The result of the study will help organizations deploy BI effectively to support SCM and improve SC Agility.
