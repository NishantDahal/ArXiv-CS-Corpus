Modeling of Spatial Uncertainties in the Magnetic Reluctivity

In this paper a computationally efficient approach is suggested for the stochastic modeling of an inhomogeneous reluctivity of magnetic materials. These materials can be part of electrical machines, such as a single phase transformer (a benchmark example that is considered in this paper). The approach is based on the Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansion. The stochastic model is further used to study the statistics of the self inductance of the primary coil as a quantity of interest.
