QoE-aware Scalable Video Transmission in MIMO~Systems

An important concept in wireless systems has been quality of experience (QoE)-aware video transmission. Such communications are considered not only connection-based communications but also content-aware communications, since the video quality is closely related to the content itself. It becomes necessary therefore for video communications to utilize a cross-layer design (also known as joint source and channel coding). To provide efficient methods of allocating network resources, the wireless network uses its cross-layer knowledge to perform unequal error protection (UEP) solutions. In this article, we summarize the latest video transmission technologies that are based on scalable video coding (SVC) over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with cross-layer designs. To provide insight into video transmission in wireless networks, we investigate UEP solutions in the delivering of video over massive MIMO systems. Our results show that in terms of quality of experience (QoE), SVC layer prioritization, which was considered important in the prior work, is not always beneficial in massive MIMO systems; consideration must be given to the content characteristics.
