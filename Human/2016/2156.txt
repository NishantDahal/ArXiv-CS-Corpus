Privacy Preserving Architectures for Collaborative Intrusion Detection

Collaboration among multiple organizations is imperative for contemporary intrusion detection. As modern threats become well sophisticated it is difficult for organizations to defend with threat context local to their networks alone. Availability of global \emph{threat intelligence} is must for organizations to defend against modern advanced persistent threats (APTs). In order to benefit from such global context of attacks, privacy concerns continue to be of major hindrance. In this position paper we identify real world privacy problems as precise use cases, relevant cryptographic technologies and discuss privacy preserving architectures for collaborative intrusion detection.
