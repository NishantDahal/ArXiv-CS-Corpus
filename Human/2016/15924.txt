Application of Global Route-Planning Algorithms with Geodesy

Global Route-Planning Algorithms (GRPA) are required to compute paths between several points located on Earth's surface. A geodesic algorithm is employed as an auxiliary tool, increasing the precision of distance calculations. This work presents a novel simulator for GRPA, which compares and evaluates three GRPAs implemented to solve the shortest path problem for points located at different cities: A*, LPA*, and D*Lite. The performance of each algorithm is investigated with a set of experiments, which are executed to check the answers provided by the algorithms and to compare their execution time. It is shown that GRPAs implementations with consistent heuristics lead to optimal paths. The noticeable differences among those algorithms are related to the time execution after successive executions.
