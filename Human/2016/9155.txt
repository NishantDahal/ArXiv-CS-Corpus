Assessment Issues in Mathematics: Design Science Approach for developing an Expert-System Based Solution

Information and communication technology (ICT) tools are ineffective when assessing solutions of questions with more than one step. ICT tools assessing these types of questions are paralleled to solving complex problems. This conceptual paper describes the method that will be adopted to create rule based expert system (ES) prototype implementing method marking concept (MMC) in assessing multi-step questions (MSQ) solutions. Pragmatist views and mixed methods will be used to conduct document analysis using undergraduate students' solutions to past examination papers and related findings from previous research. Design science research paradigm and ES development phases will be used to design, construct and evaluate an artifact based on ES. The expected functioning ES artifact will enhance the authenticity of assessment, because evaluation of solution strategies in MSQ solution reveals how much the comprehension of the domain under evaluation is shown. The artifact and the conceptual framework can be applied to a similar domain with modifications or as it is.
