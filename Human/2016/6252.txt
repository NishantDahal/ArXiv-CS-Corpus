ARSENAL: Automatic Requirements Specification Extraction from Natural Language

Requirements are informal and semi-formal descriptions of the expected behavior of a complex system from the viewpoints of its stakeholders (customers, users, operators, designers, and engineers). However, for the purpose of design, testing, and verification for critical systems, we can transform requirements into formal models that can be analyzed automatically. ARSENAL is a framework and methodology for systematically transforming natural language (NL) requirements into analyzable formal models and logic specifications. These models can be analyzed for consistency and implementability. The ARSENAL methodology is specialized to individual domains, but the approach is general enough to be adapted to new domains.
