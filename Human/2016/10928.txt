Divisive-agglomerative algorithm and complexity of automatic classification problems

An algorithm of solution of the Automatic Classification (AC for brevity) problem is set forth in the paper. In the AC problem, it is required to find one or several artitions, starting with the given pattern matrix or dissimilarity, similarity matrix.
