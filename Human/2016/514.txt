Non-Parametric Bayesian Rejuvenation of Smart-City Participation through Context-aware Internet-of-Things (IoT) Management

Tweaking citizen participation is vital in promoting Smart City services. However, conventional practices deficit sufficient realization of personal traits despite socio-economic promise. The recent trend of IoT-enabled smart-objects/things and personalized services pave the way for context-aware services. Eventually, the aim of this paper is to develop a context-aware model in predicting participation of smart city service. Hence, major requirements are identified for citizen participation, namely (a) unwrapping of contexts, which are relevant, (b) scaling up (over time) of participation. However, paramount challenges are imposed on this stipulation, such as, un-observability, independence and composite relationship of contexts. Therefore, a Non-parametric Bayesian model is proposed to address scalability of contexts and its relationship with participation.
