Listen-and-Talk: Protocol Design and Analysis for Full-duplex Cognitive Radio Networks

In traditional cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) typically access the spectrum of primary users (PUs) by a two-stage "listen-before-talk" (LBT) protocol, i.e., SUs sense the spectrum holes in the first stage before transmitting in the second. However, there exist two major problems: 1) transmission time reduction due to sensing, and 2) sensing accuracy impairment due to data transmission. In this paper, we propose a "listen-and-talk" (LAT) protocol with the help of full-duplex (FD) technique that allows SUs to simultaneously sense and access the vacant spectrum. Spectrum utilization performance is carefully analyzed, with the closed-form spectrum waste ratio and collision ratio with the PU provided. Also, regarding the secondary throughput, we report the existence of a tradeoff between the secondary transmit power and throughput. Based on the power-throughput tradeoff, we derive the analytical local optimal transmit power for SUs to achieve both high throughput and satisfying sensing accuracy. Numerical results are given to verify the proposed protocol and the theoretical results.
