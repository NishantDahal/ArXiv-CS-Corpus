Hierarchical Time-Dependent Oracles

We study networks obeying \emph{time-dependent} min-cost path metrics, and present novel oracles for them which \emph{provably} achieve two unique features: % (i) \emph{subquadratic} preprocessing time and space, \emph{independent} of the metric's amount of disconcavity; % (ii) \emph{sublinear} query time, in either the network size or the actual Dijkstra-Rank of the query at hand.
