Beampattern-Based Tracking for Millimeter Wave Communication Systems

We present a tracking algorithm to maintain the communication link between a base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS) in a millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, where antenna arrays are used for beamforming in both the BS and MS. Downlink transmission is considered, and the tracking is performed at the MS as it moves relative to the BS. Specifically, we consider the case that the MS rotates quickly due to hand movement. The algorithm estimates the angle of arrival (AoA) by using variations in the radiation pattern of the beam as a function of this angle. Numerical results show that the algorithm achieves accurate beam alignment when the MS rotates in a wide range of angular speeds. For example, the algorithm can support angular speeds up to 800 degrees per second when tracking updates are available every 10 ms.
