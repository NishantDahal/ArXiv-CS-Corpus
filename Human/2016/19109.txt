Assisting humans to achieve optimal sleep by changing ambient temperature

Environment plays a vital role in the sleep mechanism of a human. It has been shown from many studies that sleeping and waking environment, waking time and hours of sleep is of very significant importance which can result in sleeping disorders and variety of diseases. This paper finds the sleep cycle of an individual and according changes the ambient temperature to maximize his/her sleep efficiency. We suggest a method which will assist in increasing sleep efficiency. Using Fast-Fourier-Transformation (FFT) of heart rate signals to extract heart rate variability data such that low frequency / high frequency (LF/HF) power ratio we are detecting sleep stages using an automated algorithm and then applying feedback mechanism to alter the ambient temperature depending upon the sleep stage.
