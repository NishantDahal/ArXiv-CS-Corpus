Holistic Approach for Fault-Tolerant Network-on-Chip based Many-Core Systems

In this paper we describe a holistic approach for Fault-Tolerant Network-on-Chip (NoC) based many-core systems that incorporates a System Health Monitoring Unit (SHMU) which collects all the fault information from the system, classifies them and provides different solutions for different fault classes. A Mapper/Scheduler Unit (MSU) is used for online generation of different mapping and scheduling solutions based on the current fault configuration of the system. For detection of faults, we have leveraged concurrent online checkers, able to capture faults with low detection latency and providing the fault information for SHMU, which can be later used for the recovery process. The experimentation setup is performed in an open source tool, able to perform the mapping, scheduling and simulation of the system.
