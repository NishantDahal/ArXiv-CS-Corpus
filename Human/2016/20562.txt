Notes on Adiabatic Quantum Computers

We discuss in this chapter the basics of adiabatic computation, as well as some physical implementations. After a short introduction of the quantum circuit model, we describe quantum adiabatic computation, quantum annealing, and the strong relations between the three. We conclude with a brief presentation of the D-Wave computer and some future challenges.
