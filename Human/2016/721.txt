A Grouped System Architecture for Smart Grids Based AMI Communications Over LTE

A smart grid based Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), is a technology that enables the utilities to monitor and control the electricity consumption through a set of various smart meters (SMs) connected via a two way communication infrastructure. One of the key challenges for smart grids is how to connect a large number of devices. On the other hand, 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE), the latest standard for mobile communications, was developed to provide stable service performance and higher data rates for a large number of mobile users. Therefore, LTE is considered a promising solution for wide area connectivity for SMs. In this paper, a grouped hierarchal architecture for SMs communications over LTE is introduced. Then, an efficient grouped scheduling technique is proposed for SMs transmissions over LTE. The proposed architecture efficiently solves the overload problem due to AMI traffic and guarantees a full monitoring and control for energy consumption. The results of our suggested solution showed that LTE can serve better for smart grids based AMI with particular grouping and scheduling scheme. In addition, the presented technique can able to be used in urban areas having high density of SMs.
