Short range networks of wearables for safer mobility in smart cities

Ensuring safe and efficient mobility is a critical issue for smart city operators. Increasing safety not only reduces the likelihood of road injuries and fatalities, but also reduces traffic congestion and disruptions caused by accidents, increasing efficiency. While new vehicles are increasingly equipped with semi-automation, the added costs will initially limit the penetration rate of these systems. An inexpensive way to replace or augment these systems is to create networks of wearables (smart glasses, watches) that exchange positional and path data at a very fast rate between all users, identify collision risks and feedback collision resolution information to all users in an intuitive way through their smart glasses.
