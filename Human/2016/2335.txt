Waveform Optimization for SWIPT with Nonlinear Energy Harvester Modeling

Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) has attracted significant attention in the communication community. The problem of waveform design for SWIPT has however never been addressed so far. In this paper, a novel SWIPT transceiver architecture is introduced relying on the superposition of multisine and OFDM waveforms at the transmitter and a power-splitter receiver equipped with an energy harvester and an information decoder capable of cancelling the multisine waveforms. The SWIPT multisine/OFDM waveforms are optimized so as to maximize the rate-energy region of the whole system. They are adaptive to the channel state information and result from a posynomial maximization problem that originates from the non-linearity of the energy harvester. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and SWIPT architecture.
