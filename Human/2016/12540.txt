OTFS - Orthogonal Time Frequency Space

In this paper we introduce a new 2D modulation technique called OTFS (Orthogonal Time Frequency & Space) that transforms information carried in the Delay-Doppler coordinate system to the familiar time-frequency domain utilized by traditional modulation schemes such as OFDM, CDMA and TDMA. OTFS converts the fading, time-varying wireless channel into a non-fading, time-independent interaction revealing the underlying geometry of the wireless channel. In this new formulation, all QAM symbols experience the same channel and all Delay-Doppler diversity branches of the channel are coherently combined. Reference signal multiplexing is done in the time-independent Delay-Doppler domain, achieving high density pilot packing, which is a crucial requirement for Massive MIMO. Regardless of the Doppler scenario, OTFS enables approaching channel capacity through linear scaling of throughput with MIMO order, thus realizing the full promise of Massive MIMO throughput gains even in challenging 5G deployment settings.
