Safety technology for train based on multi-sensors and braking system

This work deals with integration and transmission of safety information for smart railway vehicles and control and design of cooperative emergency brake systems for high speed trains. Due to increased speed of high-speed train, safety of passengers is becoming more critical. From this perspective, three different approaches to ensure the safety of passengers are useful. These approaches are based on integrated use of multi-sensors and emergency brake system. Methodology for integrated use of sensors to obtain situation-aware safety related information and for enhanced braking is to be discussed in details in this work
