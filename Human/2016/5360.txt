Full-Duplex Cellular Networks: It Works!

Full-duplex (FD) communications with bidirectional transmitting and receiving at the same time and frequency radio resource have long been deemed a promising way to boost spectrum efficiency, but hindered by the techniques for self-interference cancellation (SIC). Recent breakthroughs in analog and digital signal processing yield the feasibility of beyond $100$ dB SIC capability and make it possible for FD communications to demonstrate nearly doubled spectrum efficiency for point-to-point links. Now it is time to shift at least partial of our focus to full duplex networking, such as in cellular networks, since it is not straightforward but demanding novel and more complicated interference management techniques. Before putting FD networking into practice, we need to understand that what scenarios FD communications should be applied in under the current technology maturity, how bad the performance will be if we do nothing to deal with the newly introduced interference, and most importantly, how much improvement could be achieved after applying advanced solutions. This article will shed light on these questions.
