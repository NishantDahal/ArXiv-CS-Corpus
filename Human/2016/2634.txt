A note on strictly positive logics and word rewriting systems

We establish a natural translation from word rewriting systems to strictly positive polymodal logics. Thereby, the latter can be considered as a generalization of the former. As a corollary we obtain examples of undecidable strictly positive normal modal logics. The translation has its counterpart on the level of proofs: we formulate a natural deep inference proof system for strictly positive logics generalizing derivations in word rewriting systems. We also formulate some open questions related to the theory of modal companions of superintuitionistic logics that was initiated by L.L. Maximova and V.V. Rybakov.
