Advances in Property-Based Testing for $α$Prolog

$α$Check is a light-weight property-based testing tool built on top of $α$Prolog, a logic programming language based on nominal logic. $α$Prolog is particularly suited to the validation of the meta-theory of formal systems, for example correctness of compiler translations involving name-binding, alpha-equivalence and capture-avoiding substitution. In this paper we describe an alternative to the negation elimination algorithm underlying $α$Check that substantially improves its effectiveness. To substantiate this claim we compare the checker performances w.r.t. two of its main competitors in the logical framework niche, namely the QuickCheck/Nitpick combination offered by Isabelle/HOL and the random testing facility in PLT-Redex.
