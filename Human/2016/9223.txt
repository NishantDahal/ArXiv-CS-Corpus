LSA-Advanced and C-RAN: A (5G) Romance of Many Dimensions

We examine the dimensional limitations of Licensed Shared Access (LSA) regulatory framework for spectrum sharing and propose a solution for its more dynamic implementation. We consider an additional dimension for sharing, beyond those of time, space and frequency, i.e. the sharing of the infrastructure. We explain why we believe that the emerging regulations and use-case scenarios are limiting the potential of LSA, and with this in mind make a set of recommendations to unlock it fully. As a specific case study, we present our architectural work around Cloud-based Radio Access Network (C-RAN) and LSA to demonstrate the possibility of a dynamic implementation of multiple incumbents and multiple LSA licensees engaged in sharing. Our case study highlights multiple ways for LSA framework to evolve into a global and flexible sharing model, and prove that LSA and C-RAN are a good match to rethink how we look at networks targeting a more flexible, efficient and profitable way of operating them.
