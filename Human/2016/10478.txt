A XML Based Datagrid Description Language

We present xDGDL, an approach towards a concise but comprehensive Datagrid description language. Our framework is based on the portable XML language and allows to store syntactical and semantical information together with arbitrary files. This information can be used to administer, locate, search and process the stored data on the Grid. As an application of the xDGDL approach we present ViPFS, a novel distributed file system targeting the Grid.
