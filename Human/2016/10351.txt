Interactive Learning from Multiple Noisy Labels

Interactive learning is a process in which a machine learning algorithm is provided with meaningful, well-chosen examples as opposed to randomly chosen examples typical in standard supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a new method for interactive learning from multiple noisy labels where we exploit the disagreement among annotators to quantify the easiness (or meaningfulness) of an example. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method in estimating the parameters of a latent variable classification model, and conduct experimental analyses on a range of synthetic and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the performance of perceptron in this interactive learning framework.
