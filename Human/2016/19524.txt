Ontohub: A semantic repository for heterogeneous ontologies

Ontohub is a repository engine for managing distributed heterogeneous ontologies. The distributed nature enables communities to share and exchange their contributions easily. The heterogeneous nature makes it possible to integrate ontologies written in various ontology languages. Ontohub supports a wide range of formal logical and ontology languages, as well as various structuring and modularity constructs and inter-theory (concept) mappings, building on the OMG-standardized DOL language. Ontohub repositories are organised as Git repositories, thus inheriting all features of this popular version control system. Moreover, Ontohub is the first repository engine meeting a substantial amount of the requirements formulated in the context of the Open Ontology Repository (OOR) initiative, including an API for federation as well as support for logical inference and axiom selection.
