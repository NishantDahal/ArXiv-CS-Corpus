Optical analogy to quantum computation based on classical fields modulated pseudorandom phase sequences

We demonstrate that a tensor product structure and optical analogy of quantum entanglement can be obtained by introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into classical fields with two orthogonal modes. Using the classical analogy, we discuss efficient simulation of several typical quantum states, including product state, Bell states, GHZ state, and W state. By performing quadrature demodulation scheme, we propose a sequence permutation mechanism to simulate certain quantum states and a generalized gate array model to simulate quantum algorithm, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm. The research on classical simulation of quantum states is important, for it not only enables potential beyond quantum computation, but also provides useful insights into fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.
