The bitwise operations in relation to obtaining Latin squares

The main thrust of the article is to provide interesting example, useful for students of using bitwise operations in the programming languages C ++ and Java. As an example, we describe an algorithm for obtaining a Latin square of arbitrary order. We will outline some techniques for the use of bitwise operations.
