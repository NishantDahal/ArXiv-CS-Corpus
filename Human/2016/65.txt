What if we considered awareness for sustainable Kwowledge Management ? Towards a model for self regulated knowledge management systems based on acceptance models of technologies and awareness

We propose, in this paper, a model of continuous use of corporate collaborative KMS. Companies do not always have the guaranty that their KMS will be continuously used. This statement can constitute an important obstacle for knowledge management processes. Our work is based on the analysis of classical models for initial and continuous use of technologies. We also analyse the regulation concept and explain how it is valuable to support a continuous use of KMS. We observed that awareness may be a regulation means that allows taking this problem into account. Awareness is a concept, which has been profusely used to improve user experience in collaborative environments. It is an important element for regulation of activity. In our model, we assume that one can integrate awareness in information systems to positively influence beliefs about them. The final objective of our work is to refine some concepts to fit the particularities of collaborative KMS and to propose an awareness regulation process using the traces of the users' interactions with the systems.
