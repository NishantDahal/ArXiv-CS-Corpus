Weakly Supervised Learning of Heterogeneous Concepts in Videos

Typical textual descriptions that accompany online videos are 'weak': i.e., they mention the main concepts in the video but not their corresponding spatio-temporal locations. The concepts in the description are typically heterogeneous (e.g., objects, persons, actions). Certain location constraints on these concepts can also be inferred from the description. The goal of this paper is to present a generalization of the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) that can (a) systematically incorporate heterogeneous concepts in an integrated framework, and (b) enforce location constraints, for efficient classification and localization of the concepts in the videos. Finally, we develop posterior inference for the proposed formulation using mean-field variational approximation. Comparative evaluations on the Casablanca and the A2D datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques: 24% relative improvement for pairwise concept classification in the Casablanca dataset and 9% relative improvement for localization in the A2D dataset as compared to the most competitive baseline.
