On "Exponential Lower Bounds for Polytopes in Combinatorial Optimization" by Fiorini et al. (2015): A Refutation For Models With Disjoint Sets of Descriptive Variables

We provide a numerical refutation of the developments of Fiorini et al. (2015)* for models with disjoint sets of descriptive variables. We also provide an insight into the meaning of the existence of a one-to-one linear map between solutions of such models.
