Weierstrass Semigroups from Kummer Extensions

The Weierstrass semigroups and pure gaps can be helpful in constructing codes with better parameters. In this paper, we investigate explicitly the minimal generating set of the Weierstrass semigroups associated with several totally ramified places over arbitrary Kummer extensions. Applying the techniques provided by Matthews in her previous work, we extend the results of specific Kummer extensions studied in the literature. Some examples are included to illustrate our results.
