An OMNeT++ based Framework for Mobility-aware Routing in Mobile Robotic Networks

In this paper, we propose a cross-layer extension for the INETMANET framework of OMNeT++, which utilizes mobility control knowledge to enhance the forwarding of routing messages. The well-known mobility meta-model from Reynolds is used to provide a realistic representation of the mobility behavior of autonomous agents with respect to the various influences those agents have to face in real-world applications. Knowledge about the current mobility properties and its predicted development is used by mobility-aware routing mechanisms in order to optimize routing decisions and avoid path losses at runtime. In a proof of concept evaluation, we show that our proposed methods can achieve significant improvements to the robustness of communication paths.
