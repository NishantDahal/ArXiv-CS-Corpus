Multi-Prime RSA Over Galois Approach

Many variants of RSA cryptosystem exist in the literature. One of them is RSA over polynomials based on Galois approach. In standard RSA modulus is product of two large primes whereas in the Galois approach author considered the modulus as a product of two irriduciable polynomials. We use this idea and extend Multi-prime RSA over polynomials.
