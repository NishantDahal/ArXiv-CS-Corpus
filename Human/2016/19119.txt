A Hybrid Network/Grid Model of Urban Morphogenesis and Optimization

We describe a hybrid agent-based model and simulation of urban morphogenesis. It consists of a cellular automata grid coupled to a dynamic network topology. The inherently heterogeneous properties of urban structure and function are taken into account in the dynamics of the system. We propose various layout and performance measures to categorize and explore the generated configurations. An economic evaluation metric was also designed using the sensitivity of segregation models to spatial configuration. Our model is applied to a real-world case, offering a means to optimize the distribution of activities in a zoning context.
