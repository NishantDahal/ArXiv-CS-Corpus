Friendship-based Cooperative Jamming for Secure Communication in Poisson Networks

Wireless networks with the consideration of social relationships among network nodes are highly appealing for lots of important data communication services. Ensuring the security of such networks is of great importance to facilitate their applications in supporting future social-based services with strong security guarantee. This paper explores the physical layer security-based secure communication in a finite Poisson network with social friendships among nodes, for which a social friendship-based cooperative jamming scheme is proposed. The jamming scheme consists of a Local Friendship Circle (LFC) and a Long-range Friendship Annulus (LFA), where all legitimate nodes in the LFC serve as jammers, but the legitimate nodes in the LFA are selected as jammers through three location-based policies. To understand both the security and reliability performance of the proposed jamming scheme, we first model the sum interference at any location in the network by deriving its Laplace transform under two typical path loss scenarios. With the help of the interference Laplace transform results, we then derive the exact expression for the transmission outage probability (TOP) and determine both the upper and lower bounds on the secrecy outage probability (SOP), such that the overall outage performances of the proposed jamming scheme can be depicted. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to validate the theoretical analysis of TOP and SOP and also to illustrate the impacts of the friendship-based cooperative jamming on the network performances.
