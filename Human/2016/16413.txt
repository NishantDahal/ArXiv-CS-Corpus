Isometrically Self-dual Cyclic Codes

General isometries of cyclic codes, including multipliers and translations, are introduced; and isometrically self-dual cyclic codes are defined. In terms of Type-I duadic splittings given by multipliers and translations, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of isometrically self-dual cyclic codes is obtained. A program to construct isometrically self-dual cyclic codes is provided, and illustrated by several examples. In particular, a class of isometrically self-dual MDS cyclic codes, which are alternant codes from a class of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, is presented.
