Using Tableau to Decide Description Logics with Full Role Negation and Identity

This paper presents a tableau approach for deciding expressive description logics with full role negation and role identity. We consider the description logic ALBOid, which is the extension of ALC with the Boolean role operators, inverse of roles, the identity role, and includes full support for individuals and singleton concepts. ALBOid is expressively equivalent to the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with equality and subsumes Boolean modal logic. In this paper we define a sound and complete tableau calculus for the ALBOid that provides a basis for decision procedures for this logic and all its sublogics. An important novelty of our approach is the use of a generic unrestricted blocking mechanism. Being based on a conceptually simple rule, unrestricted blocking performs case distinctions over whether two individuals are equal or not and equality reasoning to find finite models. The blocking mechanism ties the proof of termination of tableau derivations to the finite model property of ALBOid.
