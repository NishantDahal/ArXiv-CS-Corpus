Modeling and Analysis for Cache-Enabled Networks with Dynamic Traffic

Instead of assuming fully loaded cells in the analysis on cache-enabled networks with tools of stochastic geometry, we focus on the dynamic traffic in this letter. With modeling traffic dynamics of request arrivals and departures, probabilities of full-, free-, and modest-load cells in the large-scale cache-enabled network are elaborated based on the traffic queue state. Moreover, we propose to exploit the packets cached at cache-enabled users as side information to cancel the incoming interference. Then the packet loss rates for both the cache-enabled and cache-untenable users are investigated. The simulation results verify our analysis.
