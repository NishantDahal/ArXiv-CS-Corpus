A Multi-Smartwatch System for Assessing Speech Characteristics of People with Dysarthria in Group Settings

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) frequently use vocal exercises in the treatment of patients with speech disorders. Patients receive treatment in a clinical setting and need to practice outside of the clinical setting to generalize speech goals to functional communication. In this paper, we describe the development of technology that captures mixed speech signals in a group setting and allows the SLP to analyze the speech signals relative to treatment goals. The mixed speech signals are blindly separated into individual signals that are preprocessed before computation of loudness, pitch, shimmer, jitter, semitone standard deviation and sharpness. The proposed method has been previously validated on data obtained from clinical trials of people with Parkinson disease and healthy controls.
