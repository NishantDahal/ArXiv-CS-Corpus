Delay-Aware Dynamic Resource Management for High-Speed Railway Wireless Communications

In this paper, we investigate the delay-aware dynamic resource management problem for multi-service transmission in high-speed railway wireless communications, with a focus on resource allocation among the services and power control along the time. By taking account of average delay requirements and power constraints, the considered problem is formulated into a stochastic optimization problem, rather than pursuing the traditional convex optimization means. Inspired by Lyapunov optimization theory, the intractable stochastic optimization problem is transformed into a tractable deterministic optimization problem, which is a mixed-integer resource management problem. By exploiting the specific problem structure, the mixed-integer resource management problem is equivalently transformed into a single variable problem, which can be effectively solved by the golden section search method with guaranteed global optimality. Finally, we propose a dynamic resource management algorithm to solve the original stochastic optimization problem. Simulation results show the advantage of the proposed dynamic algorithm and reveal that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between delay requirements and power consumption.
