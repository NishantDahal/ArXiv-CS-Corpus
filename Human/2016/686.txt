Modeling Reusable, Platform-Independent Robot Assembly Processes

Smart factories that allow flexible production of highly individualized goods require flexible robots, usable in efficient assembly lines. Compliant robots can work safely in shared environments with domain experts, who have to program such robots easily for arbitrary tasks. We propose a new domain-specific language and toolchain for robot assembly tasks for compliant manipulators. With the LightRocks toolchain, assembly tasks are modeled on different levels of abstraction, allowing a separation of concerns between domain experts and robotics experts: externally provided, platform-independent assembly plans are instantiated by the domain experts using models of processes and tasks. Tasks are comprised of skills, which combine platform-specific action models provided by robotics experts. Thereby it supports a flexible production and re-use of modeling artifacts for various assembly processes.
