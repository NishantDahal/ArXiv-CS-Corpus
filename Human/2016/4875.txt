Performance Evaluation of User Scheduling for Full-Duplex Small Cells in Ultra-Dense Networks

Full-duplex (FD) communication is an emerging technology that can potentially double the throughput of cellular networks. Preliminary studies in single-cell or small FD network deployments have revealed promising rate gains using self-interference cancellation (SIC) techniques and receive processing. Nevertheless, the system-level performance gains of FD small cells in ultra-dense networks (UDNs) have not been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of resource allocation in ultra-dense FD small-cell networks using spatial stochastic models for the network layout and 3GPP channel models. More specifically, we consider various UDN scenarios and assess the performance of different low-complexity user-scheduling schemes and power allocation between uplink and downlink. We also provide useful insights into the effect of the SIC capability on the network throughput.
