Uniqueness of Minima of a Certain Least Squares Problem

This paper is essentially an exercise in studying the minima of a certain least squares optimization using the second partial derivative test. The motivation is to gain insight into an optimization-based solution to the problem of tracking human limbs using IMU sensors.
