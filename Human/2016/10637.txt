Hoffmann-Ostenhof's conjecture for traceable cubic graphs

It was conjectured by Hoffmann-Ostenhof that the edge set of every connected cubic graph can be decomposed into a spanning tree, a matching and a family of cycles. In this paper, we show that this conjecture holds for traceable cubic graphs.
