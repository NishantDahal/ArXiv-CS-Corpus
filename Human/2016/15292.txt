An Experimental Study on the Learning Outcome of Teaching Elementary Level Children using Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robotics Education Kit

Skills like computational thinking, problem solving, handling complexity, team-work and project management are essential for future careers and needs to be taught to students at the elementary level itself. Computer programming knowledge and skills, experiencing technology and conducting science and engineering experiments are also important for students at elementary level. However, teaching such skills effectively through active learning can be challenging for educators. In this paper, we present our approach and experiences in teaching such skills to several elementary level children using Lego Mindstorms EV3 robotics education kit. We describe our learning environment consisting of lessons, worksheets, hands-on activities and assessment. We taught students how to design, construct and program robots using components such as motors, sensors, wheels, axles, beams, connectors and gears. Students also gained knowledge on basic programming constructs such as control flow, loops, branches and conditions using a visual programming environment. We carefully observed how students performed various tasks and solved problems. We present experimental results which demonstrates that our teaching methodology consisting of both the course content and pedagogy was effective in imparting the desired skills and knowledge to elementary level children. The students also participated in a competitive World Robot Olympiad India event and qualified during the regional round which is an evidence of the effectiveness of the approach.
