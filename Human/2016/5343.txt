Three-Weight Ternary Linear Codes from a Family of Monomials

Based on a generic construction, two classes of ternary three-weight linear codes are obtained from a family of power functions, including some APN power functions. The weight distributions of these linear codes are determined through studying the properties of some exponential sum related to the proposed power functions.
