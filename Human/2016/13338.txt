FFT Algorithm for Binary Extension Finite Fields and its Application to Reed-Solomon Codes

Recently, a new polynomial basis over binary extension fields was proposed such that the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over such fields can be computed in the complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(n\lg(n))$, where $n$ is the number of points evaluated in FFT. In this work, we reformulate this FFT algorithm such that it can be easier understood and be extended to develop frequency-domain decoding algorithms for $(n=2^m,k)$ systematic Reed-Solomon~(RS) codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m},m\in \mathbb{Z}^+$, with $n-k$ a power of two. First, the basis of syndrome polynomials is reformulated in the decoding procedure so that the new transforms can be applied to the decoding procedure. A fast extended Euclidean algorithm is developed to determine the error locator polynomial. The computational complexity of the proposed decoding algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(n\lg(n-k)+(n-k)\lg^2(n-k))$, improving upon the best currently available decoding complexity $\mathcal{O}(n\lg^2(n)\lg\lg(n))$, and reaching the best known complexity bound that was established by Justesen in 1976. However, Justesen's approach is only for the codes over some specific fields, which can apply Cooley-Tucky FFTs. As revealed by the computer simulations, the proposed decoding algorithm is $50$ times faster than the conventional one for the $(2^{16},2^{15})$ RS code over $\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}$.
