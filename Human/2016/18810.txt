QoS Guaranteed Energy Minimization Over Two-Way Relaying Networks

In this work, we consider a typical three-node, two-way relaying network (TWRN) over fading channels. The aim is to minimize the entire system energy usage for a TWRN in the long run, while satisfying the required average symmetric exchange rate between the two source nodes. To this end, the energy usage of the physical-layer network coding (PNC) or the superposition coding based digital network coding (SPC-DNC) is analyzed. The rule on selection of both strategies is then derived by comparison. Based on the observed rule, we then design a scheme by switching between PNC and SPC-DNC for each channel realization. The associated optimization problem, through PNC/DNC switching,as well as power allocation on the uplink and the downlink for each channel realization is formulated and solved via an iterative algorithm. It is demonstrated that this switching scheme outperforms the schemes solely employing PNC or SPC-DNC through both theoretical analysis and simulations.
