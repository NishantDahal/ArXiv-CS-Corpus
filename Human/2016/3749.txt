TTC: A high-performance Compiler for Tensor Transpositions

We present TTC, an open-source parallel compiler for multidimensional tensor transpositions. In order to generate high-performance C++ code, TTC explores a number of optimizations, including software prefetching, blocking, loop-reordering, and explicit vectorization. To evaluate the performance of multidimensional transpositions across a range of possible use-cases, we also release a benchmark covering arbitrary transpositions of up to six dimensions. Performance results show that the routines generated by TTC achieve close to peak memory bandwidth on both the Intel Haswell and the AMD Steamroller architectures, and yield significant performance gains over modern compilers. By implementing a set of pruning heuristics, TTC allows users to limit the number of potential solutions; this option is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional tensors, as the search space might become prohibitively large. Experiments indicate that when only 100 potential solutions are considered, the resulting performance is about 99% of that achieved with exhaustive search.
