Strategic Formation of Heterogeneous Networks

We establish a network formation game for the Internet's Autonomous System (AS) interconnection topology. The game includes different types of players, accounting for the heterogeneity of ASs in the Internet. In this network formation game, the utility of a player depends on the network structure, e.g., the distances between nodes and the cost of links. We also consider the case where utility (or monetary) transfers are allowed between the players. We incorporate reliability considerations in the player's utility function, and analyze static properties of the game as well as its dynamic evolution. We provide dynamic analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence of some "network motifs" in the Internet graph. We assess our predictions with real-world data.
