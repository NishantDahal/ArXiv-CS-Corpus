Information Rates for Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling with 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling at the Receiver

Oversampling combined with low quantization resolutions has been shown to be a viable option when aiming for energy efficiency in multigigabit/s communications systems. This work considers the case of 1-bit quantization combined with oversampling and shows how the performance of such a system can be improved by using matched pulse shaping filters and faster than Nyquist signaling. The channel is considered with additive Gaussian noise and the performance of the system is evaluated in terms of achievable information rate under symbol-by-symbol detection.
