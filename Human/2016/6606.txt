LDPC Codes Based on the Space of Symmetric Matrices over Finite Fields

In this paper, we present a new method for explicitly constructing regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes based on $\mathbb{S}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$, the space of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Using this method, we obtain two classes of binary LDPC codes, $\cal{C}(n,q)$ and $\cal{C}^{T}(n,q)$, both of which have grith $8$. Then both the minimum distance and the stopping distance of each class are investigated. It is shown that the minimum distance and the stopping distance of $\cal{C}^{T}(n,q)$ are both $2q$. As for $\cal{C}(n,q)$, we determine the minimum distance and the stopping distance for some special cases and obtain the lower bounds for other cases.
