There are two distinct approaches to speeding up large parallel computers. The older method is the General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU). The newer is the Many Integrated Core (MIC) technology . Here we attempt to focus on the MIC technology and point out differences between the two approaches to accelerating supercomputers. This is a user perspective.
