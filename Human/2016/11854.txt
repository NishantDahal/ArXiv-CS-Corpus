MIMO Cellular Networks with Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer

In this paper, we introduce a mathematical approach for system-level analysis and optimization of densely deployed multiple-antenna cellular networks, where low-energy devices are capable of decoding information data and harvesting power simultaneously. The base stations are assumed to be deployed according to a Poisson point process and tools from stochastic geometry are exploited to quantify the trade-off in terms of information rate and harvested power. It is shown that multiple-antenna transmission is capable of increasing information rate and harvested power at the same time.
