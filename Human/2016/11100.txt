A general framework for weighted sum-rate and common-rate optimization

In this paper, we propose a framework for solving a class of optimization problems encountered in a range of power allocation problems in wireless relay networks. In particular, power allocation for weighted sum-rate and common-rate optimization problems fall in this framework. Subject to some conditions on the region of feasible powers, the optimal solutions are analytically found. The optimization problems are posed in a general form and their solutions are shown to have applications in a number of practical scenarios. Numerical results verify the optimality of the analytical approach.
