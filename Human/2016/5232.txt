Algorithmic computation of polynomial amoebas

We present algorithms for computation and visualization of amoebas, their contours, compactified amoebas and sections of three-dimensional amoebas by two-dimensional planes. We also provide method and an algorithm for the computation of~polynomials whose amoebas exhibit the most complicated topology among all polynomials with a fixed Newton polytope. The presented algorithms are implemented in computer algebra systems Matlab 8 and Mathematica 9.
