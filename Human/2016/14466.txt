Performance of ternary double circulant, double twistulant, and self-dual codes

We study the performance of ternary isodual codes which are not self-dual and ternary self-dual codes, as measured by the decoding error probability in bounded distance decoding. We compare the performance of ternary double circulant and double twistulant codes which are not self-dual with ternary extremal self-dual codes. We also investigate the performance of ternary self-dual codes having large minimum weights.
