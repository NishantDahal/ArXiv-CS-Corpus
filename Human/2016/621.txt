Online Prediction of Dyadic Data with Heterogeneous Matrix Factorization

Dyadic Data Prediction (DDP) is an important problem in many research areas. This paper develops a novel fully Bayesian nonparametric framework which integrates two popular and complementary approaches, discrete mixed membership modeling and continuous latent factor modeling into a unified Heterogeneous Matrix Factorization~(HeMF) model, which can predict the unobserved dyadics accurately. The HeMF can determine the number of communities automatically and exploit the latent linear structure for each bicluster efficiently. We propose a Variational Bayesian method to estimate the parameters and missing data. We further develop a novel online learning approach for Variational inference and use it for the online learning of HeMF, which can efficiently cope with the important large-scale DDP problem. We evaluate the performance of our method on the EachMoive, MovieLens and Netflix Prize collaborative filtering datasets. The experiment shows that, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all benchmarks. Compared with Stochastic Gradient Method (SGD), our online learning approach achieves significant improvement on the estimation accuracy and robustness.
