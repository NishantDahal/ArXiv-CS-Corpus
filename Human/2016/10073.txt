Algorithmic Analysis of Invisible Video Watermarking using LSB Encoding Over a Client-Server Framework

Video watermarking is extensively used in many media-oriented applications for embedding watermarks, i.e. hidden digital data, in a video sequence to protect the video from illegal copying and to identify manipulations made in the video. In case of an invisible watermark, the human eye can not perceive any difference in the video, but a watermark extraction application can read the watermark and obtain the embedded information. Although numerous methodologies exist for embedding watermarks, many of them have shortcomings with respect to performance efficiency, especially over a distributed network. This paper proposes and analyses a 2-bit Least Significant Bit (LSB) parallel algorithmic approach for achieving performance efficiency to watermark and distribute videos over a client-server framework.
