WINDOW: Wideband Demodulator for Optical Waveforms

Optical communication systems, which operate at very high rates, are often limited by the sampling rate bottleneck. The optical wideband regime may exceed analog to digital converters (ADCs) front-end bandwidth. Multi-channel sampling approaches, such as multicoset or interleaved ADCs, have been proposed to sample the wideband signal using several channels. Each channel samples below the Nyquist rate such that the overall sampling rate is preserved. However, this scheme suffers from two practical limitations that make its implementation difficult. First, the inherent anti-aliasing filter of the samplers distorts the wideband signal. Second, it requires accurate time shifts on the order of the signal's Nyquist rate, which are challenging to maintain. In this work, we propose an alternative multi-channel sampling scheme, the wideband demodulator for optical waveforms (WINDOW), based on analog RF demodulation, where each channel aliases the spectrum using a periodic mixing function before integration and sampling. We show that intentionally using the inherent ADC filter to perform integration increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate both theoretically and through numerical experiments that our system outperforms multicoset in terms of signal recovery and symbol estimation in the presence of both thermal and quantization noise but is slightly less robust to timing jitter.
