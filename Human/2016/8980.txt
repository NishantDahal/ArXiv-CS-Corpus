Inter-language Collaboration in an Object-oriented Virtual Machine

Multi-language virtual machines have a number of advantages. They allow software developers to use software libraries that were written for different programming languages. Furthermore, language implementors do not have to bother with low-level VM functionality and their implementation can benefit from optimizations in existing virtual machines. MagLev is an implementation of the Ruby programming language on top of the GemStone/S virtual machine for the Smalltalk programming language. In this work, we present how software components written in both languages can interact. We show how MagLev unifies the Smalltalk and the Ruby object model, taking into account Smalltalk meta classes, Ruby singleton classes, and Ruby modules. Besides, we show how we can call Ruby methods from Smalltalk and vice versa. We also present MagLev's concept of bridge methods for implementing Ruby method calling conventions. Finally, we compare our solution to other language implementations and virtual machines.
