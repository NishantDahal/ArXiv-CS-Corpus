The BioDynaMo Project: Creating a Platform for Large-Scale Reproducible Biological Simulations

Computer simulations have become a very powerful tool for scientific research. In order to facilitate research in computational biology, the BioDynaMo project aims at a general platform for biological computer simulations, which should be executable on hybrid cloud computing systems. This paper describes challenges and lessons learnt during the early stages of the software development process, in the context of implementation issues and the international nature of the collaboration.
