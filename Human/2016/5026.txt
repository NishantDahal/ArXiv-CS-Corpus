A Hybrid Performance Analysis Technique for Distributed Real-Time Embedded Systems

It remains a challenging problem to tightly estimate the worst case response time of an application in a distributed embedded system, especially when there are dependencies between tasks. We discovered that the state-of-the art techniques considering task dependencies either fail to obtain a conservative bound or produce a loose upper bound. We propose a novel conservative performance analysis, called hybrid performance analysis, combining the response time analysis technique and the scheduling time bound analysis technique to compute a tighter bound fast. Through extensive experiments with randomly generated graphs, superior performance of our proposed approach compared with previous methods is confirmed.
