Power-Efficient Resource Allocation for MC-NOMA with Statistical Channel State Information

In this paper, we study the power-efficient resource allocation for multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access (MC-NOMA) systems. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the statistical channel state information at transmitter and quality of service (QoS) constraints. To strike a balance between system performance and computational complexity, we propose a suboptimal power allocation and user scheduling with low computational complexity to minimize the total power consumption. The proposed design exploits the heterogeneity of QoS requirement to determine the successive interference cancellation decoding order. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a close-to-optimal performance and significantly outperforms a conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.
