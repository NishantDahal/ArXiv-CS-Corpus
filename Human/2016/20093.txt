Analysis and Design of a Passive Switched-Capacitor Matrix Multiplier for Approximate Computing

A switched-capacitor matrix multiplier is presented for approximate computing and machine learning applications. The multiply-and-accumulate operations perform discrete-time charge-domain signal processing using passive switches and 300 aF unit capacitors. The computation is digitized with a 6 b asynchronous successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter. The analyses of incomplete charge accumulation and thermal noise are discussed. The design was fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, and experimental measurements of multiplication are illustrated using matched filtering and image convolutions to analyze noise and offset. Two applications are highlighted: 1) energy-efficient feature extraction layer performing both compression and classification in a neural network for an analog front end and 2) analog acceleration for solving optimization problems that are traditionally performed in the digital domain. The chip obtains measured efficiencies of 8.7 TOPS/W at 1 GHz for the first application and 7.7 TOPS/W at 2.5 GHz for the second application.
