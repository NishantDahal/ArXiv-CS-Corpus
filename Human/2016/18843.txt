An Asymptotic Approximation of TCP CUBIC

In this paper, we derive an expression for computing average window size of a single TCP CUBIC connection under random losses. Throughput expression for TCP CUBIC has been computed earlier under deterministic periodic packet losses. We validate this expression theoretically. We then use insights from the deterministic loss based model to derive an expression for computing average window size of a single TCP CUBIC connection under random losses. For this computation, we first consider the sequence of TCP CUBIC window evolution processes indexed by the drop rate, p and show that with a suitable scaling this sequence converges to a limiting Markov chain as p tends to 0. The stationary distribution of the limiting Markov chain is then used to derive the average window size for small packet error rates. We validate our model and approximations via simulations.
