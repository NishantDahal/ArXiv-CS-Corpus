Improved MDS-based Algorithm for Nodes Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks

With the recent development of technology, wireless sensor networks (WSN) are becoming an important part of many applications. Knowing the exact location of each sensor in the network is very important issue. Therefore, the localization problem is a growing field of interest. Adding GPS receivers to each sensor node is costly solution and inapplicable on nodes with limited resources. Additionally, it is not suitable for indoor environments. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for nodes localization in WNS based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique. Our approach improves MDS by distance matrix refinement. Using extensive simulations we investigated in details our approach regarding different network topologies, various network parameters and performance issues. The results from simulations show that our improved MDS (IMDS) algorithm outperforms well known MDS-MAP algorithm [1] in terms of accuracy.
