Solving the Wastewater Treatment Plant Problem with SMT

In this paper we introduce the Wastewater Treatment Plant Problem, a real-world scheduling problem, and compare the performance of several tools on it. We show that, for a naive modeling, state-of-the-art SMT solvers outperform other tools ranging from mathematical programming to constraint programming. We use both real and randomly generated benchmarks.
  From this and similar results, we claim for the convenience of developing compiler front-ends being able to translate from constraint programming languages to the SMT-LIB standard language.
