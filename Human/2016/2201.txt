On Column Selection in Approximate Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis

We study the problem of column selection in large-scale kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) using the Nystr√∂m approximation, where one approximates two positive semi-definite kernel matrices using "landmark" points from the training set. When building low-rank kernel approximations in KCCA, previous work mostly samples the landmarks uniformly at random from the training set. We propose novel strategies for sampling the landmarks non-uniformly based on a version of statistical leverage scores recently developed for kernel ridge regression. We study the approximation accuracy of the proposed non-uniform sampling strategy, develop an incremental algorithm that explores the path of approximation ranks and facilitates efficient model selection, and derive the kernel stability of out-of-sample mapping for our method. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promise of our method.
