Cache-enabled Uplink Transmission in Wireless Small Cell Networks

It is starting to become a big trend in the era of social networking that people produce and upload user-generated contents to Internet via wireless networks, bringing a significant burden on wireless uplink networks. In this paper, we contribute to designing and theoretical understanding of wireless cache-enabled upload transmission in a delay-tolerant small cell network to relieve the burden, and then propose the corresponding scheduling policies for the small base station (SBS) under the infinite and finite cache sizes. Specifically, the cache ability introduced by SBS enables SBS to eliminate the redundancy among the upload contents from users. This strategy not only alleviates the wireless backhual traffic congestion from SBS to a macro base station (MBS), but also improves the transmission efficiency of SBS. We then investigate the scheduling schemes of SBS to offload more data traffic under caching size constraint. Moreover, two operational regions for the wireless cache-enabled upload network, namely, the delay-limited region and the cache-limited region, are established to reveal the fundamental tradeoff between the delay tolerance and the cache ability. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the significant performance gains of the proposed wireless cache-enabled upload network.
