Data Science at Udemy: Agile Experimentation with Algorithms

In this paper, we describe the data science framework at Udemy, which currently supports the recommender and search system. We explain the motivations behind the framework and review the approach, which allows multiple individual data scientists to all become 'full stack', taking control of their own destinies from the exploration and research phase, through algorithm development, experiment setup, and deep experiment analytics. We describe algorithms tested and deployed in 2015, as well as some key insights obtained from experiments leading to the launch of the new recommender system at Udemy. Finally, we outline the current areas of research, which include search, personalization, and algorithmic topic generation.
