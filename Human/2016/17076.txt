When Students Choose to Use Event-B in their Software Engineering Projects

Students often learn formal methods as part of a software engineering degree programme, without applying these formal methods outside of the specific module(s) dedicated to this subject. In particular, software engineering students often have to build a significant application/program/system in a substantial project at the end of their programme (in order to demonstrate the application of the things they have learned during the previous taught modules). Our experience shows that the majority of students do not use formal methods in this project work. We report on feedback from the minority of students who did choose to use formal methods in their projects, and give examples of where this was a help and where it was a hindrance.
