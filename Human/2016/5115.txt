Enforcing uniqueness in one-dimensional phase retrieval by additional signal information in time domain

Considering the ambiguousness of the discrete-time phase retrieval problem to recover a signal from its Fourier intensities, one can ask the question: what additional information about the unknown signal do we need to select the correct solution within the large solution set? Based on a characterization of the occurring ambiguities, we investigate different a priori conditions in order to reduce the number of ambiguities or even to receive a unique solution. Particularly, if we have access to additional magnitudes of the unknown signal in the time domain, we can show that almost all signals with finite support can be uniquely recovered. Moreover, we prove that an analogous result can be obtained by exploiting additional phase information.
