Negative local feedbacks in Boolean networks

We study the asymptotic dynamical properties of Boolean networks without local negative cycle. While the properties of Boolean networks without local cycle or without local positive cycle are rather well understood, recent literature raises the following two questions about networks without local negative cycle. Do they have at least one fixed point? Should all their attractors be fixed points? The two main results of this paper are negative answers to both questions: we show that and-nets without local negative cycle may have no fixed point, and that Boolean networks without local negative cycle may have antipodal attractive cycles.
