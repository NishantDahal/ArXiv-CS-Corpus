Divide and...conquer? On the limits of algorithmic approaches to syntactic semantic structure

In computer science, divide and conquer (D&C) is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A D&C algorithm works by recursively and monotonically breaking down a problem into sub problems of the same (or a related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. The present work identifies D&C algorithms assumed within contemporary syntactic theory, and discusses the limits of their applicability in the realms of the syntax semantics and syntax morphophonology interfaces. We will propose that D&C algorithms, while valid for some processes, fall short on flexibility given a mixed approach to the structure of linguistic phrase markers. Arguments in favour of a computationally mixed approach to linguistic structure will be presented as an alternative that offers advantages to uniform D&C approaches.
