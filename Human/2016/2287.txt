Latent-Class Hough Forests for 6 DoF Object Pose Estimation

In this paper we present Latent-Class Hough Forests, a method for object detection and 6 DoF pose estimation in heavily cluttered and occluded scenarios. We adapt a state of the art template matching feature into a scale-invariant patch descriptor and integrate it into a regression forest using a novel template-based split function. We train with positive samples only and we treat class distributions at the leaf nodes as latent variables. During testing we infer by iteratively updating these distributions, providing accurate estimation of background clutter and foreground occlusions and, thus, better detection rate. Furthermore, as a by-product, our Latent-Class Hough Forests can provide accurate occlusion aware segmentation masks, even in the multi-instance scenario. In addition to an existing public dataset, which contains only single-instance sequences with large amounts of clutter, we have collected two, more challenging, datasets for multiple-instance detection containing heavy 2D and 3D clutter as well as foreground occlusions. We provide extensive experiments on the various parameters of the framework such as patch size, number of trees and number of iterations to infer class distributions at test time. We also evaluate the Latent-Class Hough Forests on all datasets where we outperform state of the art methods.
