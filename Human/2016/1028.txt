MIMO Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for 5G Millimeter-Wave Wireless Systems

This paper presents a 3-D statistical channel model of the impulse response with small-scale spatially correlated random coefficients for multi-element transmitter and receiver antenna arrays, derived using the physically-based time cluster - spatial lobe (TCSL) clustering scheme. The small-scale properties of multipath amplitudes are modeled based on 28 GHz outdoor millimeter-wave small-scale local area channel measurements. The wideband channel capacity is evaluated by considering measurement-based Rician-distributed voltage amplitudes, and the spatial autocorrelation of multipath amplitudes for each pair of transmitter and receiver antenna elements. Results indicate that Rician channels may exhibit equal or possibly greater capacity compared to Rayleigh channels, depending on the number of antennas.
