Models Coupling Urban Growth and Transportation Network Growth : An Algorithmic Systematic Review Approach

A broad bibliographical study suggests a scarcity of quantitative models of simulation integrating both network and urban growth. This absence may be due to diverging interests of concerned disciplines, resulting in a lack of communication. We propose to proceed to an algorithmic systematic review to give quantitative elements of answer to this question. A formal iterative algorithm to retrieve corpuses of references from initial keywords, based on text-mining, is developed and implemented. We study its convergence properties and do a sensitivity analysis. We then apply it on queries representative of the specific question, for which results tend to confirm the assumption of disciplines compartmentalisation.
