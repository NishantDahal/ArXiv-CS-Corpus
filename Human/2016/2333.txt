Simple fluidic digital half-adder

A fluidic one-bit half-adder is made of five channels which intersect at a junction. Two channels are inputs, two channels are outputs and one channel is the drain. The channels direct fluid from input fragments to output fragments and the streams of fluid interact at the junctions. Binary signals are represented by water droplets introduced in the input channels: presence of a droplet in an input or output segments symbolises logical {\sc True}, absence --- {\sc False}. The droplets travel along channels by following a path of least resistance unless deflected at the junction. We demonstrate the function of the half-adder in both computer modelling and laboratory experiments, and propose a design of a one-bit full adder based on simulation.
