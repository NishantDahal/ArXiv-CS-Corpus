Data allocation on disks with solution reconfiguration (problems, heuristics)

The paper addresses problem of data allocation in two-layer computer storage while taking into account dynamic digraph(s) over computing tasks. The basic version of data file allocation on parallel hard magnetic disks is considered as special bin packing model. Two problems of the allocation solution reconfiguration (restructuring) are suggested: (i) one-stage restructuring model, (ii) multistage restructuring models. Solving schemes are based on simplified heuristics. Numerical examples illustrate problems and solving schemes.
