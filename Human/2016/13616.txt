Semi Automatic Color Segmentation of Document Pages

-This paper presents a semi automatic method used to segment color documents into different uniform color plans. The practical application is dedicated to administrative documents segmentation. In these documents, like in many other cases, color has a semantic meaning: it is then possible to identify some specific regions like manual annotations, rubber stamps or colored highlighting. A first step of user-controlled learning of the desired color plans is made on few sample documents. An automatic process can then be performed on the much bigger set as a batch. Our experiments show very interesting results in with a very competitive processing time.
