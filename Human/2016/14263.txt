A short review and primer on respiration in human computer interaction applications

The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Respiration is unique among physiological signals in that it can be consciously controlled which has to be taken into account when designing applications. Respiration is tightly connected to other physiological signals, especially cardiovascular activity, and often analyzed in conjunction with other signals. When analyzed separately, an increase in the rate of respiration can be seen as an increase in metabolic demand which indicates activate states such as engagement and attention. We present a short review on the application of respiration in human-computer interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
