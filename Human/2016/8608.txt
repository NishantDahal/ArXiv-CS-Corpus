Modeling and Self-Configuring SaaS Application

The main objectives of SaaS application are to make the management and control of software easier and take the management strain away from consumers. However, it also leads to software services available globally and this has been realized in our paper by designing a new model for SaaS application. The three levels we have classified in our model easy adapted to workflow and services. From the application layers meat-model description we discovered a new algorithm for the self-configuration of SaaS application. We used a feature model to define the variation of our model's management levels. The Xml file obtained from the feature model gave interactive communication between three levels and our new self-configuration algorithm. That increased the performance by selecting from the web a suitable configuration for every level. We have explained all the processes by an online booking example. Finally we present a conclusion and future work.
