Interactive Illumination Invariance

Illumination effects cause problems for many computer vision algorithms. We present a user-friendly interactive system for robust illumination-invariant image generation. Compared with the previous automated illumination-invariant image derivation approaches, our system enables users to specify a particular kind of illumination variation for removal. The derivation of illumination-invariant image is guided by the user input. The input is a stroke that defines an area covering a set of pixels whose intensities are influenced predominately by the illumination variation. This additional flexibility enhances the robustness for processing non-linearly rendered images and the images of the scenes where their illumination variations are difficult to estimate automatically. Finally, we present some evaluation results of our method.
