Modern Telecommunications: A Playground for Physicists?

This report summarizes some of the material that was presented by the author during the 2015 Les Houches Summerschool on "Random Matrices and Stochastic Processes". In these Lectures, various applications of Random Matrix Theory in modern telecommunications are reviewed. The aim is to introduce the Physics community to a number of relevant problems that can be analyzed using such tools, while at the same time briefly describing the way these methods are applied. More specifically, two applications on wireless communications and two on optical communications are presented.
