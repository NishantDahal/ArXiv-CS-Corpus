Habits vs Environment: What really causes asthma?

Despite considerable number of studies on risk factors for asthma onset, very little is known about their relative importance. To have a full picture of these factors, both categories, personal and environmental data, have to be taken into account simultaneously, which is missing in previous studies. We propose a framework to rank the risk factors from heterogeneous data sources of the two categories. Established on top of EventShop and Personal EventShop, this framework extracts about 400 features, and analyzes them by employing a gradient boosting tree. The features come from sources including personal profile and life-event data, and environmental data on air pollution, weather and PM2.5 emission sources. The top ranked risk factors derived from our framework agree well with the general medical consensus. Thus, our framework is a reliable approach, and the discovered rankings of relative importance of risk factors can provide insights for the prevention of asthma.
