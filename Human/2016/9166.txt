A Framework for Techniques for Information Technology Enabled Innovation

Australia is seen as lagging in the innovation that is needed for corporate success and national productivity gains. There is an apparent lack of consistent and integrated advice to managers on how to undertake innovation. Thus, this study aims to develop and investigate a framework that relates innovation practices to the type of innovation outcome, in the context of Information Technology (IT) enabled innovations. An Innovation Practice Framework was developed based on the Knowledge-Innovation Matrix (KIM) proposed by Gregor and Hevner (2015). Eleven commonly used innovation techniques (practices) were identified and placed in one or more of the quadrants: invention, advancement, exaptation and exploitation. Interviews were conducted with key informants in nine organisations in the Australian Capital Territory. Results showed that the least used techniques were skunk works and crowdsourcing. The most used techniques were traditional market research, brainstorming and design thinking. The Innovation Practice Framework was given some support, with genius grants being related to invention outcomes, design thinking with exaptation, traditional R&D with advancement and managerial scanning with exploitation. The study contributes theoretically with the new Innovation Practice Framework and has the potential to be useful to managers in showing how benefits can be gained from a range of innovation practices. Further work is in progress.
