Development of a 3D tongue motion visualization platform based on ultrasound image sequences

This article describes the development of a platform designed to visualize the 3D motion of the tongue using ultrasound image sequences. An overview of the system design is given and promising results are presented. Compared to the analysis of motion in 2D image sequences, such a system can provide additional visual information and a quantitative description of the tongue 3D motion. The platform can be useful in a variety of fields, such as speech production, articulation training, etc.
