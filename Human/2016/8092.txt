Intersections of the Hermitian Surface with irreducible Quadrics in even Characteristic

We determine the possible intersection sizes of a Hermitian surface $\mathcal H$ with an irreducible quadric of ${\mathrm PG}(3,q^2)$ sharing at least a tangent plane at a common non-singular point when $q$ is even.
