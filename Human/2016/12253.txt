Secret Sharing With Trusted Third Parties Using Piggy Bank Protocol

This paper presents a new scheme to distribute secret shares using two trusted third parties to increase security and eliminate the dependency on single trusted third party. This protocol for communication between a device and two trusted third parties uses the piggy bank cryptographic paradigm. We also present a protocol to give law enforcing agencies access to sensitive information present on a cell phone or a device using secret sharing scheme. The ideas for classical systems may also be applied to quantum schemes.
