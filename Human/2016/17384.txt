Hardness of Liar's Domination on Unit Disk Graphs

A unit disk graph is the intersection graph of a set of unit diameter disks in the plane. In this paper we consider liar's domination problem on unit disk graphs, a variant of dominating set problem. We call this problem as {\it Euclidean liar's domination problem}. In the Euclidean liar's domination problem, a set ${\cal P}=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n\}$ of $n$ points (disk centers) are given in the Euclidean plane. For $p \in {\cal P}$, $N[p]$ is a subset of ${\cal P}$ such that for any $q \in N[p]$, the Euclidean distance between $p$ and $q$ is less than or equal to 1, i.e., the corresponding unit diameter disks intersect. The objective of the Euclidean liar's domination problem is to find a subset $D\; (\subseteq {\cal P})$ of minimum size having the following properties : (i) $|N[p_i] \cap D| \geq 2$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$, and (ii) $|(N[p_i] \cup N[p_j]) \cap D| \geq 3$ for $i\neq j, 1\leq i,j \leq n$. This article aims to prove the Euclidean liar's domination problem is NP-complete.
