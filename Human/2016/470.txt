Big Data: Understanding Big Data

Steve Jobs, one of the greatest visionaries of our time was quoted in 1996 saying "a lot of times, people do not know what they want until you show it to them" [38] indicating he advocated products to be developed based on human intuition rather than research. With the advancements of mobile devices, social networks and the Internet of Things, enormous amounts of complex data, both structured and unstructured are being captured in hope to allow organizations to make better business decisions as data is now vital for an organizations success. These enormous amounts of data are referred to as Big Data, which enables a competitive advantage over rivals when processed and analyzed appropriately. However Big Data Analytics has a few concerns including Management of Data-lifecycle, Privacy & Security, and Data Representation. This paper reviews the fundamental concept of Big Data, the Data Storage domain, the MapReduce programming paradigm used in processing these large datasets, and focuses on two case studies showing the effectiveness of Big Data Analytics and presents how it could be of greater good in the future if handled appropriately.
