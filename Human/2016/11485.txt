Identifying a set of influential spreaders in complex networks

Identifying a set of influential spreaders in complex networks plays a crucial role in effective information spreading. A simple strategy is to choose top-$r$ ranked nodes as spreaders according to influence ranking method such as PageRank, ClusterRank and $k$-shell decomposition. Besides, some heuristic methods such as hill-climbing, SPIN, degree discount and independent set based are also proposed. However, these approaches suffer from a possibility that some spreaders are so close together that they overlap sphere of influence or time consuming. In this report, we present a simply yet effectively iterative method named VoteRank to identify a set of decentralized spreaders with the best spreading ability. In this approach, all nodes vote in a spreader in each turn, and the voting ability of neighbors of elected spreader will be decreased in subsequent turn. Experimental results on four real networks show that under Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, VoteRank outperforms the traditional benchmark methods on both spreading speed and final affected scale. What's more, VoteRank is also superior to other group-spreader identifying methods on computational time.
