Monitor, Detect, Mitigate: Combating BGP Prefix Hijacking in Real-Time with ARTEMIS

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is globally used by Autonomous Systems (ASes) to establish route paths for IP prefixes in the Internet. Due to the lack of authentication in BGP, an AS can hijack IP prefixes owned by other ASes (i.e., announce illegitimate route paths), impacting thus the Internet routing system and economy. To this end, a number of hijacking detection systems have been proposed. However, existing systems are usually third party services that -inherently- introduce a significant delay between the hijacking detection (by the service) and its mitigation (by the network administrators). To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose ARTEMIS, a tool that enables an AS to timely detect hijacks on its own prefixes, and automatically proceed to mitigation actions. To evaluate the performance of ARTEMIS, we conduct real hijacking experiments. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that a hijacking detection/mitigation system is evaluated through extensive experiments in the real Internet. Our results (a) show that ARTEMIS can detect (mitigate) a hijack within a few seconds (minutes) after it has been launched, and (b) demonstrate the efficiency of the different control-plane sources used by ARTEMIS, towards monitoring routing changes.
