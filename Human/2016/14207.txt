A Greedy Algorithm to Cluster Specialists

Several recent deep neural networks experiments leverage the generalist-specialist paradigm for classification. However, no formal study compared the performance of different clustering algorithms for class assignment. In this paper we perform such a study, suggest slight modifications to the clustering procedures, and propose a novel algorithm designed to optimize the performance of of the specialist-generalist classification system. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets allow us to investigate situations for varying number of classes on similar data. We find that our \emph{greedy pairs} clustering algorithm consistently outperforms other alternatives, while the choice of the confusion matrix has little impact on the final performance.
