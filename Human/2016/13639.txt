A Robust Diarization System for Measuring Dominance in Peer-Led Team Learning Groups

Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) is a structured learning model where a team leader is appointed to facilitate collaborative problem solving among students for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses. This paper presents an informed HMM-based speaker diarization system. The minimum duration of short conversationalturns and number of participating students were fed as side information to the HMM system. A modified form of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) was used for iterative merging and re-segmentation. Finally, we used the diarization output to compute a novel dominance score based on unsupervised acoustic analysis.
