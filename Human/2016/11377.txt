Compatibility of Mating Preferences

Human mating is a complex phenomenon. Although men and women have different preferences in mate selection, there should be compatibility in these preferences since human mating requires agreement of both parties. We investigate how compatible the mating preferences of men and women are in a given property such as age, height, education and income. We use dataset of a large online dating site (N = 44, 255 users). (i) Our findings are based on the "actual behavior" of users trying to find a date online, rather than questions about a "hypothetical" partner as in surveys. (ii) We confirm that women and men have different mating preferences. Women prefer taller and older men with better education and higher income then themselves. Men prefer just the opposite. (iii) Our findings indicate that these differences complement each other. (iv) Highest compatibility is observed in income with 95 %. This might be an indication that income is in the process of becoming more important than other properties, including age, in our modern society. (v) An evolutionary model is developed which produces similar results.
