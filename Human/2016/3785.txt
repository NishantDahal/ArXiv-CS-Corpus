Towards a DSL for Perception-Based Safety Systems

This paper is an extension to an early presented programming language, called a domain specific language. This paper extends the proposed concept with new sensors and behaviours to address real-life situations. The functionality was tested in lab experiments, and an extension to the earlier concepts is proposed.
