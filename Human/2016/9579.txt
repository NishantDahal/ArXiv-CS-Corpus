An institutional approach to computational social creativity

Modelling the creativity that takes place in social settings presents a range of theoretical challenges. Mel Rhodes's classic "4Ps" of creativity, the "Person, Process, Product, and Press," offer an initial typology. Here, Rhodes's ideas are connected with Elinor Ostrom's work on the analysis of economic governance to generate several "creativity design principles." These principles frame a survey of the shared concepts that structure the contexts that support creative work. The concepts are connected to the idea of computational "tests" to foreground the relationship with standard computing practice, and to draw out specific recommendations for the further development of computational creativity culture.
