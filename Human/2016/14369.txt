The Number of Fixed Points of AND-OR Networks with Chain Topology

AND-OR networks are Boolean networks where each coordinate function is either the AND or OR logical operator. We study the number of fixed points of these Boolean networks in the case that they have a wiring diagram with chain topology. We find closed formulas for subclasses of these networks and recursive formulas in the general case. Our results allow for an effective computation of the number of fixed points in the case that the topology of the Boolean network is an open chain (finite or infinite) or a closed chain.
