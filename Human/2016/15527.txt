A Novel Boundary Matching Algorithm for Video Temporal Error Concealment

With the fast growth of communication networks, the video data transmission from these networks is extremely vulnerable. Error concealment is a technique to estimate the damaged data by employing the correctly received data at the decoder. In this paper, an efficient boundary matching algorithm for estimating damaged motion vectors (MVs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm performs error concealment for each damaged macro block (MB) according to the list of identified priority of each frame. It then uses a classic boundary matching criterion or the proposed boundary matching criterion adaptively to identify matching distortion in each boundary of candidate MB. Finally, the candidate MV with minimum distortion is selected as an MV of damaged MB and the list of priorities is updated. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves both objective and subjective qualities of reconstructed frames without any significant increase in computational cost. The PSNR for test sequences in some frames is increased about 4.7, 4.5, and 4.4 dB compared to the classic boundary matching, directional boundary matching, and directional temporal boundary matching algorithm, respectively.
