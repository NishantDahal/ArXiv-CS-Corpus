Quantitative Analysis of Desirability in User Experience

The multi-dimensional nature of user experience warrants rigorous assessment of the interactive experience in systems. User experience assessments are based on product evaluations and subsequent analysis of the collected data using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The quality of user experience assessments are dependent on the effectiveness of the techniques deployed. This paper presents the results of a quantitative analysis of desirability aspects of the user experience in a comparative product evaluation study. The data collection was conducted using 118 item Microsoft Product Reaction Cards (PRC) tool followed by data analysis based on the Surface Measure of Overall Performance (SMOP) approach. The results of this study suggest that the incorporation of SMOP as an approach for PRC data analysis derive conclusive evidence of desirability in user experience. The significance of the paper is that it presents a novel analysis method incorporating product reaction cards and surface measure of overall performance approach for an effective quantitative analysis which can be used in academic research and industrial practice.
