Scaled VIP Algorithms for Joint Dynamic Forwarding and Caching in Named Data Networks

Emerging Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architectures seek to optimally utilize both bandwidth and storage for efficient content distribution over the network. The Virtual Interest Packet (VIP) framework has been proposed to enable joint design of forwarding and caching within the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. The virtual plane of the VIP framework captures the measured demand for content objects, but does not reflect interest collapse and suppression in the NDN network. We aim to further improve the performance of the existing VIP algorithms by using a modified virtual plane where VIP counts are appropriately scaled to reflect interest suppression effects. We characterize the stability region of the modified virtual plane with VIP scaling, develop a new distributed forwarding and caching algorithm operating on the scaled VIPs, and demonstrate the throughput optimality of the scaled VIP algorithm in the virtual plane. Numerical experiments demonstrate significantly enhanced performance relative to the existing VIP algorithm, as well as a number of other baseline algorithms.
