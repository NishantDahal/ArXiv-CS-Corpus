A Canonical Model Construction for Iteration-Free PDL with Intersection

We study the axiomatisability of the iteration-free fragment of Propositional Dynamic Logic with Intersection and Tests. The combination of program composition, intersection and tests makes its proof-theory rather difficult. We develop a normal form for formulae which minimises the interaction between these operators, as well as a refined canonical model construction. From these we derive an axiom system and a proof of its strong completeness.
