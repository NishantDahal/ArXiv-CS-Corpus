Investigating Reliability Aspects of Memristor based RRAM with Reference to Write Voltage and Frequency

In this paper, we report the effect of write voltage and frequency on memristor based Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM). The above said parameters have been investigated on the linear drift model of memristor. With a variation of write voltage from 0.2V to 1.2V and a subsequent frequency modulation from 1, 2, 4, 10, 100 and 200 Hz the corresponding effects on memory window, Low Resistance State (LRS) and High Resistance State (HRS) have been reported. Thus the lifetime (τ) reliability analysis of memristor based RRAM is carried out using above results. It is found that, the HRS is independent of write voltage, whereas LRS shows dependency on write voltage and frequency. The simulation results showcase that the memristor possess higher memory window and lifetime (τ) in the higher voltage with lower frequency region, which has been attributed to the fewer data losses in the memory architecture.
