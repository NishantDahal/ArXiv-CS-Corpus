Integrated Interleaved Codes as Locally Recoverable Codes: Properties and Performance

Considerable interest has been paid in recent literature to codes combining local and global properties for erasure correction. Applications are in cloud type of implementations, in which fast recovery of a failed storage device is important, but additional protection is required in order to avoid data loss, and in RAID type of architectures, in which total device failures coexist with silent failures at the page or sector level in each device. Existing solutions to these problems require in general relatively large finite fields. The techniques of Integrated Interleaved Codes (which are closely related to Generalized Concatenated Codes) are proposed to reduce significantly the size of the finite field, and it is shown that when the parameters of these codes are judiciously chosen, their performance may be competitive with the one of codes optimizing the minimum distance.
