On the Stability of a Full-Duplex Aloha Network

This letter offers the first characterisation of the stability for full-duplex large size networks. Through stochastic geometry tools, key performance metrics like delay and maximum stable arrival rate are derived for the non saturated system and compared to a half-duplex counterpart, also accounting for imperfect self-interference cancellation. This analysis better identifies that the full-duplex advantage is prominent for sparse networks, whereas in dense topologies residual self-interference may hinder achievable gains.
