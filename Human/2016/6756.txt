Web Infrastructure to Support e-Journal Preservation (and More)

E-journal preservation systems have to ingest millions of articles each year. Ingest, especially of the "long tail" of journals from small publishers, is the largest element of their cost. Cost is the major reason that archives contain less than half the content they should. Automation is essential to minimize these costs. This paper examines the potential for automation beyond the status quo based on the API provided by CrossRef, ANSI/NISO Z39.99 ResourceSync, and the provision of typed links in publishers' HTTP response headers. These changes would not merely assist e-journal preservation and other cross-venue scholarly applications, but would help remedy the gap that research has revealed between DOIs' potential and actual benefits.
