Proving Linearizability via Branching Bisimulation

Linearizability and progress properties are key correctness notions for concurrent objects. However, model checking linearizability has suffered from the PSPACE-hardness of the trace inclusion problem. This paper proposes to exploit branching bisimulation, a fundamental semantic equivalence relation developed for process algebras which can be computed efficiently, in checking these properties. A quotient construction is provided which results in huge state space reductions. We confirm the advantages of the proposed approach on more than a dozen benchmark problems.
