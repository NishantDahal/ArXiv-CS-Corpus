Dynamic Control of Interference Limited Underlay D2D Network

Device-to-Device (D2D) communication appears as a key communication paradigm to realizing the vision of Internet of Things (IoT) into reality by supporting heterogeneous objects interconnection in a large scale network. These devices may be many types of objects with embedded intelligence and communication capabilities, e.g., smart phones, cars, or home appliances. The issue in in this type of communication is the interference to cellular communication caused by D2D communication. Thus, proper power control and resource allocation should be coordinated in D2D network to prevent excessive interference and drastic decrease in the throughput of the cellular system. In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-layer resource allocation in time-varying cellular wireless networks with D2D communication and incorporate average interference to cellular system as a quality-of-service constraint. Specifically, each D2D pair in the network injects packets to its queue, at rates chosen in order to maximize a global utility function, subject to network stability and interference constraints. The interference constraint enforces an arbitrarily low interference to the cellular system caused by D2D communication. We first obtain the stability region for the multiuser systems assuming that the nodes have full channel state information (CSI) of their neighbors. Then, we provide a joint flow control and scheduling scheme, which is proven to achieve a utility arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility. Finally, we address the consequences of practical implementation issue such as distributed scheduling by a designing algorithm, which is capable of taking advantage of diversity gain introduced by fading channels. We demonstrate the efficacy of our policies by numerical studies under various network conditions.
