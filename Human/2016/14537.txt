Joint Audio-Video Fingerprint Media Retrieval Using Rate-Coverage Optimization

In this work, we propose a joint audio-video fingerprint Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) technology for media retrieval. The problem is focused on how to balance the query accuracy and the size of fingerprint, and how to allocate the bits of the fingerprint to video frames and audio frames to achieve the best query accuracy. By constructing a novel concept called Coverage, which is highly correlated to the query accuracy, we are able to form a rate-coverage model to translate the original problem into an optimization problem that can be resolved by dynamic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses joint audio-video fingerprint ACR technology for media retrieval with a theoretical problem formulation. Experimental results indicate that compared to reference algorithms, the proposed method has up to 25% query accuracy improvement while using 60% overall bit-rates, and 25% bit-rate reduction while achieving 85% accuracy, and it significantly outperforms the solution with single audio or video source fingerprint.
