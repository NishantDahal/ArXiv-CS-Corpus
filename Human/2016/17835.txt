An Overview on Resource Allocation Techniques for Multi-User MIMO Systems

Remarkable research activities and major advances have been occurred over the past decade in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Several transmission technologies and precoding techniques have been developed in order to exploit the spatial dimension so that simultaneous transmission of independent data streams reuse the same radio resources. The achievable performance of such techniques heavily depends on the channel characteristics of the selected users, the amount of channel knowledge, and how efficiently interference is mitigated. In systems where the total number of receivers is larger than the number of total transmit antennas, user selection becomes a key approach to benefit from multiuser diversity and achieve full multiplexing gain. The overall performance of MU-MIMO systems is a complex joint multi-objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters have to be optimized, including the number of users, the number of antennas, spatial signaling, rate and power allocation, and transmission technique. The objective of this literature survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various methodologies used to approach the aforementioned joint optimization task in the downlink of MU-MIMO communication systems.
