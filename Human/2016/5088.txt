Evolutionary Projection Selection for Radon Barcodes

Recently, Radon transformation has been used to generate barcodes for tagging medical images. The under-sampled image is projected in certain directions, and each projection is binarized using a local threshold. The concatenation of the thresholded projections creates a barcode that can be used for tagging or annotating medical images. A small number of equidistant projections, e.g., 4 or 8, is generally used to generate short barcodes. However, due to the diverse nature of digital images, and since we are only working with a small number of projections (to keep the barcode short), taking equidistant projections may not be the best course of action. In this paper, we proposed to find $n$ optimal projections, whereas $n\!<\!180$, in order to increase the expressiveness of Radon barcodes. We show examples for the exhaustive search for the simple case when we attempt to find 4 best projections out of 16 equidistant projections and compare it with the evolutionary approach in order to establish the benefit of the latter when operating on a small population size as in the case of micro-DE. We randomly selected 10 different classes from IRMA dataset (14,400 x-ray images in 58 classes) and further randomly selected 5 images per class for our tests.
