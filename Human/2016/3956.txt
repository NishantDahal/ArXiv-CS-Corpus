A Theorem on Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for Bit Allocation of Scalable Coding

In the current work, we have formulated the optimal bit-allocation problem for a scalable codec of images or videos as a constrained vector-valued optimization problem and demonstrated that there can be many optimal solutions, called Pareto optimal points. In practice, the Pareto points are derived via the weighted sum scalarization approach. An important question which arises is whether all the Pareto optimal points can be derived using the scalarization approach? The present paper provides a sufficient condition on the rate-distortion function of each resolution of a scalable codec to address the above question. The result indicated that if the rate-distortion function of each resolution is strictly decreasing and convex and the Pareto points form a continuous curve, then all the optimal Pareto points can be derived by using the scalarization method.
