Orthogonal Basis Spreading Sequence for Optimal CDMA

Recently, new spreading sequences have been proposed to increase the capacity of users. In particular, the Weyl spreading sequences have the larger capacity of users than the Gold codes. This paper shows that the Weyl spreading sequences appear in a bit recovering model and they are orthogonal basis vectors. This result shows the reason why they have the large capacity and that any spreading sequence is expressed as the sum of the Weyl spreading sequences.
