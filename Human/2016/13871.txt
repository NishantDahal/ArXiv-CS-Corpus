Entwicklung eines Reputationssystems f√ºr cyber-physikalische Systeme am Beispiel des inHMotion Forschungsprojektes

Through the continued progress and advances of networking technology and also through efforts like Industry 4.0, SmartGrid, SmartCities, systems, that have been self-sustaining for the most part are now forming networked Cyber-physical Systems (CPS). Networking does not only have undoubtely benefits but also increase the often overlooked attack surface of these systems. A basic problem in information technology systems is building and sustaining trust. This work looks at the usage of reputation systems in the field of CPS and whether they could be used to assert the trustworthyness of communication partners. This is done in context of a research project inHMotion of the University of applied Sciences Munich, which is in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). A risk based analysis is performed for this project. Based on solicited threats mitigations are proposed. A possible solution might be the usage of a reputation system, which is designed and a prototype implementation for a simulation ist done. The concept of a meta reputation system, which combines different reputation systems and verification systems can achieve promising results in a simple simulation. In a concluding discussion criticism and possible improvements are given.
