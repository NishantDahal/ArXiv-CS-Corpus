Tighter Hard Instances for PPSZ

We construct uniquely satisfiable $k$-CNF formulas that are hard for the algorithm PPSZ. Firstly, we construct graph-instances on which "weak PPSZ" has savings of at most $(2 + ε) / k$; the saving of an algorithm on an input formula with $n$ variables is the largest $γ$ such that the algorithm succeeds (i.e. finds a satisfying assignment) with probability at least $2^{ - (1 - γ) n}$. Since PPSZ (both weak and strong) is known to have savings of at least $\frac{π^2 + o(1)}{6k}$, this is optimal up to the constant factor. In particular, for $k=3$, our upper bound is $2^{0.333\dots n}$, which is fairly close to the lower bound $2^{0.386\dots n}$ of Hertli [SIAM J. Comput.'14]. We also construct instances based on linear systems over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for which strong PPSZ has savings of at most $O\left(\frac{\log(k)}{k}\right)$. This is only a $\log(k)$ factor away from the optimal bound. Our constructions improve previous savings upper bound of $O\left(\frac{\log^2(k)}{k}\right)$ due to Chen et al. [SODA'13].
