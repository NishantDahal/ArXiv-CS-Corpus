Analysis of the noise in back-projection light field acquisition and its optimization

Light field reconstruction from images captured by focal plane sweeping can achieve high lateral resolution comparable to the modern camera sensor. This is impossible for the conventional micro-lenslet based light field capture systems. However, the severe defocus noise and the low depth resolution limit its applications. In this paper, we analyze the defocus noise and the depth resolution in the focal plane sweeping based light field reconstruction technique, and propose a method to reduce the defocus noise and improve the depth resolution. Both numerical and experimental results verify the proposed method.
