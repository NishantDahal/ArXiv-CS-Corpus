Assisting Drivers During Overtaking Using Car-2-Car Communication and Multi-Agent Systems

A warning system for assisting drivers during overtaking maneuvers is proposed. The system relies on Car-2-Car communication technologies and multi-agent systems. A protocol for safety overtaking is proposed based on ACL communicative acts. The mathematical model for safety overtaking used Kalman filter to minimize localization error.
