Secure Network in Business-to-Business application by using Access Control List (ACL) and Service Level Agreement (SLA)

The motivation behind this paper is to dissecting the secure network for Business to Business (B2B) application by Implementing Access Control List (ACL) and Service Level Agreement (SLA). This data provides the nature of attacks reported as external or internal attacks. This paper presents the initial finding of attacks, types of attacks and their ratio within specific time. It demonstrates the advance technique and methodology to reduce the attacks and vulnerabilities and minimize the ratio of attacks to the networks and application and keep the network secure and runs application smoothly regarding that. It also identifies the location of attacks, the reason behind the attack and the technique used in attacking. The whole field of system security is limitless and in an evolutionary stage. To comprehend the exploration being performed today, foundation learning of the web and assaults, the security is vital and in this way they are investigated. It provides the statistical analytics about various attacks and nature of attacks for acquiring the results through simulation to prove the hypothesis.
