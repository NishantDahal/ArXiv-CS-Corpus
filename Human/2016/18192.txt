Me, Myself and My Killfie: Characterizing and Preventing Selfie Deaths

Over the past couple of years, clicking and posting selfies has become a popular trend. However, since March 2014, 127 people have died and many have been injured while trying to click a selfie. Researchers have studied selfies for understanding the psychology of the authors, and understanding its effect on social media platforms. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the selfie-related casualties and infer various reasons behind these deaths. We use inferences from incidents and from our understanding of the features, we create a system to make people more aware of the dangerous situations in which these selfies are taken. We use a combination of text-based, image-based and location-based features to classify a particular selfie as dangerous or not. Our method ran on 3,155 annotated selfies collected on Twitter gave 73% accuracy. Individually the image-based features were the most informative for the prediction task. The combination of image-based and location-based features resulted in the best accuracy. We have made our code and dataset available at http://labs.precog.iiitd.edu.in/killfie.
