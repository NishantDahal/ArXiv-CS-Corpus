Rigorous Multiple-Precision Evaluation of D-Finite Functions in SageMath

We present a new open source implementation in the SageMath computer algebra system of algorithms for the numerical solution of linear ODEs with polynomial coefficients. Our code supports regular singular connection problems and provides rigorous error bounds.
