Algorithms for Visualizing Phylogenetic Networks

We study the problem of visualizing phylogenetic networks, which are extensions of the Tree of Life in biology. We use a space filling visualization method, called DAGmaps, in order to obtain clear visualizations using limited space. In this paper, we restrict our attention to galled trees and galled networks and present linear time algorithms for visualizing them as DAGmaps.
