QoS Evaluation of Heterogeneous Networks: Application-based Approach

In this paper, an application-based QoS evaluation approach for heterogeneous networks is proposed.It is possible to expand the network capacity and coverage in a dynamic fashion by applying heterogeneous wireless network architecture. However, the Quality of Service (QoS) evaluation of this type of network architecture is very challenging due to the presence of different communication technologies. Different communication technologies have different characteristics and the applications that utilize them have unique QoS requirements. Although, the communication technologies have different performance measurement parameters, the applications using these radio access networks have the same QoS requirements. As a result, it would be easier to evaluate the QoS of the access networks and the overall network configuration based on the performance of applications running on them. Using such application-based QoS evaluation approach, the heterogeneous nature of the underlying networks and the diversity of their traffic can be adequately taken into account. Through simulation studies, we show that the application performance based assessment approach facilitates better QoS management and monitoring of heterogeneous network configurations.
