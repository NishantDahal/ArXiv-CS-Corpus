Data-driven Shoulder Inverse Kinematics

This paper proposes a shoulder inverse kinematics (IK) technique. Shoulder complex is comprised of the sternum, clavicle, ribs, scapula, humerus, and four joints. The shoulder complex shows specific motion pattern, such as Scapulo humeral rhythm. As a result, if a motion of the shoulder isgenerated without the knowledge of kinesiology, it will be seen as un-natural. The proposed technique generates motion of the shoulder complex about the orientation of the upper arm by interpolating the measurement data. The shoulder IK method allows novice animators to generate natural shoulder motions easily. As a result, this technique improves the quality of character animation.
