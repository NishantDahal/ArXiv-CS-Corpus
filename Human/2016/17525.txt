Throughput analysis in networks of WLANs

This paper proposes a simple but accurate approximation to analytically model both the inter-WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks) interactions and the negative effect of collisions in networks of IEEE 802.11 WLANs. Inter-WLANs interactions are characterized using a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model where states represent the set of active WLANs at a given time. Then, the effect of collisions is considered by analyzing the local dynamics between contending WLANs at every state using the well-known IEEE 802.11 Bianchi model. Results confirm the accuracy of the presented approach.
