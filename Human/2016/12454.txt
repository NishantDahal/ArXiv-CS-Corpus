Automatic detection of moving objects in video surveillance

This work is in the field of video surveillance including motion detection. The video surveillance is one of essential techniques for automatic video analysis to extract crucial information or relevant scenes in video surveillance systems. The aim of our work is to propose solutions for the automatic detection of moving objects in real time with a surveillance camera. The detected objects are objects that have some geometric shape (circle, ellipse, square, and rectangle).
