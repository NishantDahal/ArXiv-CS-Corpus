Stronger Error Disturbance Relations for Incompatible Quantum Measurements

We formulate a new error-disturbance relation, which is free from explicit dependence upon variances in observables. This error-disturbance relation shows improvement over the one provided by the Branciard inequality and the Ozawa inequality for some initial states and for particular class of joint measurements under consideration. We also prove a modified form of Ozawa's error-disturbance relation. The later relation provides a tighter bound compared to the Ozawa and the Branciard inequalities for a small number of states.
