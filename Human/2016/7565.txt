Morphological and Embedded Computation in a Self-contained Soft Robotic Hand

We present a self-contained, soft robotic hand composed of soft pneumatic actuator modules that are equipped with strain and pressure sensing. We show how this data can be used to discern whether a grasp was successful. Co-locating sensing and embedded computation with the actuators greatly simplifies control and system integration. Equipped with a small pump, the hand is self-contained and needs only power and data supplied by a single USB connection to a PC. We demonstrate its function by grasping a variety of objects ranging from very small to large and heavy objects weighing more than the hand itself. The presented system nicely illustrates the advantages of soft robotics: low cost, low weight, and intrinsic compliance. We exploit morphological computation to simplify control, which allows successful grasping via underactuation. Grasping indeed relies on morphological computation at multiple levels, ranging from the geometry of the actuator which determines the actuator's kinematics, embedded strain sensors to measure curvature, to maximizing contact area and applied force during grasping. Morphological computation reaches its limitations, however, when objects are too bulky to self-align with the gripper or when the state of grasping is of interest. We therefore argue that efficient and reliable grasping also requires not only intrinsic compliance, but also embedded sensing and computation. In particular, we show how embedded sensing can be used to detect successful grasps and vary the force exerted onto an object based on local feedback, which is not possible using morphological computation alone.
