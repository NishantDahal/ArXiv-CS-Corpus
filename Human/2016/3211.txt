Are easily usable security libraries possible and how should experts work together to create them?

Due to non-experts also developing security relevant applications it is necessary to support them too. Some improvements in the current research may not reach or impact these developers. Nonetheless these developers use security libraries. There are findings that even their usage is not easily possible and applications are left vulnerable to supposedly treated threats. So it is important to improve the usability of the security libraries. This is itself is not straightforward because of a required maturing process for example. By getting together experts of different involved areas, especially cryptographic and API-usability experts, both of the problems can be tackled.
