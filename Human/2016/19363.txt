A Scalable Document-based Architecture for Text Analysis

Analyzing textual data is a very challenging task because of the huge volume of data generated daily. Fundamental issues in text analysis include the lack of structure in document datasets, the need for various preprocessing steps %(e.g., stem or lemma extraction, part-of-speech tagging, named entities recognition...), and performance and scaling issues. Existing text analysis architectures partly solve these issues, providing restrictive data schemas, addressing only one aspect of text preprocessing and focusing on one single task when dealing with performance optimization. %As a result, no definite solution is currently available. Thus, we propose in this paper a new generic text analysis architecture, where document structure is flexible, many preprocessing techniques are integrated and textual datasets are indexed for efficient access. We implement our conceptual architecture using both a relational and a document-oriented database. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and the superiority of the document-oriented logical and physical implementation.
