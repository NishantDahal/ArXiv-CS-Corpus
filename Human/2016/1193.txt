Fractal surfaces from simple arithmetic operations

Fractal surfaces ('patchwork quilts') are shown to arise under most general circumstances involving simple bitwise operations between real numbers. A theory is presented for all deterministic bitwise operations on a finite alphabet. It is shown that these models give rise to a roughness exponent $H$ that shapes the resulting spatial patterns, larger values of the exponent leading to coarser surfaces.
