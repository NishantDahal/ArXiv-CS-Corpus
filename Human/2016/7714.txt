Human-Data Interaction in Healthcare

In this paper, we focus on an emerging strand of IT-oriented research, namely Human-Data Interaction (HDI) and how this can be applied to healthcare. HDI regards both how humans create and use data by means of interactive systems, which can both assist and constrain them, as well as to passively collect and proactively generate data. Healthcare provides a challenging arena to test the potential of HDI to provide a new, user-centered perspective on how data work should be supported and assessed, especially in the light of the fact that data are becoming increasingly big and that many tools are now available for the lay people, including doctors and nurses, to interact with health-related data.
