Low-complexity feedback-channel-free distributed video coding using Local Rank Transform

In this paper, we propose a new feedback-channel-free Distributed Video Coding (DVC) algorithm using Local Rank Transform (LRT). The encoder computes LRT by considering selected neighborhood pixels of Wyner-Ziv frame. The ranks from the modified LRT are merged, and their positions are entropy coded and sent to the decoder. In addition, means of each block of Wyner-Ziv frame are also transmitted to assist motion estimation. Using these measurements, the decoder generates side information (SI) by implementing motion estimation and compensation in LRT domain. An iterative algorithm is executed on SI using LRT to reconstruct the Wyner-Ziv frame. Experimental results show that the coding efficiency of our codec is close to the efficiency of pixel domain distributed video coders based on Low-Density Parity Check and Accumulate (LDPCA) or turbo codes, with less encoder complexity.
