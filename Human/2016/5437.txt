A Security Evaluation Framework for U.K. E-Goverment Services Agile Software Development

This study examines the traditional approach to software development within the United Kingdom Government and the accreditation process. Initially we look at the Waterfall methodology that has been used for several years. We discuss the pros and cons of Waterfall before moving onto the Agile Scrum methodology. Agile has been adopted by the majority of Government digital departments including the Government Digital Services. Agile, despite its ability to achieve high rates of productivity organized in short, flexible, iterations, has faced security professionals disbelief when working within the U.K. Government. One of the major issues is that we develop in Agile but the accreditation process is conducted using Waterfall resulting in delays to go live dates. Taking a brief look into the accreditation process that is used within Government for I.T. systems and applications, we focus on giving the accreditor the assurance they need when developing new applications and systems. A framework has been produced by utilizing the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). This framework will allow security and Agile to work side by side and produce secure code.
