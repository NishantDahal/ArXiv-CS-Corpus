Robust AN-Aided Beamforming and Power Splitting Design for Secure MISO Cognitive Radio With SWIPT

A multiple-input single-output cognitive radio downlink network is studied with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In this network, a secondary user coexists with multiple primary users and multiple energy harvesting receivers. In order to guarantee secure communication and energy harvesting, the problem of robust secure artificial noise-aided beamforming and power splitting design is investigated under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, the transmit power minimization problem and the max-min fairness energy harvesting problem are formulated for both the bounded CSI error model and the probabilistic CSI error model. These problems are non-convex and challenging to solve. A one-dimensional search algorithm is proposed to solve these problems based on ${\cal S}\text{-Procedure} $ under the bounded CSI error model and based on Bernstein-type inequalities under the probabilistic CSI error model. It is shown that the optimal robust secure beamforming can be achieved under the bounded CSI error model, whereas a suboptimal beamforming solution can be obtained under the probabilistic CSI error model. A tradeoff is elucidated between the secrecy rate of the secondary user receiver and the energy harvested by the energy harvesting receivers under a max-min fairness criterion.
