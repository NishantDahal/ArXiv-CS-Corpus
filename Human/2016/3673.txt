Measuring cones and other thick subsets in free groups

In this paper we investigate the special automata over finite rank free groups and estimate asymptotic characteristics of sets they accept. We show how one can decompose an arbitrary regular subset of a finite rank free group into disjoint union of sets accepted by special automata or special monoids. These automata allow us to compute explicitly generating functions, $Î»-$measures and Cesaro measure of thick monoids. Also we improve the asymptotic classification of regular subsets in free groups.
