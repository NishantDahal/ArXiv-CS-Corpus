Buffer Occupancy and Delivery Reliability Tradeoffs for Epidemic Routing

To achieve end-to-end delivery in intermittently connected networks, epidemic routing is proposed for data delivery at the price of excessive buffer occupancy due to its store-and-forward nature. The ultimate goal of epidemic routing protocol design is to reduce system resource usage (e.g., buffer occupancy) while simultaneously providing data delivery with statistical guarantee. Therefore the tradeoffs between buffer occupancy and data delivery reliability are of utmost importance. In this paper we investigate the tradeoffs for two representative schemes: the global timeout scheme and the antipacket dissemination scheme that are proposed for lossy and lossless data delivery, respectively. For lossy data delivery, we show that with the suggested global timeout value, the per-node buffer occupancy only depends on the maximum tolerable packet loss rate and pairwise meeting rate. For lossless data delivery, we show that the buffer occupancy can be significantly reduced via fully antipacket dissemination. The developed tools therefore offer new insights for epidemic routing protocol designs and performance evaluations.
