On Feature based Delaunay Triangulation for Palmprint Recognition

Authentication of individuals via palmprint based biometric system is becoming very popular due to its reliability as it contains unique and stable features. In this paper, we present a novel approach for palmprint recognition and its representation. To extract the palm lines, local thresholding technique Niblack binarization algorithm is adopted. The endpoints of these lines are determined and a connection is created among them using the Delaunay triangulation thereby generating a distinct topological structure of each palmprint. Next, we extract different geometric as well as quantitative features from the triangles of the Delaunay triangulation that assist in identifying different individuals. To ensure that the proposed approach is invariant to rotation and scaling, features were made relative to topological and geometrical structure of the palmprint. The similarity of the two palmprints is computed using the weighted sum approach and compared with the k-nearest neighbor. The experimental results obtained reflect the effectiveness of the proposed approach to discriminate between different palmprint images and thus achieved a recognition rate of 90% over large databases.
