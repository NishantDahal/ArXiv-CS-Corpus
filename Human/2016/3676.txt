A Framework for Extracting and Modeling HIPAA Privacy Rules for Healthcare Applications

Some organizations use software applications to manage their customers' personal, medical, or financial information. In the United States, those software applications are obligated to preserve users' privacy and to comply with the United States federal privacy laws and regulations. To formally guarantee compliance with those regulations, it is essential to extract and model the privacy rules from the text of the law using a formal framework. In this work we propose a goal-oriented framework for modeling and extracting the privacy requirements from regulatory text using natural language processing techniques.
