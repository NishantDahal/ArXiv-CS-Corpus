Machine to Machine (M2M) Communications in Virtualized Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks

With the growing interest in the use of internet of things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M) communications have become an important networking paradigm. In this paper, with recent advances in wireless network virtualization (WNV), we propose a novel framework for M2M communications in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) with WNV. In the proposed framework, according to different applications and quality of service (QoS) requirements of vehicles, a hypervisor enables the virtualization of the physical vehicular network, which is abstracted and sliced into multiple virtual networks. Moreover, the process of resource blocks (RBs) selection and random access in each virtual vehicular network is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which can achieve the maximum reward about transmission capacity. The optimal policy for RBs selection is derived by virtue of a dynamic programming approach. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters are presented to show the performance improvement of the proposed scheme.
