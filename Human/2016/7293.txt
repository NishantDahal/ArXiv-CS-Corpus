End-to-end evaluation of research organizations

End-to-end research evaluation needs to separate out the bibliometric part of the chain from the econometric part. We first introduce the role of size-dependent and size-independent indicators in the bibliometric part of the evaluation chain. We show that performance can then be evaluated at various levels, namely a zeroth-order, a first-order or even a second-order. To complete the evaluation chain, we take up the econometric part where efficiency of the research production process is represented in terms of output and outcome productivities. Both size-dependent and size-independent terms play a crucial role to combine quantity and quality (impact) in a meaningful way. Output or outcome at the bibliometric level can be measured using zeroth, first or second-order composite indicators, and the productivity terms follow accordingly using the input to output or outcome factors.
