A Comparison of Approaches for Traffic Engineering in IP and MPLS Networks

As IP / MPLS network service providers drive for improved network efficiencies, traffic engineering is becoming increasingly important. In this article we review the approaches for traffic engineering in IP / MPLS networks and present the result of a study, which compares their performance in operational networks
