An Optimized Huffmans Coding by the method of Grouping

Data compression has become a necessity not only the in the field of communication but also in various scientific experiments. The data that is being received is more and the processing time required has also become more. A significant change in the algorithms will help to optimize the processing speed. With the invention of Technologies like IoT and in technologies like Machine Learning there is a need to compress data. For example training an Artificial Neural Network requires a lot of data that should be processed and trained in small interval of time for which compression will be very helpful. There is a need to process the data faster and quicker. In this paper we present a method that reduces the data size. This method is known as Optimized Huffmans Coding. In the Huffmans coding we encode the messages so as to reduce the data and here in the optimized Huffmans coding we compress the data to a great extent which helps in various signal processing algorithms and has advantages in many applications. Here in this paper we have presented the Optimized Huffmans Coding method for Text compression. This method but has advantages over the normal Huffmans coding. This algorithm presented here says that every letter can be grouped together and encoded which not only reduces the size but also the Huffmans Tree data that is required for decoding, hence reducing the data size. This method has huge scientific applications.
