Green Scale Research Tool for Multi-Criteria and Multi-Metric Energy Analysis Performed During the Architectural Design Process

Prevailing computational tools available to and used by architecture and engineering professionals purport to gather and present thorough and accurate perspectives of the environmental impacts associated with their contributions to the built environment. The presented research of building modeling and analysis software used by the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry reveals that many of the most heavily relied-upon industry tools are isolated in functionality, utilize incomplete models and data, and are disruptive to normative design and building optimization workflows. This paper describes the current models and tools, their primary functions and limitations, and presents our concurrent research to develop more advanced models to assess lifetime building energy consumption alongside operating energy use. A series of case studies describes the current state-of-the-art in tools and building energy analysis followed by the research models and novel design and analysis Tool that the Green Scale Research Group has developed in response. A fundamental goal of this effort is to increase the use and efficacy of building impact studies conducted by architects, engineers, and building owners and operators during the building design process.
