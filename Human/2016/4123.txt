A Mathematical Model for Signal's Energy at the Output of an Ideal DAC

The presented research work considers a mathematical model for energy of the signal at the output of an ideal DAC, in presence of sampling clock jitter. When sampling clock jitter occurs, the energy of the signal at the output of ideal DAC does not satisfies a Parseval identity. Nevertheless, an estimation of the signal energy is here shown by a direct method involving sinc functions.
