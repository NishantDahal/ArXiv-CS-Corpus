Keyboard Based Control of Four Dimensional Rotations

Aiming at applications to the scientific visualization of three dimensional simulations with time evolution, a keyboard based control method to specify rotations in four dimensions is proposed. It is known that four dimensional rotations are generally so-called double rotations, and a double rotation is a combination of simultaneously applied two simple rotations. The proposed method can specify both the simple and double rotations by single key typings of the keyboard. The method is tested in visualizations of a regular pentachoron in four dimensional space by a hyperplane slicing.
