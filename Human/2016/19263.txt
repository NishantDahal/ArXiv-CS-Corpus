Evaluation of a RGB-LED-based Emotion Display for Affective Agents

Technology has become an essential part in every aspect of our lives. However the key to a successful implementation of a technology depends on the acceptance by the general public. In order to increase the acceptance various approaches can be applied. In this paper, we will examine the human-robot emotional interaction by investigating the capabilities of a developed low-resolution RGB-LED display in the context of artificial emotions. We are focusing on four of the most representative human emotions which include happiness, anger, sadness and fear. We will work with colors and dynamic light patterns which are supposed to evoke various associations. In an experiment, the use these patterns as expressions of emotions are validated. The results of the conducted study show that some of the considered basic emotions can be recognized by human observers.
