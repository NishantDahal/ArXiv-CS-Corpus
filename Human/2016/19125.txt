Learning Non-Lambertian Object Intrinsics across ShapeNet Categories

We consider the non-Lambertian object intrinsic problem of recovering diffuse albedo, shading, and specular highlights from a single image of an object.
  We build a large-scale object intrinsics database based on existing 3D models in the ShapeNet database. Rendered with realistic environment maps, millions of synthetic images of objects and their corresponding albedo, shading, and specular ground-truth images are used to train an encoder-decoder CNN. Once trained, the network can decompose an image into the product of albedo and shading components, along with an additive specular component.
  Our CNN delivers accurate and sharp results in this classical inverse problem of computer vision, sharp details attributed to skip layer connections at corresponding resolutions from the encoder to the decoder. Benchmarked on our ShapeNet and MIT intrinsics datasets, our model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.
  We train and test our CNN on different object categories. Perhaps surprising especially from the CNN classification perspective, our intrinsics CNN generalizes very well across categories. Our analysis shows that feature learning at the encoder stage is more crucial for developing a universal representation across categories.
  We apply our synthetic data trained model to images and videos downloaded from the internet, and observe robust and realistic intrinsics results. Quality non-Lambertian intrinsics could open up many interesting applications such as image-based albedo and specular editing.
