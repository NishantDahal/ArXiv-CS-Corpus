A Survey of Memristive Threshold Logic Circuits

In this paper, we review the different memristive threshold logic (MTL) circuits that are inspired from the synaptic action of flow of neurotransmitters in the biological brain. Brain like generalisation ability and area minimisation of these threshold logic circuits aim towards crossing the Moores law boundaries at device, circuits and systems levels.Fast switching memory, signal processing, control systems, programmable logic, image processing, reconfigurable computing, and pattern recognition are identified as some of the potential applications of MTL systems. The physical realization of nanoscale devices with memristive behaviour from materials like TiO2, ferroelectrics, silicon, and polymers has accelerated research effort in these application areas inspiring the scientific community to pursue design of high speed, low cost, low power and high density neuromorphic architectures.
