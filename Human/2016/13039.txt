Smart Multihoming in Smart Shires: Mobility and Communication Management for Smart Services in Countrysides

This paper discusses on the need to focus on effective and cheap communication solutions for the deployment of smart services in countrysides. We present the main wireless technologies, software architectures and protocols that need to be exploited, such as multihop, multipath communication and mobility support through multihoming. We present Always Best Packet Switching (ABPS), an operation mode to perform network handover in a seamless way without the need to change the current network infrastructure and configuration. This is in accordance with the need of having cheap solutions that may work in a smart shire scenario. A simulation assessment confirms the effectiveness of our approach.
