Topological Interference Management with Reconfigurable Antennas

We study the symmetric degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of partially connected interference networks under linear coding strategies at transmitters without channel state information beyond topology. We assume that the receivers are equipped with reconfigurable antennas that can switch among their preset modes. In such a network setting, we characterize the class of network topologies in which half linear symmetric DoF is achievable. Moreover, we derive a general upper bound on the linear symmetric DoF for arbitrary network topologies. We also show that this upper bound is tight if the transmitters have at most two co-interferers.
