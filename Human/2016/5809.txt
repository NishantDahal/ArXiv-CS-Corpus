Computability and Analysis, a Historical Approach

The history of computability theory and and the history of analysis are surprisingly intertwined since the beginning of the twentieth century. For one, Ã‰mil Borel discussed his ideas on computable real number functions in his introduction to measure theory. On the other hand, Alan Turing had computable real numbers in mind when he introduced his now famous machine model. Here we want to focus on a particular aspect of computability and analysis, namely on computability properties of theorems from analysis. This is a topic that emerged already in early work of Turing, Specker and other pioneers of computable analysis and eventually leads us to the very recent project of classifying the computational content of theorems in the Weihrauch lattice.
