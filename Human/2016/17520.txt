Security Schemes in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks with Cognitive Radios

Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) as the basic infrastructure can facilitate applications and services of connected vehicles (CVs). Cognitive radio (CR) technology is an effective supplement and enhancement for VANETs. It can reduce the impact of deficiency of spectrum resource in VANETs. Although CR-VANETs can utilize the unused licensed spectrum effectively, the distributed nature of CR-VANETs may open a door for different attacks, such as spectrum sensing data falsification attack. In this paper, we propose a joint RSU and vehicle-based light-weighted cloud for CR-VANETs. Based on this cloud computing model, we propose a new service named Spectrum Sensing as a Service (SSaaS), which can perform a cooperative spectrum sensing in CR-VANETs with cloud computing assistance to secure the spectrum sensing procedure. As a result, a reliable service can be obtained in CR-VANETs. Simulation results show that the cloud computing in CR-VANETs can effectively reduce latency and improve the security of CR-VANETs.
