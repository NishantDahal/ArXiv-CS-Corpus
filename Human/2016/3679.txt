The Effects of Mobility on the Hit Performance of Cached D2D Networks

A device-to-device (D2D) wireless network is considered, where user devices also have the ability to cache content. In such networks, users are mobile and communication links can be spontaneously activated and dropped depending on the users' relative position. Receivers request files from transmitters, these files having a certain popularity and file-size distribution. In this work a new performance metric is introduced, namely the Service Success Probability, which captures the specificities of D2D networks. For the Poisson Point Process case for node distribution and the SNR coverage model, explicit expressions are derived. Simulations support the analytical results and explain the influence of mobility and file-size distribution on the system performance, while providing intuition on how to appropriately cache content on mobile storage space. Of particular interest is the investigation on how different file-size distributions (Exponential, Uniform, or Heavy-Tailed) influence the performance.
