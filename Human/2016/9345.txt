Using Multimedia Presentations to Improve Digital Forensic Understanding: A Pilot Study

Improving employees' understanding of digital forensic technical terms and concepts within an organisation is likely to increase the potential of successful collaboration during a cyber security incident (e.g. data breach) investigation within that organisation. In this paper, we seek to determine whether multimedia presentations, in this case videos, are an effective tool in improving a learner's technical understanding of digital forensic terms and concepts. Using the cognitive theory of multimedia learning as the underlying theoretical lens, we surveyed nine participants from the financial sector who have cyber security-related responsibilities. With the exception of one participant, the study found that the use of multimedia presentations can improve participants' understanding of technical digital forensic terms and concepts. Potential future research questions are also identified.
