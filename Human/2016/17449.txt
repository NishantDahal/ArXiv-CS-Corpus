Deep Learning Approximation for Stochastic Control Problems

Many real world stochastic control problems suffer from the "curse of dimensionality". To overcome this difficulty, we develop a deep learning approach that directly solves high-dimensional stochastic control problems based on Monte-Carlo sampling. We approximate the time-dependent controls as feedforward neural networks and stack these networks together through model dynamics. The objective function for the control problem plays the role of the loss function for the deep neural network. We test this approach using examples from the areas of optimal trading and energy storage. Our results suggest that the algorithm presented here achieves satisfactory accuracy and at the same time, can handle rather high dimensional problems.
