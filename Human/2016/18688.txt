SPARQL query processing with Apache Spark

The number of linked data sources and the size of the linked open data graph keep growing every day. As a consequence, semantic RDF services are more and more confronted to various "big data" problems. Query processing is one of them and needs to be efficiently addressed with executions over scalable, highly available and fault tolerant frameworks. Data management systems requiring these properties are rarely built from scratch but are rather designed on top of an existing cluster computing engine. In this work, we consider the processing of SPARQL queries with Apache Spark. We propose and compare five different query processing approaches based on different join execution models and Spark components. A detailed experimentation, on real-world and synthetic data sets, emphasizes that two approaches tailored for the RDF data model outperform the other ones on all major query shapes, i.e., star, snowflake, chain and hybrid.
