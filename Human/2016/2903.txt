A Statistical Block Fading Channel Model for Multiuser Massive MIMO System

This paper presents a statistical block fading channel model for multiuser massive MIMO system. The proposed channel model is evolved from correlation based stochastic channel model (CBSCM) but in addition to the properties of CBSCM, it has capability of capturing channel variations along time or frequency and along space simultaneously. It has a simplified analytical expression, still being able to simulate underlying physical phenomena which otherwise need a complex geometry based stochastic channel model (GBSCM). The channel model is verified with reported measurement data of channel for massive MIMO. Spatial determinism in channel, the basic cause of unfavorable propagation, is modeled into controlling parameters of channel model. Channel model uses only three controlling parameters; one parameter describes variation in channel along resource block (along time or frequency) and remaining two parameters describe spatial variation in channel. Modeling of simultaneous variation along time and space belongs to a very common scenario where mobility of mobile terminal and angular power distribution at base station receiver, are key parameters. Additionally, simulation results reveal the hidden advantages of spatial determinism in channel for multiuser massive MIMO.
