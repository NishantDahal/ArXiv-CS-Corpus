Query Data With Fuzzy Information In Object-Oriented Databases An Approach Interval Values

In this paper, we propose methods of handling attributive values of object classes in object oriented database with fuzzy information and uncertainty based on quantitatively semantics based hedge algebraic. In this approach we consider to attributive values (as well as methods) object class is interval values and the interval values are converted into sub interval in [0, 1] respectively. That its the fuzziness of the elements in the hedge algebra is also sub interval in [0,1]. So, we present an algorithm allows the comparison of two sub interval [0,1] helping the requirements of the query data
