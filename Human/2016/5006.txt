Balancing Data Security and Blocking Performance with Spectrum Randomization in Optical Networks

Data randomization or scrambling has been effectively used in various applications to improve the data security. In this paper, we use the idea of data randomization to proactively randomize the spectrum (re)allocation to improve connections' security. As it is well-known that random (re)allocation fragments the spectrum and thus increases blocking in elastic optical networks, we analyze the tradeoff between system performance and security. To this end, in addition to spectrum randomization, we utilize an on-demand defragmentation scheme every time a request is blocked due to the spectrum fragmentation. We model the occupancy pattern of an elastic optical link (EOL) using a multi-class continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) under the random-fit spectrum allocation method. Numerical results show that although both the blocking and security can be improved for a particular so-called randomization process (RP) arrival rate, while with the increase in RP arrival rate the connections' security improves at the cost of the increase in overall blocking.
