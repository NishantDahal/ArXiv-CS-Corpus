Programming Internet of Things, Service, and People (IoTSP) Applications

Application development for Internet of Things, Service, and People (IoTSP) is challenging because it involves dealing with the heterogeneity that exists both in Physical and Internet worlds. Second, stakeholders involved in the application development have to address issues pertaining to different life-cycles ranging from design, implementation to deployment. Given these, a critical challenge is to enable an application development for IoTSP applications with effectively and efficiently from various stakeholders. Several approaches to tackling this challenge have been proposed in the fields of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and Pervasive Computing, regarded as precursors to the modern day of IoTSP. However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the IoTSP. In view of this, we have built upon existing framework and evolved it into a framework for developing IoTSP applications, with substantial additions and enhancements in high-level modeling languages and their integration into the framework, and we present a comparative evaluation results with existing approaches. This provides the IoTSP community for further benchmarking. The evaluation is carried out on real devices exhibiting heterogeneity. Our experimental analysis and results demonstrate that our approach drastically reduces development effort for IoTSP applications compared to existing approaches.
