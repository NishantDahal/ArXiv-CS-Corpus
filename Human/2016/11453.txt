Learning Shapes by Convex Composition

We present a mathematical and algorithmic scheme for learning the principal geometric elements in an image or 3D object. We build on recent work that convexifies the basic problem of finding a combination of a small number shapes that overlap and occlude one another in such a way that they "match" a given scene as closely as possible. This paper derives general sufficient conditions under which this convex shape composition identifies a target composition. From a computational standpoint, we present two different methods for solving the associated optimization programs. The first method simply recasts the problem as a linear program, while the second uses the alternating direction method of multipliers with a series of easily computed proximal operators.
