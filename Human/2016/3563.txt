Entanglement distillation from Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger shares

We study the problem of converting a product of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states shared by subsets of several parties in an arbitrary way into GHZ states shared by every party. Our result is that if SLOCC transformations are allowed, then the best asymptotic rate is the minimum of bipartite log-ranks of the initial state. This generalizes a result by Strassen on the asymptotic subrank of the matrix multiplication tensor.
