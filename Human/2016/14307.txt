Simultaneous independent image display technique on multiple 3D objects

We propose a new system to visualize depth-dependent patterns and images on solid objects with complex geometry using multiple projectors. The system, despite consisting of conventional passive LCD projectors, is able to project different images and patterns depending on the spatial location of the object. The technique is based on the simple principle that multiple patterns projected from multiple projectors interfere constructively with each other when their patterns are projected on the same object. Previous techniques based on the same principle can only achieve 1) low resolution volume colorization or 2) high resolution images but only on a limited number of flat planes. In this paper, we discretize a 3D object into a number of 3D points so that high resolution images can be projected onto the complex shapes. We also propose a dynamic ranges expansion technique as well as an efficient optimization procedure based on epipolar constraints.
  Such technique can be used to the extend projection mapping to have spatial dependency, which is desirable for practical applications. We also demonstrate the system potential as a visual instructor for object placement and assembling. Experiments prove the effectiveness of our method.
