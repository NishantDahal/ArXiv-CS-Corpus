Spectrum Sharing Between A Surveillance Radar and Secondary Wi-Fi Networks

Co-existence between unlicensed networks that share spectrum spatio-temporally with terrestrial (e.g. Air Traffic Control) and shipborne radars in 3-GHz band is attracting significant interest. Similar to every primary-secondary coexistence scenario, interference from unlicensed devices to a primary receiver must be within acceptable bounds. In this work, we formulate the spectrum sharing problem between a pulsed, search radar (primary) and 802.11 WLAN as the secondary. We compute the protection region for such a search radar for a) a single secondary user (initially) as well as b) a random spatial distribution of multiple secondary users. Furthermore, we also analyze the interference to the WiFi devices from the radar's transmissions to estimate the impact on achievable WLAN throughput as a function of distance to the primary radar.
