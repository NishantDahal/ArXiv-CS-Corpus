Asymptotic bounds on the globally optimal positions of orthogonal stiffeners for rectangular plates in elastostatic bending

The present paper treats the problem of finding the asymptotic bounds for the globally optimal locations of orthogonal stiffeners minimizing the compliance of a rectangular plate in elastostatic bending. The essence of the paper is the utilization of a method of analysis of orthogonally stiffened rectangular plates first presented by Mazurkiewicz in 1962, and obtained herein in a closed form for several special cases in the approximation of stiffeners having zero torsional rigidity. Asymptotic expansions of the expressions for the deflection field of a stiffened plate are used to derive limit-case globally optimal stiffening layouts for highly flexible and highly rigid stiffeners. A central result obtained in this work is an analytical proof of the fact that an array of flexible enough orthogonal stiffeners of any number, stiffening a simply-supported rectangular plate subjected to any lateral loading, is best to be put in the form of exactly two orthogonal stiffeners, one in each direction.
