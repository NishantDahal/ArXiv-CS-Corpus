Mobile and Residential INEA Wi-Fi Hotspot Network

Since 2012 INEA has been developing and expanding the network of IEEE 802.11 compliant Wi-Fi hotspots (access points) located across the Greater Poland region. This network consists of 330 mobile (vehicular) access points carried by public buses and trams and over 20,000 fixed residential hotspots distributed throughout the homes of INEA customers to provide Internet access via the "community Wi-Fi" service. Therefore, this paper is aimed at sharing the insights gathered by INEA throughout 4 years of experience in providing hotspot-based Internet access. The emphasis is put on daily and hourly trends in order to evaluate user experience, to determine key patterns, and to investigate the influences such as public transportation trends, user location and mobility, as well as, radio frequency noise and interference.
