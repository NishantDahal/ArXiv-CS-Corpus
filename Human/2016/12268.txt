A Perceptual Aesthetics Measure for 3D Shapes

While the problem of image aesthetics has been well explored, the study of 3D shape aesthetics has focused on specific manually defined features. In this paper, we learn an aesthetics measure for 3D shapes autonomously from raw voxel data and without manually-crafted features by leveraging the strength of deep learning. We collect data from humans on their aesthetics preferences for various 3D shape classes. We take a deep convolutional 3D shape ranking approach to compute a measure that gives an aesthetics score for a 3D shape. We demonstrate our approach with various types of shapes and for applications such as aesthetics-based visualization, search, and scene composition.
