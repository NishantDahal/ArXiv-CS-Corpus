HYPERgeometric functions DIfferential REduction: Mathematica-based packages for the differential reduction of generalizedhypergeometric functions: Fc hypergeometric function of three variables

We present a further extension of the HYPERDIRE project, which is devoted to the creation of a set of Mathematica-based program packages for manipulations with Horn-type hypergeometric functions on the basis of differential equations. Specifically, we present the implementation of the differential reduction for the Lauricella function $F_C$ of three variables.
