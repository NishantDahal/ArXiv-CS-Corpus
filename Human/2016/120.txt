Gondola: a Parametric Robot Infrastructure for Repeatable Mobile Experiments

When deploying a testbed infrastructure for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), one of the most challenging feature is to provide repeatable mobility. Wheeled robots, usually employed for such tasks, strive to adapt to the wide range of environments where WSNs are deployed, from chaotic office spaces to potato fields in the farmland. For this reson, these robot systems often require expensive customization steps that, for example, adapt their localization and navigation system. To avoid these issues, in this paper we present the design of Gondola, a parametric robot infrastructure based on pulling wires, rather than wheels, that avoids the most common problems of wheeled robot and easily adapts to many WSN's scenarios. Different from wheeled robots, wich movements are constrained on a 2-dimensional plane, Gondola can easily move in 3-dimensional spaces with no need of a complex localization system and an accuracy that is comparable with off-the-shelf wheeled robots.
