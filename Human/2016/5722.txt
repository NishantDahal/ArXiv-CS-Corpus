Approaching Optimal Centralized Scheduling with CSMA-based Random Access over Fading Channels

Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) based distributed algorithms can attain the largest capacity region as the centralized Max-Weight policy does. Despite their capability of achieving throughput-optimality, these algorithms can either incur large delay and have large complexity or only operate over non-fading channels. In this letter, by assuming arbitrary back-off time we first propose a fully distributed randomized algorithm whose performance can be pushed to the performance of the centralized Max-Weight policy not only in terms of throughput but also in terms of delay for completely-connected interference networks with fading channels. Then, inspired by the proposed algorithm we introduce an implementable distributed algorithm for practical networks with a reservation scheme. We show that the proposed practical algorithm can still achieve the performance of the centralized Max-Weight policy.
