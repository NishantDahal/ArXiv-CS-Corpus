Decomposition and Analysis of Technological domains for better understanding of Technological Structure

Patents represent one of the most complete sources of information related to technological change. This paper presents three months of research on U.S. patents in the field of patent analysis. The methodology consists of using search terms to locate the most representative international and US patent classes and determines the overlap of those classes to arrive at the final set of patents and using the prediction model developed by Benson and Magee to calculate the technological improvement rate for the technological domains. My research focused on the Biochemical Pharmacology technological area and selecting relevant patents for technological domains and sub-domains within this area. The goal is to better understand structure of technology domain and understand how fast the domains and their sub-domains progress. The method I used is developed by Benson and Magee which is called the Classification Overlap Method1, it provides a reliable and largely automated way to break the patent database into understandable technological domains where progress can be measured.
