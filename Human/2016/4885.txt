Comments on "Characteristic matrix of covering and its application to Boolean matrix decomposition[Information Sciences 263(1), 186-197, 2014]"

In this note, we show some improvements for Theorem 7 and Example 8 in Shiping Wang[Information Sciences 263(1), 186-197, 2014]. Concretely, we study further the sixth lower and upper approximations of sets for covering approximation spaces. Furthermore, we present the sixth dual lower and upper approximations of sets for covering approximation spaces. We also construct the sixth dual lower and upper approximations of sets from the view of matrix. Throughout, we use the same notations as Shiping Wang[Information Sciences 263(1), 186-197, 2014].
