Breakout: An Open Measurement and Intervention Tool for Distributed Peer Learning Groups

We present Breakout, a group interaction platform for online courses that enables the creation and measurement of face-to-face peer learning groups in online settings. Breakout is designed to help students easily engage in synchronous, video breakout session based peer learning in settings that otherwise force students to rely on asynchronous text-based communication. The platform also offers data collection and intervention tools for studying the communication patterns inherent in online learning environments. The goals of the system are twofold: to enhance student engagement in online learning settings and to create a platform for research into the relationship between distributed group interaction patterns and learning outcomes.
