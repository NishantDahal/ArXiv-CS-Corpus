Benchmarking OODBs with a Generic Tool

We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (OCB: the Object Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of Object-Oriented Data-bases (OODBs), and more specifically the performances of clustering policies within OODBs. OCB is generic because its sample database may be customized to fit any of the databases in-troduced by the main existing benchmarks, e.g., OO1 (Object Operation 1) or OO7. The first version of OCB was purposely clustering-oriented due to a clustering-oriented workload, but OCB has been thoroughly extended to be able to suit other purposes. Eventually, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been validated through two implementations: one within the O2 OODB and another one within the Texas persistent object store. The perfor-mances of a specific clustering policy called DSTC (Dynamic, Statistical, Tunable Clustering) have also been evaluated with OCB.
