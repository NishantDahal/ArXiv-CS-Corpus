Almost Tight Bounds for Eliminating Depth Cycles in Three Dimensions

Given $n$ non-vertical lines in 3-space, their vertical depth (above/below) relation can contain cycles. We show that the lines can be cut into $O(n^{3/2}\mathop{\mathrm{polylog}} n)$ pieces, such that the depth relation among these pieces is now a proper partial order. This bound is nearly tight in the worst case.
  Previous results on this topic could only handle restricted cases of the problem (such as handling only triangular cycles, by Aronov, Koltun, and Sharir (2005), or only cycles in grid-like patterns, by Chazelle et al. (1992)), and the bounds were considerably weaker---much closer to the trivial quadratic bound.
  Our proof uses a recent variant of the polynomial partitioning technique, due to Guth, and some simple tools from algebraic geometry. It is much more straightforward than the previous "purely combinatorial" methods.
  Our technique can be extended to eliminating all cycles in the depth relation among segments, and among constant-degree algebraic arcs. We hope that a suitable extension of this technique could be used to handle the much more difficult case of pairwise-disjoint triangles.
  We also discuss several algorithms for constructing a small set of cuts so as to eliminate all depth-relation cycles among the lines (minimizing such a set, for the case of line segments, is known to be NP-complete). The performance of these algorithms improves due to our new bound, but, so far, none of them both (a) produce close to $n^{3/2}$ cuts, and (b) run in time close to $n^{3/2}$, in the worst case.
  Our results almost completely settle a 35-year-old open problem in computational geometry, motivated by hidden-surface removal in computer graphics.
