A Method to Support Difficult Re-finding Tasks

Re-finding electronic documents from a personal computer is a frequent demand to users. In a simple re-finding task, people can use many methods to retrieve a document, such as navigating directly to the document's folder, searching with a desktop search engine, or checking the Recent Files List. However, when encountering a difficult re-finding task, people usually cannot remember the attributes used by conventional re-finding methods, such as file path, file name, keywords etc., the re-finding would fail. We propose a new method to support difficult re-finding tasks. When a user is reading a document, we collect all kinds of possible memory pieces of the user about the document, such as number of pages, number of images, number of math formulas, cumulative reading time, reading frequency, printing experiences etc. If the user wants to re-find a document later, we use these collected attributes to filter out the target document. To alleviate the user's cognitive burden, we use a question and answer wizard interface and provide recommendations to the answers for the user, the recommendations are generated by analyzing the collected attributes of each document and the user's experiences about them.
