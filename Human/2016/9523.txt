Fog Data: Enhancing Telehealth Big Data Through Fog Computing

The size of multi-modal, heterogeneous data collected through various sensors is growing exponentially. It demands intelligent data reduction, data mining and analytics at edge devices. Data compression can reduce the network bandwidth and transmission power consumed by edge devices. This paper proposes, validates and evaluates Fog Data, a service-oriented architecture for Fog computing. The center piece of the proposed architecture is a low power embedded computer that carries out data mining and data analytics on raw data collected from various wearable sensors used for telehealth applications. The embedded computer collects the sensed data as time series, analyzes it, and finds similar patterns present. Patterns are stored, and unique patterns are transmited. Also, the embedded computer extracts clinically relevant information that is sent to the cloud. A working prototype of the proposed architecture was built and used to carry out case studies on telehealth big data applications. Specifically, our case studies used the data from the sensors worn by patients with either speech motor disorders or cardiovascular problems. We implemented and evaluated both generic and application specific data mining techniques to show orders of magnitude data reduction and hence transmission power savings. Quantitative evaluations were conducted for comparing various data mining techniques and standard data compression techniques. The obtained results showed substantial improvement in system efficiency using the Fog Data architecture.
