Complexity Classes and Completeness in Algebraic Geometry

We study the computational complexity of sequences of projective varieties. We define analogues of the complexity classes P and NP for these and prove the NP-completeness of a sequence called the universal circuit resultant. This is the first family of compact spaces shown to be NP-complete in a geometric setting.
