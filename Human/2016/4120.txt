Random Access Protocol for Massive MIMO: Strongest-User Collision Resolution (SUCR)

Wireless networks with many antennas at the base stations and multiplexing of many users, known as Massive MIMO systems, are key to handle the rapid growth of data traffic. As the number of users increases, the random access in contemporary networks will be flooded by user collisions. In this paper, we propose a reengineered random access protocol, coined strongest-user collision resolution (SUCR). It exploits the channel hardening feature of Massive MIMO channels to enable each user to detect collisions, determine how strong the contenders' channels are, and only keep transmitting if it has the strongest channel gain. The proposed SUCR protocol can quickly and distributively resolve the vast majority of all pilot collisions.
