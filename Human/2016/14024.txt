Stacked-VLAN-Based Modeling of Hybrid ISP Traffic Control Schemes and Service Plans Exploiting Excess Bandwidth in Shared Access Networks

The current practice of shaping subscriber traffic using a token bucket filter by Internet service providers may result in a severe waste of network resources in shared access networks; except for a short period of time proportional to the size of a token bucket, it cannot allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers even when there are only a few active subscribers. To better utilize the network resources in shared access networks, therefore, we recently proposed and analyzed the performance of access traffic control schemes, which can allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers proportional to their token generation rates. Also, to exploit the excess bandwidth allocation enabled by the proposed traffic control schemes, we have been studying flexible yet practical service plans under a hybrid traffic control architecture, which are attractive to both an Internet service provider and its subscribers in terms of revenue and quality of service. In this paper we report the current status of our modeling of the hybrid traffic control schemes and service plans with OMNeT++/INET-HNRL based on IEEE standard 802.1Q stacked VLANs.
