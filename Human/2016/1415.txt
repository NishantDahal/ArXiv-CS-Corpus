On distances, paths and connections for hyperspectral image segmentation

The present paper introduces the $η$ and η connections in order to add regional information on $λ$-flat zones, which only take into account a local information. A top-down approach is considered. First $λ$-flat zones are built in a way leading to a sub-segmentation. Then a finer segmentation is obtained by computing $η$-bounded regions and $μ$-geodesic balls inside the $λ$-flat zones. The proposed algorithms for the construction of new partitions are based on queues with an ordered selection of seeds using the cumulative distance. $η$-bounded regions offers a control on the variations of amplitude in the class from a point, called center, and $μ$-geodesic balls controls the "size" of the class. These results are applied to hyperspectral images.
