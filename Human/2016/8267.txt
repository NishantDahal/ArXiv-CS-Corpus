On the Statistical Model of Source Localization based on Range Difference Measurements

In this work we study the statistical model of source localization based on Range Difference measurements. We investigate the case of planar localization of a source using a minimal configuration of three non aligned receivers. Our analysis is based on a previous work of the same authors concerning the localization in a noiseless scenario. As the set of feasible measurements is a semialgebraic variety, this investigation makes use of techniques from Algebraic Statistics and Information Geometry.
