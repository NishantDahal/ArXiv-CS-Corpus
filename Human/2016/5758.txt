Fuzzy Commitment Scheme based on Reed Solomon Codes

The conventional commitment scheme requires both commitment string and a valid key for the sender to verify his commitment. Differ from the conventional commitment scheme; fuzzy commitment scheme accepts the key that is similar to the original key. The new opening key, not identical to the original key, differs from the initial key in some suitable metrics. The fuzziness in the fuzzy commitment scheme tolerate small amount of corruptions. The fuzzy commitment scheme based on the cryptographic hash functions suffers security imperfections. Thus, this paper combines the fuzzy commitment scheme with the Reed Solomon error correction codes, which are capable of correcting certain number of errors. As a result, Reed Solomon code proves better alternative for fuzzy commitment scheme than hash functions, as the Reed Solomon codes are more secure than the hashing techniques. Moreover, the Fuzzy Commitment Scheme based on Reed Solomon codes provides security at two levels that making it suitable for securing data. This paper explore the efficiency of executing fuzzy commitment scheme in conjunction with Reed Solomon code as a novel better alternative to the conventional commitment scheme.
