In this study, the historical roots of tribology are investigated using a newly developed scientometric method called Referenced Publication Years Spectroscopy. The study is based on cited references in tribology research publications. The Science Citation Index Expanded is used as data source. The results show that RPYS has the potential to identify the important publications : Most of the publications which have been identified in this study as highly cited (referenced) publications are landmark publications in the field of tribology.
