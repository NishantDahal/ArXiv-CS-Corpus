Caching Strategies for Information Centric Networking: Opportunities and Challenges

Internet usage has shifted from host-centric end-to-end communication to a content-centric approach mainly used for content delivery. Information Centric Networking (ICN) was proposed as a promising novel content delivery architecture. ICN includes in-network caching features at every node which has a major impact on content retrieval. For instance, the ICN efficiency depends drastically on the management of the caching resources. The management of caching resources is achieved with caching strategies. Caching strategies decide what, where and when content is stored in the network. In this paper, we revisit the recent technical contributions on caching strategies, we compare them and discuss opportunities and challenges for improving content delivery in the upcoming years.
