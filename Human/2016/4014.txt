Streaming PCA: Matching Matrix Bernstein and Near-Optimal Finite Sample Guarantees for Oja's Algorithm

This work provides improved guarantees for streaming principle component analysis (PCA). Given $A_1, \ldots, A_n\in \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ sampled independently from distributions satisfying $\mathbb{E}[A_i] = Σ$ for $Σ\succeq \mathbf{0}$, this work provides an $O(d)$-space linear-time single-pass streaming algorithm for estimating the top eigenvector of $Σ$. The algorithm nearly matches (and in certain cases improves upon) the accuracy obtained by the standard batch method that computes top eigenvector of the empirical covariance $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in [n]} A_i$ as analyzed by the matrix Bernstein inequality. Moreover, to achieve constant accuracy, our algorithm improves upon the best previous known sample complexities of streaming algorithms by either a multiplicative factor of $O(d)$ or $1/\mathrm{gap}$ where $\mathrm{gap}$ is the relative distance between the top two eigenvalues of $Σ$.
  These results are achieved through a novel analysis of the classic Oja's algorithm, one of the oldest and most popular algorithms for streaming PCA. In particular, this work shows that simply picking a random initial point $w_0$ and applying the update rule $w_{i + 1} = w_i + η_i A_i w_i$ suffices to accurately estimate the top eigenvector, with a suitable choice of $η_i$. We believe our result sheds light on how to efficiently perform streaming PCA both in theory and in practice and we hope that our analysis may serve as the basis for analyzing many variants and extensions of streaming PCA.
