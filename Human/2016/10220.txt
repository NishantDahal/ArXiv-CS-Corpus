Satisfiability Checking meets Symbolic Computation (Project Paper)

Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking are two research areas, both having their individual scientific focus but sharing also common interests in the development, implementation and application of decision procedures for arithmetic theories. Despite their commonalities, the two communities are rather weakly connected. The aim of our newly accepted SC-square project (H2020-FETOPEN-CSA) is to strengthen the connection between these communities by creating common platforms, initiating interaction and exchange, identifying common challenges, and developing a common roadmap from theory along the way to tools and (industrial) applications. In this paper we report on the aims and on the first activities of this project, and formalise some relevant challenges for the unified SC-square community.
