The Effect of ICT Self-Discipline in the Workplace

The ubiquity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in work settings has changed the way employees behave. ICTs such as smartphones, email and social media makes employees more connected than has ever been possible. The degree of ICT connectivity can create a positive as well as a negative impact on employees' productivity. In this context, the notion of ICT self-discipline - an individual's ability to control their behaviours towards ICTs - becomes pivotal in the process of managing ICT connectivity. This follow-on study reports the results of an online survey of 443 to New Zealand professionals regarding the influence of ICT self-discipline on the relationship between ICT connectivity and employee productivity. Findings indicated that the impact of ICT self-discipline varies depending on the organisation and industry an employee works in. Insights and recommendations for future research are shared in this paper. Findings from this study contribute to IS research and practice.
