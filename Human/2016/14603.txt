An Error Covariance Splitting Technique for Multi-User MIMO Interference Environment

This paper investigates an error covariance matrix splitting technique for multiuser multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) interference downlink channel. Most of the related work has thus far considered the traditional error covariance matrix which has not been well-shaped for maximizing the system capacity. Thus, we split and propose a new iterative error covariance matrix to mitigate the system error and maximize the system capacity in this paper. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed method is strictly better than the traditional method.
