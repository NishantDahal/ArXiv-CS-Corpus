Functional Augmented State Transfer (FAST) Architecture for Computationally Intensive Network Applications

We describe a novel architecture that combines the simplicity of RESTful architecture with the power of functional programming for delivering web-services. Although, RESTful architecture has been quite useful in simplifying the development of scalable systems, it is not suited for all types of network applications. Our architecture improves upon the RESTful architecture to provide scalable framework for computationally intensive network applications. The proposed architecture is ideal for applications that involve data management and data analysis/calculations on data. Data analytics and financial calculations are two areas where the architecture can be applied efficiently.
