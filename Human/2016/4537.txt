Improved IKE Protocol Design Based On PKI/ECC

This Paper proposes an ECDH key exchange method and an ECsig Digital Signature Authentication method based on group with Koblits curve, man-in-the-middle attack prevention method for SA payload and initiator identification payload to design high intensity IKE that can be implemented in portable devices.
