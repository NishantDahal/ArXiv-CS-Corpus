Dynamic Group Behaviors for Interactive Crowd Simulation

We present a new algorithm to simulate dynamic group behaviors for interactive multi-agent crowd simulation. Our approach is general and makes no assumption about the environment, shape, or size of the groups. We use the least effort principle to perform coherent group navigation and present efficient inter-group and intra-group maintenance techniques. We extend the reciprocal collision avoidance scheme to perform agent-group and group-group collision avoidance that can generate collision-free as well as coherent and trajectories. The additional overhead of dynamic group simulation is relatively small. We highlight its interactive performance on complex scenarios with hundreds of agents and compare the trajectory behaviors with real-world videos.
