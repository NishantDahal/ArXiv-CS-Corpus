On the Non-existence of certain classes of generalized bent functions

We obtain new non-existence results of generalized bent functions from \ZZ^n_q to \ZZ_q (called type [n,q]). The first case is a class of types where q=2p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}. The second case contains two types [1 <= n <= 3, 2 * 31^e]$ and [1 <= n <= 7,2 * 151^e].
