ABRA: Approximating Betweenness Centrality in Static and Dynamic Graphs with Rademacher Averages

We present ABRA, a suite of algorithms that compute and maintain probabilistically-guaranteed, high-quality, approximations of the betweenness centrality of all nodes (or edges) on both static and fully dynamic graphs. Our algorithms rely on random sampling and their analysis leverages on Rademacher averages and pseudodimension, fundamental concepts from statistical learning theory. To our knowledge, this is the first application of these concepts to the field of graph analysis. The results of our experimental evaluation show that our approach is much faster than exact methods, and vastly outperforms, in both speed and number of samples, current state-of-the-art algorithms with the same quality guarantees.
