MOMOS-MT: Mobile Monophonic System for Music Transcription

Music holds a significant cultural role in social identity and in the encouragement of socialization. Technology, by the destruction of physical and cultural distance, has lead to many changes in musical themes and the complete loss of forms. Yet, it also allows for the preservation and distribution of music from societies without a history of written sheet music. This paper presents early work on a tool for musicians and ethnomusicologists to transcribe sheet music from monophonic voiced pieces for preservation and distribution. Using FFT, the system detects the pitch frequencies, also other methods detect note durations, tempo, time signatures and generates sheet music. The final system is able to be used in mobile platforms allowing the user to take recordings and produce sheet music in situ to a performance.
