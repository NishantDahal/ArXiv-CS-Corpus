Saliency Detection combining Multi-layer Integration algorithm with background prior and energy function

In this paper, we propose an improved mechanism for saliency detection. Firstly,based on a neoteric background prior selecting four corners of an image as background,we use color and spatial contrast with each superpixel to obtain a salinecy map(CBP). Inspired by reverse-measurement methods to improve the accuracy of measurement in Engineering,we employ the Objectness labels as foreground prior based on part of information of CBP to construct a map(OFP).Further,an original energy function is applied to optimize both of them respectively and a single-layer saliency map(SLP)is formed by merging the above twos.Finally,to deal with the scale problem,we obtain our multi-layer map(MLP) by presenting an integration algorithm to take advantage of multiple saliency maps. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithm.
