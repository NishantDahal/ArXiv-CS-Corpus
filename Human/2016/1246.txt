The Minimal and Maximal Sensitivity of the Simplified Weighted Sum Function

Sensitivity is an important complexity measure of Boolean functions. In this paper we present properties of the minimal and maximal sensitivity of the simplified weighted sum function. A simple close formula of the minimal sensitivity of the simplified weighted sum function is obtained. A phenomenon is exhibited that the minimal sensitivity of the weighted sum function is indeed an indicator of large primes, that is, for large prime number p, the minimal sensitivity of the weighted sum function is always equal to one.
