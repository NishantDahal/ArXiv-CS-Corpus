EDCC 2015 - Fast Abstracts & Student Forum Proceedings

Fast Abstracts are short presentations of work in progress or opinion pieces and aim to serve as a rapid and flexible mechanism to (i) Report on current work that may or may not be complete; (ii) Introduce new ideas to the community; (iii) State positions on controversial issues or open problems.
  On the other hand, the goal of the Student Forum is to encourage students to attend EDCC and present their work, exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners, and get early feedback on their research efforts.
