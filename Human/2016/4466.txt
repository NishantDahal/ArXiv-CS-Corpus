Analyse des rôles dans les communautés virtuelles : définitions et premières expérimentations sur IMDb

Role analysis in online communities allows us to understand and predict users behavior. Though several approaches have been followed, there is still lack of generalization of their methods and their results. In this paper, we discuss about the ground theory of roles and search for a consistent and computable definition that allows the automatic detection of roles played by users in forum threads on the internet. We analyze the web site IMDb to illustrate the discussion.
