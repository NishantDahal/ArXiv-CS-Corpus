Towards Programmable Network Dynamics: A Chemistry-Inspired Abstraction for Hardware Design

Chemical algorithms are statistical algorithms described and represented as chemical reaction networks. They are particularly attractive for traffic shaping and general control of network dynamics; they are analytically tractable, they reinforce a strict state-to-dynamics relationship, they have configurable stability properties, and they are directly implemented in state-space using a high-level (graphical) representation.
  In this paper, we present a direct implementation of chemical algorithms on FPGA hardware. Besides substantially improving performance, we have achieved hardware-level programmability and re-configurability of these algorithms at runtime (not interrupting servicing) and in realtime (with sub-second latency). This opens an interesting perspective for expanding the currently limited scope of software defined networking and network virtualisation solutions, to include programmable control of network dynamics.
