Energy Efficiency in Multicast Multihop D2D Networks

As the demand of mobile devices (MDs) for data services is explosively increasing, traditional offloading in the cellular networks is facing the contradiction of energy efficiency and quality of service. Device-to-device (D2D) communication is considered as an effective solution. This work investigates a scenario where the MDs have the same demand for common content and they cooperate to deliver it using multicast multihop relaying. We focus on the problem of total power minimization by grouping the MDs in multihop D2D networks, while maintaining the minimum rate requirement of each MD. As the problem is shown to be NP-complete and the optimal solution can not be found efficiently, two greedy algorithms are proposed to solve this problem in polynomial time. Simulation results demonstrate that lots of power can be saved in the content delivery situation using multihop D2D communication, and the proposed algorithms are suitable for different situations with different advantages.
