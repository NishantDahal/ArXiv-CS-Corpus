New Sufficient Conditions for Multiple-Access Channel with Correlated Sources

The problem of three-user Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) with correlated sources is investigated. An extension to the Cover-El Gamal-Salehi (CES) scheme is introduced. We use a combination of this scheme with linear codes and propose a new coding strategy. We derive new sufficient conditions to transmit correlated sources reliably. We consider an example of three-user MAC with binary inputs. Using this example, we show strict improvements over the CES scheme.
