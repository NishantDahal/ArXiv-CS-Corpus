WeBrowse: Mining HTTP logs online for network-based content recommendation

A powerful means to help users discover new content in the overwhelming amount of information available today is sharing in online communities such as social networks or crowdsourced platforms. This means comes short in the case of what we call communities of a place: people who study, live or work at the same place. Such people often share common interests but either do not know each other or fail to actively engage in submitting and relaying information. To counter this effect, we propose passive crowdsourced content discovery, an approach that leverages the passive observation of web-clicks as an indication of users' interest in a piece of content. We design, implement, and evaluate WeBrowse , a passive crowdsourced system which requires no active user engagement to promote interesting content to users of a community of a place. Instead, it extracts the URLs users visit from traffic traversing a network link to identify popular and interesting pieces of information. We first prototype WeBrowse and evaluate it using both ground-truths and real traces from a large European Internet Service Provider. Then, we deploy WeBrowse in a campus of 15,000 users, and in a neighborhood. Evaluation based on our deployments shows the feasibility of our approach. The majority of WeBrowse's users welcome the quality of content it promotes. Finally, our analysis of popular topics across different communities confirms that users in the same community of a place share common interests, compared to users from different communities, thus confirming the promise of WeBrowse's approach.
