Cooperative Repair of Multiple Node Failures in Distributed Storage Systems

Cooperative regenerating codes are designed for repairing multiple node failures in distributed storage systems. In contrast to the original repair model of regenerating codes, which are for the repair of single node failure, data exchange among the new nodes is enabled. It is known that further reduction in repair bandwidth is possible with cooperative repair. Currently in the literature, we have an explicit construction of exact-repair cooperative code achieving all parameters corresponding to the minimum-bandwidth point. We give a slightly generalized and more flexible version of this cooperative regenerating code in this paper. For minimum-storage regeneration with cooperation, we present an explicit code construction which can jointly repair any number of systematic storage nodes.
