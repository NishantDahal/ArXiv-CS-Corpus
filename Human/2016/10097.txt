Computational complexity of solving polynomial differential equations over unbounded domains with non-rational coefficients

In this note, we extend the result of \cite{PoulyG16} about the complexity of solving polynomial differential equations over unbounded domains to work with non-rational input. In order to deal with arbitrary input, we phrase the result in framework of Conputable Analysis \cite{Ko91}. As a side result, we also get a uniform result about complexity of the operator, and not just about the solution.
