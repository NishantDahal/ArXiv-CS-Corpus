Community structure and interaction dynamics through the lens of quotes

This is the first work investigating community structure and interaction dynamics through the lens of quotes in online discussion forums. We examine four forums of different size, language, and topic. Quote usage, which is surprisingly consistent over time and users, appears to have an important role in aiding intra-thread navigation, and uncovers a hidden "social" structure in communities otherwise lacking all trappings (from friends and followers to reputations) of today's social networks.
