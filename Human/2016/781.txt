Grafalgo - A Library of Graph Algorithms and Supporting Data Structures (revised)

This report provides an (updated) overview of {\sl Grafalgo}, an open-source library of graph algorithms and the data structures used to implement them. The programs in this library were originally written to support a graduate class in advanced data structures and algorithms at Washington University. Because the code's primary purpose was pedagogical, it was written to be as straightforward as possible, while still being highly efficient. Grafalgo is implemented in C++ and incorporates some features of C++11.
  The library is available on an open-source basis and may be downloaded from https://code.google.com/p/grafalgo/. Source code documentation is at www.arl.wustl.edu/\textasciitilde jst/doc/grafalgo. While not designed as production code, the library is suitable for use in larger systems, so long as its limitations are understood. The readability of the code also makes it relatively straightforward to extend it for other purposes.
