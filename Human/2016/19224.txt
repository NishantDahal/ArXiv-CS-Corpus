Development of UMLS Based Health Care Web Services for Android Platform

In this fast developing world of information, the amount of medical knowledge is rising at an exponential level. The UMLS (Unified Medical Language Systems), is rich knowledge base consisting files and software that provides many health and biomedical vocabularies and standards. A Web service is a web solution to facilitate machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Few UMLS web services are currently available for portable devices, but most of them lack in efficiency and performance. It is proposed to develop Android-based web services for healthcare systems underlying rich knowledge source of UMLS. The experimental evaluation was made to analyse the efficiency and performance effect with and without using the designed prototype. The understand-ability and interaction with the prototype were greater than those who used the alternate sources to obtain the answers to their questions. The overall performance indicates that the system is convenient and easy to use. The result of the evaluation clearly proved that designed system retrieves all the pertinent information better than syntactic searches.
