Application of Case-Based Teaching and Learning in Compiler Design Course

Compiler design is a course that discusses ideas used in construction of programming language compilers. Students learn how a program written in high level programming language and designed for humans understanding is systematically converted into low level assembly language understood by machines. We propose and implement a Case-based and Project-based Learning environment for teaching important Compiler design concepts (CPLC) to B.Tech third year students of a Delhi University (India) college. A case is a text that describes a real-life situation providing information but not solution. Previous research shows that case-based teaching helps students to apply the principles discussed in the class for solving complex practical problems. We divide one main project into sub-projects to give to students in order to enhance their practical experience of designing a compiler. To measure the effectiveness of case-based discussions, students complete a survey on their perceptions of benefits of case-based learning. The survey is analyzed using frequency distribution and chi square test of association. The results of the survey show that case-based teaching of compiler concepts does enhance students skills of learning, critical thinking, engagement, communication skills and team work.
