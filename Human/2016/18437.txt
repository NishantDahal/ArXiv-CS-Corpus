Novel Grid Topology Estimation Technique Exploiting PLC Modems

A fundamental requirement to develop routing strategies in power line networks is the knowledge of the network topology, which might not be complete. In this work, we present a novel method to derive the topology of a distribution network that exploits the capability of Power Line Communication modems to measure the network admittance, and we report the most significant results.
