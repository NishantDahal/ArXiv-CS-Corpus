Proceedings Sixth International Workshop on Classical Logic and Computation

The workshop series intends to cover research that investigates the computational aspects of classical logic and mathematics. Its focus is on unwinding the computational content of logical principles and proof in mathematics based on these principles, aiming to bring together researchers from both fields and exchange ideas. 
  Classical Logic and Computation (CL&C) 2016 was the sixth edition of this workshop series held as a satellite to FSCD 2016 on June 23, 2016 in Porto, Portugal. 
  In this sixth edition we received 11 submissions of both short and full papers. Eight (8) of these were selected to present at the meeting in Porto, and five (5) full papers were initially accepted to appear at this EPTCS special volume of which one was subsequently withdrawn by its authors.  An invited talk was given by Marc Bezem (U. of Bergen): Coherent Logic - an overview.  Other topics covered by this years submissions included: computational content of proofs using nonstandard analysis, a structured grammar-based approach to the Herbrand content of proofs, semantics of the lambda-mu calculus, normalization of classical natural deduction proofs,  proof mining of noneffective proofs in convex optimization and algebra by functional interpretations.  I like to thank the members of the program committee for their excellent work: Steffen van Bakel (London),  Stefano Berardi (Torino),  Fernando Ferreira (Lisboa), Hugo de'Liguoro (Torino), Alexandre Miquel (Montevideo).
