A configurable accelerator for manycores: the Explicitly Many-Processor Approach

A new approach to designing processor accelerators is presented. A new computing model and a special kind of accelerator with dynamic (end-user programmable) architecture is suggested. The new model considers a processor, in which a newly introduced supervisor layer coordinates the job of the cores. The cores have the ability (based on the parallelization information provided by the compiler, and using the help of the supervisor) to outsource part of the job they received to some neighbouring core. The introduced changes essentially and advantageously modify the architecture and operation of the computing systems. The computing throughput drastically increases, the efficiency of the technological implementation (computing performance per logic gates) increases, the non-payload activity for using operating system services decreases, the real-time behavior changes advantageously, and connecting accelerators to the processor greatly simplifies. Here only some details of the architecture and operation of the processor are discussed, the rest is described elsewhere.
