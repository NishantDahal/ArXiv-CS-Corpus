Typical Performance of Approximation Algorithms for NP-hard Problems

Typical performance of approximation algorithms is studied for randomized minimum vertex cover problems. A wide class of random graph ensembles characterized by an arbitrary degree distribution is discussed with some theoretical frameworks. Here three approximation algorithms are examined; the linear-programming relaxation, the loopy-belief propagation, and the leaf-removal algorithm. The former two algorithms are analyzed using the statistical-mechanical technique while the average-case analysis of the last one is studied by the generating function method. These algorithms have a threshold in the typical performance with increasing the average degree of the random graph, below which they find true optimal solutions with high probability. Our study reveals that there exist only three cases determined by the order of the typical-performance thresholds. We provide some conditions for classifying the graph ensembles and demonstrate explicitly examples for the difference in the threshold.
