A Parallel Corpus of Translationese

We describe a set of bilingual English--French and English--German parallel corpora in which the direction of translation is accurately and reliably annotated. The corpora are diverse, consisting of parliamentary proceedings, literary works, transcriptions of TED talks and political commentary. They will be instrumental for research of translationese and its applications to (human and machine) translation; specifically, they can be used for the task of translationese identification, a research direction that enjoys a growing interest in recent years. To validate the quality and reliability of the corpora, we replicated previous results of supervised and unsupervised identification of translationese, and further extended the experiments to additional datasets and languages.
