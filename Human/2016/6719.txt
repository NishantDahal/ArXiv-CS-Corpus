The Price of Fog: a Data-Driven Study on Caching Architectures in Vehicular Networks

Vehicular users are expected to consume large amounts of data, for both entertainment and navigation purposes. This will put a strain on cellular networks, which will be able to cope with such a load only if proper caching is in place, this in turn begs the question of which caching architecture is the best-suited to deal with vehicular content consumption. In this paper, we leverage a large-scale, crowd-collected trace to (i) characterize the vehicular traffic demand, in terms of overall magnitude and content breakup, (ii) assess how different caching approaches perform against such a real-world load, (iii) study the effect of recommendation systems and local contents. We define a price-of-fog metric, expressing the additional caching capacity to deploy when moving from traditional, centralized caching architectures to a "fog computing" approach, where caches are closer to the network edge. We find that for location-specific contents, such as the ones that vehicular users are most likely to request, such a price almost disappears. Vehicular networks thus make a strong case for the adoption of mobile-edge caching, as we are able to reap the benefit thereof -- including a reduction in the distance traveled by data, within the core network -- with little or no of the associated disadvantages.
