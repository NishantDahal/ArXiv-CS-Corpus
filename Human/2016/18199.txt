Geodetic Graphs Homeomorphic to a Given Geodetic Graph

This paper describes a new approach to the problem of generating the class of all geodetic graphs homeomorphic to a given geodetic one. An algorithmic procedure is elaborated to carry out a systematic finding of such a class of graphs. As a result, the enumeration of the class of geodetic graphs homeomorphic to certain Moore graphs has been performed.
