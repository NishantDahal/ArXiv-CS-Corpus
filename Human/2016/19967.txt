Spatio-temporal Models for Formal Analysis and Property-based Testing

This paper presents our ongoing work on spatio-temporal models for formal analysis and property-based testing. Our proposed framework aims at reducing the impedance mismatch between formal methods and practitioners. We introduce a set of formal methods and explain their interplay and benefits in terms of usability.
