Networked Intelligence: Towards Autonomous Cyber Physical Systems

Developing intelligent systems requires combining results from both industry and academia. In this report you find an overview of relevant research fields and industrially applicable technologies for building very large scale cyber physical systems. A concept architecture is used to illustrate how existing pieces may fit together, and the maturity of the subsystems is estimated.
  The goal is to structure the developments and the challenge of machine intelligence for Consumer and Industrial Internet technologists, cyber physical systems researchers and people interested in the convergence of data & Internet of Things. It can be used for planning developments of intelligent systems.
