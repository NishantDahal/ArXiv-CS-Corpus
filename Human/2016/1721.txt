Uniresolution representations of white-matter data from CoCoMac

Tracing data as collated by CoCoMac, a seminal neuroinformatics database, is at multiple resolutions -- white matter tracts were studied for areas and their subdivisions by different reports. Network theoretic analysis of this multi-resolution data often assumes that the data at various resolutions is equivalent, which may not be correct. In this paper we propose three methods to resolve the multi-resolution issue such that the resultant networks have connectivity data at only one resolution. The different resultant networks are compared in terms of their network analysis metrics and degree distributions.
