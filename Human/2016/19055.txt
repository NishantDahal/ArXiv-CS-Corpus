A New Algorithm to Compare the Magnitude of Two RNS Numbers

Comparison of two numbers in RNS systems is a challenging task. In this paper, a new algorithm to compare the magnitude of two RNS numbers, using a clustering method has been proposed. In the clustering process, each inputted number is assigned to a cluster. To compare the magnitude of two numbers, first the clusters of these numbers and their differences are obtained. Then by comparing these clusters, the relative magnitude of two numbers is determined. All of these processes are performed in RNS system without converting numbers to the binary system.
