Vector Quantization for Machine Vision

This paper shows how to reduce the computational cost for a variety of common machine vision tasks by operating directly in the compressed domain, particularly in the context of hardware acceleration. Pyramid Vector Quantization (PVQ) is the compression technique of choice and its properties are exploited to simplify Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, interest points matching and other algorithms.
