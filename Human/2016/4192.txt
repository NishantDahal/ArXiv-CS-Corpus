Marking Shortest Paths On Pushdown Graphs Does Not Preserve MSO Decidability

In this paper we consider pushdown graphs, i.e. infinite graphs that can be described as transition graphs of deterministic real-time pushdown automata. We consider the case where some vertices are designated as being final and we built, in a breadth-first manner, a marking of edges that lead to such vertices (i.e., for every vertex that can reach a final one, we mark all out-going edges laying on some shortest path to a final vertex).
  Our main result is that the edge-marked version of a pushdown graph may itself no longer be a pushdown graph, as we prove that this enrich graph may have an undecidable MSO theory.
