Example Data Sets and Collections for BeSpaceD Explained

In this report, we present example data sets and collections for the BeSpaceD platform. BeSpaceD is a spatio-temporal modelling and reasoning software framework. We describe the content of a number of the data sets and how the data was obtained. We also present the programming API in BeSpaceD used to store and access these data sets so that future BeSpaceD users can utilise the data collections in their own experiments with minimal effort and expand the library of data collections for BeSpaceD.
