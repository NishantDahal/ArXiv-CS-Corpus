Leveraging Social Communities for Optimizing Cellular Device-to-Device Communications

Device-to-device (D2D) communications over licensed wireless spectrum has been recently proposed as a promising technology to meet the capacity crunch of next generation cellular networks. However, due to the high mobility of cellular devices, establishing and ensuring the success of D2D transmission becomes a major challenge. To this end, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed to enable devices to form multi-hop D2D connections in an effort to maintain sustainable communication in the presence of device mobility. To solve the problem posed by device mobility, in contrast to existing works, which mostly focus on physical domain information, a durable community based approach is introduced taking social encounters into context. It is shown that the proposed scheme can derive an optimal solution for time sensitive content transmission while also minimizing the cost that the base station pays in order to incentivize users to participate in D2D. Simulation results show that the proposed social community aware approach yields significant performance gain, in terms of the amount of traffic offloaded from the cellular network to the D2D tier, compared to the classical social-unaware methods.
