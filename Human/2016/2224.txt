Track selection in Multifunction Radars for Multi-target tracking: an Anti-Coordination game

In this paper, a track selection problem for multi-target tracking in a multifunction radar network is studied using the concepts from game theory. The problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game, and specifically as an anti-coordination game, where each player aims to differ from what other players do. The players' utilities are modeled using a proper tracking accuracy criterion and, under different assumptions on the structure of these utilities, the corresponding Nash equilibria are characterized. To find an equilibrium, a distributed algorithm based on the best-response dynamics is proposed. Finally, computer simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a multi-target tracking scenario.
