Defining Cross-Cloud Systems

Recent years have seen an increasing number of cross-cloud architectures, i.e. systems that span across cloud provisioning boundaries. However, the cloud computing world still lacks any standards in terms of programming interfaces, which has a knock-on effect on the costs associated with interoperability and severely limits the flexibility and portability of applications and virtual infrastructures. This paper outlines the different types of cross-cloud systems, and the associated design decisions.
