Performance Analysis of RFDMRP:River Formation Dynamics based Multi-Hop Routing Protocol in WSNs

In Wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes sense the data from environment according to its functionality and forwards to its base station. This process is called Data collection. The Data collection process is done either directly or by multi-hop routing. In direct routing, every sensor node directly transfers its sensed data to base station which has an impact on energy consumption from sensor node due to the far distance between the sensor node and base station. In multi-hop routing, the sensed data is relayed through multiple nodes to the base station, it consumes less energy. This paper presents and analyzes the performance of a data collection routing protocol called RFDMRP: River Formation Dynamics based multi-hop routing protocol. The performance of RFDMRP is tested and analyzed for network parameters such as Network lifetime, Energy usage, and Node density & data aggregation impact on network lifetime. The simulated results are compared with two algorithms LEACH and MOD_LEACH. The comparison reveals that the proposed algorithm performs better than LEACH and MOD_LEACH with respect to Network lifetime.
