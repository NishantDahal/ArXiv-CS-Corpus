Development of a wearable haptic game interface

This paper outlines the development and evaluation of a wearable haptic game interface. The device differs from many traditional haptic feedback implementation in that it combines vibrotactile feedback with gesture based input, thus becoming a two way conduit between the user and the virtual environment. The device is intended to challenge what is considered an "interface" and sets out to purposefully blur the boundary between man and machine. This allows for a more immersive experience, and a user evaluation shows that the intuitive interface allows the user to become the aircraft that is controlled by the movements of the user's hand.
