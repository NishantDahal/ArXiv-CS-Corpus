Distributed Spatial Multiplexing Systems with Hardware Impairments and Imperfect Channel Estimation under Rank-$1$ Rician Fading Channels

The performance of a multiuser communication system with single-antenna transmitting terminals and a multi-antenna base-station receiver is analytically investigated. The system operates under independent and non-identically distributed rank-$1$ Rician fading channels with imperfect channel estimation and residual hardware impairments (compensation algorithms are assumed, which mitigate the main impairments) at the transceiver. The spatial multiplexing mode of operation is considered where all the users are simultaneously transmitting their streams to the receiver. Zero-forcing is applied along with successive interference cancellation (SIC) as a means for efficient detection of the received streams. New analytical closed-form expressions are derived for some important performance metrics, namely, the outage probability and ergodic capacity of the entire system. Both the analytical expressions and simulation results show the impact of imperfect channel estimation and hardware impairments to the overall system performance in the usage scenarios of massive MIMO and mmWave communication systems.
