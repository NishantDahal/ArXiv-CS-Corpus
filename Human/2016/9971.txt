Tables of the existence of equiangular tight frames

A Grassmannian frame is a collection of unit vectors which are optimally incoherent. To date, the vast majority of explicit Grassmannian frames are equiangular tight frames (ETFs). This paper surveys every known construction of ETFs and tabulates existence for sufficiently small dimensions.
