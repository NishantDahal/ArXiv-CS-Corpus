Experimental Characterization of In Vivo Wireless Communication Channels

In vivo wireless medical devices have a critical role in healthcare technologies due to their continuous health monitoring and noninvasive surgery capabilities. In order to fully exploit the potential of such devices, it is necessary to characterize the in vivo wireless communication channel which will help to build reliable and high-performance communication systems. This paper presents preliminary results of experimental characterization for this fascinating communications medium on a human cadaver and compares the results with numerical studies.
