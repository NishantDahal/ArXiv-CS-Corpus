Notes on Pervasive Virtuality

This paper summarizes current notes about a new mixed-reality paradigm that we named as "pervasive virtuality". This paradigm has emerged recently in industry and academia through different initiatives. In this paper we intend to explore this new area by proposing a set of features that we identified as important or helpful to realize pervasive virtuality in games and entertainment applications.
