Spectral-Efficiency Analysis of Massive MIMO Systems in Centralized and Distributed Schemes

This paper analyzes the spectral efficiency of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in both centralized and distributed configurations, referred to as C-MIMO and D-MIMO, respectively. By accounting for real environmental parameters and antenna characteristics, namely, path loss, shadowing effect, multi-path fading and antenna correlation, a novel comprehensive channel model is first proposed in closed-form, which is applicable to both types of MIMO schemes. Then, based on the proposed model, the asymptotic behavior of the spectral efficiency of the MIMO channel under both the centralized and distributed configurations is analyzed and compared in exact forms, by exploiting the theory of very long random vectors. Afterwards, a case study is performed by applying the obtained results into MIMO networks with circular coverage. In such a case, it is attested that for the D-MIMO of cell radius $r_{\mathrm{c}}$ and circular antenna array of radius~$r_{\mathrm{a}}$, the optimal value of~$r_{\mathrm{a}}$ that maximizes the average spectral efficiency is accurately established by $r_{\mathrm{a}}^{\mathrm{opt}}=r_{\mathrm{c}}/1.31$. Monte Carlo simulation results corroborate the developed spectral-efficiency analysis.
