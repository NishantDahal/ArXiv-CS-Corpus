Bounds for Batch Codes with Restricted Query Size

We present new upper bounds on the parameters of batch codes with restricted query size. These bounds are an improvement on the Singleton bound. The techniques for derivations of these bounds are based on the ideas in the literature for codes with locality. By employing additional ideas, we obtain further improvements, which are specific for batch codes.
