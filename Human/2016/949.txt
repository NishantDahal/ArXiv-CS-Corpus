An Improved Intelligent Agent for Mining Real-Time Databases Using Modified Cortical Learning Algorithms

Cortical Learning Algorithms based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory, HTM have been developed by Numenta Incorporation from which variations and modifications are currently being investigated upon. HTM offers better promises as a future computational model of the neocortex the seat of intelligence in the brain. Currently, intelligent agents are embedded in almost every modern day electronic system found in homes, offices and industries worldwide. In this paper, we present a first step in realising useful HTM like applications specifically for mining a synthetic and real time dataset based on a novel intelligent agent framework, and demonstrate how a modified version of this very important computational technique will lead to improved recognition.
