Bluetooth Data Exchange Between Android Phones Without Pairing

In this paper we describe a novel method of exchanging data between Bluetooth smartphones on the Android platform without requiring pairing between devices. We discuss our approach of encoding and decoding data inside the UUIDs used by the Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). Future research remains to be done on the latency, bandwidth and compatibility of this approach, as well as the possibility of utilizing other protocols in conjunction with this method.
