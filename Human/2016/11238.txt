A weakly universal cellular automaton in the heptagrid

In this paper, we construct a weakly universal cellular automaton in the heptagrid, the tessellation $\{7,3\}$ which is not rotation invariant but which is truly planar. This result, under these conditions, cannot be improved for the tessellations $\{p,3\}$.
