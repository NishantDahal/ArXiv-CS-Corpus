A light-stimulated neuromorphic device based on graphene hybrid phototransistor

Neuromorphic chip refers to an unconventional computing architecture that is modelled on biological brains. It is ideally suited for processing sensory data for intelligence computing, decision-making or context cognition. Despite rapid development, conventional artificial synapses exhibit poor connection flexibility and require separate data acquisition circuitry, resulting in limited functionalities and significant hardware redundancy. Here we report a novel light-stimulated artificial synapse based on a graphene-nanotube hybrid phototransistor that can directly convert optical stimuli into a "neural image" for further neuronal analysis. Our optically-driven synapses involve multiple steps of plasticity mechanisms and importantly exhibit flexible tuning of both short- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic functionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel neuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics.
