Simulating Organogenesis in COMSOL: Phase-Field Based Simulations of Embryonic Lung Branching Morphogenesis

Organogenesis has been studied for decades, but fundamental questions regarding the control of growth and shape remain unsolved. We have recently shown that of all proposed mathematical models only ligand-receptor based Turing models successfully reproduce the experimentally determined growth fields of the embryonic lung and thus provide a mechanism for growth control during embryonic lung development. Turing models are based on at least two coupled non-linear reaction-diffusion equations. In case of the lung model, at least two distinct layers (mesenchyme and epithelium) need to be considered that express different components (ligand and receptor, respectively). The Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method has previously been used to solve this Turing system on growing and deforming (branching) domains, where outgrowth occurs proportional to the strength of ligand-receptor signalling. However, the ALE method requires mesh deformations that eventually limit its use. Therefore, we incorporate the phase field method to simulate 3D embryonic lung branching with COMSOL.
