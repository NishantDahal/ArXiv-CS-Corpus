A bioinformatics system for searching Co-Occurrence based on Co-Operational Formation with Advanced Method (COCOFAM)

Literature analysis is a key step in obtaining background information in biomedical research. However, it is difficult for researchers to obtain knowledge of their interests in an efficient manner because of the massive amount of the published biomedical literature. Therefore, efficient and systematic search strategies are required, which allow ready access to the substantial amount of literature. In this paper, we propose a novel search system, named Co-Occurrence based on Co-Operational Formation with Advanced Method(COCOFAM) which is suitable for the large-scale literature analysis. COCOFAM is based on integrating both Spark for local clusters and a global job scheduler to gather crowdsourced co-occurrence data on global clusters. It will allow users to obtain information of their interests from the substantial amount of literature.
