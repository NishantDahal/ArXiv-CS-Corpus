A hybrid approach based segmentation technique for brain tumor in MRI Images

Automatic image segmentation becomes very crucial for tumor detection in medical image processing.In general, manual and semi automatic segmentation techniques require more time and knowledge. However these drawbacks had overcome by automatic segmentation still there needs to develop more appropriate techniques for medical image segmentation. Therefore, we proposed hybrid approach based image segmentation using the combined features of region growing and threshold based segmentation techniques. It is followed by pre-processing stage to provide an accurate brain tumor extraction by the help of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). If the tumor has holes, the region growing segmentation algorithm cannot reveal but the proposed hybrid segmentation technique can be achieved and the result as well improved. Hence the result used to made assessment with the various performance measures as DICE, JACCARD similarity, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. These similarity measures have been extensively used for evaluation with the ground truth of each processed image and its results are compared and analyzed.
