Security and Privacy of Sensitive Data in Cloud Computing: A Survey of Recent Developments

Cloud computing is revolutionizing many ecosystems by providing organizations with computing resources featuring easy deployment, connectivity, configuration, automation and scalability. This paradigm shift raises a broad range of security and privacy issues that must be taken into consideration. Multi-tenancy, loss of control, and trust are key challenges in cloud computing environments. This paper reviews the existing technologies and a wide array of both earlier and state-of-the-art projects on cloud security and privacy. We categorize the existing research according to the cloud reference architecture orchestration, resource control, physical resource, and cloud service management layers, in addition to reviewing the existing developments in privacy-preserving sensitive data approaches in cloud computing such as privacy threat modeling and privacy enhancing protocols and solutions.
