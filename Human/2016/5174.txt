META-pipe - Pipeline Annotation, Analysis and Visualization of Marine Metagenomic Sequence Data

The marine environment is one of the most important sources for microbial biodiversity on the planet. These microbes are drivers for many biogeochemical processes, and their enormous genetic potential is still not fully explored or exploited. Marine metagenomics (DNA shotgun sequencing), not only offers opportunities for studying structure and function of microbial communities, but also identification of novel biocatalysts and bioactive compounds. However, data analysis, management, storage, processing and interpretation are significant challenges in marine metagenomics due to the high diversity in samples and the size of the marine flagship projects. We provide a new pipeline, META-pipe, for marine metagenomics analysis. It offers pre- processing, assembly, taxonomic classification and functional analysis. To reduce the effort to develop and deploy it, we have integrated existing biological analysis frameworks, and compute and storage infrastructure resources. Our current META-pipe web service provides integration with identity provider services, distributed storage, computation on a Supercomputer, Galaxy workflows, and interactive data visualizations. We have evaluated the scalability and performance of the analysis pipeline. Our results demonstrate how to develop and deploy a pipeline on distributed compute and storage resources, and discusses important challenges related to this process.
