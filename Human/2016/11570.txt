Equivalence Checking By Logic Relaxation

We introduce a new framework for Equivalence Checking (EC) of Boolean circuits based on a general technique called Logic Relaxation (LoR). The essence of LoR is to relax the formula to be solved and compute a superset S of the set of new behaviors. Namely, S contains all new satisfying assignments that appeared due to relaxation and does not contain assignments satisfying the original formula. Set S is generated by a procedure called partial quantifier elimination. If all possible bad behaviors are in S, the original formula cannot have them and so the property described by this formula holds. The appeal of EC by LoR is twofold. First, it facilitates generation of powerful inductive proofs. Second, proving inequivalence comes down to checking the presence of some bad behaviors in the relaxed formula i.e. in a simpler version of the original formula. We give some experimental evidence that supports our approach.
