Row Reduction Applied to Decoding of Rank Metric and Subspace Codes

We show that decoding of $\ell$-Interleaved Gabidulin codes, as well as list-$\ell$ decoding of Mahdavifar--Vardy codes can be performed by row reducing skew polynomial matrices. Inspired by row reduction of $\F[x]$ matrices, we develop a general and flexible approach of transforming matrices over skew polynomial rings into a certain reduced form. We apply this to solve generalised shift register problems over skew polynomial rings which occur in decoding $\ell$-Interleaved Gabidulin codes. We obtain an algorithm with complexity $O(\ell μ^2)$ where $μ$ measures the size of the input problem and is proportional to the code length $n$ in the case of decoding. Further, we show how to perform the interpolation step of list-$\ell$-decoding Mahdavifar--Vardy codes in complexity $O(\ell n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of interpolation constraints.
