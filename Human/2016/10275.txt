Learning Null Space Projections in Operational Space Formulation

In recent years, a number of tools have become available that recover the underlying control policy from constrained movements. However, few have explicitly considered learning the constraints of the motion and ways to cope with unknown environment. In this paper, we consider learning the null space projection matrix of a kinematically constrained system in the absence of any prior knowledge either on the underlying policy, the geometry, or dimensionality of the constraints. Our evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach on problems of differing dimensionality, and with different degrees of non-linearity.
