Extracting Patterns of Urban Activity from Geotagged Social Data

Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich information on the whereabouts of urban dwellers. Specifically, such data reveal who spends time where, when, and on what type of activity (e.g., shopping at a mall, or dining at a restaurant). That information can, in turn, be used to describe city regions in terms of activity that takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for dining in the evening. Furthermore, once such a description is available, one can ask more elaborate questions: What are the features that distinguish one region from another -- is it simply the type of venues they host or is it the visitors they attract? What regions are similar across cities?
  In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions using publicly shared Foursquare data. In contrast with previous work, our method makes use of a probabilistic model with minimal assumptions about the data and thus relieves us from having to make arbitrary decisions in our analysis (e.g., regarding the granularity of discovered regions or the importance of different features). We perform an empirical comparison with previous work and discuss insights obtained through our findings.
