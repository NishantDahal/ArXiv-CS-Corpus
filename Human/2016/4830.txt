Stability in Graphs and Games

We study graphs and two-player games in which rewards are assigned to states, and the goal of the players is to satisfy or dissatisfy certain property of the generated outcome, given as a mean payoff property. Since the notion of mean-payoff does not reflect possible fluctuations from the mean-payoff along a run, we propose definitions and algorithms for capturing the stability of the system, and give algorithms for deciding if a given mean payoff and stability objective can be ensured in the system
