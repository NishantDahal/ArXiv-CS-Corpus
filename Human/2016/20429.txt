On the Design of MAC Protocol and Transmission Scheduling for Internet of Things

With the ubiquitous sensing enabled by wireless sensor network technologies, Internet of Things (IoT) is developed to many areas of modern day living. The inexpensive IoT devices and platforms capable of wireless communications enable the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. In this paper, we firstly investigate a scalable multimode-based MAC protocol, IoT-MAC, which consists of a channel contention period and a data transmission period, to reduce contention of channel access due to coexist of many IoT devices. Secondly, we study a data transmission scheduling algorithm to maximise data collection under the constraints of radio link quality and remaining energy of the IoT node, while ensuring a fair access to the radio channel. To study the performance of data reception rate, packet loss rate and latency, we evaluate the IoT-MAC and scheduling algorithm with varying data rate and different network scale.
