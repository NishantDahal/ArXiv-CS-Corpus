The Graph of the Pedigree Polytope is Asymptotically Almost Complete (Extended Abstract)

Graphs (1-skeletons) of Traveling-Salesman-related polytopes have attracted a lot of attention. Pedigree polytopes are extensions of the classical Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem polytopes (Arthanari 2000) whose graphs contain the TSP polytope graphs as spanning subgraphs (Arthanari 2013). Unlike TSP polytopes, Pedigree polytopes are not "symmetric", e.g., their graphs are not vertex transitive, not even regular. We show that in the graph of the pedigree polytope, the quotient minimum degree over number of vertices tends to 1 as the number of cities tends to infinity.
