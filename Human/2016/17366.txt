Structure and algorithms for (cap, even hole)-free graphs

A graph is even-hole-free if it has no induced even cycles of length 4 or more. A cap is a cycle of length at least 5 with exactly one chord and that chord creates a triangle with the cycle. In this paper, we consider (cap, even hole)-free graphs, and more generally, (cap, 4-hole)-free odd-signable graphs. We give an explicit construction of these graphs. We prove that every such graph $G$ has a vertex of degree at most $\frac{3}{2}ω(G) -1$, and hence $χ(G)\leq \frac{3}{2}ω(G)$, where $ω(G)$ denotes the size of a largest clique in $G$ and $χ(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$. We give an $O(nm)$ algorithm for $q$-coloring these graphs for fixed $q$ and an $O(nm)$ algorithm for maximum weight stable set. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for minimum coloring.
  Our algorithms are based on our results that triangle-free odd-signable graphs have treewidth at most 5 and thus have clique-width at most 48, and that (cap, 4-hole)-free odd-signable graphs $G$ without clique cutsets have treewidth at most $6ω(G)-1$ and clique-width at most 48.
