Classical - Quantum Arbitrarily Varying Wiretap Channel: Common Randomness Assisted Code and Continuity

We determine the secrecy capacities under common randomness assisted coding of arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels.Furthermore, we determine the secrecy capacity of a mixed channel model which is compound from the sender to the legal receiver and varies arbitrarily from the sender to the eavesdropper. As an application we examine when the secrecy capacity is a continuous function of the system parameters and show that resources, i.e., having access to a perfect copy of the outcome of a random experiment. are helpful for channel stability.
