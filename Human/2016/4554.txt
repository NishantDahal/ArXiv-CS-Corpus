System Level Performance Evaluation of LTE-V2X Network

Vehicles are among the fastest growing type of connected devices. Therefore, there is a need for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication i.e. passing of information from a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and vice versa. In this paper, the main focus is on the communication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs) commonly referred to as V2I communication in a multi-lane freeway scenario. Moreover, we analyze network related bottlenecks such as the maximum number of vehicles that can be supported when coverage is provided by the Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) network. The performance evaluation is assessed through extensive system-level simulations. Results show that new resource allocation and interference mitigation techniques are needed in order to achieve the required high reliability requirements, especially when network load is high.
