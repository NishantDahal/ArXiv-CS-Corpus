On Hypohamiltonian Snarks and a Theorem of Fiorini

We discuss an omission in the statement and proof of Fiorini's 1983 theorem on hypohamiltonian snarks and present a version of this theorem which is more general in several ways. Using Fiorini's erroneous result, Steffen showed that hypohamiltonian snarks exist for some $n \ge 10$ and each even $n \ge 92$. We rectify Steffen's proof by providing a correct demonstration of a technical lemma on flower snarks, which might be of separate interest. We then strengthen Steffen's theorem to the strongest possible form by determining all orders for which hypohamiltonian snarks exists. This also strengthens a result of Máčajová and Škoviera. Finally, we verify a conjecture of Steffen on hypohamiltonian snarks up to 36 vertices.
