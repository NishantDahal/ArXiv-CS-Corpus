60 GHz Multi-Gigabit Indoor WLANs: Dream or Reality?

The millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology, recently standardized by IEEE 802.11ad, is emerging as an attractive alternative to the traditional 2.4/5GHz wireless systems, promising multi-Gigabit wireless throughput. However, the high attenuation and vulnerability to blockage of 60 GHz links have limited its applications (until recently) to short-range, line-of-sight, static scenarios. On the other hand, the question of whether it is feasible to build general-purpose WLANs out of mmWave radios in dynamic indoor environments with non-line-of-sight links remains largely unanswered. In this paper, through extensive measurements with COTS 802.11ad hardware in an indoor office environment, we investigate the question of whether the mmWave technology, in spite of its unique propagation characteristics, can serve as a viable choice for providing multi-Gigabit ubiquitous wireless indoor connectivity. We study the range of 60 GHz transmissions in indoor environments, the impact of antenna height, location, orientation, and distance on 60 GHz performance, the interaction among metrics from different layers of the network stack, the increased opportunities for spatial reuse, and the impact of human blockage. Our results reveal a number of challenges that we have to address for 60 GHz multi-gigabit WLANs to become a reality.
