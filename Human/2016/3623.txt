Continuous Molecular Communication in one dimensional situation

Molecular Communication as the most potential methods to solve the communication in nano scale, for it's derived from nature, and it becomes more and more prevalent. Though molecular communication happens in three dimensional situation, there are also some situation that are in the one dimensional situation, especially when considering the transmitters and the receivers are in extremely short distance or in long slim pipe. In this paper, we introduce the one dimensional situation, and studied how the continuous information molecules transmitted in this situation, also introduced how to encode and decode the information molecules, and based on the molecular communication model, we studied some metrics of it, such as the distance between transmitter and receiver, the emitting frequency of transmitter. Through the research we know that the distance and frequency are important metrics to the successful communication, which can direct us how to place the nano transmitters and receivers in the future nano network environment.
