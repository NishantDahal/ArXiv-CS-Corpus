Learning Repository Adaptibility in an Agent-Based University Environment

Automated e-Learning Systems (AeLS) are fundamental to contemporary educational concepts worldwide. It has become a standard not only in support to the formal curriculum, but containing social platform capabilities, gamification elements and functionalities fostering communities of experts, also for faster knowledge dissemination. Additionally, AeLSs support internal communications and customizable analytics and methodologies to quickly identify learning performance, which in turn can be used as feedback to implement adaptability in tailoring the content management to meet specific individual needs. The volume of fast growing AeLS content of supplement material and exchanged communication combined with the already huge material archived in the university libraries is enormous and needs sophisticated managing through electronic repositories. Such integration of content management systems (CMS) present challenges which can be solved optimally with the use of distributed management implemented through agent-based systems. This paper depicts a successful implementation of an Integrated Intelligent Agent Based University Information System (IABUIS).
