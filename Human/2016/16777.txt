A General Framework for Estimating Graphlet Statistics via Random Walk

Graphlets are induced subgraph patterns and have been frequently applied to characterize the local topology structures of graphs across various domains, e.g., online social networks (OSNs) and biological networks. Discovering and computing graphlet statistics are highly challenging. First, the massive size of real-world graphs makes the exact computation of graphlets extremely expensive. Secondly, the graph topology may not be readily available so one has to resort to web crawling using the available application programming interfaces (APIs). In this work, we propose a general and novel framework to estimate graphlet statistics of "any size". Our framework is based on collecting samples through consecutive steps of random walks. We derive an analytical bound on the sample size (via the Chernoff-Hoeffding technique) to guarantee the convergence of our unbiased estimator. To further improve the accuracy, we introduce two novel optimization techniques to reduce the lower bound on the sample size. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art method up to an order of magnitude both in terms of accuracy and time cost.
