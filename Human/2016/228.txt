An Unsupervised Method for Detection and Validation of The Optic Disc and The Fovea

In this work, we have presented a novel method for detection of retinal image features, the optic disc and the fovea, from colour fundus photographs of dilated eyes for Computer-aided Diagnosis(CAD) system. A saliency map based method was used to detect the optic disc followed by an unsupervised probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis for detection validation. The validation concept is based on distinct vessels structures in the optic disc. By using the clinical information of standard location of the fovea with respect to the optic disc, the macula region is estimated. Accuracy of 100\% detection is achieved for the optic disc and the macula on MESSIDOR and DIARETDB1 and 98.8\% detection accuracy on STARE dataset.
