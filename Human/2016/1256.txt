Mutiscale Mapper: A Framework for Topological Summarization of Data and Maps

Summarizing topological information from datasets and maps defined on them is a central theme in topological data analysis. \textsf{Mapper}, a tool for such summarization, takes as input both a possibly high dimensional dataset and a map defined on the data, and produces a summary of the data by using a cover of the codomain of the map. This cover, via a pullback operation to the domain, produces a simplicial complex connecting the data points.
  The resulting view of the data through a cover of the codomain offers flexibility in analyzing the data. However, it offers only a view at a fixed scale at which the cover is constructed. Inspired by the concept, we explore a notion of a tower of covers which induces a tower of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, which we call {\em multiscale mapper}. We study the resulting structure, its stability, and design practical algorithms to compute its associated persistence diagrams efficiently. Specifically, when the domain is a simplicial complex and the map is a real-valued piecewise-linear function, the algorithm can compute the exact persistence diagram only from the 1-skeleton of the input complex. For general maps, we present a combinatorial version of the algorithm that acts only on \emph{vertex sets} connected by the 1-skeleton graph, and this algorithm approximates the exact persistence diagram thanks to a stability result that we show to hold. We also relate the multiscale mapper with the ÄŒech complexes arising from a natural pullback pseudometric defined on the input domain.
