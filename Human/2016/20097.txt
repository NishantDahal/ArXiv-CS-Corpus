On The Fundamental Energy Tradeoffs of Geographical Load Balancing

Geographical load balancing can optimize the utilization of green energy and the cost of electricity by taking the advantages of green and price diversities at geographical dispersed data centers. However, higher green energy utilization or lower electricity cost may actually increase the total energy consumption, and is not necessarily the best option. The achievable energy tradeoffs can be captured by taking into consideration of a defined service efficiency parameter for geo-dispersed data centers.
