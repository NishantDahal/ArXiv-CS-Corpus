The Intelligent Voice 2016 Speaker Recognition System

This paper presents the Intelligent Voice (IV) system submitted to the NIST 2016 Speaker Recognition Evaluation (SRE). The primary emphasis of SRE this year was on developing speaker recognition technology which is robust for novel languages that are much more heterogeneous than those used in the current state-of-the-art, using significantly less training data, that does not contain meta-data from those languages. The system is based on the state-of-the-art i-vector/PLDA which is developed on the fixed training condition, and the results are reported on the protocol defined on the development set of the challenge.
