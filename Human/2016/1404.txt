How marketing vocabulary was evolving from 2005 to 2014? An illustrative application of statistical methods on text mining

Here a collection of 1169 abstracts, which corresponds to articles that the Journal of Marketing Research has published from 2005 to 2014, are analysed under a novel approach. We apply several statistical methods, such as Principal Components Analysis and Correspondence Analysis to identify the way Marketing vocabulary is evolving. Similarly those articles that introduce new vocabulary are identified and the preferred words by authors are also detected. In order to provide an easy-to-understand explanation, we provide our results graphically. A word-cloud with the most frequent words is given first. Secondly abstracts-words are represented on the factorial plane. Finally one representation of word-years allows us to detect changes on the vocabulary through the passing of time.
