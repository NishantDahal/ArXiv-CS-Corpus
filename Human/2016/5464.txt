Aware: Controlling App Access to I/O Devices on Mobile Platforms

Smartphones' cameras, microphones, and device displays enable users to capture and view memorable moments of their lives. However, adversaries can trick users into authorizing malicious apps that exploit weaknesses in current mobile platforms to misuse such on-board I/O devices to stealthily capture photos, videos, and screen content without the users' consent. Contemporary mobile operating systems fail to prevent such misuse of I/O devices by authorized apps due to lack of binding between users' interactions and accesses to I/O devices performed by these apps. In this paper, we propose Aware, a security framework for authorizing app requests to perform operations using I/O devices, which binds app requests with user intentions to make all uses of certain I/O devices explicit. We evaluate our defense mechanisms through laboratory-based experimentation and a user study, involving 74 human subjects, whose ability to identify undesired operations targeting I/O devices increased significantly. Without Aware, only 18% of the participants were able to identify attacks from tested RAT apps. Aware systematically blocks all the attacks in absence of user consent and supports users in identifying 82% of social-engineering attacks tested to hijack approved requests, including some more sophisticated forms of social engineering not yet present in available RATs. Aware introduces only 4.79% maximum performance overhead over operations targeting I/O devices. Aware shows that a combination of system defenses and user interface can significantly strengthen defenses for controlling the use of on-board I/O devices.
