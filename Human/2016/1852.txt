Faster Bottleneck Non-crossing Matchings of Points in Convex Position

Given an even number of points in a plane, we are interested in matching all the points by straight line segments so that the segments do not cross. Bottleneck matching is a matching that minimizes the length of the longest segment. For points in convex position, we present a quadratic-time algorithm for finding a bottleneck non-crossing matching, improving upon the best previously known algorithm of cubic time complexity.
