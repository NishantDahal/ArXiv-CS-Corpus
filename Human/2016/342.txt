Edge Agreement of Second-order Multi-agent System with Dynamic Quantization via Directed Edge Laplacian

This work explores the edge agreement problem of second-order multi-agent system with dynamic quantization under directed communication. To begin with, by virtue of the directed edge laplacian, we derive a model reduction representation of the closed-loop multi-agent system depended on the spanning tree subgraph. Considering the limitations of the finite bandwidth channels, the quantization effects of second-order multi-agent system under directed graph are considered. Motivated by the observation that the static quantizer always lead to the practical stability rather than the asymptotic stability, the dynamic quantized communication strategy referring to the rooming in-rooming out scheme is employed. Based on the reduced model associated with the essential edge Laplacian, the asymptotic stability of second-order multi-agent system under dynamic quantized effects with only finite quantization level can be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.
