Hard Threshold Least Mean Squares Algorithm

This work presents a new variation of the commonly used Least Mean Squares Algorithm (LMS) for the identification of sparse signals with an a-priori known sparsity using a hard threshold operator in every iteration. It examines some useful properties of the algorithm and compares it with the traditional LMS and other sparsity aware variations of the same algorithm. It goes on to examine the application of the algorithm in the problem of spectrum estimation for cognitive radio devices.
