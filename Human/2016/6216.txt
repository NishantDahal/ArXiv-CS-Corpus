Spatiotemporal Modeling of a Pervasive Game

Given pervasive games that maintain a virtual spatiotemporal model of the physical world, game designers must contend with space and time in the virtual and physical, but an integrated conceptual model is lacking. Because the problem domains of GIS and Pervasive Games overlap, Peuquet's Triad Representational Framework is exapted, from the domain of GIS, and applied to Pervasive Games. Using Dix et al.'s three types of space and Langran's notion of time, virtual time and space are then be mapped to the physical world and vice versa. The approach is evaluated using the pervasive game called Codename: Heroes, as case study.
