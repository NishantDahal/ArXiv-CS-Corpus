RSA algorithm with a new approach encryption and decryption message text by ascii

In many research works, there has been an orientation to studying and developing many of the applications of public-key cryptography to secure the data while transmitting in the systems, In this paper we present an approach to encrypt and decrypt the message text according to the ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and RSA algorithm by converting the message text into binary representation and dividing this representation to bytes(8s of 0s and 1s) and applying a bijective function between the group of those bytes and the group of characters of ASCII and then using this mechanism to be compatible with using RSA algorithm, finally, Java application was built to apply this approach directly.
