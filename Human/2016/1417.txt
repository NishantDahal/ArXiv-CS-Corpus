Recovery of signals under the condition on RIC and ROC via prior support information

In this paper, the sufficient condition in terms of the RIC and ROC for the stable and robust recovery of signals in both noiseless and noisy settings was established via weighted $l_{1}$ minimization when there is partial prior information on support of signals. An improved performance guarantee has been derived.
  We can obtain a less restricted sufficient condition for signal reconstruction and a tighter recovery error bound under some conditions via weighted $l_{1}$ minimization. When prior support estimate is at least $50\%$ accurate, the sufficient condition is weaker than the analogous condition by standard $l_{1}$ minimization method, meanwhile the reconstruction error upper bound is provably to be smaller under additional conditions. Furthermore, the sufficient condition is also proved sharp.
