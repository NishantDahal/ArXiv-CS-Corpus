A Low Complexity Spectrum Sensing Scheme for Estimating Frequency Band Edges in Multi-Standard Military Communication Receivers

In a typical multi-standard military communication receiver, fast and reliable spectrum sensing unit is required to extract the information of multiple channels (frequency bands) present in a wideband input signal. In this paper, an energy detector based on our reconfigurable filter bank, in [5], for detecting the edge frequencies of the channels is proposed. Simulation results are presented to show the trade-off between the time required to calculate edge frequencies of all the channels and the maximum normalized error in estimating the edge frequencies. The proposed method is compared with existing energy detector methods for complexity and performance. It is shown that, for a fixed number of input samples, error decreases with time in the proposed algorithm as compared to other methods where error is constant. Design examples and simulations show that the complexity of the proposed method is lower than the other methods for a given error in estimating the edge frequencies
