Comparison of cinepak, intel, microsoft video and indeo codec for video compression

The file size and picture quality are factors to be considered for streaming, storage and transmitting videos over networks. This work compares Cinepak, Intel, Microsoft Video and Indeo Codec for video compression. The peak signal to noise ratio is used to compare the quality of such video compressed using AVI codecs. The most widely used objective measurement by developers of video processing systems is Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Peak Signal to Noise Ration is measured on a logarithmic scale and depends on the mean squared error (MSE) between an original and an impaired image or video, relative to (2n-1)2.
  Previous research done regarding assessing of video quality has been mainly by the use of subjective methods, and there is still no standard method for objective assessments. Although it has been considered that compression might not be significant in future as storage and transmission capabilities improve, but at low bandwidths compression makes communication possible.
