Optimal and asymptotically optimal NCT reversible circuits by the gate types

We report optimal and asymptotically optimal reversible circuits composed of NOT, CNOT, and Toffoli (NCT) gates, keeping the count by the subsets of the gate types used. This study fine tunes the circuit complexity figures for the realization of reversible functions via reversible NCT circuits. An important consequence is a result on the limitation of the use of the $T$-count quantum circuit metric popular in applications.
