Position Prediction of Ball and Fuzzy Controller for Shooting Action in A Soccer Robot System

The robot soccer game based complex motion control has been widely studied for the moving object capture and shooting. A position prediction algorithm based on global vision is introduced in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of the vision system for tracking moving objects, including a Kalmanfiter, a dynamic window and an obstacle avoidance strategy. This paper deals with the positon prediction for moving ball by using Kalmanfiter and the Fuzzy Controller for shooting action in a dynamic environment.
