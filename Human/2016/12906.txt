Incremental Noising and its Fractal Behavior

This manuscript is about further elucidating the concept of noising. The concept of noising first appeared in \cite{CVPR14}, in the context of curvature estimation and vertex localization on planar shapes. There are indications that noising can play for global methods the role smoothing plays for local methods in this task. This manuscript is about investigating this claim by introducing incremental noising, in a recursive deterministic manner, analogous to how smoothing is extended to progressive smoothing in similar tasks. As investigating the properties and behavior of incremental noising is the purpose of this manuscript, a surprising connection between incremental noising and progressive smoothing is revealed by the experiments. To explain this phenomenon, the fractal and the space filling properties of the two methods respectively, are considered in a unifying context.
