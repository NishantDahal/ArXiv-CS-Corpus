Scalable Device-to-Device Communications For Frequency Reuse >> 1

Proximity based applications are becoming fast growing markets suggesting that Device-to-Device (D2D) communications is becoming an essential part of future mobile data networks. We propose scalable admission and power control methods for D2D communications underlay cellular networks to increase the reuse of frequency resources and thus network capacity while maintaining QoS to all users. The aim of the proposed methods is to maximize the number of D2D links under QoS constraints, therefore maximizing network frequency reuse, while considering different levels of complexity and available channel state information (CSI) in a multi-cell environment. Numerical results show that by using D2D and the proposed multi-cell interference coordination and low power transmission method, the network spectral efficiency can be increased by as much as ten times, while low outage probability can be assured to provided QoS for all users.
