Spatially self-organized resilient networks by a distributed cooperative mechanism

The robustness of connectivity and the efficiency of paths are incompatible in many real networks. We propose a self-organization mechanism for incrementally generating onion-like networks with positive degree-degree correlations whose robustness is nearly optimal. As a spatial extension of the generation model based on cooperative copying and adding shortcut, we show that the growing networks become more robust and efficient through enhancing the onion-like topological structure on a space. The reasonable constraint for locating nodes on the perimeter in typical surface growth as a self-propagation does not affect these properties of the tolerance and the path length. Moreover, the robustness can be recovered in the random growth damaged by insistent sequential attacks even without any remedial measures.
