Randomness and disorder of chaotic iterations. Applications in information security field

Design and cryptanalysis of chaotic encryption schemes are major concerns to provide secured information systems. Pursuing our previous research works, some well-defined discrete chaotic iterations that satisfy the reputed Devaney's definition of chaos have been proposed. In this article, we summarize these contributions and propose applications in the fields of pseudorandom number generation, hash functions, and symmetric cryptography. For all these applications, the proofs of chaotic properties are outlined.
