Locally Repairable Regenerating Code Constructions

In this work, we give locally repairable regenerating code (LRRC) [1]-[3], [5], [6] constructions that can protect the file size promised by the graph analysis of the modified family helper selection (MFHS) scheme [1] at the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point.
