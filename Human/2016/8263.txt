Cayley Automatic Groups and Numerical Characteristics of Turing Transducers

This paper is devoted to the problem of finding characterizations for Cayley automatic groups. The concept of Cayley automatic groups was recently introduced by Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and Miasnikov. We address this problem by introducing three numerical characteristics of Turing transducers: growth functions, Folner functions and average length growth functions. These three numerical characteristics are the analogs of growth functions, Folner functions and drifts of simple random walks for Cayley graphs of groups. We study these numerical characteristics for Turing transducers obtained from automatic presentations of labeled directed graphs.
