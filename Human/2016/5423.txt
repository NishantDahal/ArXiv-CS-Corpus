Optimal Design of Compact Receive Array in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks

With the development of wireless communication, industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) plays an important role in monitoring and control systems. In this paper, we extend the application of IWSNs into High Frequency Surface-Wave Radar (HFSWR) system. The traditional antenna is replaced by mobile IWSNs. In combination of the application precondition of super-directivity in HF band and circular topology of IWSNs, a super-directivity synthesis method is presented for designing super-directivity array. In this method, the dominance of external noise is ensured by constraining the Ratio of External to Internal Noise (REIN) of the array, and the desired side lobe level is achieved by implementing linear constraint. By using this method, the highest directivity will be achieved in certain conditions. Using the designed super directive circular array as sub-arrays, the compact receive antenna array is constructed, the purpose of miniaturization is achieved. Simulation verifies that the proposed method is correct and effective, the validity of the proposed method has been proved.
