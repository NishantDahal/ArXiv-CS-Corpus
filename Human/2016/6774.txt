Ancilla-free Reversible Logic Synthesis via Sorting

Reversible logic synthesis is emerging as a major research component for post-CMOS computing devices, in particular Quantum computing. In this work, we link the reversible logic synthesis problem to sorting algorithms. Based on our analysis, an alternative derivation of the worst-case complexity of generated reversible circuits is provided. Furthermore, a novel column-wise reversible logic synthesis method, termed RevCol, is designed with inspiration from radix sort. Extending the principles of RevCol, we present a hybrid reversible logic synthesis framework. The theoretical and experimental results are presented. The results are extensively benchmarked with state-of-the-art ancilla-free reversible logic synthesis methods.
