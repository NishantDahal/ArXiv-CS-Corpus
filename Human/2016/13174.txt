On Simultaneous Percolation with Two Disk Types

In this paper we consider the simultaneous percolation of two Gilbert disk models. The two models are connected through excluding disks, which prevent elements of the second model to be in the vicinity of the first model. Under these assumptions we characterize the region of densities in which the two models both have a unique infinite connected component. The motivation for this work is the co-existence of two cognitive radio networks.
