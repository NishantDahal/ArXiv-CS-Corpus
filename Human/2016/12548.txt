Correlated Interference from Uncorrelated Users in Bounded Ad Hoc Networks with Blockage

In this letter, we study the joint impact of user density, blockage density and deployment area on the temporal correlation of interference for static and highly mobile users. We show that even if the user locations become uncorrelated, the interference level can still be correlated when the deployment area is bounded and/or there is blockage. In addition, we study how the correlation coefficients of interference scale at a high density of blockage.
