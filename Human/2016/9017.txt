A design science exploration of a visual-spatial learning system with feedback

Our paper is research in progress that is research investigating the use of games technology to enhance the learning of a physical skill. The Microsoft Kinect is a system designed for gaming with the capability to track the movement of users. Our research explored whether such a system could be used to provide feedback when teaching sign vocabulary. Whilst there are technologies available for teaching sign language, currently none provide feedback on the accuracy of the users' attempts at making signs. In this paper we report how the three-dimensional dsplay capability of the technology can enhance the users' experience. Also, when using tracking to identify errors in physical movements, how and when should feedback be given. A design science approach was undertaken to find a solution to this real world problem. The design and implementation of the solution provides interesting insights into how technology can not only emulate but also improve upon traditional learning of physical skills.
