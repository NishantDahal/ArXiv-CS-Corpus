Towards Service-oriented 5G: Virtualizing the Networks for Everything-as-a-Service

It is widely acknowledged that the forthcoming 5G architecture will be highly heterogeneous and deployed with a high degree of density. These changes over the current 4G bring many challenges on how to achieve an efficient operation from the network management perspective. In this article, we introduce a revolutionary vision of the future 5G wireless networks, in which the network is no longer limited by hardware or even software. Specifically, by the idea of virtualizing the wireless networks, which has recently gained increasing attention, we introduce the Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) taxonomy to light the way towards designing the service-oriented wireless networks. The concepts, challenges along with the research opportunities for realizing XaaS in wireless networks are overviewed and discussed.
