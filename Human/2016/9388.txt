Robust Ensemble Clustering Using Probability Trajectories

Although many successful ensemble clustering approaches have been developed in recent years, there are still two limitations to most of the existing approaches. First, they mostly overlook the issue of uncertain links, which may mislead the overall consensus process. Second, they generally lack the ability to incorporate global information to refine the local links. To address these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on sparse graph representation and probability trajectory analysis. In particular, we present the elite neighbor selection strategy to identify the uncertain links by locally adaptive thresholds and build a sparse graph with a small number of probably reliable links. We argue that a small number of probably reliable links can lead to significantly better consensus results than using all graph links regardless of their reliability. The random walk process driven by a new transition probability matrix is utilized to explore the global information in the graph. We derive a novel and dense similarity measure from the sparse graph by analyzing the probability trajectories of the random walkers, based on which two consensus functions are further proposed. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
