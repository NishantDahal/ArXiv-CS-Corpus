A short review and primer on using video for psychophysiological observations in human-computer interaction applications

The application of psychophysiological measures in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques. An important aspect in measuring psychophysiological variables in real-world settings is the invasiveness of the measurement setup. Video is a signal which can be captured from a distance without interrupting the subject. Furthermore, the advancements in camera technologies enable detecting a growing variety of psychophysiological phenomena from a video signal with an increasing accuracy. This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
