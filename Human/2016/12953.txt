MDS-Coded Distributed Storage for Low Delay Wireless Content Delivery

We address the use of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes for distributed storage (DS) to enable efficient content delivery in wireless networks. Content is stored in a number of the mobile devices and can be retrieved from them using device-to-device communication or, alternatively, from the base station (BS). We derive an analytical expression for the download delay in the hypothesis that the reliability state of the network is periodically restored. Our analysis shows that MDS-coded DS can dramatically reduce the download time with respect to the reference scenario where content is always downloaded from the BS.
