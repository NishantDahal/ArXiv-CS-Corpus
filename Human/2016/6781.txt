Geometric Near-neighbor Access Tree (GNAT) revisited

Geometric Near-neighbor Access Tree (GNAT) is a metric space indexing method based on hierarchical hyperplane partitioning of the space. While GNAT is very efficient in proximity searching, it has a bad reputation of being a memory hog. We show that this is partially based on too coarse analysis, and that the memory requirements can be lowered while at the same time improving the search efficiency. We also show how to make GNAT memory adaptive in a smooth way, and that the hyperplane partitioning can be replaced with ball partitioning, which can further improve the search performance. We conclude with experimental results showing the new methods can give significant performance boost.
