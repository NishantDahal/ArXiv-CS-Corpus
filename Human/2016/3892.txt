A Survey of the State of the Art in Data Mining and Integration Query Languages

The major aim of this survey is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a representative set of Data-Mining and Integration (DMI) query languages. We describe a set of properties of DMI-related languages that we use for a systematic evaluation of these languages. In addition, we introduce a scoring system that we use to quantify our opinion on how well a DMI-related language supports a property. The languages surveyed in this paper include: DMQL, MineSQL, MSQL, M2MQL, dmFSQL, OLEDB for DM, MINE RULE, and Oracle Data Mining. This survey may help researchers to propose a DMI language that is beyond the state-of-the-art, or it may help practitioners to select an existing language that fits well a purpose.
