Satisfiability Checking and Symbolic Computation

Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking are viewed as individual research areas, but they share common interests in the development, implementation and application of decision procedures for arithmetic theories. Despite these commonalities, the two communities are currently only weakly connected. We introduce a new project SC-square to build a joint community in this area, supported by a newly accepted EU (H2020-FETOPEN-CSA) project of the same name. We aim to strengthen the connection between these communities by creating common platforms, initiating interaction and exchange, identifying common challenges, and developing a common roadmap. This abstract and accompanying poster describes the motivation and aims for the project, and reports on the first activities.
