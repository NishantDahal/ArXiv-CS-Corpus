Simulating device-to-device communications in OMNeT++ with SimuLTE: scenarios and configurations

SimuLTE is a tool that enables system-level simulations of LTE/LTE-Advanced networks within OMNeT++. It is designed such that it can be plugged within network elements as an additional Network Interface Card (NIC) to those already provided by the INET framework (e.g. Wi-Fi). Recently, device-to-device (D2D) technology has been widely studied by the research community, as a mechanism to allow direct communications between devices of a LTE cellular network. In this work, we present how SimuLTE can be employed to simulate both one-to-one and one-to-many D2D communications, so that the latter can be exploited as a new communication opportunity in several research fields, like vehicular networks, IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications.
