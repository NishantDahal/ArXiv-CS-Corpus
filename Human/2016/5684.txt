Stability of Analytic Neural Networks with Event-triggered Synaptic Feedbacks

In this paper, we investigate stability of a class of analytic neural networks with the synaptic feedback via event-triggered rules. This model is general and include Hopfield neural network as a special case. These event-trigger rules can efficiently reduces loads of computation and information transmission at synapses of the neurons. The synaptic feedback of each neuron keeps a constant value based on the outputs of the other neurons at its latest triggering time but changes at its next triggering time, which is determined by certain criterion. It is proved that every trajectory of the analytic neural network converges to certain equilibrium under this event-triggered rule for all initial values except a set of zero measure. The main technique of the proof is the Lojasiewicz inequality to prove the finiteness of trajectory length. The realization of this event-triggered rule is verified by the exclusion of Zeno behaviors. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the theoretical results.
