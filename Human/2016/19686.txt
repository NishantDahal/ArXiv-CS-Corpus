Rate-Achieving Policy in Finite-Horizon Throughput Region for Multi-User Interference Channels

This paper studies a wireless network consisting of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing the same spectrum where interference is regarded as noise. Previously, the throughput region of such a network was characterized for either one time slot or an infinite time horizon. This work aims to close the gap by investigating the throughput region for transmissions over a finite time horizon. We derive an efficient algorithm to examine the achievability of any given rate in the finite-horizon throughput region and provide the rate-achieving policy. The computational efficiency of our algorithm comes from the use of A* search with a carefully chosen heuristic function and a tree pruning strategy. We also show that the celebrated max-weight algorithm which finds all achievable rates in the infinite-horizon throughput region fails to work for the finite-horizon throughput region.
