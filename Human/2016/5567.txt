On the importance and feasibility of forecasting data in sensors

The first generation of wireless sensor nodes have constrained energy resources and computational power, which discourages applications to process any task other than measuring and transmitting towards a central server. However, nowadays, sensor networks tend to be incorporated into the Internet of Things and the hardware evolution may change the old strategy of avoiding data computation in the sensor nodes. In this paper, we show the importance of reducing the number of transmissions in sensor networks and present the use of forecasting methods as a way of doing it. Experiments using real sensor data show that state-of-the-art forecasting methods can be successfully implemented in the sensor nodes to keep the quality of their measurements and reduce up to 30% of their transmissions, lowering the channel utilization. We conclude that there is an old paradigm that is no longer the most beneficial, which is the strategy of always transmitting a measurement when it differs by more than a threshold from the last one transmitted. Adopting more complex forecasting methods in the sensor nodes is the alternative to significantly reduce the number of transmissions without compromising the quality of their measurements, and therefore support the exponential growth of the Internet of Things.
