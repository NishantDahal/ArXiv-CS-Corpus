Cloud Cognitive Radio HetNets with Limited Feedback

In this paper we propose a cloud based interweave cognitive radio HetNets which combines gain of cloud based radio that is increased rate for cell edge users and better spectral efficiency of cognitive radio. Simulation results for limited feedback shows approximately 100 % increase in rate for primary while 300 % for secondary cell edge users with same outage in cloud over conventional cognitive radio network.
