Unidirectional Quorum-based Cycle Planning for Efficient Resource Utilization and Fault-Tolerance

In this paper, we propose a greedy cycle direction heuristic to improve the generalized $\mathbf{R}$ redundancy quorum cycle technique. When applied using only single cycles rather than the standard paired cycles, the generalized $\mathbf{R}$ redundancy technique has been shown to almost halve the necessary light-trail resources in the network. Our greedy heuristic improves this cycle-based routing technique's fault-tolerance and dependability.
  For efficiency and distributed control, it is common in distributed systems and algorithms to group nodes into intersecting sets referred to as quorum sets. Optimal communication quorum sets forming optical cycles based on light-trails have been shown to flexibly and efficiently route both point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint traffic requests. Commonly cycle routing techniques will use pairs of cycles to achieve both routing and fault-tolerance, which uses substantial resources and creates the potential for underutilization. Instead, we use a single cycle and intentionally utilize $\mathbf{R}$ redundancy within the quorum cycles such that every point-to-point communication pairs occur in at least $\mathbf{R}$ cycles. Without the paired cycles the direction of the quorum cycles becomes critical to the fault tolerance performance. For this we developed a greedy cycle direction heuristic and our single fault network simulations show a reduction of missing pairs by greater than 30%, which translates to significant improvements in fault coverage.
