Product Offerings in Malicious Hacker Markets

Marketplaces specializing in malicious hacking products - including malware and exploits - have recently become more prominent on the darkweb and deepweb. We scrape 17 such sites and collect information about such products in a unified database schema. Using a combination of manual labeling and unsupervised clustering, we examine a corpus of products in order to understand their various categories and how they become specialized with respect to vendor and marketplace. This initial study presents how we effectively employed unsupervised techniques to this data as well as the types of insights we gained on various categories of malicious hacking products.
