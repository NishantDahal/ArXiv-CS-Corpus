Extended Hardness Results for Approximate Gröbner Basis Computation

Two models were recently proposed to explore the robust hardness of Gröbner basis computation. Given a polynomial system, both models allow an algorithm to selectively ignore some of the polynomials: the algorithm is only responsible for returning a Gröbner basis for the ideal generated by the remaining polynomials. For the $q$-Fractional Gröbner Basis Problem the algorithm is allowed to ignore a constant $(1-q)$-fraction of the polynomials (subject to one natural structural constraint). Here we prove a new strongest-parameter result: even if the algorithm is allowed to choose a $(3/10-ε)$-fraction of the polynomials to ignore, and need only compute a Gröbner basis with respect to some lexicographic order for the remaining polynomials, this cannot be accomplished in polynomial time (unless $P=NP$). This statement holds even if every polynomial has maximum degree 3. Next, we prove the first robust hardness result for polynomial systems of maximum degree 2: for the $q$-Fractional model a $(1/5-ε)$ fraction of the polynomials may be ignored without losing provable NP-Hardness. Both theorems hold even if every polynomial contains at most three distinct variables. Finally, for the Strong $c$-partial Gröbner Basis Problem of De Loera et al. we give conditional results that depend on famous (unresolved) conjectures of Khot and Dinur, et al.
