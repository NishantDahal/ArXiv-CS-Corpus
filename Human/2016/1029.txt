Network Topology Adaptation and Interference Coordination for Energy Saving in Heterogeneous Networks

Interference coupling in heterogeneous networks introduces the inherent non-convexity to the network resource optimization problem, hindering the development of effective solutions. A new framework based on multi-pattern formulation has been proposed in this paper to study the energy efficient strategy for joint cell activation, user association and multicell multiuser channel allocation. One key feature of this interference pattern formulation is that the patterns remain fixed and independent of the optimization process. This creates a favorable opportunity for a linear programming formulation while still taking interference coupling into account. A tailored algorithm is developed to solve the formulated network energy saving problem in the dual domain by exploiting the problem structure, which gives a significant complexity saving compared to using standard solvers. Numerical results show a huge improvement in energy saving achieved by the proposed scheme.
