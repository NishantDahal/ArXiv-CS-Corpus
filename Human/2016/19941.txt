Analysis and Evaluation of Real-time and Safety Characteristics of IEEE 802.11p protocol in VANET

The need for safety in transportation systems has increased the popularity and applicability of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) in recent years. On-time reception and processing of alarms caused by possible accidents as well as the preventive actions have important roles in reducing human and financial losses in road accidents. In such cases, the performance of safety applications should be evaluated and guaranteed to show whether or not they can ensure the safety of humans and cars. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks by checking the real-time properties of the IEEE 802.11p protocol using a Colored Petri Net model. To analyze the performance of related standards, simulations are conducted using CPNTools. Standards from European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and Vehicle Safety Communications (VSC) are evaluated in this research. We will show that such standards may not completely fulfill the safety requirements in particular situations.
