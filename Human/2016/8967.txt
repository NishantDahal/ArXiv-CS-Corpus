IT Governance in Actor-Network Mode of Collaboration : Cost Management Process Based on Game Theory

IT governance, like global governance of projects, requires cooperation between several actors. In general, such cooperation builds a collaboration network between entities. Many works in the literature interested in collaboration network, but no one of them were focused directly on how to build a network in an IT governance perspective. In this paper, we investigate how game theory can be exploited to provide a formal implementation of Cost Management Process, while highlighting Actor-Network as a framework of collaboration and its incentive stage as a key step for network construction. Our objective is to propose an approach of network establishment, by inciting actors through cost savings. For that, we use Shapley Value to answer the question: For the sake of IT governance, which coalitions are likely to form in order to ensure best cost-saving objectives in ANT mode of collaboration? A graphical tool is developed also to visualize and simulate networks evolution.
