DeMIAN: Deep Modality Invariant Adversarial Network

Obtaining common representations from different modalities is important in that they are interchangeable with each other in a classification problem. For example, we can train a classifier on image features in the common representations and apply it to the testing of the text features in the representations. Existing multi-modal representation learning methods mainly aim to extract rich information from paired samples and train a classifier by the corresponding labels; however, collecting paired samples and their labels simultaneously involves high labor costs. Addressing paired modal samples without their labels and single modal data with their labels independently is much easier than addressing labeled multi-modal data. To obtain the common representations under such a situation, we propose to make the distributions over different modalities similar in the learned representations, namely modality-invariant representations. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm for modality-invariant representation learning, named Deep Modality Invariant Adversarial Network (DeMIAN), which utilizes the idea of Domain Adaptation (DA). Using the modality-invariant representations learned by DeMIAN, we achieved better classification accuracy than with the state-of-the-art methods, especially for some benchmark datasets of zero-shot learning.
