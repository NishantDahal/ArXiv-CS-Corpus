The Importance of Computing Education Research

Interest in computer science is growing. As a result, computer science (CS) and related departments are experiencing an explosive increase in undergraduate enrollments and unprecedented demand from other disciplines for learning computing. According to the 2014 CRA Taulbee Survey, the number of undergraduates declaring a computing major at Ph.D. granting departments in the US has increased 60% from 2011-2014 and the number of degrees granted has increased by 34% from 2008-2013. However, this growth is not limited to higher education. New York City, San Francisco and Oakland public schools will soon be offering computer science to all students at all schools from preschool to 12th grade, although it will be an elective for high school students. This unprecedented demand means that CS departments are likely to teach not only more students in the coming decades, but more diverse students, with more varied backgrounds, motivations, preparations, and abilities.
  This growth is an unparalleled opportunity to expand the reach of computing education. However, this growth is also a unique research challenge, as we know very little about how best to teach our current students, let alone the students soon to arrive. The burgeoning field of Computing Education Research (CER) is positioned to address this challenge by answering research questions such as, how should we teach computer science, from programming to advanced principles, to a broader and more diverse audience? We argue that computer science departments should lead the way in establishing CER as a foundational research area of computer science, discovering the best ways to teach CS, and inventing the best technologies with which to teach it. This white paper provides a snapshot of the current state of CER and makes actionable recommendations for academic leaders to grow CER as a successful research area in their departments.
