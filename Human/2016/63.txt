Analysis of Distributed Snapshot Algorithms

Snapshot recording durations at each process contribute to the overall efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper we are presenting the observed variations in snapshot recording durations at processes in a distributed system. We conclude with key characteristics of a reliable and effective snapshot algorithm. Simulations were achieved using SimGrid Java API.
