An Extended Stochastic Model for Quantitative Security Analysis of Networked Systems

Quantitative security analysis of networked computer systems is one of the decades-long open problems in computer security. Recently, a promising approach was proposed in \cite{XuTDSC11}, which however made some strong assumptions including the exponential distribution of, and the independence between, the relevant random variables. In this paper, we substantially weaken these assumptions while offering, in addition to the same types of analytical results as in \cite{XuTDSC11}, methods for obtaining the desired security quantities in practice. Moreover, we investigate the problem from a higher-level abstraction, which also leads to both analytical results and practical methods for obtaining the desired security quantities. These would represent a significant step toward ultimately solving the problem of quantitative security analysis of networked computer systems.
