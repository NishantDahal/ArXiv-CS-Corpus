Don't let Google know I'm lonely!

From buying books to finding the perfect partner, we share our most intimate wants and needs with our favourite online systems. But how far should we accept promises of privacy in the face of personal profiling? In particular we ask how can we improve detection of sensitive topic profiling by online systems? We propose a definition of privacy disclosure we call Îµ-indistinguishability from which we construct scalable, practical tools to assess an adversaries learning potential. We demonstrate our results using openly available resources, detecting a learning rate in excess of 98% for a range of sensitive topics during our experiments.
