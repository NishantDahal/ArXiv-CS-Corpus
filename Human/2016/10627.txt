Knowledge Representation on the Web revisited: Tools for Prototype Based Ontologies

In recent years RDF and OWL have become the most common knowledge representation languages in use on the Web, propelled by the recommendation of the W3C. In this paper we present a practical implementation of a different kind of knowledge representation based on Prototypes. In detail, we present a concrete syntax easily and effectively parsable by applications. We also present extensible implementations of a prototype knowledge base, specifically designed for storage of Prototypes. These implementations are written in Java and can be extended by using the implementation as a library. Alternatively, the software can be deployed as such. Further, results of benchmarks for both local and web deployment are presented. This paper augments a research paper, in which we describe the more theoretical aspects of our Prototype system.
