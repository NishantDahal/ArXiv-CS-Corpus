Extreme Scale-out SuperMUC Phase 2 - lessons learned

In spring 2015, the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, LRZ), installed their new Peta-Scale System SuperMUC Phase2. Selected users were invited for a 28 day extreme scale-out block operation during which they were allowed to use the full system for their applications. The following projects participated in the extreme scale-out workshop: BQCD (Quantum Physics), SeisSol (Geophysics, Seismics), GPI-2/GASPI (Toolkit for HPC), Seven-League Hydro (Astrophysics), ILBDC (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Iphigenie (Molecular Dynamic), FLASH (Astrophysics), GADGET (Cosmological Dynamics), PSC (Plasma Physics), waLBerla (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Musubi (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Vertex3D (Stellar Astrophysics), CIAO (Combustion CFD), and LS1-Mardyn (Material Science). The projects were allowed to use the machine exclusively during the 28 day period, which corresponds to a total of 63.4 million core-hours, of which 43.8 million core-hours were used by the applications, resulting in a utilization of 69%. The top 3 users were using 15.2, 6.4, and 4.7 million core-hours, respectively.
