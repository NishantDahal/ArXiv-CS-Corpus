Graph based linear error correcting codes

In this article we present a construction of error correcting codes, that have representation as very sparse matrices and belong to the class of Low Density Parity Check Codes. LDPC codes are in the classical Hamming metric. They are very close to well known Shannon bound. The ability to use graphs for code construction was first discussed by Tanner in 1981 and has been used in a number of very effective implementations. We describe how to construct such codes by using special a family of graphs introduced by Ustimenko and Woldar. Graphs that we used are bipartite, bi-regular, very sparse and do not have short cycles C 4 . Due to the very low density of such graphs, the obtained codes are fast decodable. We describe how to choose parameters to obtain a desired code rate. We also show results of computer simulations of BER (bit error rate) of the obtained codes in order to compare them with other known LDPC codes.
