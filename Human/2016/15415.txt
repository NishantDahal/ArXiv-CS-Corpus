Minimal unsatisfiability and deficiency: recent developments

Starting with Aharoni and Linial in 1986, the deficiency delta(F) = c(F) - n(F) >= 1 for minimally unsatisfiable clause-sets F, the difference of the number of clauses and the number of variables, is playing an important role in investigations into the structure of minimal unsatisfiability. The talk belonging to this extended abstract, available at http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csoliver/papers.html#BORDEAUX2016 , gives a high-level overview on recent developments.
