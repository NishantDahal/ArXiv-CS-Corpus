Acoustic intensity, energy-density and diffuseness estimation in a directionally-constrained region

This work presents a method for estimation of the acoustic intensity, the energy density and the associated sound field diffuseness around the origin, when the sound field is weighted with a spatial filter. The method permits energetic DOA estimation and sound field characterization focused in a specific angular region determined by the beam pattern of the spatial filter. The formulation of the estimators is presented and their behavior is analyzed for the fundamental cases useful in parametric sound field models of a single plane wave, a uniform diffuse field and a mixture of the two.
