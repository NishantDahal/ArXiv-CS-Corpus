Probabilistic Programming and PyMC3

In recent years sports analytics has gotten more and more popular. We propose a model for Rugby data - in particular to model the 2014 Six Nations tournament. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the characteristics that bring a team to lose or win a game, and predict the score of particular matches. This is intended to be a brief introduction to Probabilistic Programming in Python and in particular the powerful library called PyMC3.
