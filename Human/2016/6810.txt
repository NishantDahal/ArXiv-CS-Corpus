Memristor model based on fuzzy window function

Memristor (memory-resistor) is the fourth passive circuit element. We introduce a memristor model based on a fuzzy logic window function. Fuzzy models are flexible, which enables the capture of the pinched hysteresis behavior of the memristor. The introduced fuzzy model avoids common problems associated with window-function based memristor models, such as the terminal state problem, and the symmetry issues. The model captures the memristor behavior with a simple rule-base which gives an insight of how memristors work. Because of the flexibility offered by the fuzzy system, shape and distribution of input and output membership functions can be tuned to capture the behavior of various real memristors.
