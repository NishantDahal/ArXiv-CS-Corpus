Predicting User Roles in Social Networks using Transfer Learning with Feature Transformation

How can we recognise social roles of people, given a completely unlabelled social network? We present a transfer learning approach to network role classification based on feature transformations from each network's local feature distribution to a global feature space. Experiments are carried out on real-world datasets. (See manuscript for the full abstract.)
