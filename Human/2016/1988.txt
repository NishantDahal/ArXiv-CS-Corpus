Human Machine Epistemology Survey

Pluridisciplinar convergence is a major problem that had emerged with Human-Artefact Systems and so-called " Augmented Humanity " as academical fields and even more as technical fields. Problems come mainly from the juxtaposition of two very different types of system, a biological one and an artificial one. Thus, conceiving and designing the multiple couplings between them has become a major difficulty. Some came with reductionnist solutions to answer these problems but since we know that a biological system and a technical system are different, this approach is limited from its beginning. Using a specifically designed questionnaire and statistical analysis we determined how specialists (medical practitioners, ergonomists and engineers) in the domain conceive themselves what is a Human-Artifact System and how they relate to existent traditions and showed that some of them relate to the integrativist views.
