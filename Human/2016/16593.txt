The Generalized Metastable Switch Memristor Model

Memristor device modeling is currently a heavily researched topic and is becoming ever more important as memristor devices make their way into CMOS circuit designs, necessitating accurate and efficient memristor circuit simulations. In this paper, the Generalized Metastable Switch (MSS) memristor model is presented. The Generalized MSS model consists of a voltage-dependent stochastic component and a voltage-dependent exponential diode current component and is designed to be easy to implement, computationally efficient, and amenable to modeling a wide range of different memristor devices.
