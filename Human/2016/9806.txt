Hankel Matrices for Weighted Visibly Pushdown Automata

Hankel matrices (aka connection matrices) of word functions and graph parameters have wide applications in automata theory, graph theory, and machine learning. We give a characterization of real-valued functions on nested words recognized by weighted visibly pushdown automata in terms of Hankel matrices on nested words. This complements C. Mathissen's characterization in terms of weighted monadic second order logic.
