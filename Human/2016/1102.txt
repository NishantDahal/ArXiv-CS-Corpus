A survey of discrete methods in (algebraic) statistics for networks

Sampling algorithms, hypergraph degree sequences, and polytopes play a crucial role in statistical analysis of network data. This article offers a brief overview of open problems in this area of discrete mathematics from the point of view of a particular family of statistical models for networks called exponential random graph models. The problems and underlying constructions are also related to well-known concepts in commutative algebra and graph-theoretic concepts in computer science. We outline a few lines of recent work that highlight the natural connection between these fields and unify them into some open problems. While these problems are often relevant in discrete mathematics in their own right, the emphasis here is on statistical relevance with the hope that these lines of research do not remain disjoint. Suggested specific open problems and general research questions should advance algebraic statistics theory as well as applied statistical tools for rigorous statistical analysis of networks.
