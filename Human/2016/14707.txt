Graphic TSP in cubic graphs

We present a polynomial-time 9/7-approximation algorithm for the graphic TSP for cubic graphs, which improves the previously best approximation factor of 1.3 for 2-connected cubic graphs and drops the requirement of 2-connectivity at the same time. To design our algorithm, we prove that every simple 2-connected cubic n-vertex graph contains a spanning closed walk of length at most 9n/7-1, and that such a walk can be found in polynomial time.
