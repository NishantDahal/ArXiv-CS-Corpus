Quasi Linear Codes: Application to Point-to-Point and Multi-Terminal Source Coding

A new ensemble of structured codes is introduced. These codes are called Quasi Linear Codes (QLC). The QLC's are constructed by taking subsets of linear codes. They have a looser structure compared to linear codes and are not closed under addition. We argue that these codes provide gains in terms of achievable Rate-Distortions (RD) in different multi-terminal source coding problems. We derive the necessary covering bounds for analyzing the performance of QLC's. We then consider the Multiple-Descriptions (MD) problem, and prove through an example that the application of QLC's gives an improved achievable RD region for this problem. Finally, we derive an inner bound to the achievable RD region for the general MD problem which strictly contains all of the previous known achievable regions.
