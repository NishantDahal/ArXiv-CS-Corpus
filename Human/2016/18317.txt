Rough Set Based Color Channel Selection

Color channel selection is essential for accurate segmentation of sky and clouds in images obtained from ground-based sky cameras. Most prior works in cloud segmentation use threshold based methods on color channels selected in an ad-hoc manner. In this letter, we propose the use of rough sets for color channel selection in visible-light images. Our proposed approach assesses color channels with respect to their contribution for segmentation, and identifies the most effective ones.
