Robust Design of Spectrum-Sharing Networks

In spectrum-sharing networks, primary users have the right to preempt secondary users, which significantly degrades the performance of underlying secondary users. In this paper, we use backup channels to provide reliability guarantees for secondary users. In particular, we study the optimal white channel assignment that minimizes the amount of recovery capacity (i.e., bandwidth of backup channels) needed to meet a given reliability guarantee. This problem is shown to be coupled by two NP-hard objectives. We characterize the structure of the optimal assignment and develop bi-criteria approximation algorithms. Moreover, we investigate the scaling of the recovery capacity as the network size becomes large. It is shown that the recovery capacity is negligible as compared to the total traffic demands in a large-scale network.
