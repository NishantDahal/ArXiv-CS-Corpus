A Distributed Multi Agents Based Platform for High Performance Computing Infrastructures

This work introduces a novel, modular, layered web based platform for managing machine learning experiments on grid-based High Performance Computing infrastructures. The coupling of the communication services offered by the grid, with an administration layer and conventional web server programming, via a data synchronization utility, leads to the straightforward development of a web-based user interface that allows the monitoring and managing of diverse online distributed computing applications. It also introduces an experiment generation and monitoring tool particularly suitable for investigating machine learning in game playing. The platform is demonstrated with experiments for two different games.
