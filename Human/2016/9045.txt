Parameterized Algorithmics for Graph Modification Problems: On Interactions with Heuristics

In graph modification problems, one is given a graph G and the goal is to apply a minimum number of modification operations (such as edge deletions) to G such that the resulting graph fulfills a certain property. For example, the Cluster Deletion problem asks to delete as few edges as possible such that the resulting graph is a disjoint union of cliques. Graph modification problems appear in numerous applications, including the analysis of biological and social networks. Typically, graph modification problems are NP-hard, making them natural candidates for parameterized complexity studies. We discuss several fruitful interactions between the development of fixed-parameter algorithms and the design of heuristics for graph modification problems, featuring quite different aspects of mutual benefits.
