Efficient initials for computing maximal eigenpair

This paper introduces some efficient initials for a well-known algorithm (an inverse iteration) for computing the maximal eigenpair of a class of real matrices. The initials not only avoid the collapse of the algorithm but are also unexpectedly efficient. The initials presented here are based on our analytic estimates of the maximal eigenvalue and a mimic of its eigenvector for many years of accumulation in the study of stochastic stability speed. In parallel, the same problem for computing the next to the maximal eigenpair is also studied.
