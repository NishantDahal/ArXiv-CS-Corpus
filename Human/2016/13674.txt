Interaction Graphs: Nondeterministic Automata

This paper exhibits a series of semantic characterisations of sublinear nondeterministic complexity classes. These results fall into the general domain of logic-based approaches to complexity theory and so-called implicit computational complexity (ICC), i.e. descriptions of complexity classes without reference to specific machine models. In particular, it relates strongly to ICC results based on linear logic since the semantic framework considered stems from work on the latter. Moreover, the obtained characterisations are of a geometric nature: each class is characterised by a specific action of a group by measure-preserving maps.
