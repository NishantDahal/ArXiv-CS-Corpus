Closed Form Fractional Integration and Differentiation via Real Exponentially Spaced Pole-Zero Pairs

We derive closed-form expressions for the poles and zeros of approximate fractional integrator/differentiator filters, which correspond to spectral roll-off filters having any desired log-log slope to a controllable degree of accuracy over any bandwidth. The filters can be described as a uniform exponential distribution of poles along the negative-real axis of the s plane, with zeros interleaving them. Arbitrary spectral slopes are obtained by sliding the array of zeros relative to the array of poles, where each array maintains periodic spacing on a log scale. The nature of the slope approximation is close to Chebyshev optimal in the interior of the pole-zero array, approaching conjectured Chebyshev optimality over all frequencies in the limit as the order approaches infinity. Practical designs can arbitrarily approach the equal-ripple approximation by enlarging the pole-zero array band beyond the desired frequency band. The spectral roll-off slope can be robustly modulated in real time by varying only the zeros controlled by one slope parameter. Software implementations are provided in matlab and Faust.
