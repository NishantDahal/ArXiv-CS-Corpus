Multiple Instance Dictionary Learning using Functions of Multiple Instances

A multiple instance dictionary learning method using functions of multiple instances (DL-FUMI) is proposed to address target detection and two-class classification problems with inaccurate training labels. Given inaccurate training labels, DL-FUMI learns a set of target dictionary atoms that describe the most distinctive and representative features of the true positive class as well as a set of nontarget dictionary atoms that account for the shared information found in both the positive and negative instances. Experimental results show that the estimated target dictionary atoms found by DL-FUMI are more representative prototypes and identify better discriminative features of the true positive class than existing methods in the literature. DL-FUMI is shown to have significantly better performance on several target detection and classification problems as compared to other multiple instance learning (MIL) dictionary learning algorithms on a variety of MIL problems.
