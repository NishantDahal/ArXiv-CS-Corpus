On Modeling Coverage and Rate of Random Cellular Networks under Generic Channel Fading

In this paper we provide an analytic framework for computing the expected downlink coverage probability, and the associated data rate of cellular networks, where base stations are distributed in a random manner. The provided expressions are in computable integral forms that accommodate generic channel fading conditions. We develop these expressions by modelling the cellular interference using stochastic geometry analysis, then we employ them for comparing the coverage resulting from various channel fading conditions namely Rayleigh and Rician fading, in addition to the fading-less channel. Furthermore, we expand the work to accommodate the effects of random frequency reuse on the cellular coverage and rate. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis, where the results show a very close match.
