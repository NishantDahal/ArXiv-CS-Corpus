From Events to Reactions: A Progress Report

Syndicate is a new coordinated, concurrent programming language. It occupies a novel point on the spectrum between the shared-everything paradigm of threads and the shared-nothing approach of actors. Syndicate actors exchange messages and share common knowledge via a carefully controlled database that clearly scopes conversations. This approach clearly simplifies coordination of concurrent activities. Experience in programming with Syndicate, however, suggests a need to raise the level of linguistic abstraction. In addition to writing event handlers and managing event subscriptions directly, the language will have to support a reactive style of programming. This paper presents event-oriented Syndicate programming and then describes a preliminary design for augmenting it with new reactive programming constructs.
