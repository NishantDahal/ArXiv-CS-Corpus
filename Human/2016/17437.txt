Purchasing a C_4 online

Let $G$ be a graph with edge set $(e_1,e_2,...e_N)$. We independently associate to each edge $e_i$ of $G$ a cost ${x}_i$ that is drawn from a Uniform [0, 1] distribution. Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of targeted structures that consists of subgraphs of $G$. We would like to buy a subset of $\mathcal{F}$ at small cost, however we do not know a priori the values of the random variables ${x}_1,...,{x}_N$. Instead, we inspect the random variables $x_i$ one at a time. As soon as we inspect the random variable associated with the cost of an edge we have to decide whether we want to buy that edge or reject it for ever.
  In the present paper we consider the case where $G$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices and $\mathcal{F}$ is the set of all $C_4$ -cycles on 4 vertices- out of which we want to buy one.
