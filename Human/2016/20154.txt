Characterising radio telescope software with the Workload Characterisation Framework

We present a modular framework, the Workload Characterisation Framework (WCF), that is developed to reproducibly obtain, store and compare key characteristics of radio astronomy processing software. As a demonstration, we discuss the experiences using the framework to characterise a LOFAR calibration and imaging pipeline.
