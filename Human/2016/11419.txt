Friction from Reflectance: Deep Reflectance Codes for Predicting Physical Surface Properties from One-Shot In-Field Reflectance

Images are the standard input for vision algorithms, but one-shot infield reflectance measurements are creating new opportunities for recognition and scene understanding. In this work, we address the question of what reflectance can reveal about materials in an efficient manner. We go beyond the question of recognition and labeling and ask the question: What intrinsic physical properties of the surface can be estimated using reflectance? We introduce a framework that enables prediction of actual friction values for surfaces using one-shot reflectance measurements. This work is a first of its kind vision-based friction estimation. We develop a novel representation for reflectance disks that capture partial BRDF measurements instantaneously. Our method of deep reflectance codes combines CNN features and fisher vector pooling with optimal binary embedding to create codes that have sufficient discriminatory power and have important properties of illumination and spatial invariance. The experimental results demonstrate that reflectance can play a new role in deciphering the underlying physical properties of real-world scenes.
