The complexity of bit retrieval

Bit retrieval is the problem of reconstructing a binary sequence from its periodic autocorrelation, with applications in cryptography and x-ray crystallography. After defining the problem, with and without noise, we describe and compare various algorithms for solving it. A geometrical constraint satisfaction algorithm, relaxed-reflect-reflect, is currently the best algorithm for noisy bit retrieval.
