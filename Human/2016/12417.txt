Prutor: A System for Tutoring CS1 and Collecting Student Programs for Analysis

An introductory programming course (CS1) is an integral part of any undergraduate curriculum. Due to large number and diverse programming background of students, providing timely and personalised feedback to individual students is a challenging task for any CS1 instructor. The help provided by teaching assistants (typically senior students) is not sufficient as it suffers from unintentional bias and, most of the time, not quick enough.
  In this paper, we present Prutor, a tutoring system platform to conduct introductory programming courses. Prutor is a cloud-based web application that provides instant and useful feedback to students while solving programming problems. Prutor stores, at regular intervals, the snapshots of students' attempts to solve programming problems. These intermediate versions of the student programs provide the instructors (and data analysts) a view of the students' approach to solving programming problems. Since Prutor is accessible through any standard web browser, students do not need to worry about dependencies external to the programming course, viz. Operating Systems, Editors, Compilers, Compiler Options, etc.. This enables the students to focus on solving only the programming problems. Apart from the code snapshots at regular intervals, Prutor also collects other valuable data such as the time taken by the students to solve the problems, the number of compile and execution events, and the errors made. We have used this data in developing intelligent tools for giving feedback to students, some of which are described briefly in this paper. This system thus serves as a platform for tutoring as well as data collection for researchers.
