Distortion Bounds for Transmitting Correlated Sources with Common Part over MAC

This paper investigates the joint source-channel coding problem of sending two correlated memoryless sources with common part over a memoryless multiple access channel (MAC). An inner bound and two outer bounds on the achievable distortion region are derived. In particular, they respectively recover the existing bounds for several special cases, such as communication without common part, lossless communication, and noiseless communication. When specialized to quadratic Gaussian communication case, transmitting Gaussian sources with Gaussian common part over Gaussian MAC, the inner bound and outer bound are used to generate two new bounds. Numerical result shows that common part improves the distortion of such distributed source-channel coding problem.
