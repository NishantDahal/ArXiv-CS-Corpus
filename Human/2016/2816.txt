Exact Solutions for M/M/c/Setup Queues

Recently multiserver queues with setup times have been extensively studied because they have applications in power-saving data centers. The most challenging model is the M/M/$c$/Setup queue where a server is turned off when it is idle and is turned on if there are some waiting jobs. Recently, Gandhi et al.~(SIGMETRICS 2013, QUESTA 2014) present the recursive renewal reward approach as a new mathematical tool to analyze the model. In this paper, we derive exact solutions for the same model using two alternative methodologies: generating function approach and matrix analytic method. The former yields several theoretical insights into the systems while the latter provides an exact recursive algorithm to calculate the joint stationary distribution and then some performance measures so as to give new application insights.
