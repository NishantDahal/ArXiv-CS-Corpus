A Grassmannian Graph Approach to Affine Invariant Feature Matching

In this work, we present a novel and practical approach to address one of the longstanding problems in computer vision: 2D and 3D affine invariant feature matching. Our Grassmannian Graph (GrassGraph) framework employs a two stage procedure that is capable of robustly recovering correspondences between two unorganized, affinely related feature (point) sets. The first stage maps the feature sets to an affine invariant Grassmannian representation, where the features are mapped into the same subspace. It turns out that coordinate representations extracted from the Grassmannian differ by an arbitrary orthonormal matrix. In the second stage, by approximating the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO) on these coordinates, this extra orthonormal factor is nullified, providing true affine-invariant coordinates which we then utilize to recover correspondences via simple nearest neighbor relations. The resulting GrassGraph algorithm is empirically shown to work well in non-ideal scenarios with noise, outliers, and occlusions. Our validation benchmarks use an unprecedented 440,000+ experimental trials performed on 2D and 3D datasets, with a variety of parameter settings and competing methods. State-of-the-art performance in the majority of these extensive evaluations confirm the utility of our method.
