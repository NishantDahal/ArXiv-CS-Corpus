Jolie Good Buildings: Internet of things for smart building infrastructure supporting concurrent apps utilizing distributed microservices

A large percentage of buildings, domestic or special-purpose, is expected to become increasingly "smarter" in the future, due to the immense benefits in terms of energy saving, safety, flexibility, and comfort, that relevant new technologies offer. However, concerning the hardware, software, or platform levels, no clearly dominant standard frameworks currently exist. Here, we will present a prototype platform for supporting multiple concurrent applications for smart buildings, which is utilizing an advanced sensor network as well as a distributed micro services architecture, centrally featuring the Jolie language. The architecture and benefits of our system are discussed, as well as a prototype containing a number of nodes and a user interface, deployed in a real-world academic building environment. Our results illustrate the promising nature of our approach, as well as open avenues for future work towards it wider and larger scale applicability.
