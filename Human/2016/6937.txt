Overcoming the language barrier in mobile user interface design: A case study on a mobile health app

This research report proposes a structured solution to address the need for awareness of cultural and language in user design. It will include evaluated research on established methods that already exist. Discussed ideas about how to address this situation include: what others have found to take into consideration when using design principles to develop an interface, detailed troubles and critical issues that have been previously identified and also ways that have been found already to overcome such issues. This will also involve designing a prototype application catering to resolving these issues. Overcoming the language barrier plays an important role in the process of implementing a user design interface that will satisfy users. This issue must be researched and examined to identify the issues and concerns associated in order to provide a solution in an ethical manner.
