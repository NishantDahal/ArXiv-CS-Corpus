FolksoDrivenCloud: an annotation and process application for social collaborative networking

In this paper we present the FolksoDriven Cloud (FDC) built on Cloud and on Semantic technologies. Cloud computing has emerged in these recent years as the new paradigm for the provision of on-demand distributed computing resources. Semantic Web can be used for relationship between different data and descriptions of services to annotate provenance of repositories on ontologies. The FDC service is composed of a back-end which submits and monitors the documents, and a user front-end which allows users to schedule on-demand operations and to watch the progress of running processes. The impact of the proposed method is illustrated on a user since its inception.
