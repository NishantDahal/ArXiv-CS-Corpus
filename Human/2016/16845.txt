Arbitrarily Varying Wiretap Channels with Type Constrained States

An arbitrarily varying wiretap channel (AVWTC) with a type constraint on the allowed state sequences is considered, and a single-letter characterization of its correlated-random (CR) assisted semantic-security (SS) capacity is derived. The allowed state sequences are the ones in a typical set around a single constraining type. SS is established by showing that the mutual information between the message and the eavesdropper's observations is negligible even when maximized over all message distributions, choices of state sequences and realizations of the CR-code. Both the achievability and the converse proofs of the type constrained coding theorem rely on stronger claims than actually required. The direct part establishes a novel single-letter lower bound on the CR-assisted SS-capacity of an AVWTC with state sequences constrained by any convex and closed set of state probability mass functions. This bound achieves the best known single-letter secrecy rates for a corresponding compound wiretap channel over the same constraint set. In contrast to other single-letter results in the AVWTC literature, this work does not assume the existence of a best channel to the eavesdropper. Instead, SS follows by leveraging the heterogeneous version of the stronger soft-covering lemma and a CR-code reduction argument. Optimality is a consequence of an max-inf upper bound on the CR-assisted SS-capacity of an AVWTC with state sequences constrained to any collection of type-classes. When adjusted to the aforementioned compound WTC, the upper bound simplifies to a max-min structure, thus strengthening the previously best known single-letter upper bound by Liang et al. that has a min-max form. The proof of the upper bound uses a novel distribution coupling argument.
