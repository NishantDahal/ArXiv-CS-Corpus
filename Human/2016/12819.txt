A Framework for Context-Driven End-to-End QoS Control in Converged Networks

This paper presents a framework for context-driven policy-based QoS control and end-to-end resource management in converged next generation networks. The Converged Networks QoS Framework (CNQF) is being developed within the IU-ATC project, and comprises distributed functional entities whose instances co-ordinate the converged network infrastructure to facilitate scalable and efficient end-to-end QoS management. The CNQF design leverages aspects of TISPAN, IETF and 3GPP policy-based management architectures whilst also introducing important innovative extensions to support context-aware QoS control in converged networks. The framework architecture is presented and its functionalities and operation in specific application scenarios are described.
