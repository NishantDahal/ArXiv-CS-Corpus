Fast Sampling for Strongly Rayleigh Measures with Application to Determinantal Point Processes

In this note we consider sampling from (non-homogeneous) strongly Rayleigh probability measures. As an important corollary, we obtain a fast mixing Markov Chain sampler for Determinantal Point Processes.
