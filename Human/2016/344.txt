Efficient Processing of Reachability and Time-Based Path Queries in a Temporal Graph

A temporal graph is a graph in which vertices communicate with each other at specific time, e.g., $A$ calls $B$ at 11 a.m. and talks for 7 minutes, which is modeled by an edge from $A$ to $B$ with starting time "11 a.m." and duration "7 mins". Temporal graphs can be used to model many networks with time-related activities, but efficient algorithms for analyzing temporal graphs are severely inadequate. We study fundamental problems such as answering reachability and time-based path queries in a temporal graph, and propose an efficient indexing technique specifically designed for processing these queries in a temporal graph. Our results show that our method is efficient and scalable in both index construction and query processing.
