Proofs of the Technical Results Justifying an Algorithm of Reactive 3D Navigation for a Surface Scan by a Nonholonomic Mobile Robot

A single nonholonomic under-actuated mobile robot with a bounded control range travels in a 3D workspace. This workspace also hosts a compact unknown domain with a smooth boundary. The robot has access to the horizontal distance to this domain and to a certain direction (typically, vertical) in the space, along with its coordinate (typically, altitude) in this direction. We present a new navigation law that drives the robot to the desired distance to the domain and ensures subsequent full scan of its surface within a desired range of "altitudes". The proposed strategy is computationally inexpensive and achieves full scan at the lowest control level via generating the current control as a simple, reflex-like reaction to the current observation. The paper presents and proves key technical facts underlying mathematically rigorous analysis and justification of the proposed guidance approach.
