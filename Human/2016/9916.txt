Analysis of an offloading scheme for data centers in the framework of fog computing

In the context of fog computing, we consider a simple case when data centers are installed at the edge of the network and assume that if a request arrives at an overloaded data center, then it is forwarded to a neighboring data center with some probability. Data centers are assumed to have a large number of servers and that traffic at some of them is causing saturation. In this case the other data centers may help to cope with this saturation regime by accepting some of the rejected requests. Our aim is to qualitatively estimate the gain achieved via cooperation between neighboring data centers. After proving some convergence results, related to the scaling limits of loss systems, for the process describing the number of free servers at both data centers, we show that the performance of the system can be expressed in terms of the invariant distribution of a random walk in the quarter plane. By using and developing existing results in the technical literature, explicit formulas for the blocking rates of such a system are derived.
