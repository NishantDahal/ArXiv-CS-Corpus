Active Detection and Localization of Textureless Objects in Cluttered Environments

This paper introduces an active object detection and localization framework that combines a robust untextured object detection and 3D pose estimation algorithm with a novel next-best-view selection strategy. We address the detection and localization problems by proposing an edge-based registration algorithm that refines the object position by minimizing a cost directly extracted from a 3D image tensor that encodes the minimum distance to an edge point in a joint direction/location space. We face the next-best-view problem by exploiting a sequential decision process that, for each step, selects the next camera position which maximizes the mutual information between the state and the next observations. We solve the intrinsic intractability of this solution by generating observations that represent scene realizations, i.e. combination samples of object hypothesis provided by the object detector, while modeling the state by means of a set of constantly resampled particles. Experiments performed on different real world, challenging datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
