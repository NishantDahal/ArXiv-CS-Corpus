Fast Object Localization Using a CNN Feature Map Based Multi-Scale Search

Object localization is an important task in computer vision but requires a large amount of computational power due mainly to an exhaustive multiscale search on the input image. In this paper, we describe a near real-time multiscale search on a deep CNN feature map that does not use region proposals. The proposed approach effectively exploits local semantic information preserved in the feature map of the outermost convolutional layer. A multi-scale search is performed on the feature map by processing all the sub-regions of different sizes using separate expert units of fully connected layers. Each expert unit receives as input local semantic features only from the corresponding sub-regions of a specific geometric shape. Therefore, it contains more nearly optimal parameters tailored to the corresponding shape. This multi-scale and multi-aspect ratio scanning strategy can effectively localize a potential object of an arbitrary size. The proposed approach is fast and able to localize objects of interest with a frame rate of 4 fps while providing improved detection performance over the state-of-the art on the PASCAL VOC 12 and MSCOCO data sets.
