Telecom data for efficient malaria interventions

Telecom data is rich on mobility information and as such can be used to identify mobility patterns of people in near real time, enabling to build epidemiological models for understanding where epidemics might spread over time. Based on previous research, we have built an operational tool fed with telecom data which shows malaria risk flows in Zambia in near real time. It provides insights on which areas should eradicate malaria first in order to have a maximum impact on the overall country malaria flows, and it highlights regions that should coordinate their eradication efforts together. Such information is particularly relevant for countries like Zambia, which are getting close to malaria elimination and need to prevent its re-introduction into areas that are already malaria-free.
