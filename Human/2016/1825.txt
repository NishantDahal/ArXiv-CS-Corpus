Composable Industrial Internet Applications for Tiered Architectures

A single vendor cannot provide complete IIoT end-to-end solutions because cooperation is required from multiple parties. Interoperability is a key architectural quality. Composability of capabilities, information and configuration is the prerequisite for interoperability, supported by a data storage infrastructure and defined set of interfaces to build applications. Secure collection, transport and storage of data and algorithms are expectations for collaborative participation in any IIoT solution. Participants require control of their data ownership and confidentiality. We propose an Internet of Things, Services and People (IoTSP) application development and management framework which includes components for data storage, algorithm design and packaging, and computation execution. Applications use clusters of platform services, organized in tiers, and local access to data to reduce complexity and enhance reliable data exchange. Since communication is less reliable across tiers, data is synchronized between storage replicas when communication is available. The platform services provide a common ecosystem to exchange data uniting data storage, applications, and components that process the data. Configuration and orchestration of the tiers are managed using shared tools and facilities. The platform promotes the data storage components to be peers of the applications where each data owner is in control of when and how much information is shared with a service provider. The service components and applications are securely integrated using local event and data exchange communication channels. This tiered architecture reduces the cyber attack surface and enables individual tiers to operate autonomously, while addressing interoperability concerns. We present our framework using predictive maintenance as an example, and evaluate compatibility of our vision with an emerging set of standards.
