DEMoS Manifesto

This is a manifesto for DEMoS, which is a Distributed Embedded Modular System, but also a manifesto addressing the need for more inter-/cross-disciplinary mastery of working knowledge related to installing this class of systems in the real world. There is somehow room for yet another class of systems - complementary to existing embedded systems - complementing distributed operating systems - which takes on an interdisciplinary cyber-physical-materiality approach, a dedicated holistic perspective that recognizes the true value of interdisciplinary mastery vs. the implicit and overlooked expense of narrow intra-disciplinary focus dominating much of systems development (e.g. EE, CE, CS, SE, and IS). Interdisciplinary mastery yields its accumulated value across the development, deployment, use, re-use, and decommission phases for this class of systems: DEMoS is a system architected to be locally distributed, embedded, and modular as outlined herein and with the additional goals of human interdisciplinary mastery in this context: A potential set of goals for developing and applying DEMoS can be found in UN Resolution 70/1.
