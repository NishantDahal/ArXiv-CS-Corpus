qHiPSTER: The Quantum High Performance Software Testing Environment

We present qHiPSTER, the Quantum High Performance Software Testing Environment. qHiPSTER is a distributed high-performance implementation of a quantum simulator on a classical computer, that can simulate general single-qubit gates and two-qubit controlled gates. We perform a number of single- and multi-node optimizations, including vectorization, multi-threading, cache blocking, as well as overlapping computation with communication. Using the TACC Stampede supercomputer, we simulate quantum circuits ("quantum software") of up to 40 qubits. We carry out a detailed performance analysis to show that our simulator achieves both high performance and high hardware efficiency, limited only by the sustainable memory and network bandwidth of the machine.
