Commonsense Knowledge Enhanced Embeddings for Solving Pronoun Disambiguation Problems in Winograd Schema Challenge

In this paper, we propose commonsense knowledge enhanced embeddings (KEE) for solving the Pronoun Disambiguation Problems (PDP). The PDP task we investigate in this paper is a complex coreference resolution task which requires the utilization of commonsense knowledge. This task is a standard first round test set in the 2016 Winograd Schema Challenge. In this task, traditional linguistic features that are useful for coreference resolution, e.g. context and gender information, are no longer effective anymore. Therefore, the KEE models are proposed to provide a general framework to make use of commonsense knowledge for solving the PDP problems. Since the PDP task doesn't have training data, the KEE models would be used during the unsupervised feature extraction process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the KEE models, we propose to incorporate various commonsense knowledge bases, including ConceptNet, WordNet, and CauseCom, into the KEE training process. We achieved the best performance by applying the proposed methods to the 2016 Winograd Schema Challenge. In addition, experiments conducted on the standard PDP task indicate that, the proposed KEE models could solve the PDP problems by achieving 66.7% accuracy, which is a new state-of-the-art performance.
