Low-power Spin Valve Logic using Spin-transfer Torque with Automotion of Domain Walls

A novel scheme for non-volatile digital computation is proposed using spin-transfer torque (STT) and automotion of magnetic domain walls (DWs). The basic computing element is composed of a lateral spin valve (SV) with two ferromagnetic (FM) wires served as interconnects, where DW automotion is used to propagate the information from one device to another. The non-reciprocity of both device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at the input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The proposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by a long FM wire. Compared to the scheme based on non-local spin valves (NLSVs) in the previous proposal, the devices can be operated at lower current density due to utilizing all injected spins for local magnetization reversals, and thus improve both energy efficiency and resistance to electromigration. This device concept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input majority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin transport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel and stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires. In addition to digital computing, the proposed framework can also be used as a transducer between DWs and spin currents for higher wiring flexibility in the interconnect network.
