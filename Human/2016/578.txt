P vs. NP

The method for analyzing algorithmic runtime complexity using decision trees is discussed using the sorting algorithm. This method is then extended to optimal algorithms which may find all cliques of size q in network N, or simply the first clique of size q in network N. Finally, the lower bound of such decision trees is demonstrated to not be in P.
