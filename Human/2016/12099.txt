Scaling Laws for Ergodic Spectral Efficiency in MIMO Poisson Networks

In this paper, we examine the benefits of multiple antenna communication in random wireless networks, the topology of which is modeled by stochastic geometry. The setting is that of the Poisson bipolar model introduced in [1], which is a natural model for ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D) networks. The primary finding is that, with knowledge of channel state information between a receiver and its associated transmitter, by zero-forcing successive interference cancellation, and for appropriate antenna configurations, the ergodic spectral efficiency can be made to scale linearly with both 1) the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas, 2) the density of nodes and 3) the path-loss exponent. This linear gain is achieved by using the transmit antennas to send multiple data streams (e.g. through an open-loop transmission method) and by exploiting the receive antennas to cancel interference. Furthermore, when a receiver is able to learn channel state information from a certain number of near interferers, higher scaling gains can be achieved when using a successive interference cancellation method. A major implication of the derived scaling laws is that spatial multiplexing transmission methods are essential for obtaining better and eventually optimal scaling laws in multiple antenna random wireless networks. Simulation results support this analysis.
