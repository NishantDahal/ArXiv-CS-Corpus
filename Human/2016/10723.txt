Resource Planning For Rescue Operations

After an earthquake, disaster sites pose a multitude of health and safety concerns. A rescue operation of people trapped in the ruins after an earthquake disaster requires a series of intelligent behavior, including planning. For a successful rescue operation, given a limited number of available actions and regulations, the role of planning in rescue operations is crucial. Fortunately, recent developments in automated planning by artificial intelligence community can help different organization in this crucial task. Due to the number of rules and regulations, we believe that a rule based system for planning can be helpful for this specific planning problem. In this research work, we use logic rules to represent rescue and related regular regulations, together with a logic based planner to solve this complicated problem. Although this research is still in the prototyping and modeling stage, it clearly shows that rule based languages can be a good infrastructure for this computational task. The results of this research can be used by different organizations, such as Iranian Red Crescent Society and International Institute of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering (IISEE).
