TopCom: Index for Shortest Distance Query in Directed Graph

Finding shortest distance between two vertices in a graph is an important problem due to its numerous applications in diverse domains, including geo-spatial databases, social network analysis, and information retrieval. Classical algorithms (such as, Dijkstra) solve this problem in polynomial time, but these algorithms cannot provide real-time response for a large number of bursty queries on a large graph. So, indexing based solutions that pre-process the graph for efficiently answering (exactly or approximately) a large number of distance queries in real-time is becoming increasingly popular. Existing solutions have varying performance in terms of index size, index building time, query time, and accuracy. In this work, we propose T OP C OM , a novel indexing-based solution for exactly answering distance queries. Our experiments with two of the existing state-of-the-art methods (IS-Label and TreeMap) show the superiority of T OP C OM over these two methods considering scalability and query time. Besides, indexing of T OP C OM exploits the DAG (directed acyclic graph) structure in the graph, which makes it significantly faster than the existing methods if the SCCs (strongly connected component) of the input graph are relatively small.
