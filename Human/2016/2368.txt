A Novel Human Computer Interaction Platform based College Mathematical Education Methodology

This article proposes the analysis on novel human computer interaction (HCI) platform based college mathematical education methodology. Above for the application of virtual reality technology in teaching the problems in the study, only through the organization focus on the professional and technical personnel, and constantly improve researchers in development process of professional knowledge, close to the actual needs of the teaching can we achieve the satisfactory result. To obtain better education output, we combine the Kinect to form the HCI based teaching environment. We firstly review the latest HCI technique and principles of college math courses, then we introduce basic components of the Kinect including the gesture segmentation, systematic implementation and the primary characteristics of the platform. As the further step, we implement the system with the re-write of script code to build up the personalized HCI assisted education scenario. The verification and simulation proves the feasibility of our method.
