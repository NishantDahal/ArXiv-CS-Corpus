Patterns in treeshelves

We study the distribution and the popularity of left children on sets of treeshelves avoiding a pattern of size three. (Treeshelves are ordered binary increasing trees where every child is connected to its parent by a left or a right link.) The considered patterns are sub-treeshelves, and for each such a pattern we provide exponential generating function for the corresponding distribution and popularity. Finally, we present constructive bijections between treeshelves avoiding a pattern of size three and some classes of simpler combinatorial objects.
