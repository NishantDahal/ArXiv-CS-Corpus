Gender Differences in Communication Behaviors, Spatial Proximity Patterns, and Mobility Habits

The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition of social networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioral sciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional, or life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In this paper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of interaction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing platform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging, face-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt to isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively homogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the life course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data reveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative, distributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly, some patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender preference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity context, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower (and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women. These findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of gender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and mobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to differences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of sociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.
