An empirical study on the impact of IDE tool support in pair and solo programming

Agile software development has been widespread adopted. One well-known agile approach is eXtreme Programming (XP) where pair programming (PP) is a relevant practice. Although various aspects of PP have been studied, we have not found, under a traditional model of PP, studies that examine the impact of using an IDE tool support. In an attempt to obtain a better understanding of the impact of using an IDE, we present the results of a controlled experiment that expose the influence on quality, measured as the number of defects injected per hour, and cost, measured as the time necessary to complete programming assignments, of pair and solo programming with and without the use of an IDE. For quality, our findings suggest that the use of an IDE results in significantly higher defect injection rates (for both pairs and solos) when the programming assignment is not very complicated. Nevertheless, defect injection rates seem to decrease when pairs work on more complicated programming assignments irrespective of the tool support used. For cost, the programming assignment significantly affects the time necessary to complete the assignment. Finally, both aspects (quality and cost) are affected in a similar manner when either pair or solo programming is used.
