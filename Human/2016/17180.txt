DESP-C++: A Discrete-Event Simulation Package for C++

DESP-C++ is a C++ discrete-event random simulation engine that has been designed to be fast, very easy to use and expand, and valid. DESP-C++ is based on the resource view. Its complete architecture is presented in detail, as well as a short " user manual ". The validity of DESP-C++ is demonstrated by the simulation of three significant models. In each case, the simulation results obtained with DESP-C++ match those obtained with a validated simulation software: QNAP2. The versatility of DESP-C++ is also illustrated this way, since the modelled systems are very different from each other: a simple production system, the dining philosopher classical deadlock problem, and a complex object-oriented database management system.
