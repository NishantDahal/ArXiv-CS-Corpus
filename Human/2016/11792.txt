Dynamic Controllability of Conditional Simple Temporal Networks is PSPACE-complete

Even after the proposal of various solution algorithms, the precise computational complexity of checking whether a Conditional Temporal Network is Dynamically Controllable had still remained widely open. This issue gets settled in this paper which provides constructions, algorithms, and bridging lemmas and arguments to formally prove that: (1) the problem is PSPACE-hard, and (2) the problem lies in PSPACE.
