High-Quality, Low-Delay Music Coding in the Opus Codec

The IETF recently standardized the Opus codec as RFC6716. Opus targets a wide range of real-time Internet applications by combining a linear prediction coder with a transform coder. We describe the transform coder, with particular attention to the psychoacoustic knowledge built into the format. The result out-performs existing audio codecs that do not operate under real-time constraints.
