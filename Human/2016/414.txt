Asymptotic Close to Optimal Resource Allocation in Centralized Multi-band Wireless Networks

This paper concerns sub-channel allocation in multi-user wireless networks with a view to increasing the network throughput. It is assumed there are some sub-channels to be equally divided among active links, such that the total sum rate increases, where it is assumed each link is subject to a maximum transmit power constraint. This problem is found to be a non-convex optimization problem and is hard to deal with for large number of sub channels and/or users. However, relying on some approximation methods, it is demonstrated that the proposed sub-optimal problem has roots in combinatorial optimization, termed as Assignment problem which can be tackled through the so called Hungarian method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing works addressed in the literature.
