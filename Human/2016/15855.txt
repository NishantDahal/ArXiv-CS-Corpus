Towards an Accurate Mathematical Model of Generic Nominally-Typed OOP

The construction of GNOOP as a domain-theoretic model of generic nominally-typed OOP is currently underway. This extended abstract presents the concepts of `nominal intervals' and `full generication' that are likely to help in building GNOOP as an accurate mathematical model of generic nominally-typed OOP. The abstract also presents few related category-theoretic suggestions. The presented concepts and suggestions are particularly geared towards enabling GNOOP to offer a precise and simple view of so-far-hard-to-analyze features of generic OOP such as variance annotations (e.g., Java wildcard types) and erased generics (e.g., Java type erasure).
