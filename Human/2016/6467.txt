On The 2D Phase Retrieval Problem

The recovery of a signal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform, also known as phase retrieval, is of fundamental importance in many scientific fields. It is well known that due to the loss of Fourier phase the problem in 1D is ill-posed. Without further constraints, there is no unique solution to the problem. In contrast, uniqueness up to trivial ambiguities very often exists in higher dimensions, with mild constraints on the input. In this paper we focus on the 2D phase retrieval problem and provide insight into this uniqueness property by exploring the connection between the 2D and 1D formulations. In particular, we show that 2D phase retrieval can be cast as a 1D problem with additional constraints, which limit the solution space. We then prove that only one additional constraint is sufficient to reduce the many feasible solutions in the 1D setting to a unique solution for almost all signals. These results allow to obtain an analytical approach (with combinatorial complexity) to solve the 2D phase retrieval problem when it is unique.
