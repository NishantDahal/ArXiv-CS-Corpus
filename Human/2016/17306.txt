How Close to the Edge? Delay/utilization tradeoffs in MEC

Virtually all of the rapidly increasing data traffic consumed by mobile users requires some kind of processing, normally performed at cloud servers. A recent thrust, {\em mobile edge computing}, moves such processing to servers {\em within} the cellular mobile network. The large temporal and spatial variations to which mobile data usage is subject could make the reduced latency that edge clouds offer come at an unacceptable cost in redundant and underutilized infrastructure. We present some first empirical results on this question, based on large scale sampled crowd-sourced traces from several major cities spanning multiple operators and identifying the applications in use. We find opportunities to obtain both high server utilization and low application latency, but the best approaches will depend on the individual network operator's deployment strategy and geographic specifics of the cities we study.
