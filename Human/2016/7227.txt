Process Information Model for Sheet Metal Operations

The paper extracts the process parameters from a sheet metal part model (B-Rep). These process parameters can be used in sheet metal manufacturing to control the manufacturing operations. By extracting these process parameters required for manufacturing, CAM program can be generated automatically using the part model and resource information. A Product model is generated in modeling software and converted into STEP file which is used for extracting B-Rep which interned is used to classify and extract feature by using sheet metal feature recognition module. The feature edges are classified as CEEs, IEEs, CIEs and IIEs based on topological properties. Database is created for material properties of the sheet metal and machine tools required to manufacture features in a part model. The extracted feature, feature's edge information and resource information are then used to compute process parameters and values required to control manufacturing operations. The extracted feature, feature's edge information, resource information and process parameters are the integral components of the proposed process information model for sheet metal operations.
