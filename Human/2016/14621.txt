Modeling, refining and analyzing Incomplete Büchi Automata

Software development is an iterative process which includes a set of development steps that transform the initial high level specification of the system into its final, fully specified, implementation. This report discusses the theoretical foundations that allow Incomplete Büchi Automata (IBAs) to be used in the iterative development of a sequential system.
