Physical maze solvers. All twelve prototypes implement 1961 Lee algorithm

We overview experimental laboratory prototypes of maze solvers. We speculate that all maze solvers implement Lee algorithm by first developing a gradient of values showing a distance from any site of the maze to the destination site and then tracing a path from a given source site to the destination site. All prototypes approximate a set of many-source-one-destination paths using resistance, chemical and temporal gradients. They trace a path from a given source site to the destination site using electrical current, fluidic, growth of slime mould, Marangoni flow, crawling of epithelial cells, excitation waves in chemical medium, propagating crystallisation patterns. Some of the prototypes visualise the path using a stream of dye, thermal camera or glow discharge; others require a computer to extract the path from time lapse images of the tracing. We discuss the prototypes in terms of speed, costs and durability of the path visualisation.
