Topological classifier for detecting the emergence of epileptic seizures

In this work we study how to apply topological data analysis to create a method suitable to classify EEGs of patients affected by epilepsy. The topological space constructed from the collection of EEGs signals is analyzed by Persistent Entropy acting as a global topological feature for discriminating between healthy and epileptic signals. The Physionet data-set has been used for testing the classifier.
