Securely Outsourcing Large Scale Eigen Value Problem to Public Cloud

Cloud computing enables clients with limited computational power to economically outsource their large scale computations to a public cloud with huge computational power. Cloud has the massive storage, computational power and software which can be used by clients for reducing their computational overhead and storage limitation. But in case of outsourcing, privacy of client's confidential data must be maintained. We have designed a protocol for outsourcing large scale Eigen value problem to a malicious cloud which provides input/output data security, result verifiability and client's efficiency. As the direct computation method to find all eigenvectors is computationally expensive for large dimensionality, we have used power iterative method for finding the largest Eigen value and the corresponding Eigen vector of a matrix. For protecting the privacy, some transformations are applied to the input matrix to get encrypted matrix which is sent to the cloud and then decrypting the result that is returned from the cloud for getting the correct solution of Eigen value problem. We have also proposed result verification mechanism for detecting robust cheating and provided theoretical analysis and experimental result that describes high-efficiency, correctness, security and robust cheating resistance of the proposed protocol.
