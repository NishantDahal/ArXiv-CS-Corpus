Interference Avoidance Algorithm (IAA) for Multi-hop Wireless Body Area Network Communication

In this paper, we propose a distributed multi-hop interference avoidance algorithm, namely, IAA to avoid co-channel interference inside a wireless body area network (WBAN). Our proposal adopts carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) between sources and relays and a flexible time division multiple access (FTDMA) between relays and coordinator. The proposed scheme enables low interfering nodes to transmit their messages using base channel. Depending on suitable situations, high interfering nodes double their contention windows (CW) and probably use switched orthogonal channel. Simulation results show that proposed scheme has far better minimum SINR (12dB improvement) and longer energy lifetime than other schemes (power control and opportunistic relaying). Additionally, we validate our proposal in a theoretical analysis and also propose a probabilistic approach to prove the outage probability can be effectively reduced to the minimal.
