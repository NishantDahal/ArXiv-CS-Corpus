Skyrmions as Compact, Robust and Energy-Efficient Interconnects for Domain Wall (DW)-based Systems

Magnetic domain-wall (DW) has been widely investigated for future memory and computing systems. However, energy efficiency and stability become two major challenges of DW-based systems. In this letter, we first propose exploiting skyrmions as on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for DW-based systems, owing to the topological stability, small size and ultra-low depinning current density. In the proposed technique, data are processed in the form of DWs but are transmitted instead in the form of skyrmions. The reversible conversion between a skyrmion and a DW pair can be physically achieved by connecting a wide and a narrow magnetic nanowire. Our proposed technique can realize highly compact, robust and energy-efficient on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for DW-based systems, enabling the system to take advantages of both the DW and skyrmion.
