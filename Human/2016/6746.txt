New Permutation Trinomials Constructed from Fractional Polynomials

Permutation trinomials over finite fields consititute an active research due to their simple algebraic form, additional extraordinary properties and their wide applications in many areas of science and engineering. In the present paper, six new classes of permutation trinomials over finite fields of even characteristic are constructed from six fractional polynomials. Further, three classes of permutation trinomials over finite fields of characteristic three are raised. Distinct from most of the known permutation trinomials which are with fixed exponents, our results are some general classes of permutation trinomials with one parameter in the exponents. Finally, we propose a few conjectures.
