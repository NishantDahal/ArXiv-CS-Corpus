Jointly Learning Non-negative Projection and Dictionary with Discriminative Graph Constraints for Classification

Sparse coding with dictionary learning (DL) has shown excellent classification performance. Despite the considerable number of existing works, how to obtain features on top of which dictionaries can be better learned remains an open and interesting question. Many current prevailing DL methods directly adopt well-performing crafted features. While such strategy may empirically work well, it ignores certain intrinsic relationship between dictionaries and features. We propose a framework where features and dictionaries are jointly learned and optimized. The framework, named joint non-negative projection and dictionary learning (JNPDL), enables interaction between the input features and the dictionaries. The non-negative projection leads to discriminative parts-based object features while DL seeks a more suitable representation. Discriminative graph constraints are further imposed to simultaneously maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Experiments on both image and image set classification show the excellent performance of JNPDL by outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches.
