Depth Estimation from Single Image using Sparse Representations

Monocular depth estimation is an interesting and challenging problem as there is no analytic mapping known between an intensity image and its depth map. Recently there has been a lot of data accumulated through depth-sensing cameras, in parallel to that researchers started to tackle this task using various learning algorithms. In this paper, a deep sparse coding method is proposed for monocular depth estimation along with an approach for deterministic dictionary initialization.
