Proceedings 11th Doctoral Workshop on Mathematical and Engineering Methods in Computer Science

MEMICS provides a forum for doctoral students interested in applications of mathematical and engineering methods in computer science. Besides a rich technical programme (including invited talks, regular papers, and presentations), MEMICS also offers friendly social activities and exciting opportunities for meeting like-minded people. MEMICS submissions traditionally cover all areas of computer science (such as parallel and distributed computing, computer networks, modern hardware and its design, non-traditional computing architectures, information systems and databases, multimedia and graphics, verification and testing, computer security, as well as all related areas of theoretical computer science).
