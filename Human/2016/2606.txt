From local averaging to emergent global behaviors: the fundamental role of network interconnections

Distributed averaging is one of the simplest and most studied network dynamics. Its applications range from cooperative inference in sensor networks, to robot formation, to opinion dynamics. A number of fundamental results and examples scattered through the literature are gathered here and originally presented, emphasizing the deep interplay between the network interconnection structure and the emergent global behavior.
