LWIP and Wi-Fi Boost Link Management

3GPP LWIP Release 13 technology and its prestandard version Wi-Fi Boost have recently emerged as an efficient LTE and Wi-Fi integration at the IP layer, allowing uplink on LTE and downlink on Wi-Fi. This solves all the contention problems of Wi-Fi and allows an optimum usage of the unlicensed band for downlink. In this paper, we present a new feature of Wi-Fi Boost, its radio link management, which allows to steer the downlink traffic between both LTE and Wi-Fi upon congestion detection in an intelligent manner. This customised congestion detection algorithm is based on IP probing, and can work with any Wi-Fi access point. Simulation results in a typical enterprise scenario show that LWIP R13 and Wi-Fi Boost can enhance network performance up to 5x and 6x over LTE-only, and 4x and 5x over Wi-Fi only networks, respectively, and that the the proposed radio link management can further improve Wi-Fi Boost performance over LWIP R13 up to 19 %. Based on the promising results, this paper suggests to enhance LWIP R13 user feedback in future LTE releases.
