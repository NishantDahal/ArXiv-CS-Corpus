Nested algorithms for optimal reservoir operation and their embedding in a decision support platform

This is a PhD thesis of Blagoj Delipetrev explaining nested dynamic programming, nested stochastic dynamic programming and nested reinforcement learning algorithms that are applied in reservoir optimization problem. Additionally there are also multi-objective version of these algorithms.
