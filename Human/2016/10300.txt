Unfolding Convex Polyhedra via Radially Monotone Cut Trees

A notion of "radially monotone" cut paths is introduced as an effective choice for finding a non-overlapping edge-unfolding of a convex polyhedron. These paths have the property that the two sides of the cut avoid overlap locally as the cut is infinitesimally opened by the curvature at the vertices along the path. It is shown that a class of planar, triangulated convex domains always have a radially monotone spanning forest, a forest that can be found by an essentially greedy algorithm. This algorithm can be mimicked in 3D and applied to polyhedra inscribed in a sphere. Although the algorithm does not provably find a radially monotone cut tree, it in fact does find such a tree with high frequency, and after cutting unfolds without overlap. This performance of a greedy algorithm leads to the conjecture that spherical polyhedra always have a radially monotone cut tree and unfold without overlap.
