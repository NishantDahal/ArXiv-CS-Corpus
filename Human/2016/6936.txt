A Process Model for Crowdsourcing: Insights from the Literature on Implementation

The purpose of the current study is to systematically review the crowdsourcing literature, extract the activities which have been cited, and synthesise these activities into a general process model. For this to happen, we reviewed the related literature on crowdsourcing methods as well as relevant case studies and extracted the activities which they referred to as part of crowdsourcing projects. The systematic review of the related literature and an in-depth analysis of the steps in those papers were followed by a synthesis of the extracted activities resulting in an eleven-phase process model. This process model covers all of the activities suggested by the literature. This paper then briefly discusses activities in each phase and concludes with a number of implications for both academics and practitioners.
