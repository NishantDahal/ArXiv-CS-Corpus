Bio-Inspired Resource Allocation for Relay-Aided Device-to-Device Communications

The Device-to-Device (D2D) communication principle is a key enabler of direct localized communication between mobile nodes and is expected to propel a plethora of novel multimedia services. However, even though it offers a wide set of capabilities mainly due to the proximity and resource reuse gains, interference must be carefully controlled to maximize the achievable rate for coexisting cellular and D2D users. The scope of this work is to provide an interference-aware real-time resource allocation (RA) framework for relay-aided D2D communications that underlay cellular networks. The main objective is to maximize the overall network throughput by guaranteeing a minimum rate threshold for cellular and D2D links. To this direction, genetic algorithms (GAs) are proven to be powerful and versatile methodologies that account for not only enhanced performance but also reduced computational complexity in emerging wireless networks. Numerical investigations highlight the performance gains compared to baseline RA methods and especially in highly dense scenarios which will be the case in future 5G networks.
