Interference alignment for downlink cellular networks: Joint scheduling and precoding

Interference Alignment (IA) is technique that, in a large sense, makes use of the increasing signal dimensions available in the system through MIMO and OFDM technologies in order to globally reduce the interference suffered by users in a network. In this paper, we address the problem of downlink cellular networks, the so-called interfering broadcast channels, where mobile users at cell edges may suffer from high interference and thus, poor performance. Starting from the downlink IA scheme proposed by Suh et al., a new approach is proposed where each user feeds back multiple selected received signal directions with high signal-to-interference gain. A exhaustive search based scheduler selects a subset of users to be served simultaneously, balancing between sum-rate performance and fairness, but becomes untractable in dense network scenarios where many users send simultaneous requests. Therefore, we develop a sub-optimal scheduler that greatly decreases the complexity while preserving a near-optimal data rate gain. More interestingly, our simulations show that the IA scheme becomes valuable only in correlated channels, whereas the matched filtering based scheme performs the best in the uncorrelated scenarios.
