Layerwise computability and image randomness

Algorithmic randomness theory starts with a notion of an individual random object. To be reasonable, this notion should have some natural properties; in particular, an object should be random with respect to image distribution if and only if it has a random preimage. This result (for computable distributions and mappings, and Martin-LÃ¶f randomness) was known for a long time (folklore); in this paper we prove its natural generalization for layerwise computable mappings, and discuss the related quantitative results.
