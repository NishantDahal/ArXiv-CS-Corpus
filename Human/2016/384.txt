Emotional Interaction between Artificial Companion Agents and the Elderly

Artificial companion agents are defined as hardware or software entities designed to provide companionship to a person. The senior population are facing a special demand for companionship. Artificial companion agents have been demonstrated to be useful in therapy, offering emotional companionship and facilitating socialization. However, there is lack of empirical studies on what the artificial agents should do and how they can communicate with human beings better. To address these functional research problems, we attempt to establish a model to guide artificial companion designers to meet the emotional needs of the elderly through fulfilling absent roles in their social interactions. We call this model the Role Fulfilling Model. This model aims to use role as a key concept to analyse the demands from the elderly for functionalities from an emotional perspective in artificial companion agent designs and technologies. To evaluate the effectiveness of this model, we proposed a serious game platform named Happily Aging in Place. This game will help us to involve a large scale of senior users through crowdsourcing to test our model and hypothesis.
  To improve the emotional communication between artificial companion agents and users, This book draft addresses an important but largely overlooked aspect of affective computing: how to enable companion agents to express mixed emotions with facial expressions? And furthermore, for different users, do individual heterogeneity affects the perception of the same facial expressions? Some preliminary results about gender differences have been found. The perception of facial expressions between different age groups or cultural backgrounds will be held in future study.
