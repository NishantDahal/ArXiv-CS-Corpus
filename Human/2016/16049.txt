The Virtual Electromagnetic Interaction between Digital Images for Image Matching with Shifting Transformation

A novel way of matching two images with shifting transformation is studied. The approach is based on the presentation of the virtual edge current in images, and also the study of virtual electromagnetic interaction between two related images inspired by electromagnetism. The edge current in images is proposed as a discrete simulation of the physical current, which is based on the significant edge line extracted by Canny-like edge detection. Then the virtual interaction of the edge currents between related images is studied by imitating the electro-magnetic interaction between current-carrying wires. Based on the virtual interaction force between two related images, a novel method is presented and applied in image matching for shifting transformation. The preliminary experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
