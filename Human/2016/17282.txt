Dual MCDRR Scheduler for Hybrid TDM/WDM Optical Networks

In this paper we propose and investigate the performance of a dual multi-channel deficit round-robin (D-MCDRR) scheduler based on the existing single MCDRR scheduler. The existing scheduler is used for multiple channels with tunable transmitters and fixed receivers in hybrid time division multiplexing (TDM)/wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks. The proposed dual scheduler will also be used in the same optical networks. We extend the existing MCDRR scheduling algorithm for n channels to the case of considering two schedulers for the same n channels. Simulation results show that the proposed dual MCDRR (D-MCDRR) scheduler can provide better throughput when compared to the existing single MCDRR scheduler.
