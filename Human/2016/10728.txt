Development of Graphical User Interface For Microwave Filter Design

This research project aims at developing a low-cost, time-effective and a stand-alone graphical user interface (GUI) that will be used to design microwave filters. Throughout the projects, the main theory behind the technology of microwave filters, their generalized mathematical equations and the analysis of their different circuit topologies have been reviewed. This review helps to extract the necessary information needed for the design of microwave filters. Besides, the guiding principles and the underlying engineering factors for a successful and information-oriented GUI were also highlighted. To carry out the project, the High-Level GUI Development Environment (GUIDE) together with a structured programming approach have been used to design the GUI, and to program its related functionalities. The frequency responses are generated by using the generalized equation of each filter class and type; and by using their different circuit topologies (Shunt or Series topology). The GUI can also provide reactive element values from given specification. Moreover, the features for the design of ultra-wideband (UWB) band-pass filter, capacitively coupled and combline filter are also incorporated into the stand-alone application. The finalized prototype will serve both industries and educational institutions.
