An Approach for Self-Adaptive Path Loss Modeling for Accurate Positioning in Underground Environments

This paper proposes a real-time self-adaptive approach for accurate path loss estimation in underground mines or tunnels based on signal strength measurements from heterogeneous radio communication technologies. The proposed model features simplicity of implementation. The methodology was validated in simulations as well as was verified by measurements taken in real environments. The proposed method leverages accuracy of positioning matching to the existing approaches while requiring smaller engineering efforts.
