An empirical study on the effects of different types of noise in image classification tasks

Image classification is one of the main research problems in computer vision and machine learning. Since in most real-world image classification applications there is no control over how the images are captured, it is necessary to consider the possibility that these images might be affected by noise (e.g. sensor noise in a low-quality surveillance camera). In this paper we analyse the impact of three different types of noise on descriptors extracted by two widely used feature extraction methods (LBP and HOG) and how denoising the images can help to mitigate this problem. We carry out experiments on two different datasets and consider several types of noise, noise levels, and denoising methods. Our results show that noise can hinder classification performance considerably and make classes harder to separate. Although denoising methods were not able to reach the same performance of the noise-free scenario, they improved classification results for noisy data.
