Kernel-based Generative Learning in Distortion Feature Space

This paper presents a novel kernel-based generative classifier which is defined in a distortion subspace using polynomial series expansion, named Kernel-Distortion (KD) classifier. An iterative kernel selection algorithm is developed to steadily improve classification performance by repeatedly removing and adding kernels. The experimental results on character recognition application not only show that the proposed generative classifier performs better than many existing classifiers, but also illustrate that it has different recognition capability compared to the state-of-the-art discriminative classifier - deep belief network. The recognition diversity indicates that a hybrid combination of the proposed generative classifier and the discriminative classifier could further improve the classification performance. Two hybrid combination methods, cascading and stacking, have been implemented to verify the diversity and the improvement of the proposed classifier.
