Group Methodologies and Simulations for the Development of Transversal Skills: A Pilot Study on Health Sciences Higher Education

One of the methodologies based on group dynamics is Role Playing (RP). This method consists on the simulation of a real situation, allowing its study and understanding. Knowledge and technical skills are not the only prerequisites for proper practice in health sciences. RP has been used as Communication Skills Training (CST) amongst health professionals. In the teaching of odontology and stomatology, object of our research, dental assistance brings up situations where the professional must develop transversal skills, which improve the interaction with the patient and the dental treatment itself. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed RP methodology through the students' opinion. The study sample is made out of dental students (n=80), all of them on the 4th year at the College of Dentistry (University of Seville, Spain). The students who took part in the activity considered the incorporation of RP in the syllabus as relevant, though further study should be considered in order to analyze the efficacy of this teaching methodology in depth.
