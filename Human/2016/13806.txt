Simulation of the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol in OMNeT++

Real-time systems rely on a distributed global time base. As any physical clock device suffers from noise, it is necessary to provide some kind of clock synchronization to establish such a global time base. Different clock synchronization methods have been invented for individual application domains. The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which is specified in IEEE 1588, is another interesting option. It targets local networks, where it is acceptable to assume small amounts of hardware support, and promises sub-microsecond precision. PTP provides many different implementation and configuration options, and thus the Design Space Exploration (DSE) is challenging. In this paper we discuss the implementation of realistic clock noise and its synchronization via PTP in OMNeT++. The components presented in this paper are intended to assist engineers with the configuration of PTP networks.
