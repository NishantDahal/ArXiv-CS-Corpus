Automatic 3D modelling of craniofacial form

Three-dimensional models of craniofacial variation over the general population are useful for assessing pre- and post-operative head shape when treating various craniofacial conditions, such as craniosynostosis. We present a new method of automatically building both sagittal profile models and full 3D surface models of the human head using a range of techniques in 3D surface image analysis; in particular, automatic facial landmarking using supervised machine learning, global and local symmetry plane detection using a variant of trimmed iterative closest points, locally-affine template warping (for full 3D models) and a novel pose normalisation using robust iterative ellipse fitting. The PCA-based models built using the new pose normalisation are more compact than those using Generalised Procrustes Analysis and we demonstrate their utility in a clinical case study.
