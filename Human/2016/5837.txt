Computing with hardware neurons: spiking or classical? Perspectives of applied Spiking Neural Networks from the hardware side

While classical neural networks take a position of a leading method in the machine learning community, spiking neuromorphic systems bring attention and large projects in neuroscience. Spiking neural networks were shown to be able to substitute networks of classical neurons in applied tasks. This work explores recent hardware designs focusing on perspective applications (like convolutional neural networks) for both neuron types from the energy efficiency side to analyse whether there is a possibility for spiking neuromorphic hardware to grow up for a wider use. Our comparison shows that spiking hardware is at least on the same level of energy efficiency or even higher than non-spiking on a level of basic operations. However, on a system level, spiking systems are outmatched and consume much more energy due to inefficient data representation with a long series of spikes. If spike-driven applications, minimizing an amount of spikes, are developed, spiking neural systems may reach the energy efficiency level of classical neural systems. However, in the near future, both type of neuromorphic systems may benefit from emerging memory technologies, minimizing the energy consumption of computation and memory for both neuron types. That would make infrastructure and data transfer energy dominant on the system level. We expect that spiking neurons have some benefits, which would allow achieving better energy results. Still the problem of an amount of spikes will still be the major bottleneck for spiking hardware systems.
