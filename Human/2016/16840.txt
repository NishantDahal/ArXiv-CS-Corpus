Game-theoretic Interpretation of Intuitionistic Type Theory

We present a game semantics for intuitionistic type theory. Specifically, we propose categories with families of a new variant of games and strategies for both extensional and intensional variants of the type theory with dependent function, dependent pair, and identity types as well as universes. Our games and strategies generalize the existing notion of games and strategies and achieve an interpretation of dependent types and the hierarchy of universes in an intuitive manner. We believe that it is a significant step towards a computational and intensional interpretation of the type theory.
