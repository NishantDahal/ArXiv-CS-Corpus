Knowledge and Influence of MOOC Courses on Initial Teacher Training

The impact of MOOC courses in the processes of distance learning has been extremely important from the very beginning. They offer an innovative model of massive teaching, which exploits in a paradigmatic manner the potential and relevance that ICT's currently have in modern society. The present article has as its primary objective the analysis of the presence of these courses and the role that they represent in teacher training, and their knowledge and influence on the future teachers that are currently being formed at university level. A case study has been carried out with descriptive not experimental methodology, from a quantitative base. The sample study has been undertaken in Spain (n=200). Its main result being the determination of the minimal impact that the MOOC phenomenon has had on the students polled. Equally, a significant lack of knowledge has been revealed in all its dimensions (professional, pedagogical, structural, etc.), with only a minority of those in the sample group having indicated that they have studied any of the courses, or know to some extent the main platforms of the world in which they are offered. A large number of those surveyed therefore are unaware of the existence of these courses. As a result, it has been established that, regardless of the quality of the learning and the didactic and methodological characteristics that the MOOC courses offer, their study and analysis is considered necessary for future educational professionals. It is imperative that at the level of Higher Education, and especially in the faculties of teacher training, that the most recent advances in the field of ICT's are introduced in the study plan and in the academic programs, for they constitute the base of modern society.
