Applied Logic in Engineering

Logic not only helps to solve complicated and safety-critical problems, but also disciplines the mind and helps to develop abstract thinking, which is very important for any area of Engineering. In this technical report, we present an overview of common challenges in teaching of formal methods and discuss our experiences from the course Applied Logic in Engineering. This course was taught at TU Munich, Germany, in Winter Semester 2012/2013.
