Understanding Illicit Drug Use Behaviors by Mining Social Media

Drug use by people is on the rise and is of great interest to public health agencies and law enforcement agencies. As found by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 20 million Americans aged 12 years or older consumed illicit drugs in the past few 30 days. Given their ubiquity in everyday life, drug abuse related studies have received much and constant attention. However, most of the existing studies rely on surveys. Surveys present a fair number of problems because of their nature. Surveys on sensitive topics such as illicit drug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting a representative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using big data from social media in order to understand illicit drug use behaviors. Instagram posts are collected using drug related terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and dynamic dictionary of frequent illicit drug related slang is used to find these posts. These posts are studied to find common drug consumption behaviors with regard to time of day and week. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followed by the users of drug related posts, we hope to discover common interests shared by drug users.
