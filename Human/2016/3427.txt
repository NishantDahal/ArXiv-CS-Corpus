A (Basis for a) Philosophy of a Theory of Fuzzy Computation

Vagueness is a linguistic phenomenon as well as a property of physical objects. Fuzzy set theory is a mathematical model of vagueness that has been used to define vague models of computation. The prominent model of vague computation is the fuzzy Turing machine. This conceptual computing device gives an idea of what computing under vagueness means, nevertheless, it is not the most natural model. Based on the properties of this and other models of vague computing, it is aimed to formulate a basis for a philosophy of a theory of fuzzy computation.
