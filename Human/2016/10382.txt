Cloud Service Matchmaking Approaches: A Systematic Literature Survey

Service matching concerns finding suitable services according to the service requester's requirements, which is a complex task due to the increasing number and diversity of cloud services available. Service matching is discussed in web services composition and user oriented service marketplaces contexts. The suggested approaches have different problem definitions and have to be examined closer in order to identify comparable results and to find out which approaches have built on the former ones. One of the most important use cases is service requesters with limited technical knowledge who need to compare services based on their QoS requirements in cloud service marketplaces. Our survey examines the service matching approaches in order to find out the relation between their context and their objectives. Moreover, it evaluates their applicability for the cloud service marketplaces context.
