On-the-Fly TCP Acceleration with Miniproxy

TCP proxies are basic building blocks for many advanced middleboxes. In this paper we present Miniproxy, a TCP proxy built on top of a specialized minimalistic cloud operating system. Miniproxy's connection handling performance is comparable to that of full-fledged GNU/Linux TCP proxy implementations, but its minimalistic footprint enables new use cases. Specifically, Miniproxy requires as little as 6 MB to run and boots in tens of milliseconds, enabling massive consolidation, on-the-fly instantiation and edge cloud computing scenarios. We demonstrate the benefits of Miniproxy by implementing and evaluating a TCP acceleration use case.
