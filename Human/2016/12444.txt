An Algorithm to Realize Rate-Splitting in Gaussian Multi-access Channel

Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a code division multi-access technique which can achieve any base in the multi-access capacity polymatroid without high coding complexity or synchronization among the transmitting users. In this paper, a practical algorithm is proposed to compute the splitting coefficients and the successive decoding order of virtual users in Gaussian RSMA transmission. Based on the proposed algorithm, a deterministic mapping is built between the system parameters and the objective rate tuple for RSMA. As a result, the application of the RSMA technique becomes possible in current communication systems.
