Perspectives and Networks

The perspective we take on a system determines the features and properties of this system that we are focusing on. It determines where we search for causes to explain the effects on the system that we observe. It determines the terms in which we expect the information about the system to be expressed. And it can also influence the choice of formalism that will be used to convey the information. using Boolean Automata Networks as prototypes of interaction systems, this paper means to start making these considerations concrete in order to draw a practical benefit out of them.
