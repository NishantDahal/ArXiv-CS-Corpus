An Analytical Model of the IEEE 802.3ah MAC Protocol for EPON-based Access Systems

Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) access systems are considered as an alternative to ADSL for high speed access to the Internet. Supported by the Ethernet First Mile Alliance and the IEEE, the MPCP protocol has been adopted as the standardized MAC protocol for EPONs. Moreover, the IPACT dynamic bandwidth allocation mechanism has been proposed for hierarchical multiplexing. Today, IPACT is considered as interesting complement to MPCP for dynamic bandwidth allocation over EPONs. In this paper, we propose an original analytical model of the MPCP+IPACT protocol. Numerical results obtained from this model are commented and compared to computer simulations.
