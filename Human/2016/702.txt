A Class of Three-Weight Linear Codes and Their Complete Weight Enumerators

Recently, linear codes constructed from defining sets have been investigated extensively and they have many applications. In this paper, for an odd prime $p$, we propose a class of $p$-ary linear codes by choosing a proper defining set. Their weight enumerators and complete weight enumerators are presented explicitly. The results show that they are linear codes with three weights and suitable for the constructions of authentication codes and secret sharing schemes.
