Coded Caching Clusters with Device-to-Device Communications

We consider a geographically constrained caching community where popular data files are cached on mobile terminals and distributed through Device-to-Device (D2D) communications. Further, to ensure availability, data files are protected against user mobility, or churn, with erasure coding. Communication and storage costs (in units of energy) are considered. We focus on finding the coding method that minimizes the overall cost in the network. Closed-form expressions for the expected energy consumption incurred by data delivery and redundancy maintenance are derived, and it is shown that coding significantly decreases the overall energy consumption -- by more than 90% in a realistic scenario. It is further shown that D2D caching can also yield notable economical savings for telecommunication operators. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples and verified by extensive computer simulations.
