On the allocation of multiple divisible assets to players with different utilities

When there is a dispute between players on how to divide multiple divisible assets, how should it be resolved? In this paper we introduce a multi-asset game model that enables cooperation between multiple agents who bargain on sharing K assets, when each player has a different value for each asset. It thus extends the sequential discrete Raiffa solution and the Talmud rule solution to multi-asset cases. keyword: resource allocation, game theory, Raiffa Bargaining Solution, Aumann Bankruptcy, non-transferable commodities
