Spider and the Flies : Focused Crawling on Tumblr to Detect Hate Promoting Communities

Tumblr is one of the largest and most popular microblogging website on the Internet. Studies shows that due to high reachability among viewers, low publication barriers and social networking connectivity, microblogging websites are being misused as a platform to post hateful speech and recruiting new members by existing extremist groups. Manual identification of such posts and communities is overwhelmingly impractical due to large amount of posts and blogs being published every day. We propose a topic based web crawler primarily consisting of multiple phases: training a text classifier model consisting examples of only hate promoting users, extracting posts of an unknown tumblr micro-blogger, classifying hate promoting bloggers based on their activity feeds, crawling through the external links to other bloggers and performing a social network analysis on connected extremist bloggers. To investigate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on large real world dataset. Experimental results reveals that the proposed approach is an effective method and has an F-score of 0.80. We apply social network analysis based techniques and identify influential and core bloggers in a community.
