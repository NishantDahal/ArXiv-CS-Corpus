Toward Mining Visual Log of Software

In this paper, we define visual log of a software system as data capturing the interactions between its users and its graphic user interface (GUI), such as screen-shots and screen recordings. We vision that mining such visual log could be useful for bug reproducing and debugging, automated GUI testing, user interface designing, question answering of common usages in software support, etc. Toward that vision, we propose a core framework for mining visual log of software. This framework focuses on detecting GUI elements and changes in visual log, removing users' private data, recognizing user interactions with GUI elements, and learning GUI usage patterns. We also performed a small study on the characteristics of GUI elements in mobile apps. The findings from this study suggested several heuristics to design techniques for recognizing GUI elements and interactions.
