Simultaneous Feedback Edge Set: A Parameterized Perspective

In this paper we consider Simultaneous Feedback Edge Set (Sim-FES) problem. In this problem, the input is an $n$-vertex graph $G$, an integer $k$ and a coloring function ${\sf col}: E(G) \rightarrow 2^{[α]}$ and the objective is to check whether there is an edge subset $S$ of cardinality at most $k$ in $G$ such that for all $i \in [α]$, $G_i - S$ is acyclic. Here, $G_i=(V(G), \{e\in E(G) \mid i \in {\sf col}(e)\})$ and $[α]=\{1,\ldots,α\}$. When $α=1$, the problem is polynomial time solvable. We show that for $α=3$ Sim-FES is NP-hard by giving a reduction from Vertex Cover on cubic graphs. The same reduction shows that the problem does not admit an algorithm of running time $O(2^{o(k)}n^{O(1)})$ unless ETH fails. This hardness result is complimented by an FPT algorithm for Sim-FES running in time $O(2^{ωkα+α\log k} n^{O(1)})$, where $ω$ is the exponent in the running time of matrix multiplication. The same algorithm gives a polynomial time algorithm for the case when $α=2$. We also give a kernel for Sim-FES with $(kα)^{O(α)}$ vertices. Finally, we consider the problem Maximum Simultaneous Acyclic Subgraph. Here, the input is a graph $G$, an integer $q$ and, a coloring function ${\sf col}: E(G) \rightarrow 2^{[α]}$. The question is whether there is a edge subset $F$ of cardinality at least $q$ in $G$ such that for all $i\in [α]$, $G[F_i]$ is acyclic. Here, $F_i=\{e \in F \mid i \in \textsf{col}(e)\}$. We give an FPT algorithm for running in time $O(2^{ωq α}n^{O(1)})$.
