Wireless Vehicular Networks in Emergencies: A Single Frequency Network Approach

Obtaining high quality sensor information is critical in vehicular emergencies. However, existing standards such as IEEE 802.11p/DSRC and LTE-A cannot support either the required data rates or the latency requirements. One solution to this problem is for municipalities to invest in dedicated base stations to ensure that drivers have the information they need to make safe decisions in or near accidents. In this paper we further propose that these municipality-owned base stations form a Single Frequency Network (SFN). In order to ensure that transmissions are reliable, we derive tight bounds on the outage probability when the SFN is overlaid on an existing cellular network. Using our bounds, we propose a transmission power allocation algorithm. We show that our power allocation model can reduce the total instantaneous SFN transmission power up to $20$ times compared to a static uniform power allocation solution, for the considered scenarios. The result is particularly important when base stations rely on an off-grid power source (i.e., batteries).
