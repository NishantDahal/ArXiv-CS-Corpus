Evaluation of Zika Vector Control Strategies Using Agent-Based Modeling

Aedes Aegypti is the vector of several deadly diseases, including Zika. Effective and sustainable vector control measures must be deployed to keep A. aegypti numbers under control. The distribution of A. Aegypti is subject to spatial and climatic constraints. Using agent-based modeling, we model the population dynamics of A. aegypti subjected to the spatial and climatic constraints of a neighborhood in the Key West. Satellite imagery was used to identify vegetation, houses (CO2 zones) both critical to the mosquito lifecycle. The model replicates the seasonal fluctuation of adult population sampled through field studies and approximates the population at a high of 986 (95% CI: [979, 993]) females and 1031 (95% CI: [1024, 1039]) males in the fall and a low of 316 (95% CI: [313, 319]) females and 333 (95% CI: [330, 336]) males during the winter. We then simulate two biological vector control strategies: 1) Wolbachia infection and 2) Release of Insects carrying a Dominant Lethal gene (RIDL). Our results support the probability of sustained Wolbachia infection within the population for two years after the year of release. egies, our approach provides a realistic simulation environment consisting of male and female Aedes aegypti, breeding spots, vegetation and CO2 sources.
