Stable and accurate interface capturing advection schemes

In this paper, stable and "low-diffusive" multidimensional interface capturing (IC) schemes using slope limiters are discussed. It is known that direction-by-direction slope-limited MUSCL schemes create geometrical artifacts and thus return a poor accuracy. We here focus on this particular issue and show that the reconstruction of gradient directions are an important factor of accuracy. The use of a multidimensional limiting process (MLP) added with an adequate time integration scheme leads to an artifact-free and instability-free interface capturing (IC) approach. Numerical experiments like the reference Kothe-Rider forward-backward advection case show the accuracy of the approach. We also show that the approach can be extended to the more complex compressible multimaterial hydrodynamics case, with potentially an arbitrary number of fluids. We also believe that this approach is appropriate for multicore/manycore architecture because of its SIMD feature, which may be another asset compared to interface reconstruction approaches.
