Photo-Quality Evaluation based on Computational Aesthetics: Review of Feature Extraction Techniques

Researchers try to model the aesthetic quality of photographs into low and high- level features, drawing inspiration from art theory, psychology and marketing. We attempt to describe every feature extraction measure employed in the above process. The contribution of this literature review is the taxonomy of each feature by its implementation complexity, considering real-world applications and integration in mobile apps and digital cameras. Also, we discuss the machine learning results along with some unexplored research areas as future work.
