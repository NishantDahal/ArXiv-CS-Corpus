Automating Political Bias Prediction

Every day media generate large amounts of text. An unbiased view on media reports requires an understanding of the political bias of media content. Assistive technology for estimating the political bias of texts can be helpful in this context. This study proposes a simple statistical learning approach to predict political bias from text. Standard text features extracted from speeches and manifestos of political parties are used to predict political bias in terms of political party affiliation and in terms of political views. Results indicate that political bias can be predicted with above chance accuracy. Mistakes of the model can be interpreted with respect to changes of policies of political actors. Two approaches are presented to make the results more interpretable: a) discriminative text features are related to the political orientation of a party and b) sentiment features of texts are correlated with a measure of political power. Political power appears to be strongly correlated with positive sentiment of a text. To highlight some potential use cases a web application shows how the model can be used for texts for which the political bias is not clear such as news articles.
