User Point Processes in Cellular Networks

The point process of concurrent users is critical for the analysis of cellular networks, in particular for the uplink and for full-duplex communication. We analyze the properties of two popular models. For the first one, we provide an accurate characterization of the pair correlation functions from the user and the base station point of view, which are applied to approximate the user process by Poisson and Ginibre point processes. For the second model, which includes the first model asymptotically, we study the cell vacancy probability, the mean area of vacant and occupied cells, the user-base station distance, and the pair correlation function in lightly and heavily loaded regimes.
