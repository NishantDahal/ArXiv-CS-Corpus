Towards Dependable Change Management and Traceability for Global Software Development

This paper reports on our definition of guidelines for managing global software development (GSD) that implements the specific practice - manage requirements changes - of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 2. The guidelines present a model for change management and traceability that supports the implementation of the specific CMMI Level 2 goal. Also, to support the effective management of the system engineering processes, an adaptation of the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) process group (PG) for project life-cycle practices is provided. We introduce a cloud-based Reactive Middleware which provides services for managing GSD projects towards dependable change management and traceability.
