Sparsity and Parallel Acquisition: Optimal Uniform and Nonuniform Recovery Guarantees

The problem of multiple sensors simultaneously acquiring measurements of a single object can be found in many applications. In this paper, we present the optimal recovery guarantees for the recovery of compressible signals from multi-sensor measurements using compressed sensing. In the first half of the paper, we present both uniform and nonuniform recovery guarantees for the conventional sparse signal model in a so-called distinct sensing scenario. In the second half, using the so-called sparse and distributed signal model, we present nonuniform recovery guarantees which effectively broaden the class of sensing scenarios for which optimal recovery is possible, including to the so-called identical sampling scenario. To verify our recovery guarantees we provide several numerical results including phase transition curves and numerically-computed bounds.
