Modeling selectional restrictions in a relational type system

Selectional restrictions are semantic constraints on forming certain complex types in natural language. The paper gives an overview of modeling selectional restrictions in a relational type system with morphological and syntactic types. We discuss some foundations of the system and ways of formalizing selectional restrictions.
