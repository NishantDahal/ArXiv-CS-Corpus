Analysis on 60 GHz Wireless Communications with Beamwidth-Dependent Misalignment

High speed wireless access on 60 GHz spectrum relies on high-gain directional antennas to overcome the severe signal attenuation. However, perfect alignment between transmitting and receiving antenna beams is rare in practice and overheard signals from concurrent transmissions may cause significant interference. In this paper we analyze the impact of antenna beam misalignment on the system performance of 60 GHz wireless access. We quantify the signal power loss caused by beam misalignment and the interference power accumulated from neighboring concurrent transmissions whose signals are leaked either via the main-beam pointing in the similar direction or via side-lobe emission, and derive the probability distribution of the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR). For scenarios where interfering transmitters are distributed uniformly at random, we derive upper and lower bounds on the cumulative distribution function (abbreviated as CDF or c.d.f.) of SINR, which can be easily applied to evaluate system performance. We validate our analytical results by simulations where random nodes are uniformly distributed within a circular hall, and evaluate the sensitivity of average throughput and outage probability against two parameters: the half-power (3 dB) beamwidth to main-lobe beamwidth ratio and the beam misalignment deviation to main-lobe beamwidth ratio. Our results indicate that the derived lower bound performs well when the half-power beamwidth to main-lobe beamwidth ratio or the number of concurrent transmission links is small. When the number of active links is high, it is desirable in antenna design to balance the degradation caused by beam misalignment (wider beam is better) and the interference from concurrent transmission (narrower beam is better).
