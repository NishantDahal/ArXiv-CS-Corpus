Performance Assessment of WhatsApp and IMO on Android Operating System (Lollipop and KitKat) during VoIP calls using 3G or WiFi

This paper assesses the performance of mobile messaging and VoIP connections. We investigate the CPU usage of WhatsApp and IMO under different scenarios. This analysis also enabled a comparison of the performance of these applications on two Android operating system (OS) versions: KitKat or Lollipop. Two models of smartphones were considered, viz. Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy S4. The applications behavior was statistically investigated for both sending and receiving VoIP calls. Connections have been examined over 3G and WiFi. The handset model plays a decisive role in CPU usage of the application. t-tests showed that IMO has a better performance that WhatsApp whatever be the Android at a significance level 1%, on Galaxy Note 4. In contrast, WhatsApp requires less CPU than IMO on Galaxy S4 whatever be the OS and access (3G/WiFi). Galaxy Note 4 using WiFi always outperformed S4 in terms of processing efficiency.
