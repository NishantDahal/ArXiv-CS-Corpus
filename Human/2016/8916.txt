Social- and Mobility-Aware Device-to-Device Content Delivery

Mobile online social network services have seen a rapid increase, in which the huge amount of user-generated social media contents propagating between users via social connections has significantly challenged the traditional content delivery paradigm: First, replicating all of the contents generated by users to edge servers that well "fit" the receivers becomes difficult due to the limited bandwidth and storage capacities. Motivated by device-to-device (D2D) communication that allows users with smart devices to transfer content directly, we propose replicating bandwidth-intensive social contents in a device-to-device manner. Based on large-scale measurement studies on social content propagation and user mobility patterns in edge-network regions, we observe that (1) Device-to-device replication can significantly help users download social contents from nearby neighboring peers; (2) Both social propagation and mobility patterns affect how contents should be replicated; (3) The replication strategies depend on regional characteristics ({\em e.g.}, how users move across regions).
  Using these measurement insights, we propose a joint \emph{propagation- and mobility-aware} content replication strategy for edge-network regions, in which social contents are assigned to users in edge-network regions according to a joint consideration of social graph, content propagation and user mobility. We formulate the replication scheduling as an optimization problem and design distributed algorithm only using historical, local and partial information to solve it. Trace-driven experiments further verify the superiority of our proposal: compared with conventional pure movement-based and popularity-based approach, our design can significantly ($2-4$ times) improve the amount of social contents successfully delivered by device-to-device replication.
