Steganography -- A Game of Hide and Seek in Information Communication

With the growth of communication over computer networks, how to maintain the confidentiality and security of transmitted information have become some of the important issues. In order to transfer data securely to the destination without unwanted disclosure or damage, nature inspired hide and seek tricks such as, cryptography and Steganography are heavily in use. Just like the Chameleon and many other bio-species those change their body color and hide themselves in the background in order to protect them from external attacks, Cryptography and Steganography are techniques those are used to encrypt and hide the secret data inside other media to ensure data security. This paper discusses the concept of a simple spatial domain LSB Steganography that encrypts the secrets using Fibonacci- Lucas transformation, before hiding, for better security.
