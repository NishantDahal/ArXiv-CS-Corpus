Towards a Human-Centred Approach in Modelling and Testing of Cyber-Physical Systems

The ability to capture different levels of abstraction in a system model is especially important for remote integration, testing/verification, and manufacturing of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). However, the complexity of modelling and testing of CPSs makes these processes extremely prone to human error. In this paper we present our ongoing work on introducing human-centred considerations into modelling and testing of CPSs, which allow for agile iterative refinement processes of different levels of abstraction when errors are discovered or missing information is completed.
