The Effect of Multi-core Communication Architecture on System Performance

MPSoCs are gaining popularity because of its potential to solve computationally expensive applications. A multi-core processor combines two or more independent cores (normally a CPU) into a single package composed of a single integrated circuit (Chip). However, as the number of components on a single chip and their performance continue to increase, a shift from computation-based to communication-based design becomes mandatory. As a result, the communication architecture plays a major role in the area, performance, and energy consumption of the overall system. In this paper, multiple soft-cores (IPs) such as Micro Blaze in an FPGA is used to study the effect of different connection topologies on the performance of a parallel program.
