Mobile-service based Max-Min Fairness Resource Scheduling for Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks

This paper investigates the resource scheduling for heterogeneous vehicular networks, where some moving vehicles are selected and scheduled as helping relays to assist information transmission between the roadside infrastructure and other moving vehicles. For such a system, we propose a mobile-service based max-min fairness resource scheduling scheme, where service amount which is more suitable for high mobility scenarios is adopted to characterize the information transmission capacity of the links and the max-min criteria is adopted to meet the fairness requirement of the moving vehicles. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. It is shown that our proposed scheme archives higher throughput and better fairness compared with random scheduling scheme and non relaying scheme.
