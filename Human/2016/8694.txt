Greedy palindromic lengths

In [A. Frid, S. Puzynina, L.Q. Zamboni, \textit{On palindromic factorization of words}, Adv. in Appl. Math. 50 (2013), 737-748], it was conjectured that any infinite word whose palindromic lengths of factors are bounded is ultimately periodic. We introduce variants of this conjecture and prove this conjecture in particular cases. Especially we introduce left and right greedy palindromic lengths. These lengths are always greater than or equals to the initial palindromic length. When the greedy left (or right) palindromic lengths of prefixes of a word are bounded then this word is ultimately periodic.
