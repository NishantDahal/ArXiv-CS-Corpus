Row-constrained effective sets of colourings in the $2$-fold horocyclic tessellations of $\mathbb{H}^2$ are sofic

In this article we prove that, restricted to the row-constrained case, effective sets of colourings in the $2$-fold horocyclic tessellations of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$ are sofic.
