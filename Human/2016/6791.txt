Routing in all optical networks using recursive state space technique

In this paper, we have minimized the effects of failures on network performance, by using suitable Routing and Wavelenghth Assignment(RWA) method without disturbing other performance criteria such as blocking probability(BP) and network management(NM). The computation complexity is reduced by using Kalaman Filter(KF) techniques. The minimum reconfiguration probability routing (MRPR) algorithm must be able to select most reliable routes and assign wavelengths to connections in a manner that utilizes the light path(LP) established efficiently considering all possible requests.
