New word analogy corpus for exploring embeddings of Czech words

The word embedding methods have been proven to be very useful in many tasks of NLP (Natural Language Processing). Much has been investigated about word embeddings of English words and phrases, but only little attention has been dedicated to other languages.
  Our goal in this paper is to explore the behavior of state-of-the-art word embedding methods on Czech, the language that is characterized by very rich morphology. We introduce new corpus for word analogy task that inspects syntactic, morphosyntactic and semantic properties of Czech words and phrases. We experiment with Word2Vec and GloVe algorithms and discuss the results on this corpus. The corpus is available for the research community.
