Termination of LCTRSs

Logically Constrained Term Rewriting Systems (LCTRSs) provide a general framework for term rewriting with constraints. We discuss a simple dependency pair approach to prove termination of LCTRSs. We see that existing techniques transfer to the constrained setting in a natural way.
