SICS: Secure In-Cloud Service Function Chaining

There is an increasing trend that enterprises outsource their network functions to the cloud for lower cost and ease of management. However, network function outsourcing brings threats to the privacy of enterprises since the cloud is able to access the traffic and rules of in-cloud network functions. Current tools for secure network function outsourcing either incur large performance overhead or do not support real-time updates. In this paper, we present SICS, a secure service function chain outsourcing framework. SICS encrypts each packet header and use a label for in-cloud rule matching, which enables the cloud to perform its functionalities correctly with minimum header information leakage. Evaluation results show that SICS achieves higher throughput, faster construction and update speed, and lower resource overhead at both enterprise and cloud sides, compared to existing solutions.
