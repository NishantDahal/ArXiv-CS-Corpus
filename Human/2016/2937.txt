Exploiting Facial Landmarks for Emotion Recognition in the Wild

In this paper, we describe an entry to the third Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge, EmotiW2015. We detail the associated experiments and show that, through more accurately locating the facial landmarks, and considering only the distances between them, we can achieve a surprising level of performance. The resulting system is not only more accurate than the challenge baseline, but also much simpler.
