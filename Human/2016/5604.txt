Dual Link Algorithm for the Weighted Sum Rate Maximization in MIMO Interference Channels

MIMO interference network optimization is important for increasingly crowded wireless communication networks. We provide a new algorithm, named Dual Link algorithm, for the classic problem of weighted sum-rate maximization for MIMO multiaccess channels (MAC), broadcast channels (BC), and general MIMO interference channels with Gaussian input and a total power constraint. For MIMO MAC/BC, the algorithm finds optimal signals to achieve the capacity region boundary. For interference channels with Gaussian input assumption, two of the previous state-of-the-art algorithms are the WMMSE algorithm and the polite water-filling (PWF) algorithm. The WMMSE algorithm is provably convergent, while the PWF algorithm takes the advantage of the optimal transmit signal structure and converges the fastest in most situations but is not guaranteed to converge in all situations. It is highly desirable to design an algorithm that has the advantages of both algorithms. The dual link algorithm is such an algorithm. Its fast and guaranteed convergence is important to distributed implementation and time varying channels. In addition, the technique and a scaling invariance property used in the convergence proof may find applications in other non-convex problems in communication networks.
