Compositional Reasoning for Interval Markov Decision Processes

Model checking probabilistic CTL properties of Markov decision processes with convex uncertainties has been recently investigated by Puggelli et al. Such model checking algorithms typically suffer from the state space explosion. In this paper, we address probabilistic bisimulation to reduce the size of such an MDP while preserving the probabilistic CTL properties it satisfies. In particular, we discuss the key ingredients to build up the operations of parallel composition for composing interval MDP components at run-time. More precisely, we investigate how the parallel composition operator for interval MDPs can be defined so as to arrive at a congruence closure. As a result, we show that probabilistic bisimulation for interval MDPs is congruence with respect to two facets of parallelism, namely synchronous product and interleaving.
