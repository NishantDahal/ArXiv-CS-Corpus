On the Beer index of convexity and its variants

Let $S$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite positive Lebesgue measure. The Beer index of convexity $\operatorname{b}(S)$ of $S$ is the probability that two points of $S$ chosen uniformly independently at random see each other in $S$. The convexity ratio $\operatorname{c}(S)$ of $S$ is the Lebesgue measure of the largest convex subset of $S$ divided by the Lebesgue measure of $S$. We investigate the relationship between these two natural measures of convexity.
  We show that every set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ with simply connected components satisfies $\operatorname{b}(S)\leqα\operatorname{c}(S)$ for an absolute constant $α$, provided $\operatorname{b}(S)$ is defined. This implies an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Cabello et al. that this estimate holds for simple polygons.
  We also consider higher-order generalizations of $\operatorname{b}(S)$. For $1\leq k\leq d$, the $k$-index of convexity $\operatorname{b}_k(S)$ of a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ is the probability that the convex hull of a $(k+1)$-tuple of points chosen uniformly independently at random from $S$ is contained in $S$. We show that for every $d\geq 2$ there is a constant $β(d)>0$ such that every set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfies $\operatorname{b}_d(S)\leqβ\operatorname{c}(S)$, provided $\operatorname{b}_d(S)$ exists. We provide an almost matching lower bound by showing that there is a constant $γ(d)>0$ such that for every $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$ there is a set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ of Lebesgue measure $1$ satisfying $\operatorname{c}(S)\leq\varepsilon$ and $\operatorname{b}_d(S)\geqγ\frac{\varepsilon}{\log_2{1/\varepsilon}}\geqγ\frac{\operatorname{c}(S)}{\log_2{1/\operatorname{c}(S)}}$.
