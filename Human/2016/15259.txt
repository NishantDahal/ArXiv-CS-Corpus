LTL Model-Checking for Dynamic Pushdown Networks Communicating via Locks

A Dynamic Pushdown Network (DPN) is a set of pushdown systems (PDSs) where each process can dynamically create new instances of PDSs. DPNs are a natural model of multi-threaded programs with (possibly recursive) procedure calls and thread creation. Extending DPNs with locks allows processes to synchronize with each other. Thus, DPNs with locks are a well adapted formalism to model multi-threaded programs that synchronize via locks. Therefore, it is important to have model-checking algorithms for DPNs with locks. We consider in this work model-checking for DPNs with locks against single-indexed LTL properties of the form V fi s.t. fi is a LTL formula interpreted over the PDS i. We consider the model-checking problems w.r.t. simple valuations (i.e, whether a configuration satisfies an atomic proposition depends only on its control location and held locks) and w.r.t. regular valuations (i.e., the set of the configurations satisfying an atomic proposition is a regular set of configurations). We show that these model-checking problems are decidable.
