Quality Analysis of a Chaotic Proven Keyed Hash Function

Hash functions are cryptographic tools, which are notably involved in integrity checking and password storage. They are of primary importance to improve the security of exchanges through the Internet. However, as security flaws have been recently identified in the current standard in this domain, new ways to hash digital data must be investigated. In this document an original keyed hash function is evaluated. It is based on asynchronous iterations leading to functions that have been proven to be chaotic. It thus possesses various topological properties as uniformity and sensibility to its initial condition. These properties make our hash function satisfies established security requirements in this field. This claim is qualitatively proven and experimentally verified in this research work, among other things by realizing a large number of simulations.
