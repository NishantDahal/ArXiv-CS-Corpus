Holistic Features For Real-Time Crowd Behaviour Anomaly Detection

This paper presents a new approach to crowd behaviour anomaly detection that uses a set of efficiently computed, easily interpretable, scene-level holistic features. This low-dimensional descriptor combines two features from the literature: crowd collectiveness [1] and crowd conflict [2], with two newly developed crowd features: mean motion speed and a new formulation of crowd density. Two different anomaly detection approaches are investigated using these features. When only normal training data is available we use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for outlier detection. When both normal and abnormal training data is available we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classification. We evaluate on two crowd behaviour anomaly detection datasets, achieving both state-of-the-art classification performance on the violent-flows dataset [3] as well as better than real-time processing performance (40 frames per second).
