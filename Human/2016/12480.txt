A machine learning method for the large-scale evaluation of urban visual environment

Given the size of modern cities in the urbanising age, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the beauty and ugliness of the city at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions like 'where are the worst-looking places in the city that regeneration should give first consideration', or 'in the fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing', etc. To address this issue, we here present a computer vision method for the large-scale and automatic evaluation of the urban visual environment, by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and the wide-coverage street view images. From the various factors that are at work, we choose two key features, the visual quality of street facade and the continuity of street wall, as the starting point of this line of analysis. In order to test the validity of this method, we further compare the machine ratings with ratings collected on site from 752 passers-by on fifty-six locations. We show that the machine learning model can produce a good estimation of people's real visual experience, and it holds much potential for various tasks in terms of urban design evaluation, culture identification, etc.
