Guaranteeing QoS using Unlicensed TV White Spaces for Smart Grid Applications

In this paper, we consider the utilization of TV White Spaces (TVWS) by small Cognitive Radio (CR) network operators to support the communication needs of various smart grid applications. We first propose a multi-tier communication network architecture for smart metering applications in dense urban environments. Our measurement campaign, without any competition from other CR operators, reveals that the communication architecture can achieve more than 1Mbps data rates using the free unlicensed TVWS spectrum. However, anticipating stiff competition for the unlicensed TVWS spectrum among CR operators and to support smart grid applications with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, we further exploit the novel idea of high priority channels (HPC) that the CR operator can temporarily lease by paying a small fee. This poses several new challenges for the CR operators, such as, their economic viability while providing QoS guarantees. We develop a real-time decision support framework with several adjustable parameters for the CR operators that enables them to tradeoff HPC leasing cost and QoS. The developed algorithms are simple rules that provide significant opportunities to the CR operators to maintain a balance between spectrum cost and QoS depending on dynamic spectrum availability and smart grid application requirements.
