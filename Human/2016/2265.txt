Online and Global Network Optimization: Towards the Next-Generation of Routing Platforms

The computation power of SDN controllers fosters the development of a new generation of control plane that uses compute-intensive operations to automate and optimize the network configuration across layers. From now on, cutting-edge optimization and machine learning algorithms can be used to control networks in real-time. This formidable opportunity transforms the way routing systems should be conceived and designed. This paper presents a candidate architecture for the next generation of routing platforms built on three main pillars for admission control, re-routing and monitoring that would have not been possible in legacy control planes.
