Context Awareness in Next Generation of Mobile Core Networks

Context awareness is an important enabler for next generation of Mobile Core Networks (MCN). However there exist a number of challenges in this regard. For example how to develop a framework which 1) is able to generate context richer than what is available today; 2) allows reusability of context across the network; 3) provides a mechanism for exposing context to third parties; and 4) can bring together "big data" for mobile core network optimization. In this work, we introduce a context awareness framework addressing the aforementioned challenges but also taking into account the 3GPP standardization activities related to context awareness in MCN. Within this framework we propose Context Generation and Handling Function (CGHF) which generates rich context by processing information from various sources and then handles its distribution through an efficient publish subscribe mechanism. In addition we provide examples where context can be used to optimize control plane decision making. While the focus of this work is on the use of context for MCN, we still believe such context can be also used by applications (at the edge as well as in data centers) and third party services to improve their operations and providing new unforeseen services.
