Detecting state of aggression in sentences using CNN

In this article we study verbal expression of aggression and its detection using machine learning and neural networks methods. We test our results using our corpora of messages from anonymous imageboards. We also compare Random forest classifier with convolutional neural network for "Movie reviews with one sentence per review" corpus.
