Vulnerability of linear systems against sensor attacks--a system's security index

The `security index' of a discrete-time LTI system under sensor attacks is introduced as a quantitative measure on the security of an observable system. We derive ideas from error control coding theory to provide sufficient conditions for attack detection and correction.
