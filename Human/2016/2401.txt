Power Allocation and Scheduling for SWIPT Systems with Non-linear Energy Harvesting Model

In this paper, we design a resource allocation algorithm for multiuser simultaneous wireless information and power transfer systems for a realistic non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model. In particular, the algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the long-term average total harvested power at EH receivers subject to quality of service requirements for information decoding receivers. To obtain a tractable solution, we transform the corresponding non-convex sum-of-ratios objective function into an equivalent objective function in parametric subtractive form. This leads to a computationally efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. Numerical results reveal a significant performance gain that can be achieved if the resource allocation algorithm design is based on the non-linear EH model instead of the traditional linear model.
