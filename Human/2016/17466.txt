Asymptotic expansions for factorial moments of some distributions in the analysis of algorithms

We establish asymptotic expansions for factorial moments of following distributions: number of cycles in a random permutation, number of inversions in a random permutation, and number of comparisons used by the randomized quick sort algorithm.To achieve this we use singularity analysis of certain type of generating functions due to Flajolet and Odlyzko.
