Wind Speed Data Analysis for Various Seasons during a Decade by Wavelet and S transform

The appropriate weather prediction is a challenging task and it can be feasible with proper wind speed fluctuation analysis. In this current paper daubechies-4 wavelet is used to analyze the winter wind speed fluctuations due to lesser agitated wind data samples of winter. In summer abrupt changes in wind speed occurs which creates difficulty for wavelets to keep proper track of wind speed fluctuations. So, in that case the concept of the S-transform is introduced.
