Object Tracking via Dynamic Feature Selection Processes

DFST proposes an optimized visual tracking algorithm based on the real-time selection of locally and temporally discriminative features. A feature selection mechanism is embedded in the Adaptive colour Names (CN) tracking system that adaptively selects the top-ranked discriminative features for tracking. DFST provides a significant gain in accuracy and precision allowing the use of a dynamic set of features that results in an increased system flexibility. DFST is based on the unsupervised method "Infinite Feature Selection" (Inf-FS), which ranks features according with their "redundancy" without using class labels. By using a fast online algorithm for learning dictionaries the size of the box is adapted during the processing. At each update, we use multiple examples around the target (at different positions and scales). DFST also improved the CN by adding micro-shift at the predicted position and bounding box adaptation.
