A sufficient condition for tail asymptotics of SIR distribution in downlink cellular networks

We consider the spatial stochastic model of single-tier downlink cellular networks, where the wireless base stations are deployed according to a general stationary point process on the Euclidean plane with general i.i.d. propagation effects. Recently, Ganti & Haenggi (2016) consider the same general cellular network model and, as one of many significant results, derive the tail asymptotics of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution. However, they do not mention any conditions under which the result holds. In this paper, we compensate their result for the lack of the condition and expose a sufficient condition for the asymptotic result to be valid. We further illustrate some examples satisfying such a sufficient condition and indicate the corresponding asymptotic results for the example models. We give also a simple counterexample violating the sufficient condition.
