A Parallel Solution to Finding Nodal Neighbors in Generic Meshes

In this paper we specifically present a parallel solution to finding the one-ring neighboring nodes and elements for each vertex in generic meshes. The finding of nodal neighbors is computationally straightforward but expensive for large meshes. To improve the efficiency, the parallelism is adopted by utilizing the modern Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The presented parallel solution is heavily dependent on the parallel sorting, scan, and reduction, and can be applied to determine both the neighboring nodes and elements. To evaluate the performance, the parallel solution is compared to the corresponding serial solution. Experimental results show that: our parallel solution can achieve the speedups of approximately 55 and 90 over the corresponding serial solution for finding neighboring nodes and elements, respectively. Our parallel solution is efficient and easy to implement, but requires the allocation of large device memory.
