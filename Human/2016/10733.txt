Feature Extraction and Automated Classification of Heartbeats by Machine Learning

We present algorithms for the detection of a class of heart arrhythmias with the goal of eventual adoption by practicing cardiologists. In clinical practice, detection is based on a small number of meaningful features extracted from the heartbeat cycle. However, techniques proposed in the literature use high dimensional vectors consisting of morphological, and time based features for detection. Using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, we found smaller subsets of features sufficient to detect arrhythmias with high accuracy. The features were found by an iterative step-wise feature selection method. We depart from common literature in the following aspects: 1. As opposed to a high dimensional feature vectors, we use a small set of features with meaningful clinical interpretation, 2. we eliminate the necessity of short-duration patient-specific ECG data to append to the global training data for classification 3. We apply semi-parametric classification procedures (in an ensemble framework) for arrhythmia detection, and 4. our approach is based on a reduced sampling rate of ~ 115 Hz as opposed to 360 Hz in standard literature.
