Hand Gesture Recognition for Contactless Device Control in Operating Rooms

Hand gesture is one of the most important means of touchless communication between human and machines. There is a great interest for commanding electronic equipment in surgery rooms by hand gesture for reducing the time of surgery and the potential for infection. There are challenges in implementation of a hand gesture recognition system. It has to fulfill requirements such as high accuracy and fast response. In this paper we introduce a system of hand gesture recognition based on a deep learning approach. Deep learning is known as an accurate detection model, but its high complexity prevents it from being fabricated as an embedded system. To cope with this problem, we applied some changes in the structure of our work to achieve low complexity. As a result, the proposed method could be implemented on a naive embedded system. Our experiments show that the proposed system results in higher accuracy while having less complexity in comparison with the existing comparable methods.
