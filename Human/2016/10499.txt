You want to survive the data deluge: Be careful, Computational Intelligence will not serve you as a rescue boat

We are at the dawn of a new era, where advances in computer power, broadband communication and digital sensor technologies have led to an unprecedented flood of data inundating our surrounding. It is generally believed that means such as Computational Intelligence will help to outlive these tough times. However, these hopes are improperly high. Computational Intelligence is a surprising composition of two mutually exclusive and contradicting constituents that could be coupled only if you disregard and neglect their controversies: "Computational" implies reliance on data processing and "Intelligence" implies reliance on information processing. Only those who are indifferent to data-information discrepancy can believe that such a combination can be viable. We do not believe in miracles, so we will try to share with you our reservations.
