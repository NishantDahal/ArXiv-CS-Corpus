On the Necessity of Mixed Models: Dynamical Frustrations in the Mind

In the present work we will present and analyze some basic processes at the local and global level in linguistic derivations that seem to go beyond the limits of Markovian or Turing-like computation, and require, in our opinion, a quantum processor. We will first present briefly the working hypothesis and then focus on the empirical domain. At the same time, we will argue that a model appealing to only one kind of computation (be it quantum or not) is necessarily insufficient, and thus both linear and non-linear formal models are to be invoked in order to pursue a fuller understanding of mental computations within a unified framework.
