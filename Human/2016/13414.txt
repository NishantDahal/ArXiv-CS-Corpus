A Theory of Consciousness Founded on Neurons That Behave Like Qubits

This paper presents a hypothesis that consciousness is a natural result of neurons that become connected recursively, and work synchronously between short and long term memories. Such neurons demonstrate qubit-like properties, each supporting a probabilistic combination of true and false at a given phase. Advantages of qubits include probabilistic modifications of cues for searching associations in long term memory, and controlled toggling for parallel, reversible computations to prioritize multiple recalls and to facilitate mathematical abilities.
