Generalized Gray codes with prescribed ends

An $n$-bit Gray code is a sequence of all $n$-bit strings such that consecutive strings differ in a single bit. It is well-known that given $α,β\in\{0,1\}^n$, an $n$-bit Gray code between $α$ and $β$ exists iff the Hamming distance $d(α,β)$ of $α$ and $β$ is odd. We generalize this classical result to $k$ pairwise disjoint pairs $α_i, β_i\in\{0,1\}^n$: if $d(α_i,β_i)$ is odd for all $i$ and $k<n$, then the set of all $n$-bit strings can be partitioned into $k$ sequences such that the $i$-th sequence leads from $α_i$ to $β_i$ and consecutive strings differ in a single bit. This holds for every $n>1$ with one exception in the case when $n = k + 1 = 4$. Our result is optimal in the sense that for every $n>2$ there are $n$ pairwise disjoint pairs $α_i,β_i\in\{0,1\}^n$ with $d(α_i,β_i)$ odd for which such sequences do not exist.
