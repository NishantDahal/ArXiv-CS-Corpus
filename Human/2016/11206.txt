Design of Robust, Protograph Based LDPC Codes for Rate-Adaptation via Probabilistic Shaping

In this work, the design of robust, protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for rate-adaptive communication via probabilistic shaping is considered. Recently, probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) by BÃ¶cherer et al. has been introduced for capacity approaching and rate-adaptive communication with a bitwise-demapper and binary decoder. Previous work by the authors considered the optimization of protograph based LDPC codes for PAS and specific spectral efficiencies (SEs) to jointly optimize the LDPC code node degrees and the mapping of the coded bits to the bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) bit-channels. We show that these codes tend to perform poor when operated at other rates and propose the design of robust LDPC codes by employing a min-max approach in the search for good protograph ensembles via differential evolution. The considered design uses a single 16 amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) constellation and a robust 13/16 rate LDPC code to operate between 0.7 to 2.7 bits per channel use. For a blocklength of 16224 bits and a target frame error rate of 1e-3 the proposed code operates within 1.32 dB of continuous AWGN capacity for 0.7 to 1.3 bpcu and within 1.05 dB for 1.3 bpcu to 2.7 bpcu.
