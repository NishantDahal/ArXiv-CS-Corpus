The Non-Uniform k-Center Problem

In this paper, we introduce and study the Non-Uniform k-Center problem (NUkC). Given a finite metric space $(X,d)$ and a collection of balls of radii $\{r_1\geq \cdots \ge r_k\}$, the NUkC problem is to find a placement of their centers on the metric space and find the minimum dilation $α$, such that the union of balls of radius $α\cdot r_i$ around the $i$th center covers all the points in $X$. This problem naturally arises as a min-max vehicle routing problem with fleets of different speeds.
  The NUkC problem generalizes the classic $k$-center problem when all the $k$ radii are the same (which can be assumed to be $1$ after scaling). It also generalizes the $k$-center with outliers (kCwO) problem when there are $k$ balls of radius $1$ and $\ell$ balls of radius $0$. There are $2$-approximation and $3$-approximation algorithms known for these problems respectively; the former is best possible unless P=NP and the latter remains unimproved for 15 years.
  We first observe that no $O(1)$-approximation is to the optimal dilation is possible unless P=NP, implying that the NUkC problem is more non-trivial than the above two problems. Our main algorithmic result is an $(O(1),O(1))$-bi-criteria approximation result: we give an $O(1)$-approximation to the optimal dilation, however, we may open $Θ(1)$ centers of each radii. Our techniques also allow us to prove a simple (uni-criteria), optimal $2$-approximation to the kCwO problem improving upon the long-standing $3$-factor. Our main technical contribution is a connection between the NUkC problem and the so-called firefighter problems on trees which have been studied recently in the TCS community.
