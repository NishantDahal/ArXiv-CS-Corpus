Content Delivery in Erasure Broadcast Channels with Cache and Feedback

We study a content delivery problem in a K-user erasure broadcast channel such that a content providing server wishes to deliver requested files to users, each equipped with a cache of a finite memory. Assuming that the transmitter has state feedback and user caches can be filled during off-peak hours reliably by the decentralized content placement, we characterize the achievable rate region as a function of the memory sizes and the erasure probabilities. The proposed delivery scheme, based on the broadcasting scheme by Wang and Gatzianas et al., exploits the receiver side information established during the placement phase. Our results can be extended to centralized content placement as well as multi-antenna broadcast channels with state feedback.
