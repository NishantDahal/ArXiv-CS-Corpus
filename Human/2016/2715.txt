The Complete Weight Enumerator of Several Cyclic Codes

Cyclic codes have attracted a lot of research interest for decades. In this paper, for an odd prime $p$, we propose a general strategy to compute the complete weight enumerator of cyclic codes via the value distribution of the corresponding exponential sums. As applications of this general strategy, we determine the complete weight enumerator of several $p$-ary cyclic codes and give some examples to illustrate our results.
