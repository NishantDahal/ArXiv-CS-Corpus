Features Fusion for Classification of Logos

In this paper, a logo classification system based on the appearance of logo images is proposed. The proposed classification system makes use of global characteristics of logo images for classification. Color, texture, and shape of a logo wholly describe the global characteristics of logo images. The various combinations of these characteristics are used for classification. The combination contains only with single feature or with fusion of two features or fusion of all three features considered at a time respectively. Further, the system categorizes the logo image into: a logo image with fully text or with fully symbols or containing both symbols and texts.. The K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier is used for classification. Due to the lack of color logo image dataset in the literature, the same is created consisting 5044 color logo images. Finally, the performance of the classification system is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure computed from the confusion matrix. The experimental results show that the most promising results are obtained for fusion of features.
