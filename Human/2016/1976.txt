Study of Interference Cancellation and Relay Selection Algorithms Using Greedy Techniques for Cooperative DS-CDMA Systems

In this work, we study interference cancellation techniques and a multi-relay selection algorithm based on greedy methods for the uplink of cooperative direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. We first devise low-cost list-based successive interference cancellation (GL-SIC) and parallel interference cancellation (GL-PIC) algorithms with RAKE receivers as the front-end that can approach the maximum likelihood detector performance and be used at both the relays and the destination of cooperative systems. Unlike prior art, the proposed GL-SIC and GL-PIC algorithms exploit the Euclidean distance between users of interest and the potential nearest constellation point with a chosen threshold in order to build an effective list of detection candidates. A low-complexity multi-relay selection algorithm based on greedy techniques that can approach the performance of an exhaustive search is also proposed. A cross-layer design strategy that brings together the proposed multiuser detection algorithms and the greedy relay selection is then developed along with an analysis of the proposed techniques. Simulations show an excellent bit error rate performance of the proposed detection and relay selection algorithms as compared to existing techniques.
