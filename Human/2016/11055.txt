Extended LTLvis Motion Planning interface (Extended Technical Report)

This paper introduces an extended version of the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) graphical interface. It is a sketch based interface built on the Android platform which makes the LTL control interface more straightforward and friendly to nonexpert users. By predefining a set of areas of interest, this interface can quickly and efficiently create plans that satisfy extended plan goals in LTL. The interface can also allow users to customize the paths for this plan by sketching a set of reference trajectories. Given the custom paths by the user, the LTL specification and the environment, the interface generates a plan balancing the customized paths and the LTL specifications. We also show experimental results with the implemented interface.
