Gaussian Process Morphable Models

Statistical shape models (SSMs) represent a class of shapes as a normal distribution of point variations, whose parameters are estimated from example shapes. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the shape variation in terms of the leading principal components. In this paper, we propose a generalization of SSMs, called Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs). We model the shape variations with a Gaussian process, which we represent using the leading components of its Karhunen-Loeve expansion. To compute the expansion, we make use of an approximation scheme based on the Nystrom method. The resulting model can be seen as a continuous analogon of an SSM. However, while for SSMs the shape variation is restricted to the span of the example data, with GPMMs we can define the shape variation using any Gaussian process. For example, we can build shape models that correspond to classical spline models, and thus do not require any example data. Furthermore, Gaussian processes make it possible to combine different models. For example, an SSM can be extended with a spline model, to obtain a model that incorporates learned shape characteristics, but is flexible enough to explain shapes that cannot be represented by the SSM. We introduce a simple algorithm for fitting a GPMM to a surface or image. This results in a non-rigid registration approach, whose regularization properties are defined by a GPMM. We show how we can obtain different registration schemes,including methods for multi-scale, spatially-varying or hybrid registration, by constructing an appropriate GPMM. As our approach strictly separates modelling from the fitting process, this is all achieved without changes to the fitting algorithm. We show the applicability and versatility of GPMMs on a clinical use case, where the goal is the model-based segmentation of 3D forearm images.
