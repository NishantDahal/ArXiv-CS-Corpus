Multi-mode Unrolled Architectures for Polar Decoders

In this work, we present a family of architectures for polar decoders using a reduced-complexity successive-cancellation decoding algorithm that employs unrolling to achieve extremely high throughput values while retaining moderate implementation complexity. The resulting fully-unrolled, deeply-pipelined architecture is capable of achieving a coded throughput in excess of 1 Tbps on a 65 nm ASIC at 500 MHz---three orders of magnitude greater than current state-of-the-art polar decoders. However, unrolled decoders are built for a specific, fixed code. Therefore we also present a new method to enable the use of multiple code lengths and rates in a fully-unrolled polar decoder architecture. This method leads to a length- and rate-flexible decoder while retaining the very high speed typical to unrolled decoders. The resulting decoders can decode a master polar code of a given rate and length, and several shorter codes of different rates and lengths. We present results for two versions of a multi-mode decoder supporting eight and ten different polar codes, respectively. Both are capable of a peak throughput of 25.6 Gbps. For each decoder, the energy efficiency for the longest supported polar code is shown to be of 14.8 pJ/bit at 250 MHz and of 8.8 pJ/bit at 500 MHz.
