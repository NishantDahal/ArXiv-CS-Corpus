Evaluating the Business Value of CPOE for Cancer Care in Australia: A Resource Based View Perspective

Today, cancer is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. This threatening disease has huge negative impacts, not only on quality of life, but also on the healthcare industry, whose resources are already scarce. Thus, finding new approaches for cancer care has been a central point of interest during the last few decades. One of these approaches is the use of computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems. This systems have the potential to provide more effective and efficient patient-centric cancer care. This paper serves to examine the business value of an American CPOE in an Australian context. This is achieved by using our specifically designed tool to evaluate the business value of IT in the healthcare, in combination with a resource based view perspective. Our results show that the system has a number of enabling resources to generate business value subject to having other resources.
