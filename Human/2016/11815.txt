Offline Drawing of Dynamic Trees: Algorithmics and Document Integration

While the algorithmic drawing of static trees is well-understood and well-supported by software tools, creating animations depicting how a tree changes over time is currently difficult: software support, if available at all, is not integrated into a document production workflow and algorithmic approaches only rarely take temporal information into consideration. During the production of a presentation or a paper, most users will visualize how, say, a search tree evolves over time by manually drawing a sequence of trees. We present an extension of the popular $\TeX$ typesetting system that allows users to specify dynamic trees inside their documents, together with a new algorithm for drawing them. Running $\TeX$ on the documents then results in documents in the SVG format with visually pleasing embedded animations. Our algorithm produces animations that satisfy a set of natural aesthetic criteria when possible. On the negative side, we show that one cannot always satisfy all criteria simultaneously and that minimizing their violations is NP-complete.
