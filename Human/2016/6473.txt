A Feature based Approach for Video Compression

It is a high cost problem for panoramic image stitching via image matching algorithm and not practical for real-time performance. In this paper, we take full advantage ofHarris corner invariant characterization method light intensity parallel meaning, translation and rotation, and made a realtime panoramic image stitching algorithm. According to the basic characteristics and performance FPGA classical algorithm, several modules such as the feature point extraction, and matching description is to optimize the feature-based logic. Real-time optimization system to achieve high precision match. The new algorithm process the image from pixel domain and obtained from CCD camera Xilinx Spartan-6 hardware platform. After the image stitching algorithm, will eventually form a portable interface to output high-definition content on the display. The results showed that, the proposed algorithm has higher precision with good real-time performance and robustness.
