Energy-Efficient Design of MIMO Heterogeneous Networks with Wireless Backhaul

As future networks aim to meet the ever-increasing requirements of high data rate applications, dense and heterogeneous networks (HetNets) will be deployed to provide better coverage and throughput. Besides the important implications for energy consumption, the trend towards densification calls for more and more wireless links to forward a massive backhaul traffic into the core network. It is critically important to take into account the presence of a wireless backhaul for the energy-efficient design of HetNets. In this paper, we provide a general framework to analyze the energy efficiency of a two-tier MIMO heterogeneous network with wireless backhaul in the presence of both uplink and downlink transmissions. We find that under spatial multiplexing the energy efficiency of a HetNet is sensitive to the network load, and it should be taken into account when controlling the number of users served by each base station. We show that a two-tier HetNet with wireless backhaul can be significantly more energy efficient than a one-tier cellular network. However, this requires the bandwidth division between radio access links and wireless backhaul to be optimally designed according to the load conditions.
