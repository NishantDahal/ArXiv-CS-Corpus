Multipliers: comparison of Fourier transformation based method and Synopsys design technique for up to 32 bits inputs in regular and saturation arithmetics

The technique for hardware multiplication based upon Fourier transformation has been introduced. The technique has the highest efficiency on multiplication units with up to 8 bit range. Each multiplication unit is realized on base of the minimized Boolean functions. Experimental data showed that this technique the multiplication process speed up to 20% higher for 2-8 bit range of input operands and up to 3% higher for 8-32 bit range of input operands than analogues designed by Synopsys technique.
