Wireless Sensors Networks for Internet of Things

The Internet is smoothly migrating from an Internet of people towards an Internet of Things (IoT). By 2020, it is expected to have 50 billion things connected to the Internet. However, such a migration induces a strong level of complexity when handling interoperability between the heterogeneous Inter- net things, e.g., RFIDs (Radio Frequency Identification), mobile handheld devices, and wireless sensors. In this context, a couple of standards have been already set, e.g., IPv6, 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks), and M2M (Machine to Machine communications). In this paper, we focus on the integration of wireless sensor networks into IoT, and shed further light on the subtleties of such integration. We present a real-world test bed deployment where wireless sensors are used to control electrical appliances in a smart building. Encountered problems are highlighted and suitable solutions are presented.
