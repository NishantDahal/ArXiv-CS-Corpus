Efficient 3-D Placement of an Aerial Base Station in Next Generation Cellular Networks

Agility and resilience requirements of future cellular networks may not be fully satisfied by terrestrial base stations in cases of unexpected or temporary events. A promising solution is assisting the cellular network via low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with base stations, i.e., drone-cells. Although drone-cells provide a quick deployment opportunity as aerial base stations, efficient placement becomes one of the key issues. In addition to mobility of the drone-cells in the vertical dimension as well as the horizontal dimension, the differences between the air-to-ground and terrestrial channels cause the placement of the drone-cells to diverge from placement of terrestrial base stations. In this paper, we first highlight the properties of the dronecell placement problem, and formulate it as a 3-D placement problem with the objective of maximizing the revenue of the network. After some mathematical manipulations, we formulate an equivalent quadratically-constrained mixed integer non-linear optimization problem and propose a computationally efficient numerical solution for this problem. We verify our analytical derivations with numerical simulations and enrich them with discussions which could serve as guidelines for researchers, mobile network operators, and policy makers.
