Effect of Densification on Cellular Network Performance with Bounded Pathloss Model

In this paper, we investigate how network densification influences the performance of downlink cellular network in terms of coverage probability (CP) and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Instead of the simplified unbounded pathloss model (UPM), we apply a more realistic bounded pathloss model (BPM) to model the decay of signal power caused by pathloss. It is shown that network densification indeed degrades CP when the base station (BS) density $λ$ is sufficiently large. This is inconsistent with the result derived using UPM that CP is independent of $λ$. Moreover, we shed light on the impact of ultra-dense deployment of BSs on the ASE scaling law. Specifically, it is proved that the cellular network ASE scales with rate $λe^{-κλ}$, i.e., first increases with $λ$ and then diminishes to be zero as $λ$ goes to infinity.
