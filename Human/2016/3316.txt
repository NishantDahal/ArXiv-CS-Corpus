Assessing the Navigational Effects of Click Biases and Link Insertion on the Web

Websites have an inherent interest in steering user navigation in order to, for example, increase sales of specific products or categories, or to guide users towards specific information. In general, website administrators can use the following two strategies to influence their visitors' navigation behavior. First, they can introduce click biases to reinforce specific links on their website by changing their visual appearance, for example, by locating them on the top of the page. Second, they can utilize link insertion to generate new paths for users to navigate over. In this paper, we present a novel approach for measuring the potential effects of these two strategies on user navigation. Our results suggest that, depending on the pages for which we want to increase user visits, optimal link modification strategies vary. Moreover, simple topological measures can be used as proxies for assessing the impact of the intended changes on the navigation of users, even before these changes are implemented.
