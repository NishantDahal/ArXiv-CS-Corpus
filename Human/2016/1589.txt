Philosophical Fictionalism and Problem of Artificial Intelligence

The artificial intelligence received broad interpretation as a literary image. This approach did not have unambiguous refering to the scopes of logical studies and mathematical investigations. An author applied methods peculiar to the semiotic approach, offered by Boris Uspensky and Yury Lotman. In addition, the article presented the criticism of modern versions of educational technologies, which led to the unconditional expectations for possibilities of information and telecommunication technologies. Methodological culture's growth, which was described on the base of semiotics and functional approach to word formation of new meanings for the description of the studied subjects, provided the development of pupils' thought. As a result, the research opened new prospects on understanding of artificial intelligence within educational practice.
