Sliding Window Spectrum Sensing for Full-Duplex Cognitive Radios with Low Access-Latency

In a cognitive radio system the failure of secondary user (SU) transceivers to promptly vacate the channel can introduce significant access-latency for primary or high-priority users (PU). In conventional cognitive radio systems, the backoff latency is exacerbated by frame structures that only allow sensing at periodic intervals. Concurrent transmission and sensing using self-interference suppression has been suggested to improve the performance of cognitive radio systems, allowing decisions to be taken at multiple points within the frame. In this paper, we extend this approach by proposing a sliding-window full-duplex model allowing decisions to be taken on a sample-by-sample basis. We also derive the access-latency for both the existing and the proposed schemes. Our results show that the access-latency of the sliding scheme is decreased by a factor of 2.6 compared to the existing slotted full-duplex scheme and by a factor of approximately 16 compared to a half-duplex cognitive radio system. Moreover, the proposed scheme is significantly more resilient to the destructive effects of residual self-interference compared to previous approaches.
