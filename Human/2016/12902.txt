A Novel Bilingual Word Embedding Method for Lexical Translation Using Bilingual Sense Clique

Most of the existing methods for bilingual word embedding only consider shallow context or simple co-occurrence information. In this paper, we propose a latent bilingual sense unit (Bilingual Sense Clique, BSC), which is derived from a maximum complete sub-graph of pointwise mutual information based graph over bilingual corpus. In this way, we treat source and target words equally and a separated bilingual projection processing that have to be used in most existing works is not necessary any more. Several dimension reduction methods are evaluated to summarize the BSC-word relationship. The proposed method is evaluated on bilingual lexicon translation tasks and empirical results show that bilingual sense embedding methods outperform existing bilingual word embedding methods.
