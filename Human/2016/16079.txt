Model Driven Web Application Development With Agile Practices

Model driven development is an effective method due to its benefits such as code transformation, increasing productivity and reducing human based error possibilities. Meanwhile, agile software development increases the software flexibility and customer satisfaction by using iterative method. Can these two development approaches be combined to develop web applications efficiently? What are the challenges and what are the benefits of this approach? In this paper, we answer these two crucial problems; combining model driven development and agile software development results in not only fast development and easiness of the user interface design but also efficient job tracking. We also defined an agile model based approach for web applications whose implementation study has been carried out to support the answers we gave these two crucial problems.
