A Survey of Downlink Non-orthogonal Multiple Access for 5G Wireless Communication Networks

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique for the next generation cellular communication networks. In this paper, we first discuss a simple NOMA model with two users served by a single-carrier simultaneously to illustrate its basic principles. Then, a more general model with multicarrier serving an arbitrary number of users on each subcarrier is also discussed. An overview of existing works on performance analysis, resource allocation, and multiple-input multiple-output NOMA are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the key features of NOMA and its potential research challenges.
