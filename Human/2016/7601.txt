New Bounds for Hypergeometric Creative Telescoping

Based on a modified version of Abramov-Petkov≈°ek reduction, a new algorithm to compute minimal telescopers for bivariate hypergeometric terms was developed last year. We investigate further in this paper and present a new argument for the termination of this algorithm, which provides an independent proof of the existence of telescopers and even enables us to derive lower as well as upper bounds for the order of telescopers for hypergeometric terms. Compared to the known bounds in the literature, our bounds are sometimes better, and never worse than the known ones.
