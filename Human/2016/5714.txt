Joint Resource Allocation for OFDMA based Overlay Cognitive Radio Networks under Stochastic Rate Constraint

This work presents joint subcarrier, power and bit allocation schemes for multi-user OFDM based overlay cognitive radio under constraints on primary user throughput loss and total secondary user transmitted power. Closed form for expressions for the optimal power and bit allocations are initially derived. Subsequently, optimal and suboptimal algorithms to realise the joint subcarrier, power and bit allocations are introduced. Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the joint resource allocation algorithms.
