An IoT Architecture for Wide Area Measurement Systems: a Virtualized PMU Based Approach

Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are pervading different application domains by relying on sensing and actuating devices that share, process and present meaningful real-world information. One of the most important of these domains is certainly the Smart Grid (SG), where the use of advanced measurement and control equipment and the diffusion of communication technologies are making an adaptive, reliable, and efficient management of the energy possible, with several new applications. In this scenario, this paper focuses on one of the major IoT features, which is the virtualization, and proposes an IoT solution for wide area measurement systems where virtualized phasor measurement resources are introduced. Such a solution is intended to make a programmable and smart environment fostering interoperability, reusability and flexibility of SG services. The performance of the system is evaluated for both the traffic generated and the latency to understand which scenarios can benefit from its deployment.
