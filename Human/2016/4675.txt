Mutual Transformation of Information and Knowledge

Information and knowledge are transformable into each other. Information transformation into knowledge by the example of rule generation from OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontology has been shown during the development of the SWES (Semantic Web Expert System). The SWES is expected as an expert system for searching OWL ontologies from the Web, generating rules from the found ontologies and supplementing the SWES knowledge base with these rules. The purpose of this paper is to show knowledge transformation into information by the example of ontology generation from rules.
