Performance of spatial Multi-LRU caching under traffic with temporal locality

In this work a novel family of decentralised caching policies for wireless networks is introduced, referred to as spatial multi-LRU. These improve cache-hit probability by exploiting multi-coverage. Two variations are proposed, the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the number of replicas inserted in the covering edge-caches. The evaluation is done under spatial traffic that exhibits temporal locality, with varying content catalogue and dependent demands. The performance metric is hit probability and the policies are compared to (1) the single-LRU and (2) an upper bound for all centralised policies with periodic popularity updates. Numerical results show the multi-LRU policies outperform both comparison policies. The reason is their passive adaptability to popularity changes. Between the -One and -All variation, which one is preferable strongly depends on the available storage space and on traffic characteristics. The performance also depends on the popularity shape.
