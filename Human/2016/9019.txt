Social value and information quality in online health information search

This paper extends and validates a model of value-driven online healthcare information search in online shared contexts. Perceived value is an important factor behind users' decisions concerning search, consumption and reuse of products and services. The role of utilitarian, hedonic and epistemic value of information in user satisfaction and intention to repeat online search is well recognized, but little support has been found for social value affecting user satisfaction critical for such decisions. Therefore, a value-based model of online healthcare information search was extended adding detailed information quality measures. Our survey data collected from 143 college going students from more than 10 countries studying in South Korea demonstrated two novel results. At first, unlike existing studies, strong support was found for perceived social value affecting the user satisfaction. As a second substantial finding, the significance of social value could only be appreciated by using comprehensive constructs of information quality than simpler measures. Therefore, this study shows for social and shared HIS, users consider access, representation and context quality of healthcare information to be more important from social perspective than intrinsic (or content) quality. Therefore, developers and healthcare organizations interested in traction of their online healthcare information delivery systems (HIS), especially those using internet and social media networks, should focus on enhancing information quality of their systems accordingly.
