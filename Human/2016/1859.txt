VPSolver 3: Multiple-choice Vector Packing Solver

VPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation with graph compression. In this paper, we present the algorithm introduced in VPSolver 3.0.0 for building compressed arc-flow models for the multiple-choice vector packing problem.
