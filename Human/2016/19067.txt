Emerging Security Challenges of Cloud Virtual Infrastructure

The cloud computing model is rapidly transforming the IT landscape. Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm that delivers computing resources as a set of reliable and scalable internet-based services allowing customers to remotely run and manage these services. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is one of the popular cloud computing services. IaaS allows customers to increase their computing resources on the fly without investing in new hardware. IaaS adapts virtualization to enable on-demand access to a pool of virtual computing resources. Although there are great benefits to be gained from cloud computing, cloud computing also enables new categories of threats to be introduced. These threats are a result of the cloud virtual infrastructure complexity created by the adoption of the virtualization technology.
  Breaching the security of any component in the cloud virtual infrastructure significantly impacts on the security of other components and consequently affects the overall system security. This paper explores the security problem of the cloud platform virtual infrastructure identifying the existing security threats and the complexities of this virtual infrastructure. The paper also discusses the existing security approaches to secure the cloud virtual infrastructure and their drawbacks. Finally, we propose and explore some key research challenges of implementing new virtualization-aware security solutions that can provide the pre-emptive protection for complex and ever- dynamic cloud virtual infrastructure.
