RFID-Cloud Smart Cart System

The main purpose of this work is in reducing the queuing delays in major supermarkets or other shopping centers by means of an Electronic Smart Cart System which will introduce an intellectual approach to billing process through RFID technology. Smart Cart System is a cooperative performance of three separate systems: a website developed for the shopping market, electronic smart cart device and anti-theft RFID gates. This project focuses on developing the electronic smart cart device itself. It involves an embedded electronic hardware that consists of an OLED display, Arduino Mega 2560 board, a specifically designed PCB, a Wi-Fi module, 13.56 MHz HF RFID reader, a power supply and a shopping cart.
