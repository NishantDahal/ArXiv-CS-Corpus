Reproducible Pattern Recognition Research: The Case of Optimistic SSL

In this paper, we discuss the approaches we took and trade-offs involved in making a paper on a conceptual topic in pattern recognition research fully reproducible. We discuss our definition of reproducibility, the tools used, how the analysis was set up, show some examples of alternative analyses the code enables and discuss our views on reproducibility.
