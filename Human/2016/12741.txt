Quantifier Scope in Categorical Compositional Distributional Semantics

In  previous  work with J. Hedges, we formalised a generalised quantifiers theory of natural language in  categorical compositional distributional semantics  with the help of bialgebras. In this paper, we show how  quantifier scope ambiguity can be represented in that setting and how this representation can be generalised to branching  quantifiers.
