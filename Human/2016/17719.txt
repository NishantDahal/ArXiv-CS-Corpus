Dilated Floor Functions That Commute

We determine all pairs of real numbers $(α, β)$ such that the dilated floor functions $\lfloor αx\rfloor$ and $\lfloor βx\rfloor$ commute under composition, i.e., such that $\lfloor α\lfloor βx\rfloor\rfloor = \lfloor β\lfloor αx\rfloor\rfloor$ holds for all real $x$.
