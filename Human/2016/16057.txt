Robust self-testing of many-qubit states

We introduce a simple two-player test which certifies that the players apply tensor products of Pauli $σ_X$ and $σ_Z$ observables on the tensor product of $n$ EPR pairs. The test has constant robustness: any strategy achieving success probability within an additive $\varepsilon$ of the optimal must be $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)$-close, in the appropriate distance measure, to the honest $n$-qubit strategy. The test involves $2n$-bit questions and $2$-bit answers. The key technical ingredient is a quantum version of the classical linearity test of Blum, Luby, and Rubinfeld.
  As applications of our result we give (i) the first robust self-test for $n$ EPR pairs; (ii) a quantum multiprover interactive proof system for the local Hamiltonian problem with a constant number of provers and classical questions and answers, and a constant completeness-soundness gap independent of system size; (iii) a robust protocol for delegated quantum computation.
