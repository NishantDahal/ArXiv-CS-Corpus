CNN-LTE: a Class of 1-X Pooling Convolutional Neural Networks on Label Tree Embeddings for Audio Scene Recognition

We describe in this report our audio scene recognition system submitted to the DCASE 2016 challenge. Firstly, given the label set of the scenes, a label tree is automatically constructed. This category taxonomy is then used in the feature extraction step in which an audio scene instance is represented by a label tree embedding image. Different convolutional neural networks, which are tailored for the task at hand, are finally learned on top of the image features for scene recognition. Our system reaches an overall recognition accuracy of 81.2% and 83.3% and outperforms the DCASE 2016 baseline with absolute improvements of 8.7% and 6.1% on the development and test data, respectively.
