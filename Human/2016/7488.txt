The Role of communication and network technologies in vehicular applications

Vehicular networks attract a lot of attention in the research world. Novel vehicular applications need a suitable communication channel in order to extend in-vehicle capabilities and, be aware about surrounding events. However, these networks present some proprieties, such as high mobility or specific topologies. These properties affect the performances of applications and more effort should be directed to identify the final necessities of the network. Few works deal with application requirements which should be considered when vehicular services are designed. In this chapter this gap is filled, proposing an analysis of application requirements which considers available technologies for physical/MAC and network layers. This study contains key factors which must be taken into account not only at the designing stage of the vehicular network, but also when applications are evaluated.
