New MDS Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual codes over finite fields

In this paper, we construct MDS Euclidean self-dual codes which are extended cyclic duadic codes.
  And we obtain many new MDS Euclidean self-dual codes. We also construct MDS Hermitian self-dual codes from generalized Reed-Solomon codes and constacyclic codes. And we give some results on Hermitian self-dual codes, which are the extended cyclic duadic codes.
