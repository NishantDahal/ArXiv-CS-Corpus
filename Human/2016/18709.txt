A High-Level LTL Synthesis Format: TLSF v1.1

We present the Temporal Logic Synthesis Format (TLSF), a high-level format to describe synthesis problems via Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The format builds upon standard LTL, but additionally allows to use high-level constructs, such as sets and functions, to provide a compact and human-readable representation. Furthermore, the format allows to identify parameters of a specification such that a single description can be used to define a family of problems. Additionally, we present a tool to automatically translate the format into plain LTL, which then can be used for synthesis by a solver. The tool also allows to adjust parameters of the specification and to apply standard transformations on the resulting formula.
