Enlightening Deep Neural Networks with Knowledge of Confounding Factors

Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant capacity in modeling some of the most challenging real world problems of high complexity. Despite the popularity of deep models, we still strive to better understand the underlying mechanism that drives their success. Motivated by observations that neurons in trained deep nets predict attributes indirectly related to the training tasks, we recognize that a deep network learns representations more general than the task at hand to disentangle impacts of multiple confounding factors governing the data, in order to isolate the effects of the concerning factors and optimize a given objective. Consequently, we propose a general framework to augment training of deep models with information on auxiliary explanatory data variables, in an effort to boost this disentanglement and train deep networks that comprehend the data interactions and distributions more accurately, and thus improve their generalizability. We incorporate information on prominent auxiliary explanatory factors of the data population into existing architectures as secondary objective/loss blocks that take inputs from hidden layers during training. Once trained, these secondary circuits can be removed to leave a model with the same architecture as the original, but more generalizable and discerning thanks to its comprehension of data interactions. Since pose is one of the most dominant confounding factors for object recognition, we apply this principle to instantiate a pose-aware deep convolutional neural network and demonstrate that auxiliary pose information indeed improves the classification accuracy in our experiments on SAR target classification tasks.
