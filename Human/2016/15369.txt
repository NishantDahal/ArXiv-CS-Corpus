Broadcast Coded Modulation: Multilevel and Bit-interleaved Construction

The capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel is achieved by superposition coding, but superposition of individual coded modulations expands the modulation alphabet and distorts its configuration. Coded modulation over a broadcast channel subject to a specific channel-input modulation constraint remains an important open problem. Some progress has been made in the related area of unequal-error protection modulations which can be considered single-user broadcast transmission, but it does not approach all points on the boundary of the capacity region. This paper studies broadcast coded modulation using multilevel coding (MLC) subject to a specific channel input constellation. The conditions under which multilevel codes can achieve the constellation-constrained capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel are derived. For any given constellation, we propose a pragmatic multilevel design technique with near constellation-constrained-capacity performance where the coupling of the superposition inner and outer codes are localized to each bit-level. It is shown that this can be further relaxed to a code coupling on only one bit level, with little or no penalty under natural labeling. The rate allocation problem between the bit levels of the two users is studied and a pragmatic method is proposed, again with near-capacity performance. In further pursuit of lower complexity, a hybrid MLC-BICM is proposed, whose performance is shown to be very close to the boundary of the constellation-constrained capacity region. Simulation results show that good point-to-point LDPC codes produce excellent performance in the proposed coded modulation framework.
