An Application of Network Lasso Optimization For Ride Sharing Prediction

Ride sharing has important implications in terms of environmental, social and individual goals by reducing carbon footprints, fostering social interactions and economizing commuter costs. The ride sharing systems that are commonly available lack adaptive and scalable techniques that can simultaneously learn from the large scale data and predict in real-time dynamic fashion. In this paper, we study such a problem towards a smart city initiative, where a generic ride sharing system is conceived capable of making predictions about ride share opportunities based on the historically recorded data while satisfying real-time ride requests. Underpinning the system is an application of a powerful machine learning convex optimization framework called Network Lasso that uses the Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization for learning and dynamic prediction. We propose an application of a robust and scalable unified optimization framework within the ride sharing case-study. The application of Network Lasso framework is capable of jointly optimizing and clustering different rides based on their spatial and model similarity. The prediction from the framework clusters new ride requests, making accurate price prediction based on the clusters, detecting hidden correlations in the data and allowing fast convergence due to the network topology. We provide an empirical evaluation of the application of ADMM network Lasso on real trip record and simulated data, proving their effectiveness since the mean squared error of the algorithm's prediction is minimized on the test rides.
