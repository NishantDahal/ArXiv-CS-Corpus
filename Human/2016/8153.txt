Digitory, A Smart Way of Learning Islamic History in Digital Era

In this paper, we would like to propose our web-based application for Islamic history learning system, named Digitory-Digital History. There are two main navigations to browse historical stories on the web. One is location-based navigation using on-line map which gives users access to understand events during Islamic introduction to Indonesia based on the location. Alternatively, users can browse on time base using sliding navigation marked timely, so they can comprehend history in time sequence. Implementing semantic web, this web-app can suggest users related articles, either based on time series, location similarities, or time-domain similarities, and also suggest pictures related to the articles. AJAX strengthen the real-time access and interactivity as users navigate around the web. By the end of this research, we will have the web-app prototype completed with its fundamental location-based navigation, semantic relationship among articles and pictures, and time- based navigation system. As the web-app deployed, we have some volunteers to try our application so that we can evaluate its result, particularly its effectiveness.
