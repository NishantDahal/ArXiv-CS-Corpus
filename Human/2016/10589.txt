Towards Personality-Aware Recommendation

In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: firstly, a person's buying choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems. This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer's buying tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users' personality factors and 1,200 personal users' pictures. The proposed benchmark allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e., Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction. Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them within one integrated toolbox.
