A multilayer reactive system for robots interacting with children with autism

There is a lack of autonomy on traditional Robot-Assisted Therapy systems interacting with children with autism. To overcome this limitation a supervised autonomous robot controller is being built. In this paper we present a multilayer reactive system within such controller. The goal of this Reactive system is to allow the robot to appropriately react to the child's behavior creating the illusion of being alive.
