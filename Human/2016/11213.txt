Meaningful Models: Utilizing Conceptual Structure to Improve Machine Learning Interpretability

The last decade has seen huge progress in the development of advanced machine learning models; however, those models are powerless unless human users can interpret them. Here we show how the mind's construction of concepts and meaning can be used to create more interpretable machine learning models. By proposing a novel method of classifying concepts, in terms of 'form' and 'function', we elucidate the nature of meaning and offer proposals to improve model understandability. As machine learning begins to permeate daily life, interpretable models may serve as a bridge between domain-expert authors and non-expert users.
