Axiomatizing Mathematical Theories: Multiplication

Axiomatizing mathematical structures is a goal of Mathematical Logic. Axiomatizability of the theories of some structures have turned out to be quite difficult and challenging, and some remain open. However axiomatization of some mathematical structures are now classical theorems in Logic, Algebra and Geometry. In this paper we will study the axiomatizability of the theories of multiplication in the domains of natural, integer, rational, real, and complex numbers. We will review some classical theorems, and will give some new proofs for old results. We will see that some structures are missing in the literature, thus leaving it open whether the theories of that structures are axiomatizable (decidable) or not. We will answer one of those open questions in this paper.
