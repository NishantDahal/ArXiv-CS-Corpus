A General Characterization of Sync Word for Asynchronous Communication

We study a problem of sequential frame synchronization for a frame transmitted uniformly in $A$ slots. For a discrete memoryless channel (DMC), Venkat Chandar et al showed that the frame length $N$ must scale with $A$ as $e^{N α(Q)} > A$ for the frame synchronization error to go to zero (asymptotically with $A$). Here, $Q$ denotes the transition probabilities of the DMC and $α(Q)$, defined as the synchronization threshold, characterizes the scaling needed of $N$ for asymptotic error free frame synchronization. We show that the asynchronous communication framework permits a natural tradeoff between the sync frame length $N$ and the channel (usually parameterised by the input). For an AWGN channel, we study this tradeoff between the sync frame length $N$ and the input symbol power $P$ and characterise the scaling needed of the sync frame energy $E = N P$ for optimal frame synchronisation.
