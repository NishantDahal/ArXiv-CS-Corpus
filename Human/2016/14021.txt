Babel Routing Protocol for OMNeT++ - More than just a new simulation module for INET framework

Routing and switching capabilities of computer networks seem as the closed environment containing a limited set of deployed protocols, which nobody dares to change. The majority of wired network designs are stuck with OSPF (guaranteeing dynamic routing exchange on network layer) and RSTP (securing loop-free data-link layer topology). Recently, more use-case specific routing protocols, such as Babel, have appeared. These technologies claim to have better characteristic than current industry standards. Babel is a fresh contribution to the family of distance-vector routing protocols, which is gaining its momentum for small double-stack (IPv6 and IPv4) networks. This paper briefly describes Babel behavior and provides details on its implementation in OMNeT++ discrete event simulator.
