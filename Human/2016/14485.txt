Modeling The Adaption Rule in Context-aware Systems

Context awareness is increasingly gaining applicability in interactive ubiquitous mobile computing systems. Each context-aware application has its own set of behaviors to react to context modifications. This paper is concerned with the context modeling and the development methodology for context-aware systems. We proposed a rule-based approach and use the adaption tree to model the adaption rule of context-aware systems. We illustrate this idea in an arithmetic game application.
