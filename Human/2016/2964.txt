On the Performance of Delay Aware Shared Access with Priorities

In this paper, we analyze a shared access network with a fixed primary node and randomly distributed secondary nodes whose distribution follows a Poisson point process (PPP). The secondaries use a random access protocol allowing them to access the channel with probabilities that depend on the queue size of the primary. Assuming a system with multipacket reception (MPR) receivers having bursty packet arrivals at the primary and saturation at the secondaries, our protocol can be tuned to alleviate congestion at the primary. We study the throughput of the secondary network and the primary average delay, as well as the impact of the secondary node access probability and transmit power. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the throughput of the secondary network under delay constraints for the primary node, which in the case that no congestion control is performed has a closed form expression providing the optimal access probability. Our numerical results illustrate the impact of network operating parameters on the performance of the proposed priority-based shared access protocol.
