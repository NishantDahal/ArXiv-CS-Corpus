Machine Learning for Dental Image Analysis

In order to study the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to dental imaging, we applied AI technology to classify a set of panoramic radiographs using (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is a form of an artificial neural network (ANN), (b) representative image cognition algorithms that implement scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and (c) histogram of oriented gradients (HOG).
