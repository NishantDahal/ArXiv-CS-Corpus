Optimal Traffic Aggregation in Multi-RAT Heterogeneous Wireless Networks

Traffic load balancing and radio resource management is key to harness the dense and increasingly heterogeneous deployment of next generation "$5$G" wireless infrastructure. Strategies for aggregating user traffic from across multiple radio access technologies (RATs) and/or access points (APs) would be crucial in such heterogeneous networks (HetNets), but are not well investigated. In this paper, we develop a low complexity solution for maximizing an $α$-optimal network utility leveraging the multi-link aggregation (simultaneous connectivity to multiple RATs/APs) capability of users in the network. The network utility maximization formulation has maximization of sum rate ($α=0$), maximization of minimum rate ($α\to \infty$), and proportional fair ($α=1$) as its special cases. A closed form is also developed for the special case where a user aggregates traffic from at most two APs/RATs, and hence can be applied to practical scenarios like LTE-WLAN aggregation (LWA) and LTE dual-connectivity solutions. It is shown that the required objective may also be realized through a decentralized implementation requiring a series of message exchanges between the users and network. Using comprehensive system level simulations, it is shown that optimal leveraging of multi-link aggregation leads to substantial throughput gains over single RAT/AP selection techniques.
