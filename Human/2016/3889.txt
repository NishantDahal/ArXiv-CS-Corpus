Evolving Boolean Regulatory Networks with Variable Gene Expression Times

The time taken for gene expression varies not least because proteins vary in length considerably. This paper uses an abstract, tuneable Boolean regulatory network model to explore gene expression time variation. In particular, it is shown how non-uniform expression times can emerge under certain conditions through simulated evolution. That is, gene expression time variance appears beneficial in the shaping of the dynamical behaviour of the regulatory network without explicit consideration of protein function.
