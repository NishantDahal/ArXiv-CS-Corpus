A Study of Vision based Human Motion Recognition and Analysis

Vision based human motion recognition has fascinated many researchers due to its critical challenges and a variety of applications. The applications range from simple gesture recognition to complicated behaviour understanding in surveillance system. This leads to major development in the techniques related to human motion representation and recognition. This paper discusses applications, general framework of human motion recognition, and the details of each of its components. The paper emphasizes on human motion representation and the recognition methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. This study also discusses the selected literature, popular datasets, and concludes with the challenges in the domain along with a future direction. The human motion recognition domain has been active for more than two decades, and has provided a large amount of literature. A bird's eye view for new researchers in the domain is presented in the paper.
