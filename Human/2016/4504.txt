How DNA Cryptography can help whistleblowers and refugees

The recent progress in DNA sequencing will probably revolutionize the world of electronic. Hence, we went from DNA sequencing that only research centers could realize, to portable, tiny and inexpensive tools. So, it is likely that in a few years these DNA sequencers will be included in our smartphones.
  The purpose of this paper is to support this revolution, by using the DNA cryptography, hash functions and social networks. The first application will introduce a mutual entity authentication protocol in order to help waifs, refugees, and victims of human trafficking to find their biological parents online.
  The second application will also use the DNA cryptography and the social networks to protect whistleblowers' actions. For example, this method will allow whistleblowers to securely broadcast on social networks, their information with one grape.
