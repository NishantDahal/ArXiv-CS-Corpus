Secure Repairable Fountain Codes

In this letter, we provide the construction of repairable fountain codes (RFCs) for distributed storage systems that are information-theoretically secure against an eavesdropper that has access to the data stored in a subset of the storage nodes and the data downloaded to repair an additional subset of storage nodes. The security is achieved by adding random symbols to the message, which is then encoded by the concatenation of a Gabidulin code and an RFC. We compare the achievable code rates of the proposed codes with those of secure minimum storage regenerating codes and secure locally repairable codes.
