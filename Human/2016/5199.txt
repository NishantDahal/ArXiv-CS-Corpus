Quantum network protocol for qudits with use of quantum repeaters and Pauli Z-type operational errors

In this chapter a quantum communication protocol with use of repeaters is presented. The protocol is constructed for qudits i.e. the generalized quantum information units. One-dit teleportation is based on the generalized Pauli-Z (phase-flip) gate's correction. This approach avoids using Pauli-X and Hadamard gates unlike in other known protocols based on quantum repeaters which were constructed for qubits and qudits. It is also important to mention that the repeaters based on teleportation protocol, described in this chapter, allow a measurement in the standard base (what simplifies the measurement process) and the use of teleportation causes only Pauli-Z operational errors.
