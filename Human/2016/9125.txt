MHCL: IPv6 Multihop Host Configuration for Low-Power Wireless Networks

Standard routing protocols for Low power and Lossy Networks are typically designed to optimize bottom-up data flows, by maintaining a cycle-free network topology. The advantage of such topologies is low memory footprint to store routing information (only the parent's address needs to me known by each node). The disadvantage is that other communication patterns, like top-down and bidirectional data flows, are not easily implemented. In this work we propose MHCL: IPv6 Multihop Host Configuration for Low-Power Wireless Networks. MHCL employs hierarchical address allocation that explores cycle-free network topologies and aims to enable top-down data communication with low message overhead and memory footprint. We evaluated the performance of MHCL both analytically and through simulations. We implemented MHCL as a subroutine of RPL protocol on Contiki OS and showed that it significantly improves top-down message delivery in RPL, while using a constant amount of memory (i.e., independent of network size) and being efficient in terms of setup time and number of control messages.
