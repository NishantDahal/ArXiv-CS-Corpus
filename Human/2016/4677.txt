Compress Voice Transference over low Signal Strength in Satellite Communication

This paper presents the comparison of compression algorithms for voice transferring method over SMS in satellite communication. Voice transferring method over SMS is useful in situations when signal strength is low and due to poor signal strength voice call connection is not possible to initiate or signal dropped during voice call. This method has one serious flaw that it produces large number of SMS while converting voice into SMS. Such issue is catered to some extend by employing any compression algorithm. In this paper our major aim is to find best compression scheme for said method, for that purpose we compare 6 different types of compression algorithms which are; LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), Huffman coding, PPM (Prediction by partial matching), Arithmetic Coding (AC), BWT (Burrows-Wheeler-Transform), LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain). This comparison shows that PPM compression method offers better compression ratio and produce small number of SMS. For experimentation we use Thuraya SG-2520 satellite phone. Moreover, we develop an application using J2ME platform[Ref:a]. We tested that application more than 100 times and then we compare the result in terms of compression ratio of each algorithm and number of connected SMS produce after each compression method. The result of this study will help developers to choose better compression scheme for their respective applications. http://www.learnrnd.com/news.php?id=ISSUES_IN_MOLECULAR_COMMUNICATIONS
