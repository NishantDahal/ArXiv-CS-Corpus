A Crowd Monitoring Framework using Emotion Analysis of Social Media for Emergency Management in Mass Gatherings

In emergency management for mass gathering, the knowledge about crowd types can highly assist with providing timely response and effective resource allocation. Crowd monitoring can be achieved using computer vision based approaches and sensory data analysis. The emergence of social media platforms presents an opportunity to capture valuable information about how people feel and think. However, reviewing current works shows that there are a limited number of studies that use social media in crowd monitoring and/or incorporate a unified crowd model for consistency and interoperability. This presents a novel framework for crowd monitoring using social media. It includes a standard crowd model to represent different types of crowds. The proposed framework considers the effect of emotion on crowd behaviour and uses the emotion analysis of social media to identify the crowd types in an event. An experiment using historical data of a past event to validate our framework and model is described.
