A Finitely presented group whose word problem has sampleable hard instances

Hard instances of natural computational problems are often elusive. In this note we present an example of a natural decision problem, the word problem for a certain finitely presented group, whose hard instances are easy to find. More precisely the problem has a complexity core sampleable in linear time.
