LIA-RAG: a system based on graphs and divergence of probabilities applied to Speech-To-Text Summarization

This paper aims to introduces a new algorithm for automatic speech-to-text summarization based on statistical divergences of probabilities and graphs. The input is a text from speech conversations with noise, and the output a compact text summary. Our results, on the pilot task CCCS Multiling 2015 French corpus are very encouraging
