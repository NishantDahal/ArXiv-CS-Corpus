Gaussian Multiple Access via Compute-and-Forward

Lattice codes used under the Compute-and-Forward paradigm suggest an alternative strategy for the standard Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC): The receiver successively decodes integer linear combinations of the messages until it can invert and recover all messages. In this paper, a multiple-access technique called CFMA (Compute-Forward Multiple Access) is proposed and analyzed. For the two-user MAC, it is shown that without time-sharing, the entire capacity region can be attained using CFMA with a single-user decoder as soon as the signal-to-noise ratios are above $1+\sqrt{2}$. A partial analysis is given for more than two users. Lastly the strategy is extended to the so-called dirty MAC where two interfering signals are known non-causally to the two transmitters in a distributed fashion. Our scheme extends the previously known results and gives new achievable rate regions.
