Coinami: A Cryptocurrency with DNA Sequence Alignment as Proof-of-work

Rate of growth of the amount of data generated using the high throughput sequencing (HTS) platforms now exceeds the growth stipulated by Moore's Law. The HTS data is expected to surpass those of other "big data" domains such as astronomy, before the year 2025. In addition to sequencing genomes for research purposes, genome and exome sequencing in clinical settings will be a routine part of health care. The analysis of such large amounts of data, however, is not without computational challenges. This burden is even more increased due to the periodic updates to reference genomes, which typically require re-analysis of existing data. Here we propose Coin-Application Mediator Interface (Coinami) to distribute the workload for mapping reads to reference genomes using a volunteer grid computer approach similar to Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC). However, since HTS read mapping requires substantial computational resources and fast analysis turnout is desired, Coinami uses the HTS read mapping as proof-of-work to generate valid blocks to main its own cryptocurrency system, which may help motivate volunteers to dedicate more resources. The Coinami protocol includes mechanisms to ensure that jobs performed by volunteers are correct, and provides genomic data privacy. The prototype implementation of Coinami is available at http://coinami.github.io/.
