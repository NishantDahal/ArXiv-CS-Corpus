On level-transitivity and exponential growth

We prove that if the group generated by a Mealy automaton acts level-transitively on a regular rooted tree, then the semigroup generated by the dual automaton has exponential growth, hence giving a decision procedure of exponential growth for a restricted family of automaton semigroups.
