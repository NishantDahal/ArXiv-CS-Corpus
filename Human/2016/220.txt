Pricing Vehicle Sharing with Proximity Information

For vehicle sharing schemes, where drop-off positions are not fixed, we propose a pricing scheme, where the price depends in part on the distance between where a vehicle is being dropped off and where the closest shared vehicle is parked. Under certain restrictive assumptions, we show that this pricing leads to a socially optimal spread of the vehicles within a region.
