GECKA3D: A 3D Game Engine for Commonsense Knowledge Acquisition

Commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning is key for tasks such as artificial intelligence and natural language understanding. Since commonsense consists of information that humans take for granted, gathering it is an extremely difficult task. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D game engine for commonsense knowledge acquisition (GECKA3D) which aims to collect commonsense from game designers through the development of serious games. GECKA3D integrates the potential of serious games and games with a purpose. This provides a platform for the acquisition of re-usable and multi-purpose knowledge, and also enables the development of games that can provide entertainment value and teach players something meaningful about the actual world they live in.
