Optimal Locally Repairable Systematic Codes Based on Packings

Locally repairable codes are desirable for distributed storage systems to improve the repair efficiency. In this paper, we first build a bridge between locally repairable code and packing. As an application of this bridge, some optimal locally repairable codes can be obtained by packings, which gives optimal locally repairable codes with flexible parameters.
