The constant of recognizability is computable for primitive morphisms

Moss√© proved that primitive morphisms are recognizable. In this paper we give a computable upper bound for the constant of recognizability of such a morphism. This bound can be expressed only using the cardinality of the alphabet and the length of the longest image under the morphism of a letter.
