Knowledge-Enabled Robotic Agents for Shelf Replenishment in Cluttered Retail Environments

Autonomous robots in unstructured and dynamically changing retail environments have to master complex perception, knowledgeprocessing, and manipulation tasks. To enable them to act competently, we propose a framework based on three core components: (o) a knowledge-enabled perception system, capable of combining diverse information sources to cope with occlusions and stacked objects with a variety of textures and shapes, (o) knowledge processing methods produce strategies for tidying up supermarket racks, and (o) the necessary manipulation skills in confined spaces to arrange objects in semi-accessible rack shelves. We demonstrate our framework in an simulated environment as well as on a real shopping rack using a PR2 robot. Typical supermarket products are detected and rearranged in the retail rack, tidying up what was found to be misplaced items.
