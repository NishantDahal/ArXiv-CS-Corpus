A New Approach to SMS Steganography using Mathematical Equations

In the era of Information Technology, cyber-crime has always been a worrying issue for online users. Phishing, social engineering, and third party attacks have made people reluctant to share their personal information, even with trusted entities. Messages that are sent via Short Message Service (SMS) are easily copied and hacked by using special software. To enforce the security of sending messages through mobile phones, one solution is SMS steganography. SMS Steganography is a technique that hides a secret message in the SMS. We propose a new approach for SMS steganography that uses a mathematical equation as the stego media in order to transmit the data. With this approach, we can hide up to 35 characters (25%) of a secret message on a single SMS with maximum of 140 characters.
