Optimizing Point-to-Multipoint Transmissions in High Speed Packet Access Networks

In this paper an innovative Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithm is proposed with the purpose of increasing High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) performances, in terms of system capacity and service quality, when the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) is supplied. The proposed RRM algorithm exploits channel quality indications to set up point-to-multipoint connections to subgroups of multicast users and to select the proper modulation and coding schemes on the downlink. The number of subgroups is determined through an optimization technique that also takes into account the user satisfaction. An exhaustive simulation campaign is conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with the most promising approaches in the literature. Comparisons aim to assess the capability of the proposed RRM algorithm to efficiently manage group oriented services by providing an increment in terms of user satisfaction.
