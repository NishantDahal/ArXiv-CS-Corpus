A Framework for the Adoption of Biometric ATM Authentication in the Kenyan Banks

The use of ATMs has become fundamental in the banking industry owing to the values transacted using these systems and their 24/7 usage. Although several researchers have studied the role of biometrics in security applications for financial institutions, no systematic empirical research has been applied to studying the role of organizational characteristics and contextual factors in the Kenyan financial sector. This study sought to develop a framework for the adoption of biometric ATMs in the Kenyan banking sector, apply the developed framework to study factors influencing adoption of biometric ATM authentication and validate the developed conceptual framework. A survey was used to collect quantitative data from the ATM users which was then analysed using factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. The study established that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy were key determinants for biometric ATMs acceptance, adoption and usage. The study further demonstrated that age, gender and experience were moderating factors on effort expectancy with experience further moderating performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and user privacy.
