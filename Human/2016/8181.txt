A Semi-Definite Programming approach to low dimensional embedding for unsupervised clustering

This paper proposes a variant of the method of Gu√©don and Verhynin for estimating the cluster matrix in the Mixture of Gaussians framework via Semi-Definite Programming. A clustering oriented embedding is deduced from this estimate. The procedure is suitable for very high dimensional data because it is based on pairwise distances only. Theoretical garantees are provided and an eigenvalue optimisation approach is proposed for computing the embedding. The performance of the method is illustrated via Monte Carlo experiements and comparisons with other embeddings from the literature.
