SROS: Securing ROS over the wire, in the graph, and through the kernel

SROS is a proposed addition to the ROS API and ecosystem to support modern cryptography and security measures. An overview of current progress will be presented, rationalizing each major advancement, including: over-the-wire cryptography for all data transport, namespaced access control enforcing graph policies/restrictions, and finally process profiles using Linux Security Modules to harden a node's resource access. By making the community aware of the vulnerabilities in ROS, as well as the proposed solutions provided by SROS, we intend to improve the state of security for future robotics subsystems.
