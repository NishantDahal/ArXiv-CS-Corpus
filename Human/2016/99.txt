Categorization of Stringed Instruments with Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis

Categorization is crucial for content description in archiving of music signals. On many occasions, human brain fails to classify the instruments properly just by listening to their sounds which is evident from the human response data collected during our experiment. Some previous attempts to categorize several musical instruments using various linear analysis methods required a number of parameters to be determined. In this work, we attempted to categorize a number of string instruments according to their mode of playing using latest-state-of-the-art robust non-linear methods. For this, 30 second sound signals of 26 different string instruments from all over the world were analyzed with the help of non linear multifractal analysis (MFDFA) technique. The spectral width obtained from the MFDFA method gives an estimate of the complexity of the signal. From the variation of spectral width, we observed distinct clustering among the string instruments according to their mode of playing. Also there is an indication that similarity in the structural configuration of the instruments is playing a major role in the clustering of their spectral width. The observations and implications are discussed in detail.
