MPP3D: Multi-Precision Pointing using the 3rd Dimension

Distant pointing is still not efficient, accurate or flexible enough for many applications, although many researchers have focused on it. To improve upon distant pointing, we propose MPP3D, which is especially suitable for high-resolution displays. MPP3D uses two dimensions of hand positioning to move a pointer, and it also uses the third dimension to adjust the precision of the movement. Based on the idea of MPP3D, we propose four techniques which combine two ways of mapping and two techniques for precision adjustment. We further provide three types of mapping scheme and visual feedback for each technique. The potential of the proposed techniques was investigated through experimentation. The results show that these techniques were competent for usual computer operations with a cursor, and the adjustment for pointing precision was beneficial for both pointing efficiency and accuracy.
