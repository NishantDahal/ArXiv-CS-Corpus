Quantum algorithms for abelian difference sets and applications to dihedral hidden subgroups

Difference sets are basic combinatorial structures that have applications in signal processing, coding theory, and cryptography. We consider the problem of identifying a shifted version of the characteristic function of a (known) difference set. We present a generic quantum algorithm that can be used to tackle any hidden shift problem for any difference set in any abelian group. We discuss special cases of this framework where the resulting quantum algorithm is efficient. This includes: a) Paley difference sets based on quadratic residues in finite fields, which allows to recover the shifted Legendre function quantum algorithm, b) Hadamard difference sets, which allows to recover the shifted bent function quantum algorithm, and c) Singer difference sets based on finite geometries. The latter class allows us to define instances of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem that can be efficiently solved on a quantum computer.
