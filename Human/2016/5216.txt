Frequency-domain equalization aided iterative detection of faster-than-Nyquist signaling with noise whitening

In this paper, we propose a serially concatenated turbo-encoded faster-than-Nyquist signaling (FTNS) transceiver that takes into account FTNS-specific colored noise effects. The proposed low-complexity receiver carries out soft-decision frequency-domain equalization with the aid of the minimum-mean square error criterion while whitening the colored noise. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage-concatenated FTNS system achieves a better error-ratio performance than previous systems that do not consider colored noise effects in the high-symbol-packing FTNS regime. Furthermore, as an explicit benefit of the proposed iterative decoder, near-capacity performance is achieved with practical decoding complexity.
