Norm minimized Scattering Data from Intensity Spectra

We apply the $l_1$ minimizing technique of compressive sensing (CS) to non-linear quadratic observations. For the example of coherent X-ray scattering we provide the formulae for a Kalman filter approach to quadratic CS and show how to reconstruct the scattering data from their spatial intensity distribution.
