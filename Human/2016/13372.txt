Design and Autonomous Control of the Active Adaptive Suspension System Rudra Mars Rover

Semi or completely autonomous unmanned vehicles, remotely driven or controlled through artificial intelligence, are instrumental to foster space exploration. One of the most essential tasks of a rover is terrain traversing which requires the need of efficient suspension systems. This communication presents a suspension system giving degrees of freedom to every wheel with the help of linear actuators connected through bell crank levers. The actuation of linear actuators directly varies the height of every wheel from the chassis hence offering articulation to the rover. A control system is developed offering an algorithm for its autonomous actuation. This system proves instrumental for leveling of the chassis where any kind of slope, roll or pitch, may impute abstaining of payloads from efficient working. This was tried and tested successfully as a part of the rover developed by Team RUDRA from SRM University, INDIA (first Team from Asia and finishing at the fifth position) at University Rover Challenge 2013, held at UTAH, USA in May-June.
