Grammatical Constraints on Intra-sentential Code-Switching: From Theories to Working Models

We make one of the first attempts to build working models for intra-sentential code-switching based on the Equivalence-Constraint (Poplack 1980) and Matrix-Language (Myers-Scotton 1993) theories. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis, and a small-scale empirical study of the two models for Hindi-English CS. Our analyses show that the models are neither sound nor complete. Taking insights from the errors made by the models, we propose a new model that combines features of both the theories.
