Asymptotic Optimality of Massive MIMO Systems Using Densely Spaced Transmit Antennas

This paper investigates the performance of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that uses a large transmit antenna array with antenna elements spaced densely. Under the assumption of idealized uniform linear antenna arrays without mutual coupling, precoded quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) transmission is proved to achieve the channel capacity of the massive MIMO system when the transmit antenna separation tends to zero. This asymptotic optimality is analogous to that of QPSK faster-than-Nyquist signaling.
