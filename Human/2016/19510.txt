Transition-based Parsing with Context Enhancement and Future Reward Reranking

This paper presents a novel reranking model, future reward reranking, to re-score the actions in a transition-based parser by using a global scorer. Different to conventional reranking parsing, the model searches for the best dependency tree in all feasible trees constraining by a sequence of actions to get the future reward of the sequence. The scorer is based on a first-order graph-based parser with bidirectional LSTM, which catches different parsing view compared with the transition-based parser. Besides, since context enhancement has shown substantial improvement in the arc-stand transition-based parsing over the parsing accuracy, we implement context enhancement on an arc-eager transition-base parser with stack LSTMs, the dynamic oracle and dropout supporting and achieve further improvement. With the global scorer and context enhancement, the results show that UAS of the parser increases as much as 1.20% for English and 1.66% for Chinese, and LAS increases as much as 1.32% for English and 1.63% for Chinese. Moreover, we get state-of-the-art LASs, achieving 87.58% for Chinese and 93.37% for English.
