To Follow or Not to Follow: Analyzing the Growth Patterns of the Trumpists on Twitter

In this paper, we analyze the growth patterns of Donald Trump's followers (Trumpists, henceforth) on Twitter. We first construct a random walk model with a time trend to study the growth trend and the effects of public debates. We then analyze the relationship between Trump's activity on Twitter and the growth of his followers. Thirdly, we analyze the effects of such controversial events as calling for Muslim ban and his 'schlonged' remark.
