Encoding Semiconstrained Systems

Semiconstrained systems were recently suggested as a generalization of constrained systems, commonly used in communication and data-storage applications that require certain offending subsequences be avoided. In an attempt to apply techniques from constrained systems, we study sequences of constrained systems that are contained in, or contain, a given semiconstrained system, while approaching its capacity. In the case of contained systems we describe to such sequences resulting in constant-to-constant bit-rate block encoders and sliding-block encoders. Surprisingly, in the case of containing systems we show that a "generic" semiconstrained system is never contained in a proper fully-constrained system.
