A Unified Coding Framework for Distributed Computing with Straggling Servers

We propose a unified coded framework for distributed computing with straggling servers, by introducing a tradeoff between "latency of computation" and "load of communication" for some linear computation tasks. We show that the coded scheme of [1]-[3] that repeats the intermediate computations to create coded multicasting opportunities to reduce communication load, and the coded scheme of [4], [5] that generates redundant intermediate computations to combat against straggling servers can be viewed as special instances of the proposed framework, by considering two extremes of this tradeoff: minimizing either the load of communication or the latency of computation individually. Furthermore, the latency-load tradeoff achieved by the proposed coded framework allows to systematically operate at any point on that tradeoff to perform distributed computing tasks. We also prove an information-theoretic lower bound on the latency-load tradeoff, which is shown to be within a constant multiplicative gap from the achieved tradeoff at the two end points.
