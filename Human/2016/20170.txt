Hippocampus Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Detection using a Combination of Shape-based Features and Spherical Harmonics Representation

Most of the temporal lobe epilepsy detection approaches are based on hippocampus deformation and use complicated features, resulting, detection is done with complicated features extraction and pre-processing task. In this paper, a new detection method based on shape-based features and spherical harmonics is proposed which can analysis the hippocampus shape anomaly and detection asymmetry. This method consisted of two main parts; (1) shape feature extraction, and (2) image classification. For evaluation, HFH database is used which is publicly available in this field. Nine different geometry and 256 spherical harmonic features are introduced then selected Eighteen of them that detect the asymmetry in hippocampus significantly in a randomly selected subset of the dataset. Then a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was employed to classify the remaining images of the dataset to normal and epileptic images using our selected features. On a dataset of 25 images, 12 images were used for feature extraction and the rest 13 for classification. The results show that the proposed method has accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of, respectively, 84%, 100%, and 80%. Therefore, the proposed approach shows acceptable result and is straightforward also; complicated pre-processing steps were omitted compared to other methods.
