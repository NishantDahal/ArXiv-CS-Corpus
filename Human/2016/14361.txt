Cutting down energy usage in wireless sensor networks using Duty Cycle technique and multi-hop routing

A wireless sensor network is composed of many sensor nodes that have been given out in a specific zone and each of them had an ability of collecting information from the environment and sending collected data to the sink. The most significant issues in wireless sensor networks despite the recent progress is the trouble of the severe limitations of energy resources. Since that in different applications of sensor nets we could throw a static or mobile sink then all aspects of such networks should be planned with an awareness of energy. One of the most significant topics related to these networks is routing. One of the most widely used and efficient methods of routing is a hierarchy (based on clustering) method. In The present study with the objective of cutting down energy consumption and persistence of network coverage we have offered a novel algorithm based on clustering algorithms and multi hop routing. To achieve this goal first we layer the network environment based on the size of the network. We will identify the optimal number of cluster heads and every cluster head based on the mechanism of topology control will start to accept members. Likewise we set the first layer as gate layer and subsequently identifying the gate nodes we would turn away half of the sensors and then stop using energy and the remaining nodes in this layer will join the gate nodes because they hold a critical part in bettering the functioning of the system. Cluster heads off following layers send the information to cluster heads in the above layer until sent data will be sent to gate nodes and finally will be sent to sink. We have tested the proposed algorithm in two situations 1) when the sink is off and 2) when a sink is on and simulation data shows that proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of the life span of a network than LEACH and E LEACH protocols.
