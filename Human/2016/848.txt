Attention Sensitive Web Browsing

With a number of cheap commercial dry EEG kits available today, it is possible to look at user attention driven scenarios for interaction with the web browser. Using EEG to determine the user's attention level is preferable to using methods such as gaze tracking or time spent on the webpage. In this paper we use the attention level in three different ways. First, as a control mechanism, to control user interface elements such as menus or buttons. Second, to make the web browser responsive to the current attention level. Third, as a means for the web developer to control the user experience based on the level of attention paid by the user, thus creating attention sensitive websites. We present implementation details for each of these, using the NeuroSky MindWave sensor. We also explore issues in the system, and possibility of an EEG based web standard.
