Edge Agreement of Multi-agent System with Quantized Measurements via the Directed Edge Laplacian

This work explores the edge agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system under quantized measurements. Under the edge agreement framework, we introduce an important concept about the \emph{essential edge Laplacian} and also obtain a reduced model of the edge agreement dynamics based on the spanning tree subgraph. The quantized edge agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system is studied, in which both uniform and logarithmic quantizers are considered. We do not only guarantee the stability of the proposed quantized control law, but also reveal the explicit mathematical connection of the quantized interval and the convergence properties for both uniform and logarithmic quantizers, which has not been addressed before. Particularly, for uniform quantizers, we provide the upper bound of the radius of the agreement neighborhood and indicate that the radius increases with the quantization interval. While for logarithmic quantizers, the agents converge exponentially to the desired agreement equilibrium. In addition, we figure out the relationship of the quantization interval and the convergence speed and also provide the estimates of the convergence rate. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.
