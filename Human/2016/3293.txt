Analyzing coevolutionary games with dynamic fitness landscapes

Coevolutionary games cast players that may change their strategies as well as their networks of interaction. In this paper a framework is introduced for describing coevolutionary game dynamics by landscape models. It is shown that coevolutionary games invoke dynamic landscapes. Numerical experiments are shown for a prisoner's dilemma (PD) and a snow drift (SD) game that both use either birth-death (BD) or death-birth (DB) strategy updating. The resulting landscapes are analyzed with respect to modality and ruggedness
