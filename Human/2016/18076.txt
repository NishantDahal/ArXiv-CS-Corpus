Transforming Hidden Vector Encryption Schemes from Composite to Prime Order Groups

Predicate encryption is a new type of public key encryption that enables searches on encrypted data. By using predicate encryption, we can search keywords or attributes on encrypted data without decrypting ciphertexts. Hidden vector encryption (HVE) is a special kind of predicate encryption. HVE supports the evaluation of conjunctive equality, comparison, and subset operations between attributes in ciphertexts and attributes in tokens. In this paper, we construct efficient HVE schemes in prime order bilinear groups derived from previous HVE schemes in composite order bilinear groups, and prove their selective security under simple assumptions. To achieve this result, we present a conversion method that transforms HVE schemes from composite order bilinear groups into prime order bilinear groups. Our method supports any types of prime order bilinear groups and uses simple assumptions.
