A note about "Faster algorithms for computing Hong's bound on absolute positiveness" by K. Mehlhorn and S. Ray

We show that a linear-time algorithm for computing Hong's bound for positive roots of a univariate polynomial, described by K. Mehlhorn and S. Ray in an article "Faster algorithms for computing Hong's bound on absolute positiveness", is incorrect. We present a corrected version.
