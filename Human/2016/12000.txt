Resource Allocation in Dynamic TDD Heterogeneous Networks under Mixed Traffic

Recently, Dynamic Time Division Duplex (TDD) has been proposed to handle the asymmetry of traffic demand between DownLink (DL) and UpLink (UL) in Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). However, for mixed traffic consisting of best effort traffic and soft Quality of Service (QoS) traffic, the resource allocation problem has not been adequately studied in Dynamic TDD HetNets. In this paper, we focus on such problem in a two-tier HetNet with co-channel deployment of one Macro cell Base Station (MBS) and multiple Small cell Base Stations (SBSs) in hotspots. Different from existing work, we introduce low power almost blank subframes to alleviate MBS-to-SBS interference which is inherent in TDD operation. To tackle the resource allocation problem, we propose a two-step strategy. First, from the view point of base stations, we propose a transmission protocol and perform time resource allocation by formulating and solving a network capacity maximization problem under DL/UL traffic demands. Second, from the view point of User Equipments (UEs), we formulate their resource allocation as a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the NUM problem. Simulations show the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of network throughput and UE QoS satisfaction level.
