Fundamental Limits of Training-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems

In this paper, we endeavour to seek a fundamental understanding of the potentials and limitations of training-based multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In a multiuser MIMO system, users are geographically separated. So, the near-far effect plays an indispensable role in channel fading. The existing optimal training design for conventional MIMO does not take the near-far effect into account, and thus is not applicable to a multiuser MIMO system. In this work, we use the majorization theory as a basic tool to study the tradeoff between the channel estimation quality and the information throughput. We establish tight upper and lower bounds of the throughput, and prove that the derived lower bound is asymptotically optimal for throughput maximization at high signal-to-noise ratio. Our analysis shows that the optimal training sequences for throughput maximization in a multiuser MIMO system are in general not orthogonal to each other. Furthermore, due to the near-far effect, the optimal training design for throughput maximization is to deactivate a portion of users with the weakest channels in transmission. These observations shed light on the practical design of training-based multiuser MIMO systems.
