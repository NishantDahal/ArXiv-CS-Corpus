Efficient Deployment of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Optimal Wireless Coverage

In this paper, the efficient deployment of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with directional antennas acting as wireless base stations that provide coverage for ground users is analyzed. First, the downlink coverage probability for UAVs as a function of the altitude and the antenna gain is derived. Next, using circle packing theory, the three-dimensional locations of the UAVs is determined in a way that the total coverage area is maximized while maximizing the coverage lifetime of the UAVs. Our results show that, in order to mitigate interference, the altitude of the UAVs must be properly adjusted based on the beamwidth of the directional antenna as well as coverage requirements. Furthermore, the minimum number of UAVs needed to guarantee a target coverage probability for a given geographical area is determined. Numerical results evaluate the various tradeoffs involved in various UAV deployment scenarios.
