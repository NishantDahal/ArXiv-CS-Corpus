An advanced Study on Cryptography Mechanisms for Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. The most crucial and fundamental challenge facing WSN is security. Due to minimum capacity in-term of memory cost, processing and physical accessibility to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic. They are mostly deployed in open area, which expose them to different kinds of attacks. In this paper, we present an illustration of different attacks and vulnerabilities in WSN. Then we describe and analyze security requirement, countermeasures based on cryptography mechanisms in literature. Finally, we present possible directions in future research.
