Service Function Chaining Resource Allocation: A Survey

Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a crucial technology for future Internet. It aims to overcome the limitation of current deployment models which is rigid and static. Application of this technology relies on algorithms that can optimally mapping SFC to substrate network. This category of algorithms is referred as "Service Function Chaining Resource Allocation (SFC-RA)" algorithms or "VNF placement (VNFP)" algorithms. This paper presents a survey of current researches in SFC-RA algorithms. After presenting the formulation and related problems, several variants of SFC-RA problem are summarized. At last, we discussed several future research directions.
