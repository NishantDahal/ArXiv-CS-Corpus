Software-Defined Networking Based Network Virtualization for Mobile Operators

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm provides many features including hardware abstraction, programmable networking and centralized policy control. One of the main benefits used along with these features is core/backhaul network virtualization which ensures sharing of mobile core and backhaul networks among Mobile Operators (MOs). In this paper, we propose a virtualized SDN-based Evolved Packet System (EPS) cellular network architecture including design of network virtualization controller. After virtualization of core/backhaul network elements, eNodeBs associated with MOs become a part of resource allocation problem for Backhaul Transport Providers (BTPs). We investigate the performance of our proposed architecture where eNodeBs are assigned to the MOs using quality-of-service (QoS)-aware and QoS-unaware scheduling algorithms under the consideration of time-varying numbers and locations of user equipments (UEs) through Monte-Carlo simulations. The performances are compared with traditional EPS in Long Term Evolution (LTE) architecture and the results reveal that our proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cellular network architecture.
