A necessary and sufficient condition for minimum phase and implications for phase retrieval

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a function $E(t)$ being of minimum phase, and hence for its phase being univocally determined by its intensity $|E(t)|^2$. This condition is based on the knowledge of $E(t)$ alone and not of its analytic continuation in the complex plane, thus greatly simplifying its practical applicability. We apply these results to find the class of all band-limited signals that correspond to distinct receiver states when the detector is sensitive to the field intensity only and insensitive to the field phase, and discuss the performance of a recently proposed transmission scheme able to linearly detect all distinguishable states.
