Matrix Factorization Method for Decentralized Recommender Systems

Decentralized recommender system does not rely on the central service provider, and the users can keep the ownership of their ratings. This article brings the theoretically well-studied matrix factorization method into the decentralized recommender system, where the formerly prevalent algorithms are heuristic and hence lack of theoretical guarantee. Our preliminary simulation results show that this method is promising.
