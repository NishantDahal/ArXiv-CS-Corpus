GeThR-Net: A Generalized Temporally Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network for Multimodal Information Fusion

Data generated from real world events are usually temporal and contain multimodal information such as audio, visual, depth, sensor etc. which are required to be intelligently combined for classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel generalized deep neural network architecture where temporal streams from multiple modalities are combined. There are total M+1 (M is the number of modalities) components in the proposed network. The first component is a novel temporally hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that exploits the complimentary nature of the multimodal temporal information by allowing the network to learn both modality specific temporal dynamics as well as the dynamics in a multimodal feature space. M additional components are added to the network which extract discriminative but non-temporal cues from each modality. Finally, the predictions from all of these components are linearly combined using a set of automatically learned weights. We perform exhaustive experiments on three different datasets spanning four modalities. The proposed network is relatively 3.5%, 5.7% and 2% better than the best performing temporal multimodal baseline for UCF-101, CCV and Multimodal Gesture datasets respectively.
