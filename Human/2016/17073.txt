RenderSelect: a Cloud Broker Framework for Cloud Renderfarm Services

In the 3D studios the animation scene files undergo a process called as rendering, where the 3D wire frame models are converted into 3D photorealistic images. As the rendering process is both a computationally intensive and a time consuming task, the cloud services based rendering in cloud render farms is gaining popularity among the animators. Though cloud render farms offer many benefits, the animators hesitate to move from their traditional offline rendering to cloud services based render farms as they lack the knowledge, expertise and the time to compare the render farm service providers based on the Quality of Service (QoS) offered by them, negotiate the QoS and monitor whether the agreed upon QoS is actually offered by the renderfarm service providers. In this paper we propose a Cloud Service Broker (CSB) framework called the RenderSelect that helps in the dynamic ranking, selection, negotiation and monitoring of the cloud based render farm services. The cloud services based renderfarms are ranked and selected services based on multi criteria QoS requirements. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), the popular Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method is used for ranking and selecting the cloud services based renderfarms. The AHP method of ranking is illustrated in detail with an example. It could be verified that AHP method ranks the cloud services effectively with less time and complexity.
