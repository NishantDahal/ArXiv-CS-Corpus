Computing the $L_1$ Geodesic Diameter and Center of a Polygonal Domain

For a polygonal domain with $h$ holes and a total of $n$ vertices, we present algorithms that compute the $L_1$ geodesic diameter in $O(n^2+h^4)$ time and the $L_1$ geodesic center in $O((n^4+n^2 h^4)α(n))$ time, respectively, where $α(\cdot)$ denotes the inverse Ackermann function. No algorithms were known for these problems before. For the Euclidean counterpart, the best algorithms compute the geodesic diameter in $O(n^{7.73})$ or $O(n^7(h+\log n))$ time, and compute the geodesic center in $O(n^{11}\log n)$ time. Therefore, our algorithms are significantly faster than the algorithms for the Euclidean problems. Our algorithms are based on several interesting observations on $L_1$ shortest paths in polygonal domains.
