Graph Editing to a Given Degree Sequence

We investigate the parameterized complexity of the graph editing problem called Editing to a Graph with a Given Degree Sequence, where the aim is to obtain a graph with a given degree sequence σby at most k vertex or edge deletions and edge additions. We show that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by k for any combination of the allowed editing operations. From the positive side, we show that the problem can be solved in time 2^{O(k(Δ+k)^2)}n^2 log n for n-vertex graphs, where Δ=max σ, i.e., the problem is FPT when parameterized by k+Δ. We also show that Editing to a Graph with a Given Degree Sequence has a polynomial kernel when parameterized by k+Δif only edge additions are allowed, and there is no polynomial kernel unless NP\subseteq coNP/poly for all other combinations of allowed editing operations.
