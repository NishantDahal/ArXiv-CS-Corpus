Secure Communication in Uplink Transmissions: User Selection and Multiuser Secrecy Gain

In this paper, we investigate secure communications in uplink transmissions, where there are a base station (BS) with M receive antennas, K mobile users each with a single antenna, and an eavesdropper with N receive antennas. The closed-form expressions of the achievable ergodic secrecy sumrates (ESSR) for a random k users selection scheme in the high and low SNR regimes are presented. It is shown that the scaling behavior of ESSR with respect to the number of served users k can be quite different under different system configurations, determined by the numbers of the BS antennas and that of the eavesdropper antennas. In order to achieve a multiuser gain, two low-complexity user selection schemes are proposed under different assumptions on the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI). The closed-form expressions of the achievable ESSRs and the multiuser secrecy gains of the two schemes are also presented in both low and high SNR regimes. We observe that, as k increases, the multiuser secrecy gain increases, while the ESSR may decrease. Therefore, when N is much larger than M, serving one user with the strongest channel (TDMA-like) is a favourable secrecy scheme, where the ESSR scales with root square of 2 log K.
