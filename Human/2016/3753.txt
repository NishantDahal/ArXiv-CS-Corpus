In-Vehicle PLC: In-Car and In-Ship Channel Characterization

This paper deals with power line communication (PLC) in the context of in-vehicle data networks. This technology can provide high-speed data connectivity via the exploitation of the existing power network, with clear potential benefits in terms of cost and weight reduction. The focus is on two scenarios: an electric car and a cruise ship. An overview of the wiring infrastructure and the network topology in these two scenarios is provided. The main findings reported in the literature related to the channel characteristics are reported. Noise is also assessed with emphasis to the electric car context. Then, new results from the statistical analysis of measurements made in a compact electric car and in a large cruise ship are shown. The channel characteristics are analysed in terms of average channel gain, delay spread, coherence bandwidth and achievable transmission rate. Finally, an overall comparison is made, highlighting similarities and differences taking into account also the conventional (combustion engine) car and the largely investigated in-home scenario.
