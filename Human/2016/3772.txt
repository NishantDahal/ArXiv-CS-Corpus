How to make RSA and some other encryptions probabilistic

A new scheme of probabilistic subgroup-related encryption is introduced. Some applications of this scheme based on the RSA, Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal encryption algorithms are described. Security assumptions and main advantages of this scheme are discussed. We outline that this scheme is potentially semantically secure under reasonable cryptographic assumptions.
