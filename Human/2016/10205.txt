A DEMATEL-Based Completion Method for Incomplete Pairwise Comparison Matrix in AHP

Pairwise comparison matrix as a crucial component of AHP, presents the prefer- ence relations among alternatives. However, in many cases, the pairwise comparison matrix is difficult to complete, which obstructs the subsequent operations of the clas- sical AHP. In this paper, based on DEMATEL which has ability to derive the total relation matrix from direct relation matrix, a new completion method for incomplete pairwise comparison matrix is proposed. The proposed method provides a new per- spective to estimate the missing values with explicit physical meaning. Besides, the proposed method has low computational cost. This promising method has a wide application in multi-criteria decision-making.
