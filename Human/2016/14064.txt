On Wirelessly Powered Communications with Short Packets

Wireless-powered communications will entail short packets due to naturally small payloads, low latency requirements and/or insufficient energy resources to support longer transmissions. In this paper, a wireless-powered communication system is investigated where an energy harvesting transmitter, charged by a power beacon via wireless energy transfer, attempts to communicate with a receiver over a noisy channel. Leveraging the framework of finite-length information theory, the system performance is analyzed using metrics such as the energy supply probability at the transmitter, and the achievable rate at the receiver. The analysis yields useful insights into the system behavior in terms of key parameters such as the harvest blocklength, the transmit blocklength, the average harvested power and the transmit power. Closed-form expressions are derived for the asymptotically optimal transmit power. Numerical results suggest that power control is essential for improving the achievable rate of the system in the finite blocklength regime.
