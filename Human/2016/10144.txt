On the Capacity of Diffusion-Based Molecular Communications with SiNW FET-Based Receiver

Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices. Although MC has been extensively studied from various aspects, limitations imposed by the physical design of transceiving units have been largely neglected in the literature. Recently, we have proposed a nanobioelectronic MC receiver architecture based on the nanoscale field effect transistor-based biosensor (bioFET) technology, providing noninvasive and sensitive molecular detection at nanoscale while producing electrical signals at the output. In this paper, we derive analytical closed-form expressions for the capacity and capacity-achieving input distribution for a memoryless MC channel with a silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receiver. The resulting expressions could be used to optimize the information flow in MC systems equipped with nanobioelectronic receivers.
