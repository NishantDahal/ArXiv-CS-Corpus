Optimal QoS-Aware Channel Assignment in D2D Communications with Partial CSI

In this paper, we propose effective channel assignment algorithms for network utility maximization in a cellular network with underlaying device-to-device (D2D) communications. A major innovation is the consideration of partial channel state information (CSI), i.e., the base station (BS) is assumed to be able to acquire `partial' instantaneous CSI of the cellular and D2D links, as well as, the interference links. In contrast to existing works, multiple D2D links are allowed to share the same channel, and the quality of service (QoS) requirements for both the cellular and D2D links are enforced. We first develop an optimal channel assignment algorithm based on dynamic programming (DP), which enjoys a much lower complexity compared to exhaustive search and will serve as a performance benchmark. To further reduce complexity, we propose a cluster-based sub-optimal channel assignment algorithm. New closed-form expressions for the expected weighted sum-rate and the successful transmission probabilities are also derived. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Moreover, by comparing different partial CSI scenarios, we observe that the CSI of the D2D communication links and the interference links from the D2D transmitters to the BS significantly affects the network performance, while the CSI of the interference links from the BS to the D2D receivers only has a negligible impact.
