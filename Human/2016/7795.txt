  Let $H$ be a set of $n$ planes in three dimensions, and let $r \leq n$ be a parameter. We give a simple alternative proof of the existence of a $(1/r)$-cutting of the first $n/r$ levels of $\Arr(H)$, which consists of $O(r)$ semi-unbounded vertical triangular prisms. The same construction yields an approximation of the $(n/r)$-level by a terrain consisting of $O(r/\eps^3)$ triangular faces, which lies entirely between the levels $(1\pm\eps)n/r$. The proof does not use sampling, and exploits techniques based on planar separators and various structural properties of levels in three-dimensional arrangements and of planar maps. The proof is constructive, and leads to a simple randomized algorithm, with expected near-linear running time. An application of this technique allows us to mimic Matousek's construction of cuttings in the plane, to obtain a similar construction of "layered" $(1/r)$-cutting of the entire arrangement $\Arr(H)$, of optimal size $O(r^3)$. Another application is a simplified optimal approximate range counting algorithm in three dimensions, competing with that of Afshani and Chan.
