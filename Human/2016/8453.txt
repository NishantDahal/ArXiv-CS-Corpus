Artificial Fun: Mapping Minds to the Space of Fun

Yampolskiy and others have shown that the space of possible minds is vast, actually infinite (Yampolskiy, 2015). A question of interest is 'Which activities can minds perform during their lifetime?' This question is very broad, thus in this article restricted to 'Which non-boring activities can minds perform?' The space of potential non-boring activities has been called by Yudkowsky 'fun space' (Yudkowsky, 2009). This paper aims to discuss the relation between various types of minds and the part of the fun space, which is accessible for them.
