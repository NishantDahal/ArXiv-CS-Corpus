Nanosurveyor: a framework for real-time data processing

Scientists are drawn to synchrotrons and accelerator based light sources because of their brightness, coherence and flux. The rate of improvement in brightness and detector technology has outpaced Moore's law growth seen for computers, networks, and storage, and is enabling novel observations and discoveries with faster frame rates, larger fields of view, higher resolution, and higher dimensionality. Here we present an integrated software/algorithmic framework designed to capitalize on high throughput experiments, and describe the streamlined processing pipeline of ptychography data analysis. The pipeline provides throughput, compression, and resolution as well as rapid feedback to the microscope operators.
