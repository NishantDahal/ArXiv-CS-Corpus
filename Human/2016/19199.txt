The Cycle Structure of LFSR with Arbitrary Characteristic Polynomial over Finite Fields

We determine the cycle structure of linear feedback shift register with arbitrary monic characteristic polynomial over any finite field. For each cycle, a method to find a state and a new way to represent the state are proposed.
