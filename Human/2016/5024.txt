Gaussian Copula Variational Autoencoders for Mixed Data

The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model with continuous latent variables where a pair of probabilistic encoder (bottom-up) and decoder (top-down) is jointly learned by stochastic gradient variational Bayes. We first elaborate Gaussian VAE, approximating the local covariance matrix of the decoder as an outer product of the principal direction at a position determined by a sample drawn from Gaussian distribution. We show that this model, referred to as VAE-ROC, better captures the data manifold, compared to the standard Gaussian VAE where independent multivariate Gaussian was used to model the decoder. Then we extend the VAE-ROC to handle mixed categorical and continuous data. To this end, we employ Gaussian copula to model the local dependency in mixed categorical and continuous data, leading to {\em Gaussian copula variational autoencoder} (GCVAE). As in VAE-ROC, we use the rank-one approximation for the covariance in the Gaussian copula, to capture the local dependency structure in the mixed data. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the useful behaviour of VAE-ROC and GCVAE, compared to the standard VAE.
