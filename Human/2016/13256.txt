A System for Precise End-to-End Delay Measurements in Video Communication

Low delay video transmission is becoming increasingly important. Delay critical, video enabled applications range from teleoperation scenarios such as controlling drones or telesurgery to autonomous control through computer vision algorithms applied on real-time video. To judge the quality of the video transmission in such a system, it is important to be able to precisely measure the end-to-end (E2E) delay of the transmitted video. We present a low-complexity system that automatically takes pairwise independent measurements of E2E delay. The precision can be far below the millisecond order, mainly limited by the sampling rate of the measurement system. In our implementation, we achieve a precision of 0.5 milliseconds with a sampling rate of 2kHz.
