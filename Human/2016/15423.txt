Cryptanalysis of a Classical chaos-based cryptosystem with some quantum cryptography features

The application of synchronization theory to build up new cryptosystems has been a hot topic during the last two decades. In this paper we analyze a recent proposal in this field. We pinpoint the main limitations of the software implementation of chaos-based systems designed on the grounds of synchronization theory. In addition, we show that the cryptosystem under evaluation possesses serious security problems that imply a clear reduction of the key space.
