Decarbonized Demand Response for Residential Plug-in Electric Vehicles in Smart Grids

Recently, in Paris, the world has reached an agreement whereby many countries commit to bolster their efforts about reducing adverse climate changes. Hence, we can expect that decarbonization will even attract more attention in different energy sectors in near future. In particular, both generation side and consumption side are required to be run more congruently and environmentally friendly. Thus, employing the renewables at the generation side along with our proposed decarbonized demand response (DDR) at the consumption side could significantly reduce deleterious impacts on the climate. Such ambition, at the consumption side, necessitates symbiosis and synergy between the customers and the retailer, and among customers, respectively. In other words, there should be some incentive-based collaboration between customers and the retailer as well as coordination among customers to make the objective be achieved successfully. In this paper, we present such matching demand response (DR) algorithm for residential users owning vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) who obtain electricity from a common retailer. The retailer itself is connected to the wholesale electricity market to purchase and sell electricity. Furthermore, we explain the details of the existing symbiosis and synergy in our system. Our simulation results illustrate that substantial cost savings can be achieved along with pollution reduction by our proposed technique.
