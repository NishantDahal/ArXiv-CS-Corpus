Stub Wireless Multi-hop Networks using Self-configurable Wi-Fi Basic Service Set Cascading

The increasing trend in wireless Internet access has been boosted by IEEE 802.11. However, the application scenarios are still limited by its short radio range. Stub Wireless Multi-hop Networks (WMNs) are a robust, flexible, and cost-effective solution to the problem. Yet, typically they are formed by single radio mesh nodes and suffer from hidden node, unfairness, and scalability problems.
  We propose a simple multi-radio, multi-channel WMN solution, named Wi-Fi network Infrastructure eXtension - Dual-Radio (WiFIX-DR), to overcome these problems. WiFIX-DR reuses IEEE 802.11 built-in mechanisms and beacons to form a Stub WMN as a set of self-configurable interconnected Basic Service Sets (BSSs). Experimental results show the improved scalability enabled by the proposed solution when compared to single-radio WMNs.
