Review on Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model

Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model is computer simulation model of pedestrian movement where every pedestrian in the model is treated as individual. Most of pedestrian researches have been done on macroscopic level, which does not consider the interaction between pedestrians and does not well suited for prediction of pedestrian flow performance in pedestrian areas or building with some objects that reduce the effective width of it. In the other hand, microscopic level has more general usage and considers detail of the design. Tough the analytical model for microscopic pedestrian model is existed exist, the numerical solution of the model is very difficult and simulation is favorable. The model has practical application of Evacuation from building, Design of pedestrian area, and Experimental & Optimization Design Tool. In general, Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model consist of two terms, that make the pedestrian moving toward the destination and make repulsive effect toward other pedestrian or obstacles.
