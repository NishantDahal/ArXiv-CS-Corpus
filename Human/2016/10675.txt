Password Generators: Old Ideas and New

This paper considers password generators, i.e. systems designed to generate site-specific passwords on demand. Such systems are an alternative to password managers. Over the last 15 years a range of password generator systems have been described. This paper proposes the first general model for such systems, and critically examines options for instantiating this model; options considered include all those previously proposed as part of existing schemes as well as certain novel possibilities. The model enables a more objective and high-level assessment of the design of such systems; it has also been used to sketch a possible new scheme, AutoPass, intended to incorporate the best features of the prior art whilst also addressing many of the most serious shortcomings of existing systems through the inclusion of novel features.
