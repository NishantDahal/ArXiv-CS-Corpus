Remark on a result of Constantine

In this short note we construct codes of length $4n$ with $8n+8$ codewords and minimum distance $2n-2$ whenever $4n+4$ is the order of a Hadamard matrix. This generalises work of Constantine who obtained a similar result in the special case that $n$ is a prime power.
