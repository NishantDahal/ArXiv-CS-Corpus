Proposal of Optimum Application Deployment Technology for Heterogeneous IaaS Cloud

Recently, cloud systems composed of heterogeneous hardware have been increased to utilize progressed hardware power. However, to program applications for heterogeneous hardware to achieve high performance needs much technical skill and is difficult for users. Therefore, to achieve high performance easily, this paper proposes a PaaS which analyzes application logics and offloads computations to GPU and FPGA automatically when users deploy applications to clouds.
