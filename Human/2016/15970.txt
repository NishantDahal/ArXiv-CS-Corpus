Theory and computer simulation of the moiré patterns in single-layer cylindrical particles

Basing on the theory for arbitrary oriented surfaces, we developed the theory of the moiré effect for cylindrical single-layer objects in the paraxial approximation. With using the dual grids, the moiré effect in the plane gratings is simulated, as well as the near-axis moiré effect in cylinders including the chiral layouts. The results can be applied to the graphene layers, to single-walled nanotubes, and to cylinders in general.
