Lecture Notes on Channel Coding

These lecture notes on channel coding were developed for a one-semester course for graduate students of electrical engineering. Chapter 1 reviews the basic problem of channel coding. Chapters 2-5 are on linear block codes, cyclic codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and BCH codes, respectively. The notes are self-contained and were written with the intent to derive the presented results with mathematical rigor. The notes contain in total 68 homework problems, of which 20% require computer programming.
