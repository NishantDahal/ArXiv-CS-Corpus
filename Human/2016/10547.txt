Training Skinny Deep Neural Networks with Iterative Hard Thresholding Methods

Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of practical problems. However, due to the inherent large parameter space, deep models are notoriously prone to overfitting and difficult to be deployed in portable devices with limited memory. In this paper, we propose an iterative hard thresholding (IHT) approach to train Skinny Deep Neural Networks (SDNNs). An SDNN has much fewer parameters yet can achieve competitive or even better performance than its full CNN counterpart. More concretely, the IHT approach trains an SDNN through following two alternative phases: (I) perform hard thresholding to drop connections with small activations and fine-tune the other significant filters; (II)~re-activate the frozen connections and train the entire network to improve its overall discriminative capability. We verify the superiority of SDNNs in terms of efficiency and classification performance on four benchmark object recognition datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST and ImageNet. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that IHT can be applied for training SDNN based on various CNN architectures such as NIN and AlexNet.
