Tweeting the Mind and Instagramming the Heart: Exploring Differentiated Content Sharing on Social Media

Understanding the usage of multiple OSNs (Online Social Networks) has been of significant research interest as it helps in identifying the unique and distinguishing trait in each social media platform that contributes to its continued existence. The comparison between the OSNs is insightful when it is done based on the representative majority of the users holding active accounts on all the platforms. In this research, we collected a set of user profiles holding accounts on both Twitter and Instagram, these platforms being of prominence among a majority of users. An extensive textual and visual analysis on the media content posted by these users revealed that both these platforms are indeed perceived differently at a fundamental level with Instagram engaging more of the users' heart and Twitter capturing more of their mind. These differences got reflected in almost every microscopic analysis done upon the linguistic, topical and visual aspects.
