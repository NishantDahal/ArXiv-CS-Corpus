Hierarchical Latent Word Clustering

This paper presents a new Bayesian non-parametric model by extending the usage of Hierarchical Dirichlet Allocation to extract tree structured word clusters from text data. The inference algorithm of the model collects words in a cluster if they share similar distribution over documents. In our experiments, we observed meaningful hierarchical structures on NIPS corpus and radiology reports collected from public repositories.
