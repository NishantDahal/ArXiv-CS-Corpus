A method for the segmentation of images based on thresholding and applied to vesicular textures

In image processing, a segmentation is a process of partitioning an image into multiple sets of pixels, that are defined as super-pixels. Each super-pixel is characterized by a label or parameter. Here, we are proposing a method for determining the super-pixels based on the thresholding of the image. This approach is quite useful for studying the images showing vesicular textures.
