M2M Massive Access in LTE: RACH Performance Evaluation in a Smart City Scenario

Several studies assert that the random access procedure of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular standard may not be effective whenever a massive number of simultaneous connection attempts are performed by terminals, as may happen in a typical Internet of Things or Smart City scenario. Nevertheless, simulation studies in real deployment scenarios are missing because many system-level simulators do not implement the LTE random access procedure in detail. In this paper, we propose a patch for the LTE module of ns-3, one of the most prominent open-source network simulators, to improve the accuracy of the routine that simulates the LTE Random Access Channel (RACH). The patched version of the random access procedure is compared with the default one and the issues arising from massive simultaneous access from mobile terminals in LTE are assessed via a simulation campaign.
