On the Capacity Advantage of a Single Bit

In this work we study the capacity advantage achieved by adding a single bit of communication -- not a link of capacity 1 but a single bit over all time -- to a memoryless network. Specifically, we present a memoryless network in which adding a single bit of communication strictly increases the capacity region.
