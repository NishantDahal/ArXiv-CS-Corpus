A Report on Shape Deformation with a Stretching and Bending Energy

In this report we describe a mesh editing system that we implemented that uses a natural stretching and bending energy defined over smooth surfaces. As such, this energy behaves uniformly under various mesh resolutions. All of the elements of our approach already exist in the literature. We hope that our discussions of these energies helps to shed light on the behaviors of these methods and provides a unified discussion of these methods.
