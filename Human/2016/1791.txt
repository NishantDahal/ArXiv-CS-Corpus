Distributed Strong Diameter Network Decomposition

For a pair of positive parameters $D,χ$, a partition ${\cal P}$ of the vertex set $V$ of an $n$-vertex graph $G = (V,E)$ into disjoint clusters of diameter at most $D$ each is called a $(D,χ)$ network decomposition, if the supergraph ${\cal G}({\cal P})$, obtained by contracting each of the clusters of ${\cal P}$, can be properly $χ$-colored. The decomposition ${\cal P}$ is said to be strong (resp., weak) if each of the clusters has strong (resp., weak) diameter at most $D$, i.e., if for every cluster $C \in {\cal P}$ and every two vertices $u,v \in C$, the distance between them in the induced graph $G(C)$ of $C$ (resp., in $G$) is at most $D$.
  Network decomposition is a powerful construct, very useful in distributed computing and beyond. It was shown by Awerbuch \etal \cite{AGLP89} and Panconesi and Srinivasan \cite{PS92}, that strong $(2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})},2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})})$ network decompositions can be computed in $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$ distributed time. Linial and Saks \cite{LS93} devised an ingenious randomized algorithm that constructs {\em weak} $(O(\log n),O(\log n))$ network decompositions in $O(\log^2 n)$ time. It was however open till now if {\em strong} network decompositions with both parameters $2^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$ can be constructed in distributed $2^{o(\sqrt{\log n})}$ time.
  In this paper we answer this long-standing open question in the affirmative, and show that strong $(O(\log n),O(\log n))$ network decompositions can be computed in $O(\log^2 n)$ time. We also present a tradeoff between parameters of our network decomposition. Our work is inspired by and relies on the "shifted shortest path approach", due to Blelloch \etal \cite{BGKMPT11}, and Miller \etal \cite{MPX13}. These authors developed this approach for PRAM algorithms for padded partitions. We adapt their approach to network decompositions in the distributed model of computation.
