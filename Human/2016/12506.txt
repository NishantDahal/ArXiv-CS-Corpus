On quasi-cyclic subspace codes

Construction of subspace codes with good parameters is one of the most important problems in random network coding. In this paper we present first a generalization of the concept of cyclic subspaces codes and further we show that the usual methods for constructing cyclic subspace codes over finite fields works for m-quasi cyclic codes, namely the subspaces polynomials and Frobenius mappings.
