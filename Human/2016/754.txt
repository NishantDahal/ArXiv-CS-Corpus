Dynamic Environments for Virtual Machine Placement considering Elasticity and Overbooking

Cloud computing datacenters provide millions of virtual machines in actual cloud markets. In this context, Virtual Machine Placement (VMP) is one of the most challenging problems in cloud infrastructure management, considering the large number of possible optimization criteria and different formulations that could be studied. Considering the on-demand model of cloud computing, the VMP problem should be solved dynamically to efficiently attend typical workload of modern applications. This work proposes a taxonomy in order to understand possible challenges for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) in dynamic environments, based on the most relevant dynamic parameters studied so far in the VMP literature. Based on the proposed taxonomy, several unexplored environments have been identified. To further study those research opportunities, sample workload traces for each particular environment are required; therefore, basic examples illustrate a preliminary work on dynamic workload trace generation.
