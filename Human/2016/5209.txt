Matrix-Product Complementary dual Codes

Linear complementary dual codes (LCD) are linear codes satisfying $C\cap C^{\perp}=\{0\}$. Under suitable conditions, matrix-product codes that are complementary dual codes are characterized. We construct LCD codes using quasi-orthogonal matrices. Some asymptotic results are derived.
