Today, in the digital age, the mobile devices are more and more used to aid people in the struggle to improve or maintain their health. In this paper, the mobile eHealth solution for remote patient monitoring during clinical trials is presented, together with the outcomes of quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation. The evaluation is a third step to improve the quality of the application after earlier Good Clinical Practice certification and validation with the participation of 10 patients and three general practitioners. This time, the focus was on the usability which was evaluated by the seventeen participants divided into three age groups (18-28, 29-50, and 50+). The results, from recorded sessions and the eye tracking, show that there is no difference in performance between the first group and the second group, while for the third group the performance was worse, however, it was still good enough to complete task within reasonable time.
