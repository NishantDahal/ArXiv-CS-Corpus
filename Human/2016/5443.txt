Ladder and Subdivision of Ladder Graphs with Pendant Edges are Odd Graceful

The ladder graph plays an important role in many applications as Electronics, Electrical and Wireless communication areas. The aim of this work is to present a new class of odd graceful labeling for the ladder graph. In particular, we show that the ladder graph Ln with m-pendant Ln + mk1 is odd graceful. We also show that the subdivision of ladder graph Ln with m-pendant S(Ln) + mk1 is odd graceful. Finally, we prove that all the subdivision of triangular snakes (delt-k snake) with pendant edges S(delt-k snake)+ mk are odd graceful.
