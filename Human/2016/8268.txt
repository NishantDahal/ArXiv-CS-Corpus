ISI-Aware Modeling and Achievable Rate Analysis of the Diffusion Channel

Analyzing the achievable rate of molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) inherits intricacies due to its nature: MCvD channel has memory, and the heavy tail of the signal causes inter symbol interference (ISI). Therefore, using Shannon's channel capacity formulation for memoryless channel is not appropriate for the MCvD channel. Instead, a more general achievable rate formulation and system model must be considered to make this analysis accurately. In this letter, we propose an effective ISI-aware MCvD modeling technique in 3-D medium and properly analyze the achievable rate.
