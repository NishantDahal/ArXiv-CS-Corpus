Downlink Transmit Power Setting in LTE HetNets with Carrier Aggregation

Carrier aggregation, which allows users to aggregate several component carriers to obtain up to 100 MHz of band- width, is one of the central features envisioned for next generation cellular networks. While this feature will enable support for higher data rates and improve quality of service, it may also be employed as an effective interference mitigation technique, especially in multi-tier heterogeneous networks. Having in mind that the aggregated component carriers may belong to different frequency bands and, hence, have varying propagation profiles, we argue that it is not necessary, indeed even harmful, to transmit at maximum power at all carriers, at all times. Rather, by using game theory, we design a distributed algorithm that lets eNodeBs and micro base stations dynamically adjust the downlink transmit power for the different component carriers. We compare our scheme to different power strategies combined with popular interference mitigation techniques, in a typical large-scale scenario, and show that our solution significantly outperforms the other strategies in terms of global network utility, power consumption and user throughput.
