Adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) for explosive hazard detection using wideband electromagnetic induction (WEMI)

The adaptive coherence estimator (ACE) estimates the squared cosine of the angle between a known target vector and a sample vector in a whitened coordinate space. The space is whitened according to an estimation of the background statistics, which directly effects the performance of the statistic as a target detector. In this paper, the ACE detection statistic is used to detect buried explosive hazards with data from a Wideband Electromagnetic Induction (WEMI) sensor. Target signatures are based on a dictionary defined using a Discrete Spectrum of Relaxation Frequencies (DSRF) model. Results are summarized as a receiver operator curve (ROC) and compared to other leading methods.
