Dense Urban Channel Measurements for Utility Pole Fixed Wireless Links

This radio channel measurement campaign characterizes the propagation conditions experienced in a dense urban environment over fixed backhaul links between wireless devices that are mounted on utility or traffic light poles. The measurements characterize the 2x1 multiple input single output channel in the 2.45 GHz band for both spatially separated omni antennas and cross polarized directional antennas. Results presented include both small and large scale channel statistics, antenna correlation coefficient values and the off-broadside rejection achieved with the directional antennas.
