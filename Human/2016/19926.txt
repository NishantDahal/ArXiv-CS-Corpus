Knowledge Space Framework: An API for representation, persistence and visualization of knowledge spaces

This paper will discuss the challenges in tooling around the management and utilization of knowledge space structures, via standardized APIs for external Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS) to consume. It then describes how these challenges are addressed in a graph based knowledge management framework application designed for external ALSs.
