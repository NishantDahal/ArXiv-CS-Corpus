Right whale recognition using convolutional neural networks

We studied the feasibility of recognizing individual right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) using convolutional neural networks. Prior studies have shown that CNNs can be used in wide range of classification and categorization tasks such as automated human face recognition. To test applicability of deep learning to whale recognition we have developed several models based on best practices from literature. Here, we describe the performance of the models. We conclude that machine recognition of whales is feasible and comment on the difficulty of the problem
