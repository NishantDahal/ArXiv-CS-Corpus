A Novel Design of Linear Phase Non-uniform Digital Filter Banks

In many applications such as wireless communications and subband adaptive filtering, we need to design non-uniform filter banks (NUFB), which may lead to better performances and reduced hardware complexity when compared to uniform filter bank. NUFB satisfying linear phase property for all the constituent filters, are desirable in applications such as speech and image processing and in communication. This paper proposes a novel design of non-uniform modified discrete fourier transform filter bank (MDFT FB). Here, each non-uniform channel is obtained by merging the nearby channels of a uniform MDFT FB. The reported works of non-uniform cosine modulated filter banks (CMFBs) do not satisfy linear phase property for all the constituent filters. In this work, we introduce the design of a non-uniform MDFT FB which satisfies linear phase property for all the constituent filters. The proposed design of the non-uniform MDFT FB is checked utilizing the alias cancellation among the channels, distortion and flatness condition of the channels. A condition is derived to find the channels when merged with adjacent channels, will cause aliasing in M channels. In the design and implementation of the proposed non-uniform MDFT FB, the structure of the uniform MDFT filter bank is preserved and hence all the advantages of MDFT FB over the DFT filter bank, are guaranteed. Hence without increasing the design complexity, the non-uniform MDFT FB is designed.
