It's just a matter of perspective(s): Crowd-Powered Consensus Organization of Corpora

We study the problem of organizing a collection of objects - images, videos - into clusters, using crowdsourcing. This problem is notoriously hard for computers to do automatically, and even with crowd workers, is challenging to orchestrate: (a) workers may cluster based on different latent hierarchies or perspectives; (b) workers may cluster at different granularities even when clustering using the same perspective; and (c) workers may only see a small portion of the objects when deciding how to cluster them (and therefore have limited understanding of the "big picture"). We develop cost-efficient, accurate algorithms for identifying the consensus organization (i.e., the organizing perspective most workers prefer to employ), and incorporate these algorithms into a cost-effective workflow for organizing a collection of objects, termed ORCHESTRA. We compare our algorithms with other algorithms for clustering, on a variety of real-world datasets, and demonstrate that ORCHESTRA organizes items better and at significantly lower costs.
