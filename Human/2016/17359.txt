On the Feasibility of Attribute-Based Encryption on Internet of Things Devices

Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) could be an effective cryptographic tool for the secure management of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, but its feasibility in the IoT has been under-investigated thus far. This article explores such feasibility for well-known IoT platforms, namely, Intel Galileo Gen 2, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, and Raspberry Pi Zero, and concludes that adopting ABE in the IoT is indeed feasible.
