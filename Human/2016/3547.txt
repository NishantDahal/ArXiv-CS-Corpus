Indoor 5G 3GPP-like Channel Models for Office and Shopping Mall Environments

Future mobile communications systems are likely to be very different to those of today with new service innovations driven by increasing data traffic demand, increasing processing power of smart devices and new innovative applications. To meet these service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as high as 10 Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency of less than 1 msec. To reach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in the range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth channels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100 GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not addressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz. This paper presents a preliminary overview of the 5G channel models for bands up to 100 GHz in indoor offices and shopping malls, derived from extensive measurements across a multitude of bands. These studies have found some extensibility of the existing 3GPP models to the higher frequency bands up to 100 GHz. The measurements indicate that the smaller wavelengths introduce an increased sensitivity of the propagation models to the scale of the environment and show some frequency dependence of the path loss as well as increased occurrence of blockage. Further, the penetration loss is highly dependent on the material and tends to increase with frequency. The small-scale characteristics of the channel such as delay spread and angular spread and the multipath richness is somewhat similar over the frequency range, which is encouraging for extending the existing 3GPP models to the wider frequency range. Further work will be carried out to complete these models, but this paper presents the first steps for an initial basis for the model development.
