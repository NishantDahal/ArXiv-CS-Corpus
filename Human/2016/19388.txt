Varieties of Metric and Quantitative Algebras

Metric algebras are metric variants of $Î£$-algebras. They are first introduced in the field of universal algebra to deal with algebras equipped with metric structures such as normed vector spaces. Recently a similar notion of quantitative algebra is used in computer science to formulate computational effects of probabilistic programs. In this paper we show that varieties of metric algebras (classes defined by a set of metric equations) are exactly classes closed under (metric versions of) subalgebras, products and quotients. This result implies the class of normed vector spaces cannot be defined by metric equations, differently from the classical case where the class of vector spaces is equational. This phenomenon suggests that metric equations are not a very natural class of formulas since they cannot express such a typical class of metric algebras. Therefore we need a broader class of formulas to acquire an appropriate metric counterpart of the classical variety theory.
