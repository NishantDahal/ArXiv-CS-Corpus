Detection of epileptic seizure in EEG signals using linear least squares preprocessing

An epileptic seizure is a transient event of abnormal excessive neuronal discharge in the brain. This unwanted event can be obstructed by detection of electrical changes in the brain that happen before the seizure takes place. The automatic detection of seizures is necessary since the visual screening of EEG recordings is a time consuming task and requires experts to improve the diagnosis. Four linear least squares-based preprocessing models are proposed to extract key features of an EEG signal in order to detect seizures. The first two models are newly developed. The original signal (EEG) is approximated by a sinusoidal curve. Its amplitude is formed by a polynomial function and compared with the pre developed spline function.Different statistical measures namely classification accuracy, true positive and negative rates, false positive and negative rates and precision are utilized to assess the performance of the proposed models. These metrics are derived from confusion matrices obtained from classifiers. Different classifiers are used over the original dataset and the set of extracted features. The proposed models significantly reduce the dimension of the classification problem and the computational time while the classification accuracy is improved in most cases. The first and third models are promising feature extraction methods. Logistic, LazyIB1, LazyIB5 and J48 are the best classifiers. Their true positive and negative rates are $1$ while false positive and negative rates are zero and the corresponding precision values are $1$. Numerical results suggest that these models are robust and efficient for detecting epileptic seizure.
