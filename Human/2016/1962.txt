On Scaling Rules for Energy of VLSI Polar Encoders and Decoders

It is shown that all polar encoding schemes of rate $R>\frac{1}{2}$ of block length $N$ implemented according to the Thompson VLSI model must take energy $E\geΩ\left(N^{3/2}\right)$. This lower bound is achievable up to polylogarithmic factors using a mesh network topology defined by Thompson and the encoding algorithm defined by Arikan. A general class of circuits that compute successive cancellation decoding adapted from Arikan's butterfly network algorithm is defined. It is shown that such decoders implemented on a rectangle grid for codes of rate $R>2/3$ must take energy $E\geΩ(N^{3/2})$, and this can also be reached up to polylogarithmic factors using a mesh network. Capacity approaching sequences of energy optimal polar encoders and decoders, as a function of reciprocal gap to capacity $χ= (1-R/C)^{-1}$, have energy that scales as $Ω\left(χ^{5.325}\right)\le E \le O\left(χ^{7.05}\log^{4}\left(χ\right)\right)$.
