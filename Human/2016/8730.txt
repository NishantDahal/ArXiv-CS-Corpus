Technique Report: Scheduling Flows with Multiple Service Frequency Constraints

With the fast development of wireless technologies, wireless applications have invaded various areas in people's lives with a wide range of capabilities. Guaranteeing Quality-of-Service (QoS) is the key to the success of those applications. One of the QoS requirements, service frequency, is very important for tasks including multimedia transmission in the Internet of Things. A service frequency constraint denotes the length of time period during which a link can transmit at least once. Unfortunately, it has not been well addressed yet. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework to schedule multi transmitting flows in wireless networks considering service frequency constraint for each link. In our model, the constraints for flows are heterogeneous due to the diversity of users' behaviors. We first introduce a new definition for network stability with service frequency constraints and demonstrate that the novel scheduling policy is throughput-optimal in one fundamental category of network models. After that, we discuss the performance of a wireless network with service frequency constraints from the views of capacity region and total queue length. Finally, a series of evaluations indicate the proposed scheduling policy can guarantee service frequency and achieve a good performance on the aspect of queue length of each flow.
