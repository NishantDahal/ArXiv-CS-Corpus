Nonlinear FM Waveform Design to Reduction of sidelobe level in Autocorrelation Function

This paper will design non-linear frequency modulation (NLFM) signal for Chebyshev, Kaiser, Taylor, and raised-cosine power spectral densities (PSDs). Then, the variation of peak sidelobe level with regard to mainlobe width for these four different window functions are analyzed. It has been demonstrated that reduction of sidelobe level in NLFM signal can lead to increase in mainlobe width of autocorrelation function. Furthermore, the results of power spectral density obtained from the simulation and the desired PSD are compared. Finally, error percentage between simulated PSD and desired PSD for different peak sidelobe level are illustrated. The stationary phase concept is the possible source for this error.
