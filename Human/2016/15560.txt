Automatic and Manual Segmentation of Hippocampus in Epileptic Patients MRI

The hippocampus is a seminal structure in the most common surgically-treated form of epilepsy. Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus aids in establishing asymmetry regarding size and signal characteristics in order to disclose the likely site of epileptogenicity. With sufficient refinement, it may ultimately aid in the avoidance of invasive monitoring with its expense and risk for the patient. To this end, a reliable and consistent method for segmentation of the hippocampus from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed. In this work, we present a systematic and statistical analysis approach for evaluation of automated segmentation methods in order to establish one that reliably approximates the results achieved by manual tracing of the hippocampus.
