Lossless Intra Coding in HEVC with Adaptive 3-tap Filters

In pixel-by-pixel spatial prediction methods for lossless intra coding, the prediction is obtained by a weighted sum of neighbouring pixels. The proposed prediction approach in this paper uses a weighted sum of three neighbor pixels according to a two-dimensional correlation model. The weights are obtained after a three step optimization procedure. The first two stages are offline procedures where the computed prediction weights are obtained offline from training sequences. The third stage is an online optimization procedure where the offline obtained prediction weights are further fine-tuned and adapted to each encoded block during encoding using a rate-distortion optimized method and the modification in this third stage is transmitted to the decoder as side information. The results of the simulations show average bit rate reductions of 12.02% and 3.28% over the default lossless intra coding in HEVC and the well-known Sample-based Angular Prediction (SAP) method, respectively.
