Characterizing Solution Concepts in Terms of Common Knowledge of Rationality

Characterizations of Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium, and rationalizability in terms of common knowledge of rationality are well known. Analogous characterizations of sequential equilibrium, (trembling hand) perfect equilibrium, and quasi-perfect equilibrium using results of Halpern [2009].
