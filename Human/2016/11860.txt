Learning-Based Resource Allocation Scheme for TDD-Based CRAN System

Explosive growth in the use of smart wireless devices has necessitated the provision of higher data rates and always-on connectivity, which are the main motivators for designing the fifth generation (5G) systems. To achieve higher system efficiency, massive antenna deployment with tight coordination is one potential strategy for designing 5G systems, but has two types of associated system overhead. First is the synchronization overhead, which can be reduced by implementing a cloud radio access network (CRAN)-based architecture design, that separates the baseband processing and radio access functionality to achieve better system synchronization. Second is the overhead for acquiring channel state information (CSI) of the users present in the system, which, however, increases tremendously when instantaneous CSI is used to serve high-mobility users. To serve a large number of users, a CRAN system with a dense deployment of remote radio heads (RRHs) is considered, such that each user has a line-of-sight (LOS) link with the corresponding RRH. Since, the trajectory of movement for high-mobility users is predictable; therefore, fairly accurate position estimates for those users can be obtained, and can be used for resource allocation to serve the considered users. The resource allocation is dependent upon various correlated system parameters, and these correlations can be learned using well-known \emph{machine learning} algorithms. This paper proposes a novel \emph{learning-based resource allocation scheme} for time division duplex (TDD) based 5G CRAN systems with dense RRH deployment, by using only the users' position estimates for resource allocation, thus avoiding the need for CSI acquisition. This reduces the overall system overhead significantly, while still achieving near-optimal system performance; thus, better (effective) system efficiency is achieved.
