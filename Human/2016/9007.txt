Firm Growth and Innovation in the ERP Industry: A Systems Thinking Approach

Achievement and sustenance of growth are essential themes in organizational literature. In our paper, we develop models using systems thinking approach to understand how firms achieve and sustain growth in a technology-intensive product domain. We augment these to explain the possible impact of a disruptive technological innovation. We use enterprise software industry as the context where SAP has been acknowledged as the market leader. We find that product differentiation and learning effects helped SAP establish itself, and this growth was further sustained through networks and complementors. Introducing cloud computing as the disruptive innovation, we explain its impact on a firm. Analysis reveals that for the next wave of growth to occur, and to tap into newer markets, it would be imperative for SAP to create attractive cloud based offerings. We also discuss how the model can be enhanced by considering competitor dynamics.
