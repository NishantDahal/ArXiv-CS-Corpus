Robust benchmarking in noisy environments

We propose a benchmarking strategy that is robust in the presence of timer error, OS jitter and other environmental fluctuations, and is insensitive to the highly nonideal statistics produced by timing measurements. We construct a model that explains how these strongly nonideal statistics can arise from environmental fluctuations, and also justifies our proposed strategy. We implement this strategy in the BenchmarkTools Julia package, where it is used in production continuous integration (CI) pipelines for developing the Julia language and its ecosystem.
