Systematic Mapping Protocol: Have Systematic Reuse Benefits Been Transferred to Real-world Settings?

This document details the planning phase of a Systematic Mapping Study. Our goal is to identify and to understand the benefits that the software engineering community has reported on the application of the different reuse strategies in industrial context, by building a general picture (map) containing: the claimed benefits, the data supporting those claims, the industry's domains and the reuse strategy employed.
