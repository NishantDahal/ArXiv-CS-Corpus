Forward and Reverse Entropy Power Inequalities in Convex Geometry

The entropy power inequality, which plays a fundamental role in information theory and probability, may be seen as an analogue of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. Motivated by this connection to Convex Geometry, we survey various recent developments on forward and reverse entropy power inequalities not just for the Shannon-Boltzmann entropy but also more generally for RÃ©nyi entropy. In the process, we discuss connections between the so-called functional (or integral) and probabilistic (or entropic) analogues of some classical inequalities in geometric functional analysis
