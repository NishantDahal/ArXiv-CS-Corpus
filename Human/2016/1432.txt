Filtering Video Noise as Audio with Motion Detection to Form a Musical Instrument

Even though they differ in the physical domain, digital video and audio share many characteristics. Both are temporal data streams often stored in buffers with 8-bit values. This paper investigates a method for creating harmonic sounds with a video signal as input. A musical instrument is proposed, that utilizes video in both a sound synthesis method, and in a controller interface for selecting musical notes at specific velocities. The resulting instrument was informally determined by the author to sound both pleasant and interesting, but hard to control, and therefore suited for synth pad sounds.
