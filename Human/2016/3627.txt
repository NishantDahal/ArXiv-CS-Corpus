Generalizing The Morley Trisector and Various Theorems with Realizability Computations

An approach is shown that proves various theorems of plane geometry in an algorithmic manner. The approach affords transparent proofs of a generalization of the Theorem of Morley and other well known results by casting them in terms of constraint satisfaction.
