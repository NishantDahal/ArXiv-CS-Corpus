Software for enumerative and analytic combinatorics

We survey some general-purpose symbolic software packages that implement algorithms from enumerative and analytic combinatorics. Software for the following areas is covered: basic combinatorial objects, symbolic combinatorics, PÃ³lya theory, combinatorial species, and asymptotics. We describe the capabilities that the packages offer as well as some of the algorithms used, and provide links to original documentation. Most of the packages are freely downloadable from the web.
