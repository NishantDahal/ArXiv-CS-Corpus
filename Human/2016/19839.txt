Fast Fourier single-pixel imaging using binary illumination

Fourier single-pixel imaging (FSI) has proven capable of reconstructing high-quality two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. The utilization of the sparsity of natural images in Fourier domain allows high-resolution images to be reconstructed from far fewer measurements than effective image pixels. However, applying original FSI in digital micro-mirror device (DMD) based high-speed imaging system turns out to be challenging, because the original FSI uses grayscale Fourier basis patterns for illumination while DMDs generate grayscale patterns at a relatively low rate. DMDs are a binary device which can only generate a black-and-white pattern at each instance. In this paper, we adopt binary Fourier patterns for illumination to achieve DMD-based high-speed single-pixel imaging. Binary Fourier patterns are generated by upsampling and then applying error diffusion based dithering to the grayscale patterns. Experiments demonstrate the proposed technique able to achieve static imaging with high quality and dynamic imaging in real time. The proposed technique potentially allows high-quality and high-speed imaging over broad wavebands.
