On Quantum Codes Obtained From Cyclic Codes Over $\mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2+u^2\mathbb{F}_2$

Let $R=\mathbb{F}_2+u\mathbb{F}_2+u^2\mathbb{F}_2$ be a non-chain finite commutative ring, where $u^3=u$. In this paper, we mainly study the construction of quantum codes from cyclic codes over $R$. We obtained self-orthogonal codes over $\mathbb{F}_2$ as gray images of linear and cyclic codes over $R$. The parameters of quantum codes which are obtained from cyclic code over $R$ are discussed.
