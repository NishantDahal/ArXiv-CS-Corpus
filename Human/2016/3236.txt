Degrees of Freedom of the Two-User MIMO Broadcast Channel with Private and Common Messages Under Hybrid CSIT Models

We study the degrees of freedom (DoF) regions of the two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel with a general message set (BC-CM) - that includes private and common messages - under fast fading. Nine different channel state knowledge assumptions -collectively known as hybrid CSIT models - are considered wherein the transmitter has either perfect/instantaneous (P), delayed (D) or no (N) channel state information (CSI) from each of the two receivers. General antenna configurations are addressed wherein the three terminals have arbitrary numbers of antennas. The DoF regions are established for the five hybrid CSIT models in which either both channels are unknown at the transmitter or each of the two channels is known perfectly or with delay. In the four remaining cases in which exactly one of the two channels is unknown at the transmitter, the DoF regions under the restriction of linear encoding strategies - also known as the linear DoF (LDoF) regions- are established. As the key to the converse proofs of the LDoF region of the MIMO BC-CM under such hybrid CSIT assumptions, we show that, when only considering linear encoding strategies, the channel state information from the receiver with more antennas does not help if there is no channel state information available from the receiver with fewer antennas. This result is conjectured to be true even without the restriction on the encoding strategies to be linear. If true, the LDoF regions obtained for the four hybrid CSIT cases herein will also be the DoF regions for those cases.
