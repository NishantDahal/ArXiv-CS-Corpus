Private reputation retrieval in public - a privacy-aware announcement scheme for VANETs

An announcement scheme is a system that facilitates vehicles to broadcast road-related information in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) in order to improve road safety and efficiency. Here we propose a new cryptographic primitive for public updating of reputation score based on the Boneh-Boyen-Shacham short group signature scheme. This allows private reputation score retrieval without a secure channel. Using this we devise a privacy-aware announcement scheme using reputation systems which is reliable, auditable and robust.
