Multipair Massive MIMO Relaying with Pilot-Data Transmission Overlay

We propose a pilot-data transmission overlay scheme for multipair massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying systems employing either half- or full-duplex (HD or FD) communications at the relay station (RS). In the proposed scheme, pilots are transmitted in partial overlap with data to decrease the channel estimation overhead. The RS can detect the source data with minimal destination pilot interference by exploiting the asymptotic orthogonality of massive MIMO channels. Then pilot-data interference can be effectively suppressed with assistance of the detected source data in the destination channel estimation. Due to the transmission overlay, the effective data period is extended, hence improving system throughput. Both theoretical and simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot-data overlay scheme outperforms the conventional separate pilot-data design in the limited coherence time interval scenario. Moreover, asymptotic analyses at high and low SNR regions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme regardless of the coherence interval length. Because of simultaneous transmission, the proper allocation of source data transmission and relay data forwarding power can further improve the system performance. Hence a power allocation problem is formulated and a successive convex approximation approach is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem with the FD pilot-data transmission overlay.
