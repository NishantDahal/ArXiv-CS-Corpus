Quantum Information Approach to Dynamical Diffraction Theory

We present a simplified model for dynamical diffraction of particles through a periodic thick perfect crystal based on repeated application of a coherent beam splitting unitary at coarse-grained lattice sites. By demanding translational invariance and a computationally tractable number of sites in the coarse-graining we show how this approach reproduces many results typical of dynamical diffraction theory and experiments. This approach has the benefit of being applicable in the thick, thin, and intermediate crystal regimes. The method is applied to a three-blade neutron interferometer to predict the output beam profiles, interference patterns, and contrast variation.
