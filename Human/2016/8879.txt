Fundamentals of Modeling Finite Wireless Networks using Binomial Point Process

Modeling the locations of nodes as a uniform binomial point process (BPP), we present a generic mathematical framework to characterize the performance of an arbitrarily-located reference receiver in a finite wireless network. Different from most of the prior works where the serving transmitter (TX) node is located at the fixed distance from the reference receiver, we consider two general TX-selection policies: i) uniform TX-selection: the serving node is chosen uniformly at random amongst transmitting nodes, and ii) k-closest TX-selection: the serving node is the k-th closest node out of transmitting nodes to the reference receiver. The key intermediate step in our analysis is the derivation of a new set of distance distributions that lead not only to the tractable analysis of coverage probability but also enable the analyses of wide range of classical and currently trending problems in wireless networks. Using this new set of distance distributions, we first investigate the diversity loss due to SIR correlation in a finite network. We then obtain the optimal number of links that can be simultaneously activated to maximize network spectral efficiency. Finally, we evaluate optimal caching probability to maximize the total hit probability in cache-enabled finite networks.
