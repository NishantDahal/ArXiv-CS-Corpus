Degrees of Freedom of Spatial Self-Interference Suppression for In-Band Full-Duplex with Inter-node Interference

We study a three-node network with a full-duplex base-station communicating with one uplink and one downlink half-duplex node. In this network, both self-interference and inter-node interference are present. We use an antenna-theory-based channel model to study the spatial degrees of freedom of such network, and study if and how much does spatial isolation outperforms time-division (i.e. half-duplex) counterpart. Using degrees of freedom analysis, we show that spatial isolation outperforms time division, unless the angular spread of the objects that scatters to the intended users is overlapped by the spread of objects that back scatters to the receivers.
