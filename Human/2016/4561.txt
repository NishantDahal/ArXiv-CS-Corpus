A Fast Sampling Method of Exploring Graphlet Degrees of Large Directed and Undirected Graphs

Exploring small connected and induced subgraph patterns (CIS patterns, or graphlets) has recently attracted considerable attention. Despite recent efforts on computing the number of instances a specific graphlet appears in a large graph (i.e., the total number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet), little attention has been paid to characterizing a node's graphlet degree, i.e., the number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet that include the node, which is an important metric for analyzing complex networks such as social and biological networks. Similar to global graphlet counting, it is challenging to compute node graphlet degrees for a large graph due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. Unfortunately, previous methods of computing global graphlet counts are not suited to solve this problem. In this paper we propose sampling methods to estimate node graphlet degrees for undirected and directed graphs, and analyze the error of our estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem and give a fast scalable solution. We conduct experiments on a variety of real-word datasets that demonstrate that our methods accurately and efficiently estimate node graphlet degrees for graphs with millions of edges.
