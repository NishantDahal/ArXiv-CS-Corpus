Self-service Ad-hoc Querying Using Controlled Natural Language

The ad-hoc querying process is slow and error prone due to inability of business experts of accessing data directly without involving IT experts. The problem lies in complexity of means used to query data. We propose a new natural language- and semistar ontology-based ad-hoc querying approach which lowers the steep learning curve required to be able to query data. The proposed approach would significantly shorten the time needed to master the ad-hoc querying and to gain the direct access to data by business experts, thus facilitating the decision making process in enterprises, government institutions and other organizations.
