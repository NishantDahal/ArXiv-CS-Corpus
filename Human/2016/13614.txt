Matched filter detection with dynamic threshold for cognitive radio networks

-In cognitive radio networks, spectrum sensing aims to detect the unused spectrum channels in order to use the radio spectrum more efficiently. Various methods have been proposed in the past, such as energy, feature detection, and matched filter. These methods are characterized by a sensing threshold, which plays an important role in the sensing performance. Most of the existing techniques used a static threshold. However, the noise is random, and, thus the threshold should be dynamic. In this paper, we suggest an approach with an estimated and dynamic sensing threshold to increase the efficiency of the sensing detection. The matched filter method with dynamic threshold is simulated and its results are compared to those of other existing techniques.
