Similarity in Observable Behaviors: A Synthesis of Studies with Implications for Socially-Aware Educational Technology Design

Conversation is like an intricate partner dance and behavioral convergence, or the similarity in observable behaviors of partners over time, can lead to shared understanding, changed beliefs and increased rapport. This article describes a synthesis of three strands of our work on fine-grained analysis of conversational interaction in peer tutoring at the paralinguistic and verbal levels, in an attempt to better understand the phenomenon of behavioral convergence and its relationship to social and cognitive constructs. Implications for development of socially-aware agents that can improve task performance through convergence to and from the human learner's behavior are discussed.
