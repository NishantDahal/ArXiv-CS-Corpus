Conditions that the quotient of $L$-fuzzy up-sets forms a complete lattice

This paper deals with conditions under which the quotient of $L$-fuzzy up-sets forms a complete lattice by using terminologies of closure operators. It first gives a condition that a family of some subsets of a nonempty set can be represented by $L$-fuzzy up-sets, which is then used to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition under which the quotient of $L$-fuzzy up-sets forms a complete lattice. This paper finally shows that the quotient of a kind of $L$-fuzzy up-sets is isomorphic to an interval generated by an $L$-fuzzy up-set.
