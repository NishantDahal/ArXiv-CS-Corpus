2.4GHZ Class AB power Amplifier For Healthcare Application

The objective of this research was to design a 2.4 GHz class AB Power Amplifier, with 0.18 um SMIC CMOS technology by using Cadence software, for health care applications. The ultimate goal for such application is to minimize the trade-offs between performance and cost, and between performance and low power consumption design. The performance of the power amplifier meets the specification requirements of the desired.
