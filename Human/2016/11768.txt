(Lack Of) Representation of Non Western World in process of creation of Web standards

World Wide Consortium (W3C) as an standard setting organization for the world wide web plays a very important role in shaping the web. We focus on the ongoing controversy related to Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) and found that there was a serious lack of participation from people from non western countries. We also found serious lack of gender diversity in the EME debate.
