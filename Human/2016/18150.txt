Automated Application Offloading through Ant-inspired Decision-Making

-The explosive trend of smartphone usage as the most effective and convenient communication tools of human life in recent years make developers build ever more complex smartphone applications. Gaming, navigation, video editing, augmented reality, and speech recognition applications require considerable computational power and energy. Although smart- phones have a wide range of capabilities - GPS, WiFi, cameras - their inherent limitations - frequent disconnections, mobility - and significant constraints - size, lower weights, longer battery life - make difficult to exploiting their full potential to run complex applications. Several research works have proposed solutions in application offloading domain, but few ones concerning the highly changing properties of the environment. To address these issues, we realize an automated application offloading middleware, ACOMMA, with dynamic and re-adaptable decision-making engine. The decision engine of ACOMMA is based on an ant- inspired algorithm.
