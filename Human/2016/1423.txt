MUIT: A Middleware for Adaptive Mobile Web-based User Interfaces in WS-BPEL

In enterprise organizations, the Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) requirement has become prevalent as employees use their own mobile devices to process the workflow-oriented tasks. Consequently, it calls for approaches that can quickly develop and integrate mobile user interactions into existing business processes, and adapt to various contexts. However, designing, developing and deploying adaptive and mobile-oriented user interfaces for existing process engines are non-trivial, and require significant systematic efforts. To address this issue, we present a novel middleware-based approach, called MUIT, to developing and deploying the Mobility, User Interactions and Tasks into WS-BPEL engines. MUIT can be seamlessly into WS-BPEL without intrusions of existing process instances. MUIT provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that provides some intuitive APIs to support the declarative development of adaptive, mobile-oriented, and Web-based user interfaces in WS-BPEL. The DSL can significantly improve the development of user interactions by preventing arbitrarily mixed codes, and its runtime supports satisfactory user experiences. We implement a proof- of-concept prototype by integrating MUIT into the commodity WS-BPEL-based Apusic Platform, and evaluate the performance and usability of MUIT platform.
