Remarks to the paper "Control system for reducing energy consumption in backbone computer network" from "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience" journal

This paper indicates two errors in the formulation of the main optimization model in the article "Control system for reducing energy consumption in backbone computer network" by Niewiadomska-Szynkiewicz et al. and shows how to fix them.
