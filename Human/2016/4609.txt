Cloudrone: Micro Clouds in the Sky

Recent years have witnessed several initiatives on enabling Internet access to the next three billion people. Access to the Internet necessarily translates to access to its services. This means that the goal of providing Internet access requires ac- cess to its critical service infrastructure, which are currently hosted in the cloud. However, recent works have pointed out that the current cloud centric nature of the Internet is a fundamental barrier for Internet access in rural/remote areas as well as in developing regions. It is important to explore (low cost) solutions such as micro cloud infrastructures that can provide services at the edge of the network (potentially on demand), right near the users. In this paper, we present Cloudrone- a preliminary idea of deploying a lightweight micro cloud infrastructure in the sky using indigenously built low cost drones, single board computers and lightweight Operating System virtualization technologies. Our paper lays out the preliminary ideas on such a system that can be instantaneously deployed on demand. We describe an initial design of the Cloudrone and provide a preliminary evaluation of the proposed system mainly focussed on the scalability issues of supporting multiple services and users.
