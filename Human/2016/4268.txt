Human Gender Classification: A Review

Gender contains a wide range of information regarding to the characteristics difference between male and female. Successful gender recognition is essential and critical for many applications in the commercial domains such as applications of human-computer interaction and computer-aided physiological or psychological analysis. Some have proposed various approaches for automatic gender classification using the features derived from human bodies and/or behaviors. First, this paper introduces the challenge and application for gender classification research. Then, the development and framework of gender classification are described. Besides, we compare these state-of-the-art approaches, including vision-based methods, biological information-based method, and social network information-based method, to provide a comprehensive review in the area of gender classification. In mean time, we highlight the strength and discuss the limitation of each method. Finally, this review also discusses several promising applications for the future work.
