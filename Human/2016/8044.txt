The relational model is injective for Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic

We prove a completeness result for Multiplicative Exponential Linear Logic (MELL): we show that the relational model is injective for MELL proof-nets, i.e. the equality between MELL proof-nets in the relational model is exactly axiomatized by cut-elimination.
