Iterative Secret Key Rate Adapting with Error Minimization for Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution

We define an iterative error-minimizing secret key adapting method for multicarrier CVQKD. A multicarrier CVQKD protocol uses Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CVs) for the transmission. The proposed method allows for the parties to reach a given target secret key rate with minimized error rate through the Gaussian sub-channels by a sub-channel adaption procedure. The adaption algorithm iteratively determines the optimal transmit conditions to achieve the target secret key rate and the minimal error rate over the sub-channels. The solution requires no complex calculations or computational tools, allowing for easy implementation for experimental CVQKD scenarios.
