Robust Beamforming in Cache-Enabled Cloud Radio Access Networks

Popular content caching is expected to play a major role in efficiently reducing backhaul congestion and achieving user satisfaction in next generation mobile radio systems. Consider the downlink of a cache-enabled cloud radio access network (CRAN), where each cache-enabled base station (BS) is equipped with limited-size local cache storage. The central computing unit (cloud) is connected to the BSs via a limited capacity backhaul link and serves a set of single-antenna mobile users (MUs). This paper assumes that only imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the cloud. It focuses on the problem of minimizing the total network power and backhaul cost so as to determine the beamforming vector of each user across the network, the quantization noise covariance matrix, and the BS clustering subject to imperfect channel state information and fixed cache placement assumptions. The paper suggests solving such a difficult, non-convex optimization problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The paper then uses the $\ell_0$-norm approximation to provide a feasible, sub-optimal solution using the majorization-minimization (MM) approach. Simulation results particularly show how the cache-enabled network significantly improves the backhaul cost especially at high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) values as compared to conventional cache-less CRANs.
