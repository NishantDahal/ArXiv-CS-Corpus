Demand-Flow of Agents with Gross-Substitute Valuations

We consider the class of valuations on indivisible items called gross-substitute (GS). This class was introduced by Kelso and Crawford (1982) and is widely used in studies of markets with indivisibilities. GS is a condition on the demand-flow in a specific scenario: some items become more expensive while other items retain their price. We prove that GS implies a much stronger condition, describing the demand-flow in the general scenario in which all prices may change. We prove that the demand of GS agents always flows (weakly) downwards, i.e, from items with higher price-increase to items with lower price-increase. We show that this property is equivalent to GS and is not true when there are complementarities.
