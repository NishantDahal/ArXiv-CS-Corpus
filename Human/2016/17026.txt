Cryptanalyzing image encryption using chaotic logistic map

Chaotic behavior arises from very simple non-linear dynamical equation of logistic map which makes it was used often in designing chaotic image encryption schemes. However, some properties of chaotic maps can also facilitate cryptanalysis especially when they are implemented in digital domain. Utilizing stable distribution of the chaotic states generated by iterating the logistic map, this paper presents a typical example to show insecurity of an image encryption scheme using chaotic logistic map. This work will push encryption and chaos be combined in a more effective way.
