2D SEM images turn into 3D object models

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is probably one the most fascinating examination approach that has been used since more than two decades to detailed inspection of micro scale objects. Most of the scanning electron microscopes could only produce 2D images that could not assist operational analysis of microscopic surface properties. Computer vision algorithms combined with very advanced geometry and mathematical approaches turn any SEM into a full 3D measurement device. This work focuses on a methodical literature review for automatic 3D surface reconstruction of scanning electron microscope images.
