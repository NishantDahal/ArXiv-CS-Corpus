Enerji İzleme Yazılımları için Merkezi ve Genel bir Mimari (A Centralized and Generic Architecture for Energy Monitoring Software)

There is need for several software systems within the energy domain and corresponding systems are being developed to satisfy these needs. These systems include energy monitoring, information, wide area monitoring and control systems, and SCADA systems. Energy monitoring systems are one of the most important and common systems among them. In this study, after briefly reviewing several of the software systems within the energy domain, a centralized and generic software architecture for energy monitoring systems is presented. Next, sample projects are described in which energy monitoring systems based on this architecture have been implemented. We envisage that this study will be an important resource for software projects in the energy domain.
