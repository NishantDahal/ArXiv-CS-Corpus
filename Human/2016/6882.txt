Two Roads Diverged: A Semantic Network Analysis of Guanxi on Twitter

Guanxi, roughly translated as "social connection", is a term commonly used in the Chinese language. In this research, we employed a linguistic approach to explore popular discourses on Guanxi. Although sharing the same Confucian roots, Chinese communities inside and outside Mainland China have undergone different historical trajectories. Hence, we took a comparative approach to examine guanxi in Mainland China and in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (TW-HK-M). Comparing guanxi discourses in two Chinese societies aims at revealing the divergence of guanxi culture. The data for this research were collected on Twitter over a three-week period by searching tweets containing guanxi written in Simplified Chinese characters and in Traditional Chinese characters. After building, visualising, and conducting community detection on both semantic networks, two guanxi discourses were then compared in terms of their major concept sub-communities. This research aims at addressing two questions: Has the meaning of guanxi transformed in contemporary Chinese societies? And how do different socio-economic configurations affect the practice of guanxi? Results suggest that guanxi in interpersonal relationships has adapted to a new family structure in both Chinese societies. In addition, the practice of guanxi in business varies in Mainland China and in TW-HK-M. Furthermore, an extended domain was identified where guanxi is used in a macro-level discussion of state relations. Network representations of the guanxi discourses enabled reification of the concept and shed lights on the understanding of social connections and social orders in contemporary China.
