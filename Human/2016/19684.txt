Proceedings of the The First Workshop on Verification and Validation of Cyber-Physical Systems

The first International Workshop on Verification and Validation of Cyber-Physical Systems (V2CPS-16) was held in conjunction with the 12th International Conference on integration of Formal Methods (iFM 2016) in Reykjavik, Iceland. The purpose of V2CPS-16 was to bring together researchers and experts of the fields of formal verification and cyber-physical systems (CPS) to cover the theme of this workshop, namely a wide spectrum of verification and validation methods including (but not limited to) control, simulation, formal methods, etc.
  A CPS is an integration of networked computational and physical processes with meaningful inter-effects; the former monitors, controls, and affects the latter, while the latter also impacts the former. CPSs have applications in a wide-range of systems spanning robotics, transportation, communication, infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. Many safety-critical systems such as chemical processes, medical devices, aircraft flight control, and automotive systems, are indeed CPS. The advanced capabilities of CPS require complex software and synthesis algorithms, which are hard to verify. In fact, many problems in this area are undecidable. Thus, a major step is to find particular abstractions of such systems which might be algorithmically verifiable regarding specific properties of such systems, describing the partial/overall behaviors of CPSs.
