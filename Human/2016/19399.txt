D-LITe: Building Internet of Things Choreographies

In this work, we present a complete architecture for designing Internet of Things applications. While a main issue in this domain is the heterogeneity of Objects hardware, networks and protocols, we propose D-LITe, a solution to hide this wide range of low layer technologies. By abstracting the hardware, we focus on object's features and not on its real characteristics. D-LITe aims to give a universal access to object's internal processing and computational power. A small virtual machine embedded in each object gives a universal view of its functionalities. Each object's features are discovered and programmed through the network, without any physical access. D-LITe comes with the SALT language that describes the logical behaviour needed to include user's Objects into an IoT application. This communication is based on REST architecture. Gathering all these logical units into a global composition is our way to build a services Choreography, in which each Object has its own task to achieve. This paper presents also an analysis of the gain obtained when a Choreography is used instead of the most common services.
