Non-Linear Programming: Maximize SNR for Designing Spreading Sequence - Part II: Conditions for Optimal Spreading Sequences

Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is an important index for wireless communications. In CDMA systems, spreading sequences are utilized. This series of papers show the method to derive spreading sequences as the solutions of non-linear programming: maximize SNR. In this paper, we derive the optimization problems with the expression SNR derived in Part I and the necessary conditions for the global solutions. We numerically solve the problems and evaluate the solutions with two factors, mean-square correlations and maximum mean-square correlations.
