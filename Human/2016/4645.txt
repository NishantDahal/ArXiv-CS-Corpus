Procedural Generation of Angry Birds Levels using Building Constructive Grammar with Chinese-Style and/or Japanese-Style Models

This paper presents a procedural generation method that creates visually attractive levels for the Angry Birds game. Besides being an immensely popular mobile game, Angry Birds has recently become a test bed for various artificial intelligence technologies. We propose a new approach for procedurally generating Angry Birds levels using Chinese style and Japanese style building structures. A conducted experiment confirms the effectiveness of our approach with statistical significance.
