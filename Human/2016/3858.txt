Proportional Fair Rate Allocation for Private Shared Networks

In this paper, we consider fair privacy in a shared network subject to traffic analysis attacks by an eavesdropper. We initiate the study of the joint trade-off between privacy, throughput and delay in such a shared network as a utility fairness problem and derive the proportional fair rate allocation for networks of flows subject to privacy constraints and delay deadlines.
