Weakly Supervised Object Localization Using Size Estimates

We present a technique for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL), building on the observation that WSOL algorithms usually work better on images with bigger objects. Instead of training the object detector on the entire training set at the same time, we propose a curriculum learning strategy to feed training images into the WSOL learning loop in an order from images containing bigger objects down to smaller ones. To automatically determine the order, we train a regressor to estimate the size of the object given the whole image as input. Furthermore, we use these size estimates to further improve the re-localization step of WSOL by assigning weights to object proposals according to how close their size matches the estimated object size. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using size order and size weighting on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, where we achieve a significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art WSOL techniques.
