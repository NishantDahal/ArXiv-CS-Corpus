Distributed area coverage control with imprecise robot localization: Simulation and experimental studies

This article examines the area coverage problem for a network of mobile robots with imprecise agents' localization. Each robot has uniform radial sensing ability, governed by first order kinodynamics. The convex-space is partitioned based on the Guaranteed Voronoi (GV) principle and each robot's area of responsibility corresponds to its GV-cell, bounded by hyperbolic arcs. The proposed control law is distributed, demanding the positioning information about its GV-Delaunay neighbors. Simulation and experimental studies are offered to highlight the efficiency of the proposed control law.
