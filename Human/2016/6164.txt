Online Social Network Analysis: A Survey of Research Applications in Computer Science

The emergence and popularization of online social networks suddenly made available a large amount of data from social organization, interaction and human behavior. All this information opens new perspectives and challenges to the study of social systems, being of interest to many fields. Although most online social networks are recent (less than fifteen years old), a vast amount of scientific papers was already published on this topic, dealing with a broad range of analytical methods and applications. This work describes how computational researches have approached this subject and the methods used to analyze such systems. Founded on a wide though non-exaustive review of the literature, a taxonomy is proposed to classify and describe different categories of research. Each research category is described and the main works, discoveries and perspectives are highlighted.
