Optimal Scheduling for Incentive WiFi Offloading under Energy Constraint

WiFi offloading, where mobile device users (e.g., smart phone users) transmit packets through WiFi networks rather than cellular networks, is a promising solution to alleviating the heavy traffic burden of cellular networks due to data explosion. However, since WiFi networks are intermittently available, a mobile device user in WiFi offloading usually needs to wait for WiFi connection and thus experiences longer delay of packet transmission. To motivate users to participate in WiFi offloading, cellular network operators give incentives (rewards like coupons, e-coins) to users who wait for WiFi connection and transmit packets through WiFi networks.
  In this paper, we aim at maximizing users' rewards while meeting constraints on queue stability and energy consumption. However, we face scheduling challenges from random packet arrivals, intermittent WiFi connection and time varying wireless link states. To address these challenges, we first formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization problem. We then propose an optimal scheduling policy, named Optimal scheduling Policy under Energy Constraint (OPEC), which makes online decisions as to when to delay packet transmission to wait for WiFi connection and which wireless link (WiFi link or cellular link) to transmit packets on. OPEC automatically adapts to random packet arrivals and time varying wireless link states, not requiring a priori knowledge of packet arrival and wireless link probabilities. As verified by simulations, OPEC scheduling policy can achieve the maximum rewards while keeping queue stable and meeting energy consumption constraint.
