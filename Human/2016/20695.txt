Herbrand Consistency of Some Finite Fragments of Bounded Arithmetical Theories

We formalize the notion of Herbrand Consistency in an appropriate way for bounded arithmetics, and show the existence of a finite fragment of ${\rm IΔ_0}$ whose Herbrand Consistency is not provable in the thoery ${\rm IΔ_0}$. We also show the existence of an ${\rm IΔ_0}-$derivable $Π_1-$sentence such that ${\rm IΔ_0}$ cannot prove its Herbrand Consistency.
