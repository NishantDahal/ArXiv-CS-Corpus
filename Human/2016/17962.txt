Smartphone-based Vehicle Telematics - A Ten-Year Anniversary

Just like it has irrevocably reshaped social life, the fast growth of smartphone ownership is now beginning to revolutionize the driving experience and change how we think about automotive insurance, vehicle safety systems, and traffic research. This paper summarizes the first ten years of research in smartphone-based vehicle telematics, with a focus on user-friendly implementations and the challenges that arise due to the mobility of the smartphone. Notable academic and industrial projects are reviewed, and system aspects related to sensors, energy consumption, cloud computing, vehicular ad hoc networks, and human-machine interfaces are examined. Moreover, we highlight the differences between traditional and smartphonebased automotive navigation, and survey the state-of-the-art in smartphone-based transportation mode classification, driver classification, and road condition monitoring. Future advances are expected to be driven by improvements in sensor technology, evidence of the societal benefits of current implementations, and the establishment of industry standards for sensor fusion and driver assessment
