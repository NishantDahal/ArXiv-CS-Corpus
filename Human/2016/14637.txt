868 MHz Wireless Sensor Network - A Study

Today 2.4 GHz based wireless sensor networks are increasing at a tremendous pace, and are seen in widespread applications. Product innovation and support by many vendors in 2.4 GHz makes it a preferred choice, but the networks are prone to issues like interference, and range issues. On the other hand, the less popular 868 MHz in the ISM band has not seen significant usage. In this paper we explore the use of 868 MHz channel to implement a wireless sensor network, and study the efficacy of this channel
