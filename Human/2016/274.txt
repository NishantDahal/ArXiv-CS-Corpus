Role-based Label Propagation Algorithm for Community Detection

Community structure of networks provides comprehensive insight into their organizational structure and functional behavior. LPA is one of the most commonly adopted community detection algorithms with nearly linear time complexity. But it suffers from poor stability and occurrence of monster community due to the introduced randomize. We note that different community-oriented node roles impact the label propagation in different ways. In this paper, we propose a role-based label propagation algorithm (roLPA), in which the heuristics with regard to community-oriented node role were used. We have evaluated the proposed algorithm on both real and artificial networks. The result shows that roLPA is comparable to the state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.
