Energy Efficient Location and Activity-aware On-Demand Mobile Distributed Sensing Platform for Sensing as a Service in IoT Clouds

The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions billions of sensors deployed around us and connected to the Internet, where the mobile crowd sensing technologies are widely used to collect data in different contexts of the IoT paradigm. Due to the popularity of Big Data technologies, processing and storing large volumes of data has become easier than ever. However, large scale data management tasks still require significant amounts of resources that can be expensive regardless of whether they are purchased or rented (e.g. pay-as-you-go infrastructure). Further, not everyone is interested in such large scale data collection and analysis. More importantly, not everyone has the financial and computational resources to deal with such large volumes of data. Therefore, a timely need exists for a cloud-integrated mobile crowd sensing platform that is capable of capturing sensors data, on-demand, based on conditions enforced by the data consumers. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, specifically, location and activity-aware mobile sensing platform called C-MOSDEN ( Context-aware Mobile Sensor Data ENgine) for the IoT domain. We evaluated the proposed platform using three real-world scenarios that highlight the importance of 'selective sensing'. The computational effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed platform are investigated and is used to highlight the advantages of context-aware selective sensing.
