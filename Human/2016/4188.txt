A First Practical Fully Homomorphic Crypto-Processor Design: The Secret Computer is Nearly Here

Following a sequence of hardware designs for a fully homomorphic crypto-processor - a general purpose processor that natively runs encrypted machine code on encrypted data in registers and memory, resulting in encrypted machine states - proposed by the authors in 2014, we discuss a working prototype of the first of those, a so-called `pseudo-homomorphic' design. This processor is in principle safe against physical or software-based attacks by the owner/operator of the processor on user processes running in it. The processor is intended as a more secure option for those emerging computing paradigms that require trust to be placed in computations carried out in remote locations or overseen by untrusted operators.
  The prototype has a single-pipeline superscalar architecture that runs OpenRISC standard machine code in two distinct modes. The processor runs in the encrypted mode (the unprivileged, `user' mode, with a long pipeline) at 60-70% of the speed in the unencrypted mode (the privileged, `supervisor' mode, with a short pipeline), emitting a completed encrypted instruction every 1.67-1.8 cycles on average in real trials.
