Interference Management and Power Allocation for NOMA Visible Light Communications Network

To design an efficient interference management and multiple access scheme for visible light communication (VLC) network, this letter leverages the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which has received significant attention in the $5^{th}$ generation wireless communication. With the residual interference from the successive interference cancellation in NOMA taken into account, we optimize the power allocation for NOMA VLC network to improve the achievable user rate under user quality of service (QoS) constraint. The performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated by the numerical results.
