Fair Scheduling for Data Collection in Mobile Sensor Networks with Energy Harvesting

We consider the problem of data collection from a continental-scale network of energy harvesting sensors, applied to tracking mobile assets in rural environments. Our application constraints favour a highly asymmetric solution, with heavily duty-cycled sensor nodes communicating with powered base stations. We study a novel scheduling optimisation problem for energy harvesting mobile sensor network, that maximises the amount of collected data under the constraints of radio link quality and energy harvesting efficiency, while ensuring a fair data reception. We show that the problem is NP-complete and propose a heuristic algorithm to approximate the optimal scheduling solution in polynomial time. Moreover, our algorithm is flexible in handling progressive energy harvesting events, such as with solar panels, or opportunistic and bursty events, such as with Wireless Power Transfer. We use empirical link quality data, solar energy, and WPT efficiency to evaluate the proposed algorithm in extensive simulations and compare its performance to state-of-the-art. We show that our algorithm achieves high data reception rates, under different fairness and node lifetime constraints.
