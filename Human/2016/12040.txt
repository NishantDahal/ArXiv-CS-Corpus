Wireless Sensor Networks: Local Multicast Study

Wireless sensor networks and Ad-hoc network in the region Multicast (Geocasting) means to deliver the message to all nodes in a given geographical area from the source point. Regional Multicast practical application of the specified area and other regions may be formed to broadcast transmission and location-related business information, extensive advertising, or to send an urgent message. Regional multicast protocol design goal is to ensure messaging and low transport costs. Most have been proposed agreement does not guarantee message delivery, although some other guaranteed messaging protocol has triggered high transmission costs. The goal now is to ensure that research messaging and low-cost local transmission protocol and its algorithm, to promote the development of domain communication. This paper introduces the research background and research results, and proposed to solve the problems and ideas.
