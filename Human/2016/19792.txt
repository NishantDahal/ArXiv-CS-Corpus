Dynamic Scheduling for Delay Guarantees for Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Users

We study an uplink multi secondary user (SU) system having statistical delay constraints, and an average interference constraint to the primary user (PU). SUs with heterogeneous interference channel statistics, to the PU, experience heterogeneous delay performances since SUs causing low interference are scheduled more frequently than those causing high interference. We propose a scheduling algorithm that can provide arbitrary average delay guarantees to SUs irrespective of their statistical channel qualities. We derive the algorithm using the Lyapunov technique and show that it yields bounded queues and satisfy the interference constraints. Using simulations, we show its superiority over the Max-Weight algorithm.
