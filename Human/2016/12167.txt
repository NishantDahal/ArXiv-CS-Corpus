Computing with Dynamical Systems Based on Insulator-Metal-Transition Oscillators

In this paper we review recent work on novel computing paradigms using coupled oscillatory dynamical systems. We explore systems of relaxation oscillators based on linear state transitioning devices, which switch between two discrete states with hysteresis. By harnessing the dynamics of complex, connected systems we embrace the philosophy of "let physics do the computing" and demonstrate how complex phase and frequency dynamics of such systems can be controlled, programmed and observed to solve computationally hard problems. Although our discussion in this paper is limited to Insulator-to-Metallic (IMT) state transition devices, the general philosophy of such computing paradigms can be translated to other mediums including optical systems. We present the necessary mathematical treatments necessary to understand the time evolution of these systems and demonstrate through recent experimental results the potential of such computational primitives.
