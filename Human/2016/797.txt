Family of 2-simplex cognitive tools and their application for decision-making and its justifications

Urgency of application and development of cognitive graphic tools for usage in intelligent systems of data analysis, decision making and its justifications is given. Cognitive graphic tool "2-simplex prism" and examples of its usage are presented. Specificity of program realization of cognitive graphics tools invariant to problem areas is described. Most significant results are given and discussed. Future investigations are connected with usage of new approach to rendering, cross-platform realization, cognitive features improving and expanding of n-simplex family.
