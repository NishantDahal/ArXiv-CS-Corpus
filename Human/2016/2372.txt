Distance-Sensitive Planar Point Location

Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a connected planar polygonal subdivision with $n$ edges that we want to preprocess for point-location queries, and where we are given the probability $γ_i$ that the query point lies in a polygon $P_i$ of $\mathcal{S}$. We show how to preprocess $\mathcal{S}$ such that the query time for a point~$p\in P_i$ depends on~$γ_i$ and, in addition, on the distance from $p$ to the boundary of~$P_i$---the further away from the boundary, the faster the query. More precisely, we show that a point-location query can be answered in time $O\left(\min \left(\log n, 1 + \log \frac{\mathrm{area}(P_i)}{γ_i Δ_{p}^2}\right)\right)$, where $Δ_{p}$ is the shortest Euclidean distance of the query point~$p$ to the boundary of $P_i$. Our structure uses $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ preprocessing time. It is based on a decomposition of the regions of $\mathcal{S}$ into convex quadrilaterals and triangles with the following property: for any point $p\in P_i$, the quadrilateral or triangle containing~$p$ has area $Ω(Δ_{p}^2)$. For the special case where $\mathcal{S}$ is a subdivision of the unit square and $γ_i=\mathrm{area}(P_i)$, we present a simpler solution that achieves a query time of $O\left(\min \left(\log n, \log \frac{1}{Δ_{p}^2}\right)\right)$. The latter solution can be extended to convex subdivisions in three dimensions.
