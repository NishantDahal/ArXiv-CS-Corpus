Large-Scale MIMO is Capable of Eliminating Power-Thirsty Channel Coding for Wireless Transmission of HEVC/H.265 Video

A wireless video transmission architecture relying on the emerging large-scale multiple-input--multiple-output (LS-MIMO) technique is proposed. Upon using the most advanced High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) (also known as H.265), we demonstrate that the proposed architecture invoking the low-complexity linear zero-forcing (ZF) detector and dispensing with any channel coding is capable of significantly outperforming the conventional small-scale MIMO based architecture, even if the latter employs the high-complexity optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector and a rate-$1/3$ recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) channel codec. Specifically, compared to the conventional small-scale MIMO system, the effective system throughput of the proposed LS-MIMO based scheme is increased by a factor of up to three and the quality of reconstructed video quantified in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is improved by about $22.5\, \text{dB}$ at a channel-SNR of $E_b/N_0 \approx 6\,\text{dB}$ for delay-tolerant video-file delivery applications, and about $20\,\text{dB}$ for lip-synchronized real-time interactive video applications. Alternatively, viewing the attainable improvement from a power-saving perspective, a channel-SNR gain as high as $Î”_{E_b/N_0}\approx 5\,\text{dB}$ is observed at a PSNR of $36\, \text{dB}$ for the scenario of delay-tolerant video applications and again, an even higher gain is achieved in the real-time video application scenario. Therefore, we envisage that LS-MIMO aided wireless multimedia communications is capable of dispensing with power-thirsty channel codec altogether!
