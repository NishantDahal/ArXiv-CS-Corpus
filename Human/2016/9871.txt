A Still Simpler Way of Introducing the Interior-Point Method for Linear Programming

Linear programming is now included in algorithm undergraduate and postgraduate courses for computer science majors. We give a self-contained treatment of an interior-point method which is particularly tailored to the typical mathematical background of CS students. In particular, only limited knowledge of linear algebra and calculus is assumed.
