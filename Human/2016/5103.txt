Advanced Coordinated Beamforming for the Downlink of Future LTE Cellular Networks

Modern cellular networks in traditional frequency bands are notoriously interference-limited especially in urban areas, where base stations are deployed in close proximity to one another. The latest releases of Long Term Evolution (LTE) incorporate features for coordinating downlink transmissions as an efficient means of managing interference. Recent field trial results and theoretical studies of the performance of joint transmission (JT) coordinated multi-point (CoMP) schemes revealed, however, that their gains are not as high as initially expected, despite the large coordination overhead. These schemes are known to be very sensitive to defects in synchronization or information exchange between coordinating bases stations as well as uncoordinated interference. In this article, we review recent advanced coordinated beamforming (CB) schemes as alternatives, requiring less overhead than JT CoMP while achieving good performance in realistic conditions. By stipulating that, in certain LTE scenarios of increasing interest, uncoordinated interference constitutes a major factor in the performance of CoMP techniques at large, we hereby assess the resilience of the state-of-the-art CB to uncoordinated interference. We also describe how these techniques can leverage the latest specifications of current cellular networks, and how they may perform when we consider standardized feedback and coordination. This allows us to identify some key roadblocks and research directions to address as LTE evolves towards the future of mobile communications.
