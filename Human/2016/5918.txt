Partition bound is quadratically tight for product distributions

Let $f : \{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be a 2-party function. For every product distribution $μ$ on $\{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}^n$, we show that $$\mathsf{CC}^μ_{0.49}(f) = O\left(\left(\log \mathsf{prt}_{1/8}(f) \cdot \log \log \mathsf{prt}_{1/8}(f)\right)^2\right),$$ where $\mathsf{CC}^μ_\varepsilon(f)$ is the distributional communication complexity of $f$ with error at most $\varepsilon$ under the distribution $μ$ and $\mathsf{prt}_{1/8}(f)$ is the {\em partition bound} of $f$, as defined by Jain and Klauck [{\em Proc. 25th CCC}, 2010]. We also prove a similar bound in terms of $\mathsf{IC}_{1/8}(f)$, the {\em information complexity} of $f$, namely, $$\mathsf{CC}^μ_{0.49}(f) = O\left(\left(\mathsf{IC}_{1/8}(f) \cdot \log \mathsf{IC}_{1/8}(f)\right)^2\right).$$ The latter bound was recently and independently established by Kol [{\em Proc. 48th STOC}, 2016] using a different technique.
  We show a similar result for query complexity under product distributions. Let $g : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be a function. For every bit-wise product distribution $μ$ on $\{0,1\}^n$, we show that $$\mathsf{QC}^μ_{0.49}(g) = O\left(\left( \log \mathsf{qprt}_{1/8}(g) \cdot \log \log\mathsf{qprt}_{1/8}(g) \right)^2 \right),$$ where $\mathsf{QC}^μ_{\varepsilon}(g)$ is the distributional query complexity of $f$ with error at most $\varepsilon$ under the distribution $μ$ and $\mathsf{qprt}_{1/8}(g))$ is the {\em query partition bound} of the function $g$.
  Partition bounds were introduced (in both communication complexity and query complexity models) to provide LP-based lower bounds for randomized communication complexity and randomized query complexity. Our results demonstrate that these lower bounds are polynomially tight for {\em product} distributions.
