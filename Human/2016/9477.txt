Short Communication on QUIST: A Quick Clustering Algorithm

In this short communication we introduce the quick clustering algorithm (QUIST), an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm based on sorting. QUIST is a poly-logarithmic divisive clustering algorithm that does not assume the number of clusters, and/or the cluster size to be known ahead of time. It is also insensitive to the original ordering of the input.
