Reliable Uplink Communication through Double Association in Wireless Heterogeneous Networks

We investigate methods for network association that improve the reliability of uplink transmissions in dense wireless heterogeneous networks. The stochastic geometry analysis shows that the double association, in which an uplink transmission is transmitted to a macro Base Station (BS) and small BS, significantly improves the probability of successful transmission.
