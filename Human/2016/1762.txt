When the Filter Bubble Bursts: Collective Evaluation Dynamics in Online Communities

We analyze online collective evaluation processes through positive and negative votes in various social media. We find two modes of collective evaluations that stem from the existence of filter bubbles. Above a threshold of collective attention, negativity grows faster with positivity, as a sign of the burst of a filter bubble when information reaches beyond the local social context of a user. We analyze how collectively evaluated content can reach large social contexts and create polarization, showing that emotions expressed through text play a key role in collective evaluation processes.
