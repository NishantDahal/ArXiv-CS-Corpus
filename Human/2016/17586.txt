A Sequence Construction of Cyclic Codes over Finite Fields

Due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms, cyclic codes, a subclass of linear codes, have applications in communication systems, consumer electronics, and data storage systems. There are several approaches to constructing all cyclic codes over finite fields, including the generator matrix approach, the generator polynomial approach, and the generating idempotent approach. Another one is a sequence approach, which has been intensively investigated in the past decade. The objective of this paper is to survey the progress in this direction in the past decade. Many open problems are also presented in this paper.
