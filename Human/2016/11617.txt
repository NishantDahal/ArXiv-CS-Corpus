Meta-MapReduce: A Technique for Reducing Communication in MapReduce Computations

MapReduce has proven to be one of the most useful paradigms in the revolution of distributed computing, where cloud services and cluster computing become the standard venue for computing. The federation of cloud and big data activities is the next challenge where MapReduce should be modified to avoid (big) data migration across remote (cloud) sites. This is exactly our scope of research, where only the very essential data for obtaining the result is transmitted, reducing communication, processing and preserving data privacy as much as possible. In this work, we propose an algorithmic technique for MapReduce algorithms, called Meta-MapReduce, that decreases the communication cost by allowing us to process and move metadata to clouds and from the map phase to reduce phase. In Meta-MapReduce, the reduce phase fetches only the required data at required iterations, which in turn, assists in preserving the data privacy.
