On instruction sets for Boolean registers in program algebra

In previous work carried out in the setting of program algebra, including work in the area of instruction sequence size complexity, we chose instruction sets for Boolean registers that contain only instructions of a few of the possible kinds. In the current paper, we study instruction sequence size bounded functional completeness of all possible instruction sets for Boolean registers. We expect that the results of this study will turn out to be useful to adequately assess results of work that is concerned with lower bounds of instruction sequence size complexity.
