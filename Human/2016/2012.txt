Two-hop Power-Relaying for Linear Wireless Sensor Networks

This paper presents two-hop relay gain-scheduling control in a Wireless Sensor Network to estimate a static target prior characterized by Gaussian probability distribution. The target is observed by a network of linear sensors, whose observations are transmitted to a fusion center for carrying out final estimation via a amplify-and-forward relay node. We are concerned with the joint transmission power allocation for sensors and relay to optimize the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator, which is deployed at the fusion center. Particularly, such highly nonlinear optimization problems are solved by an iterative procedure of very low computational complexity. Simulations are provided to support the efficiency of our proposed power allocation.
