A Parallel Memory-efficient Epistemic Logic Program Solver: Harder, Better, Faster

As the practical use of answer set programming (ASP) has grown with the development of efficient solvers, we expect a growing interest in extensions of ASP as their semantics stabilize and solvers supporting them mature. Epistemic Specifications, which adds modal operators K and M to the language of ASP, is one such extension. We call a program in this language an epistemic logic program (ELP). Solvers have thus far been practical for only the simplest ELPs due to exponential growth of the search space. We describe a solver that is able to solve harder problems better (e.g., without exponentially-growing memory needs w.r.t. K and M occurrences) and faster than any other known ELP solver.
