A new fast algorithm for reproducing complex networks with community structure

In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm allowing for generation of networks with heterogeneity of both node degrees and community sizes. The quality and efficiency of the algorithm is analyzed and compared to the other, so far the most popular algorithm which was proposed by Lancichinetti et al. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of both algorithms indicating the areas of their potential application.
