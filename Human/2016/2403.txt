A Graph Representation for Two-Dimensional Finite Type Constrained Systems

The demand of two-dimensional source coding and constrained coding has been getting higher these days, but compared to the one-dimensional case, many problems have remained open as the analysis is cumbersome. A main reason for that would be because there are no graph representations discovered so far. In this paper, we focus on a two-dimensional finite type constrained system, a set of two-dimensional blocks characterized by a finite number of two-dimensional constraints, and propose its graph representation. We then show how to generate an element of the two-dimensional finite type constrained system from the graph representation.
