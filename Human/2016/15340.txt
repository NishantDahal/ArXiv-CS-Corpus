Radio Link Planning made easy with a Telegram Bot

Traditional radio planning tools present a steep learning curve. We present BotRf, a Telegram Bot that facilitates the process by guiding non-experts in assessing the feasibility of radio links. Built on open source tools, BotRf can run on any smartphone or PC running Telegram. Using it on a smartphone has the added value that the Bot can leverage the internal GPS to enter coordinates. BotRf can be used in environments with low bandwidth as the generated data traffic is quite limited. We present examples of its use in Venezuela.
