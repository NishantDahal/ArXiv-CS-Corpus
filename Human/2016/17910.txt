Contact activity and dynamics of the online elite

Humans interact through numerous channels to build and maintain social connections: they meet face-to-face, initiate phone calls or send text messages, and interact via social media. Although it is known that the network of physical contacts, for example, is distinct from the network arising from communication events via phone calls and instant messages, the extent to which these networks differ is not clear. In fact, the network structure of these channels shows large structural variations. Each network of interactions, however, contains both central and peripheral individuals: central members are characterized by higher connectivity and can reach a high fraction of the network within a low number of connections, contrary to the nodes on the periphery. Here we show that the various channels account for diverse relationships between pairs of individuals and the corresponding interaction patterns across channels differ to an extent that hinders the simple reduction of social ties to a single layer. Furthemore, the origin and purpose of each network also determine the role of their respective central members: highly connected individuals in the person-to-person networks interact with their environment in a regular manner, while members central in the social communication networks display irregular behavior with respect to their physical contacts and are more active through rare, social events. These results suggest that due to the inherently different functions of communication channels, each one favors different social behaviors and different strategies for interacting with the environment. Our findings can facilitate the understanding of the varying roles and impact individuals have on the population, which can further shed light on the prediction and prevention of epidemic outbreaks, or information propagation.
