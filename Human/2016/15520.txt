Subexponential parameterized algorithms for graphs of polynomial growth

We show that for a number of parameterized problems for which only $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$ time algorithms are known on general graphs, subexponential parameterized algorithms with running time $2^{O(k^{1-\frac{1}{1+δ}} \log^2 k)} n^{O(1)}$ are possible for graphs of polynomial growth with growth rate (degree) $δ$, that is, if we assume that every ball of radius $r$ contains only $O(r^δ)$ vertices. The algorithms use the technique of low-treewidth pattern covering, introduced by Fomin et al. [FOCS 2016] for planar graphs; here we show how this strategy can be made to work for graphs with polynomial growth.
  Formally, we prove that, given a graph $G$ of polynomial growth with growth rate $δ$ and an integer $k$, one can in randomized polynomial time find a subset $A \subseteq V(G)$ such that on one hand the treewidth of $G[A]$ is $O(k^{1-\frac{1}{1+δ}} \log k)$, and on the other hand for every set $X \subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$, the probability that $X \subseteq A$ is $2^{-O(k^{1-\frac{1}{1+δ}} \log^2 k)}$. Together with standard dynamic programming techniques on graphs of bounded treewidth, this statement gives subexponential parameterized algorithms for a number of subgraph search problems, such as Long Path or Steiner Tree, in graphs of polynomial growth.
  We complement the algorithm with an almost tight lower bound for Long Path: unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, no parameterized algorithm with running time $2^{k^{1-\frac{1}δ-\varepsilon}}n^{O(1)}$ is possible for any $\varepsilon > 0$ and an integer $δ\geq 3$.
