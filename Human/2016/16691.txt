User Cooperation for Enhanced Throughput Fairness in Wireless Powered Communication Networks

This paper studies a novel user cooperation method in a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), where a pair of distributed terminal users first harvest wireless energy broadcasted by one energy node (EN) and then use the harvested energy to transmit information cooperatively to a destination node (DN). In particular, the two cooperating users exchange their independent information with each other to form a virtual antenna array and transmit jointly to the DN. By allowing each user to allocate part of its harvested energy to transmit the other's information, the proposed cooperation can effectively mitigate the user unfairness problem in WPCNs, where a user may suffer from very low data rate due to the poor energy harvesting performance and high data transmission consumptions. We derive the maximum common throughput achieved by the cooperation scheme through optimizing the time allocation on wireless energy transfer, user message exchange, and joint information transmissions. Through comparing with some representative benchmark schemes, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed user cooperation in enhancing the throughput performance under different setups.
