Age-of-Information in the Presence of Error

We consider the peak age-of-information (PAoI) in an M/M/1 queueing system with packet delivery error, i.e., update packets can get lost during transmissions to their destination. We focus on two types of policies, one is to adopt Last-Come-First-Served (LCFS) scheduling, and the other is to utilize retransmissions, i.e., keep transmitting the most recent packet. Both policies can effectively avoid the queueing delay of a busy channel and ensure a small PAoI. Exact PAoI expressions under both policies with different error probabilities are derived, including First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), LCFS with preemptive priority, LCFS with non-preemptive priority, Retransmission with preemptive priority, and Retransmission with non-preemptive priority. Numerical results obtained from analysis and simulation are presented to validate our results.
