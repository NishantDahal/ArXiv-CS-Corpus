ICE: A General and Validated Energy Complexity Model for Multithreaded Algorithms

Like time complexity models that have significantly contributed to the analysis and development of fast algorithms, energy complexity models for parallel algorithms are desired as crucial means to develop energy efficient algorithms for ubiquitous multicore platforms. Ideal energy complexity models should be validated on real multicore platforms and applicable to a wide range of parallel algorithms. However, existing energy complexity models for parallel algorithms are either theoretical without model validation or algorithm-specific without ability to analyze energy complexity for a wide-range of parallel algorithms.
  This paper presents a new general validated energy complexity model for parallel (multithreaded) algorithms. The new model abstracts away possible multicore platforms by their static and dynamic energy of computational operations and data access, and derives the energy complexity of a given algorithm from its work, span and I/O complexity. The new model is validated by different sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) algorithms and dense matrix multiplication (matmul) algorithms running on high performance computing (HPC) platforms (e.g., Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi). The new energy complexity model is able to characterize and compare the energy consumption of SpMV and matmul kernels according to three aspects: different algorithms, different input matrix types and different platforms. The prediction of the new model regarding which algorithm consumes more energy with different inputs on different platforms, is confirmed by the experimental results. In order to improve the usability and accuracy of the new model for a wide range of platforms, the platform parameters of ICE model are provided for eleven platforms including HPC, accelerator and embedded platforms.
