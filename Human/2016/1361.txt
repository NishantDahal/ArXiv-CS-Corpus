Behavior recognition and analysis in smart environments for context-aware applications

Providing accurate/suitable information on behaviors in sma\-rt environments is a challenging and crucial task in pervasive computing where context-awareness and pro-activity are of fundamental importance. Behavioral identifications enable to abstract higher-level concepts that are interesting to applications. This work proposes the unified logical-based framework to recognize and analyze behavioral specifications understood as a formal logic language that avoids ambiguity typical for natural languages. Automatically discovering behaviors from sensory data streams as formal specifications is of fundamental importance to build seamless human-computer interactions. Thus, the knowledge about environment behaviors expressed in terms of temporal logic formulas constitutes a base for the reactive and precise reasoning processes to support trustworthy, unambiguous and pro-active decisions for applications that are smart and context-aware.
