From compressed sensing to compressed bit-streams: practical encoders, tractable decoders

Compressed sensing is now established as an effective method for dimension reduction when the underlying signals are sparse or compressible with respect to some suitable basis or frame. One important, yet under-addressed problem regarding the compressive acquisition of analog signals is how to perform quantization. This is directly related to the important issues of how "compressed" compressed sensing is (in terms of the total number of bits one ends up using after acquiring the signal) and ultimately whether compressed sensing can be used to obtain compressed representations of suitable signals. Building on our recent work, we propose a concrete and practicable method for performing "analog-to-information conversion". Following a compressive signal acquisition stage, the proposed method consists of a quantization stage, based on $ΣΔ$ (sigma-delta) quantization, and a subsequent encoding (compression) stage that fits within the framework of compressed sensing seamlessly. We prove that, using this method, we can convert analog compressive samples to compressed digital bitstreams and decode using tractable algorithms based on convex optimization. We prove that the proposed AIC provides a nearly optimal encoding of sparse and compressible signals. Finally, we present numerical experiments illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed analog-to-information converter.
