Modelling movement for collective adaptive systems with CARMA

Space and movement through space play an important role in many  collective adaptive systems (CAS). CAS consist of multiple components  interacting to achieve some goal in a system or environment that can  change over time. When these components operate in space, then their  behaviour can be affected by where they are located in that space.  Examples include the possibility of communication between two components  located at different points, and rates of movement of a component  that may be affected by location. The CARMA language and its associated  software tools can be used to model such systems. In particular, a  graphical editor for CARMA allows for the specification of spatial structure and  generation of templates that can be used in a CARMA model with space.  We demonstrate the use of this tool to experiment with a model of  pedestrian movement over a network of paths.
