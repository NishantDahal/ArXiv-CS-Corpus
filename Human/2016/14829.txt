Connecting web-based mapping services with scientific data repositories: collaborative curation and retrieval of simulation data via a geospatial interface

Increasing quantities of scientific data are becoming readily accessible via online repositories such as those provided by Figshare and Zenodo. Geoscientific simulations in particular generate large quantities of data, with several research groups studying many, often overlapping areas of the world. When studying a particular area, being able to keep track of one's own simulations as well as those of collaborators can be challenging. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a new tool for visually cataloguing and retrieving data associated with a given geographical location through a web-based Google Maps interface. Each data repository is pin-pointed on the map with a marker based on the geographical location that the dataset corresponds to. By clicking on the markers, users can quickly inspect the metadata of the repositories and download the associated data files. The crux of the approach lies in the ability to easily query and retrieve data from multiple sources via a common interface. While many advances are being made in terms of scientific data repositories, the development of this new tool has uncovered several issues and limitations of the current state-of-the-art which are discussed herein, along with some ideas for the future.
