Robust Automated Human Activity Recognition and its Application to Sleep Research

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a powerful tool for understanding human behaviour. Applying HAR to wearable sensors can provide new insights by enriching the feature set in health studies, and enhance the personalisation and effectiveness of health, wellness, and fitness applications. Wearable devices provide an unobtrusive platform for user monitoring, and due to their increasing market penetration, feel intrinsic to the wearer. The integration of these devices in daily life provide a unique opportunity for understanding human health and wellbeing. This is referred to as the "quantified self" movement. The analyses of complex health behaviours such as sleep, traditionally require a time-consuming manual interpretation by experts. This manual work is necessary due to the erratic periodicity and persistent noisiness of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a robust automated human activity recognition algorithm, which we call RAHAR. We test our algorithm in the application area of sleep research by providing a novel framework for evaluating sleep quality and examining the correlation between the aforementioned and an individual's physical activity. Our results improve the state-of-the-art procedure in sleep research by 15 percent for area under ROC and by 30 percent for F1 score on average. However, application of RAHAR is not limited to sleep analysis and can be used for understanding other health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiac diseases.
