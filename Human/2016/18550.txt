Dynamic Collaborative Filtering with Compound Poisson Factorization

Model-based collaborative filtering analyzes user-item interactions to infer latent factors that represent user preferences and item characteristics in order to predict future interactions. Most collaborative filtering algorithms assume that these latent factors are static, although it has been shown that user preferences and item perceptions drift over time. In this paper, we propose a conjugate and numerically stable dynamic matrix factorization (DCPF) based on compound Poisson matrix factorization that models the smoothly drifting latent factors using Gamma-Markov chains. We propose a numerically stable Gamma chain construction, and then present a stochastic variational inference approach to estimate the parameters of our model. We apply our model to time-stamped ratings data sets: Netflix, Yelp, and Last.fm, where DCPF achieves a higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art static and dynamic factorization models.
