On the Algebraic Representation of One-Tape Deterministic Turing Machine

An algebraic representation of the Turing machines is given, where the configurations of Turing machines are represented by 4 order tensors, and the transition functions by 8 order tensors. Two types of tensor product are defined, one is to model the evolution of the Turing machines, and the other is to model the compositions of transition functions. It is shown that the two types of tensor product are harmonic in the sense that the associate law is obeyed.
