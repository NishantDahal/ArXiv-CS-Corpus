Integrating a Model of Analytical Quality Assurance into the V-Modell XT

Economic models of quality assurance can be an important tool for decision makers in software development projects. They enable to base quality assurance planning on economical factors of the product and the used defect-detection techniques. A variety of such models has been proposed but many are too abstract to be used in practice. Furthermore, even the more concrete models lack an integration with existing software development process models to increase their applicability. This paper describes an integration of a thorough stochastic model of the economics of analytical quality assurance with the systems development process model V-Modell XT. The integration is done in a modular way by providing a new process module - a concept directly available in the V-Modell XT for extension purposes - related to analytical quality assurance. In particular, we describe the work products, roles, and activities defined in our new process module and their effects on existing V-Modell XT elements.
