Strong connectivity and its applications

Directed graphs are widely used in modelling of nonsymmetric relations in various sciences and engineering disciplines. We discuss invariants of strongly connected directed graphs - minimal number of vertices or edges necessary to remove to make remaining graphs not strongly connected. By analogy with undirected graphs these invariants are called strong vertex/edge connectivities. We review some properties of these invariants. Computational results for some publicly available connectome graphs used in neuroscience are described.
