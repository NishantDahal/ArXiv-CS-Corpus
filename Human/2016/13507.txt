Determination of signal-to-noise ratio on the base of information-entropic analysis

In this paper we suggest a new algorithm for determination of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is a quantitative measure widely used in science and engineering. Generally, methods for determination of SNR are based on using of experimentally defined power of noise level, or some conditional noise criterion which can be specified for signal processing. In the present work we describe method for determination of SNR of chaotic and stochastic signals at unknown power levels of signal and noise. For this aim we use information as difference between unconditional and conditional entropy. Our theoretical results are confirmed by results of analysis of signals which can be described by nonlinear maps and presented as overlapping of harmonic and stochastic signals.
