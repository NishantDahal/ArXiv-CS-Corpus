A Hybrid Dynamical Extension of Averaging

We extend a smooth dynamical systems averaging technique to a class of hybrid systems with a limit cycle that is particularly relevant to the synthesis of stable legged gaits. After introducing a definition of hybrid averageability sufficient to recover the classical result, we provide a simple illustration of its applicability to legged locomotion and conclude with some rather more speculative remarks concerning the prospects for further generalization of these ideas.
