A combinatorial problem about binary necklaces and attractors of Boolean automata networks

It is known that there are no more Lyndon words of length n than there are periodic necklaces of same length. This paper considers a similar problem where, additionally, the necklaces must be without some forbidden factors. This problem relates to a different context, concerned with the behaviours of particular discrete dynamical systems, namely, Boolean automata networks. A formal argument supporting the following idea is provided: addition of cycle intersections in network structures causes exponential reduction of the networks' number of attractors.
