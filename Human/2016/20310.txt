Model-based Test Generation for Robotic Software: Automata versus Belief-Desire-Intention Agents

Robotic code needs to be verified to ensure its safety and functional correctness, especially when the robot is interacting with people. Testing real code in simulation is a viable option. However, generating tests that cover rare scenarios, as well as exercising most of the code, is a challenge amplified by the complexity of the interactions between the environment and the software. Model-based test generation methods can automate otherwise manual processes and facilitate reaching rare scenarios during testing. In this paper, we compare using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents as models for test generation with more conventional automata-based techniques that exploit model checking, in terms of practicality, performance, transferability to different scenarios, and exploration (`coverage'), through two case studies: a cooperative manufacturing task, and a home care scenario. The results highlight the advantages of using BDI agents for test generation. BDI agents naturally emulate the agency present in Human-Robot Interactions (HRIs), and are thus more expressive than automata. The performance of the BDI-based test generation is at least as high, and the achieved coverage is higher or equivalent, compared to test generation based on model checking automata.
