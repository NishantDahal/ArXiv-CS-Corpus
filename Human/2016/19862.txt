Nonlinear 1-Bit Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO with Higher-Order Modulation

Massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple- output (MIMO) is widely believed to be a core technology for the upcoming fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication standards. The use of low-precision digital-to-analog converters (DACs) in MU-MIMO base stations is of interest because it reduces the power consumption, system costs, and raw baseband data rates. In this paper, we develop novel algorithms for downlink precoding in massive MU-MIMO systems with 1-bit DACs that support higher-order modulation schemes such as 8-PSK or 16-QAM. Specifically, we present low-complexity nonlinear precoding algorithms that achieve low error rates when combined with blind or training-based channel-estimation algorithms at the user equipment. These results are in stark contrast to linear-quantized precoding algorithms, which suffer from a high error floor if used with high-order modulation schemes and 1-bit DACs.
