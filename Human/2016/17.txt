Determination of sizes of optimal three-dimensional optical orthogonal codes of weight three with the AM-OPP restriction

In this paper, we further investigate the constructions on three-dimensional $(u\times v\times w,k,1)$ optical orthogonal codes with the at most one optical pulse per wavelength/time plane restriction (briefly AM-OPP $3$-D $(u\times v\times w,k,1)$-OOCs) by way of the corresponding designs. Several new auxiliary designs such as incomplete holey group divisible designs and incomplete group divisible packings are introduced and therefore new constructions are presented. As a consequence, the exact number of codewords of an optimal AM-OPP $3$-D $(u\times v\times w,3,1)$-OOC is finally determined for any positive integers $v,w$ and $u\geq3$.
