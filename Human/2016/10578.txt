Multi-view pattern matching

We introduce the \textit{multi-view pattern matching} problem, where a text can have multiple views. Each view is a string of the same size and drawn from disjoint alphabets. The pattern is drawn from the union of all alphabets.
  The algorithm we present is an extension of the Horspool algorithm, and in our experiments on synthetic data it shows an $3 \times$ improvement over the naive baseline.
