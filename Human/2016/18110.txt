On the Uplink Spectral Efficiency of Full-Duplex Cooperative OFDMA Systems

In this paper, we develop a resource allocation algorithm for uplink of in-band full-duplex (FD) cellular networks. The FD cellular network is assumed to be based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and consists of a base station communicating with multiple users. Some of the users in the network act as relay for other users and help them to transmit their data to the base station. These relays are FD and work based on amplify and forward (AF) protocol. By appropriate selection of the relays and optimized allocation of subcarriers and powers to all users, we try to maximize the total sum rate of the network. During this optimization, we also impose some constraints on the users' quality of service (QoS) and power. We propose a new algorithm to select the best relays based on the users' maximum data rate and also use Linear Assignment Problem Jonker-Volgenant (LAPJV) algorithm for subcarrier assignment. It is proved that the resulting optimization problem can be converted to a convex problem, and hence it can be solved by standard numerical methods. The simulation results demonstrate the effect of the proposed scheme on the sum rate and coverage of the network.
