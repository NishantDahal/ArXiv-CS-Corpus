Panoramic Structure from Motion via Geometric Relationship Detection

This paper addresses the problem of Structure from Motion (SfM) for indoor panoramic image streams, extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art due to the lack of textures and minimal parallax. The key idea is the fusion of single-view and multi-view reconstruction techniques via geometric relationship detection (e.g., detecting 2D lines as coplanar in 3D). Rough geometry suffices to perform such detection, and our approach utilizes rough surface normal estimates from an image-to-normal deep network to discover geometric relationships among lines. The detected relationships provide exact geometric constraints in our line-based linear SfM formulation. A constrained linear least squares is used to reconstruct a 3D model and camera motions, followed by the bundle adjustment. We have validated our algorithm on challenging datasets, outperforming various state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques.
