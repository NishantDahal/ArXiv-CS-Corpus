Study of all the periods of a Neuronal Recurrence Equation

We characterize the structure of the periods of a neuronal recurrence equation. Firstly, we give a characterization of k-chains in 0-1 periodic sequences. Secondly, we characterize the periods of all cycles of some neuronal recurrence equation. Thirdly, we explain how these results can be used to deduce the existence of the generalized period-halving bifurcation.
