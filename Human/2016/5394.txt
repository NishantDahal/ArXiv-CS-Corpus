Modeling and Simulation of Passenger Traffic in a National Airport

Optimal operation of a country's air transport infrastructure plays a major role in the economic development of nations. Due to the increasing use of air transportation in today's world, flights' boarding times have become a concern for both airlines and airports, thus the importance of knowing beforehand how changes in flights demand parameters and physical airport layout will affect passengers flow and boarding times. This paper presents a pedestrian modeling study in which a national airport passenger flow was analyzed. The study was conducted at Vanguardia National Airport in Villavicencio, Meta, Colombia. Different effects of structural changes are shown and provide judging elements for decision makers regarding passenger traffic in airport design.
