DeepAlgebra - an outline of a program

We outline a program in the area of formalization of mathematics to automate theorem proving in algebra and algebraic geometry. We propose a construction of a dictionary between automated theorem provers and (La)TeX exploiting syntactic parsers. We describe its application to a repository of human-written facts and definitions in algebraic geometry (The Stacks Project). We use deep learning techniques.
