On the Mints Hierarchy in First-Order Intuitionistic Logic

We stratify intuitionistic first-order logic over $(\forall,\to)$ into fragments determined by the alternation of positive and negative occurrences of quantifiers (Mints hierarchy).
  We study the decidability and complexity of these fragments. We prove that even the $Δ_2$ level is undecidable and that $Σ_1$ is Expspace-complete. We also prove that the arity-bounded fragment of $Σ_1$ is complete for co-Nexptime.
