Order-preserving 1-string representations of planar graphs

This paper considers 1-string representations of planar graphs that are order-preserving in the sense that the order of crossings along the curve representing vertex $v$ is the same as the order of edges in the clockwise order around $v$ in the planar embedding. We show that this does not exist for all planar graphs (not even for all planar 3-trees), but show existence for some subclasses of planar partial 3-trees. In particular, for outer-planar graphs it can be order-preserving and outer-string in the sense that all ends of strings are on the outside of the representation.
