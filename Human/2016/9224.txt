Evaluating a Development Framework for Engineering Internet of Things Applications

A critical challenge is to enable IoT application development with minimal effort from various stakeholders involved in the development process. Several approaches to tacking this challenge have been proposed in the fields of wireless sensor networks and ubiquitous and pervasive computing, regarded as precursors to the modern day of IoT. However, although existing approaches provide a wide range of features, stakeholders have specific application development requirements and choosing an appropriate approach requires thorough evaluations on different aspects. To date, this aspect has been investigated to a limited extend. In view of this, this paper provides an extensive set of evaluations based on our previous work on IoT application development framework. Specifically, we evaluate our approach in terms of (1) development effort: the effort required to create a new application, (2) reusability: the extend to which software artifacts can be reused during application development, (3) expressiveness: the characteristics of IoT applications that can be modeled using our approach, (4) memory metrics: the amount of memory and storage a device needs to consume in order to run an application under our framework, and (5) comparison of our approach with state of the art in IoT application development on various dimensions, which does not only provide a comprehensive view of state of the art, but also guides developers in selecting an approach given application requirements in hand. We believe that the above different aspects provide the research community with insight into evaluating, selecting, and developing useful IoT frameworks and applications.
