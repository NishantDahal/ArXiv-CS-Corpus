Eilenberg theorems for many-sorted formations

A theorem of Eilenberg establishes that there exists a bijection between the set of all varieties of regular languages and the set of all varieties of finite monoids. In this article after defining, for a fixed set of sorts $S$ and a fixed $S$-sorted signature $Σ$, the concepts of formation of congruences with respect to $Σ$ and of formation of $Σ$-algebras, we prove that the algebraic lattices of all $Σ$-congruence formations and of all $Σ$-algebra formations are isomorphic, which is an Eilenberg's type theorem. Moreover, under a suitable condition on the free $Σ$-algebras and after defining the concepts of formation of congruences of finite index with respect to $Σ$, of formation of finite $Σ$-algebras, and of formation of regular languages with respect to $Σ$, we prove that the algebraic lattices of all $Σ$-finite index congruence formations, of all $Σ$-finite algebra formations, and of all $Σ$-regular language formations are isomorphic, which is also an Eilenberg's type theorem.
