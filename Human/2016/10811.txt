Enhanced VIP Algorithms for Forwarding, Caching, and Congestion Control in Named Data Networks

Emerging Information-Centric Networking (ICN) architectures seek to optimally utilize both bandwidth and storage for efficient content distribution over the network. The Virtual Interest Packet (VIP) framework has been proposed to enable joint design of forwarding, caching, and congestion control strategies within the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture. While the existing VIP algorithms exhibit good performance, they are primarily focused on maximizing network throughput and utility, and do not explicitly consider user delay. In this paper, we develop a new class of enhanced algorithms for joint dynamic forwarding, caching and congestion control within the VIP framework. These enhanced VIP algorithms adaptively stabilize the network and maximize network utility, while improving the delay performance by intelligently making use of VIP information beyond one hop. Generalizing Lyapunov drift techniques, we prove the throughput optimality and characterize the utility-delay tradeoff of the enhanced VIP algorithms. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the resulting enhanced algorithms for handling Interest Packets and Data Packets within the actual plane, in terms of low network delay and high network utility.
