Automatic View-Point Selection for Inter-Operative Endoscopic Surveillance

Esophageal adenocarcinoma arises from Barrett's esophagus, which is the most serious complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Strategies for screening involve periodic surveillance and tissue biopsies. A major challenge in such regular examinations is to record and track the disease evolution and re-localization of biopsied sites to provide targeted treatments. In this paper, we extend our original inter-operative relocalization framework to provide a constrained image based search for obtaining the best view-point match to the live view. Within this context we investigate the effect of: the choice of feature descriptors and color-space; filtering of uninformative frames and endoscopic modality, for view-point localization. Our experiments indicate an improvement in the best view-point retrieval rate to [92%,87%] from [73%,76%] (in our previous approach) for NBI and WL.
