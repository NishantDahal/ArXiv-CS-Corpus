Phase Retrieval by Linear Algebra

The null vector method, based on a simple linear algebraic concept, is proposed as a solution to the phase retrieval problem.
  In the case with complex Gaussian random measurement matrices, a non-asymptotic error bound is derived, yielding an asymptotic regime of accurate approximation comparable to that for the spectral vector method.
