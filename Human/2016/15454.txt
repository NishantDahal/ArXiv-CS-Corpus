Huddler: Convening Stable and Familiar Crowd Teams Despite Unpredictable Availability

Distributed, parallel crowd workers can accomplish simple tasks through workflows, but teams of collaborating crowd workers are necessary for complex goals. Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams - familiarity with other members - stands in contrast to crowd work's flexible, on-demand nature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to assemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time constraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for highly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first present a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd teams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar) teams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment wherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18 minutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term, team-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work.
