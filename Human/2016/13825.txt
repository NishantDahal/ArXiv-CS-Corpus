Compressive imaging using fast transform coding

We propose deterministic sampling strategies for compressive imaging based on Delsarte-Goethals frames. We show that these sampling strategies result in multi-scale measurements which can be related to the 2D Haar wavelet transform. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies through numerical experiments.
