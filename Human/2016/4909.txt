Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks: eICIC Approach

Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) are introduced by the 3GPP as an emerging technology to provide high network coverage and capacity. The HetNets are the combination of multilayer networks such as macrocell, small cell (picocell and femtocell) networks. In such networks, users may suffer significant cross-layer interference. To manage the interference the 3GPP has introduced Enhanced Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) techniques, Almost Blank SubFrame (ABSF) is one of the time-domain technique in the eICIC solutions. In this thesis, we propose a dynamically optimal ABSF framework to enhance the small cell user downlink performance while maintains the macro user downlink performance. We also study the mechanism to help the small cell base stations cooperate efficiently in order to reduce the mutual interference. Via numerical results, our proposed scheme achieves a significant performance and outperforms the existing ABSF frameworks in terms of user throughput and outage probability.
