Urban sidewalks: visualization and routing for individuals with limited mobility

People with limited mobility in the U.S. (defined as having difficulty or inability to walk a quarter of a mile without help and without the use of special equipment) face a growing informational gap: while pedestrian routing algorithms are getting faster and more informative, planning a route with a wheeled device in urban centers is very difficult due to lack of integrated pertinent information regarding accessibility along the route. Moreover, reducing access to street-spaces translates to reduced access to other public information and services that are increasingly made available to the public along urban streets. To adequately plan a commute, a traveler with limited or wheeled mobility must know whether her path may be blocked by construction, whether the sidewalk would be too steep or rendered unusable due to poor conditions, whether the street can be crossed or a highway is blocking the way, or whether there is a sidewalk at all. These details populate different datasets in many modern municipalities, but they are not immediately available in a convenient, integrated format to be useful to people with limited mobility. Our project, AccessMap, in its first phase (v.1) overlayed the information that is most relevant to people with limited mobility on a map, enabling self-planning of routes. Here, we describe the next phase of the project: synthesizing commonly available open data (including streets, sidewalks, curb ramps, elevation data, and construction permit information) to generate a graph of paths to enable variable cost-function accessible routing.
