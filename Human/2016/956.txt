Constacyclic and Quasi-Twisted Hermitian Self-Dual Codes over Finite Fields

Constacyclic and quasi-twisted Hermitian self-dual codes over finite fields are studied. An algorithm for factorizing $x^n-位$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ is given, where $位$ is a unit in $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. Based on this factorization, the dimensions of the Hermitian hulls of $位$-constacyclic codes of length $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ are determined. The characterization and enumeration of constacyclic Hermitian self-dual (resp., complementary dual) codes of length $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ are given through their Hermitian hulls. Subsequently, a new family of MDS constacyclic Hermitian self-dual codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ is introduced.
  As a generalization of constacyclic codes, quasi-twisted Hermitian self-dual codes are studied. Using the factorization of $x^n-位$ and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, quasi-twisted codes can be viewed as a product of linear codes of shorter length some over extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. Necessary and sufficient conditions for quasi-twisted codes to be Hermitian self-dual are given. The enumeration of such self-dual codes is determined as well.
