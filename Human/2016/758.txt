Design and implementation of a user interface for a multi-device spatially-aware mobile system

The aim of this thesis was the design and development of an interactive system enhancing collaborative sensemaking. The system design was based on related work research and preliminary user study. The system is based on multiple spatially-aware mobile devices. The spatial awareness is established with a motion tracking system. The information about position of tablets is received by a server. The server communicates with the devices and manages the content of each device. The implemented system supports managing the elements of information across the devices basing on their relative spatial arrangement. The evaluation of the system was done by a user study.
