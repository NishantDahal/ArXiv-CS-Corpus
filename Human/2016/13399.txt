Classical-Quantum Arbitrarily Varying Wiretap Channel: Ahlswede dichotomy, Positivity, Resources, Super Activation

We establish Ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels. This means that either the deterministic secrecy capacity of an arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channel is zero or it equals its randomness-assisted secrecy capacity. We analyze the secrecy capacity of arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels when the sender and the receiver use various resources. It turns out that having randomness, common randomness, and correlation as resources are very helpful for achieving a positive deterministic secrecy capacity of arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels. We prove the phenomenon super-activation for arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels, i.e., if we use two arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels, both with zero deterministic secrecy capacity together, they allow perfect secure transmission.
