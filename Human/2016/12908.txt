Read-Tuned STT-RAM and eDRAM Cache Hierarchies for Throughput and Energy Enhancement

As capacity and complexity of on-chip cache memory hierarchy increases, the service cost to the critical loads from Last Level Cache (LLC), which are frequently repeated, has become a major concern. The processor may stall for a considerable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache blocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide accelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this work concentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing SRAM-based L2 with Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) to accommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of reducing the overall read service time. Our proposed technique partitions L2 cache into two STT-RAM arrangements with different write performance and data retention time. The retention-relaxed STT-RAM arrays are utilized to effectively deal with the regular L2 cache requests while the high retention STT-RAM arrays in L2 are selected for maintaining repeatedly read accessed cache blocks from LLC by incurring negligible energy consumption for data retention. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce the mean L2 read miss ratio by 51.4% and increase the IPC by 11.7% on average across PARSEC benchmark suite while significantly decreasing the total L2 energy consumption compared to conventional SRAM-based L2 design.
