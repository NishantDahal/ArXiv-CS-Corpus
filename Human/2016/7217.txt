On the 5G Wireless Communications at the Low Terahertz Band

Initiation of fourth generation (4G) mobile telecommunication system rollouts fires the starting pistol for beyond 4G research activities. Whereas technologies enhancing spectral efficiency have traditionally been the solution to data rate and network capacity increase demands, due to the already advanced techniques, returns of the even more complicated algorithms hardly worth the complexity increase any longer. In addition, surging number of connected devices now enables operative use of short-range communication methods. Also considering the recently approved standards for the 60 gigahertz (GHz) industrial, scientific and medical radio band, in this paper the transmission windows around 300 GHz is proposed to be utilized for the fifth generation wireless communication systems. Motivations for the low end of the terahertz (THz) band are provided in accordance with market trends, and standardization activities in higher frequencies are listed. Unified mathematical expressions of the electromagnetic wave propagation mechanisms in the low-THz band are presented. THz band device technologies are outlined and a complete survey of the state-of-the-art low-THz band circuit blocks which are suitable for mass market production is given. Future research directions are specified before the conclusion of the paper.
