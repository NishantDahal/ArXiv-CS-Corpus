Waterdrop Stereo

This paper introduces depth estimation from water drops. The key idea is that a single water drop adhered to window glass is totally transparent and convex, and thus optically acts like a fisheye lens. If we have more than one water drop in a single image, then through each of them we can see the environment with different view points, similar to stereo. To realize this idea, we need to rectify every water drop imagery to make radially distorted planar surfaces look flat. For this rectification, we consider two physical properties of water drops: (1) A static water drop has constant volume, and its geometric convex shape is determined by the balance between the tension force and gravity. This implies that the 3D geometric shape can be obtained by minimizing the overall potential energy, which is the sum of the tension energy and the gravitational potential energy. (2) The imagery inside a water-drop is determined by the water-drop 3D shape and total reflection at the boundary. This total reflection generates a dark band commonly observed in any adherent water drops. Hence, once the 3D shape of water drops are recovered, we can rectify the water drop images through backward raytracing. Subsequently, we can compute depth using stereo. In addition to depth estimation, we can also apply image refocusing. Experiments on real images and a quantitative evaluation show the effectiveness of our proposed method. To our best knowledge, never before have adherent water drops been used to estimate depth.
