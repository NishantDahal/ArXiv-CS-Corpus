Classical and Quantum Algorithms for the Boolean Satisfiability Problem

This paper presents a complete algorithmic study of the decision Boolean Satisfiability Problem under the classical computation and quantum computation theories. The paper depicts deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, propositions of their properties and the main result is that the problem has not an efficient algorithm (NP is not P). Novel quantum algorithms and propositions depict that the complexity by quantum computation approach for solving the Boolean Satisfiability Problem or any NP problem is lineal time.
