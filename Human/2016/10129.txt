Two-Level Spatial Multiplexing using Hybrid Beamforming Antenna Arrays for mmWave Communications

In this work, we consider a two-level hierarchical MIMO antenna array system, where each antenna of the upper level is made up of a subarray on the lower one. The concept of spatial multiplexing is applied twice in this situation: Firstly, the spatial multiplexing of a Line-of-Sight (LoS) MIMO system is exploited. It is based on appropriate (sub-)array distances and achieves multiplexing gain due to phase differences among the signals at the receive (sub-)arrays. Secondly, one or more additional reflected paths of different angles (separated from the LoS path by different spatial beams at the subarrays) are used to exploit spatial multiplexing between paths.
  By exploiting the above two multiplexing kinds simultaneously, a high dimensional system with maximum spatial multiplexing is proposed by jointly using 'phase differences' within paths and 'angular differences' between paths. The system includes an advanced hybrid beamforming architecture with large subarray separation, which could occur in millimeter wave backhaul scenarios. The possible gains of the system w.r.t. a pure LOS MIMO system are illustrated by evaluating the capacities with total transmit power constraints.
