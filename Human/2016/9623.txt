Prime factorization using quantum annealing and computational algebraic geometry

We investigate prime factorization from two perspectives: quantum annealing and computational algebraic geometry, specifically Gr√∂bner bases. We present a novel scalable algorithm which combines the two approaches and leads to the factorization of all bi-primes up to just over $200 \, 000$, the largest number factored to date using a quantum processor.
