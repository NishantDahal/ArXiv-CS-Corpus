SimTensor: A synthetic tensor data generator

SimTensor is a multi-platform, open-source software for generating artificial tensor data (either with CP/PARAFAC or Tucker structure) for reproducible research on tensor factorization algorithms. SimTensor is a stand-alone application based on MATALB. It provides a wide range of facilities for generating tensor data with various configurations. It comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface, which enables the user to generate tensors with complicated settings in an easy way. It also has this facility to export generated data to universal formats such as CSV and HDF5, which can be imported via a wide range of programming languages (C, C++, Java, R, Fortran, MATLAB, Perl, Python, and many more). The most innovative part of SimTensor is this that can generate temporal tensors with periodic waves, seasonal effects and streaming structure. it can apply constraints such as non-negativity and different kinds of sparsity to the data. SimTensor also provides this facility to simulate different kinds of change-points and inject various types of anomalies. The source code and binary versions of SimTensor is available for download in http://www.simtensor.org.
