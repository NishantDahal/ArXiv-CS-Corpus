AptaTRACE: Elucidating Sequence-Structure Binding Motifs by Uncovering Selection Trends in HT-SELEX Experiments

Aptamers, short synthetic RNA/DNA molecules binding specific targets with high affinity and specificity, are utilized in an increasing spectrum of bio-medical applications. Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects binders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random ssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of selection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput sequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the field to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a billion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of identifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine binding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial solutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required for HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of the experimental procedure.
  We present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of sequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach leverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies sequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its unique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in only a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can help to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with the desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive procedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates that AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging data.
