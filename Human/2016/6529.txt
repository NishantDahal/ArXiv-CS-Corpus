End-to-End Known-Interference Cancellation (E2E-KIC) with Multi-Hop Interference

Recently, end-to-end known-interference cancellation (E2E-KIC) has been proposed as a promising technique for wireless networks. It sequentially cancels out the known interferences at each node so that wireless multi-hop transmission can achieve a similar throughput as single-hop transmission. Existing work on E2E-KIC assumed that the interference of a transmitter to those nodes outside the transmitter's communication range is negligible. In practice, however, this assumption is not always valid. There are many cases where a transmitter causes notable interference to nodes beyond its communication distance. From a wireless networking perspective, such interference is caused by a node to other nodes that are multiple hops away, thus we call it multi-hop interference. The presence of multi-hop interference poses fundamental challenges to E2E-KIC, where known procedures cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose an E2E-KIC approach which allows the existence of multi-hop interference. In particular, we present a method that iteratively cancels unknown interferences transmitted across multiple hops. We analyze mathematically why and when this approach works and the performance of it. The analysis is further supported by numerical results.
