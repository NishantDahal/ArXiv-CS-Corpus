DNA Image Pro -- A Tool for Generating Pixel Patterns using DNA Tile Assembly

Self-assembly is a process found everywhere in the Nature. In particular, it is known that DNA self-assembly is Turing universal. Thus one can do arbitrary computations or build nano-structures using DNA self-assembly. In order to understand the DNA self-assembly process, many mathematical models have been proposed in the literature. In particular, abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) received much attention. In this work, we investigate pixel pattern generation using aTAM. For a given image, a tile assembly system is given which can generate the image by self-assembly process. We also consider image blocks with specific cyclic pixel patterns (uniform shift and non uniform shift) self assembly. A software, DNA Image Pro, for generating pixel patterns using DNA tile assembly is also given.
