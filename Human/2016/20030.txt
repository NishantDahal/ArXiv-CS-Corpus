New Generation Value Networks for Content Delivery

In this paper we paint a broad picture of the Internet content delivery market, by taking into consideration both economical and technical challenges that might drive the interactions among the stakeholders in the future. We focus on a few disrupting factors, namely ubiquitous encryption, traffic boost, network scalability, latency needs and network control; and try to figure out whether the current model (CDN) is robust against their variation, which optimization can be envisioned and how the most accredited option (ICN) can be of help.
