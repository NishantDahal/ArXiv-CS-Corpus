Resource Allocation Optimization for Users with Different Levels of Service in Multicarrier Systems

We optimize the throughput of a single cell multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system with proportional data rate fairness among the users. The concept is to support mobile users with different levels of service. The optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is computationally very expensive. We propose a novel and efficient near-optimal solution adopting a two-phase optimization approach that separates the subcarrier and power allocation. In the first phase, we relax the strict proportional data rate requirements and employ an iterative subcarrier allocation approach that coarsely satisfies desired data rate proportionality constraints. In the second phase, we reallocate the power among the users in an iterative way to further enhance the adherence to the desired proportions by exploiting the normalized proportionality deviation measure. The simulation results show that the proposed solution exhibits very strong adherence to the desired proportional data rate fairness while achieving higher system throughput compared to the other existing solutions.
