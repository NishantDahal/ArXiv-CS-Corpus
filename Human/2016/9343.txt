Using Collaborative Visual Analytics for Innovative Industry-inspired Learning Activities

Inspired by the leading industry practices, this paper describes an innovative learning activity that combines data visualization and collaboration structured around sharing, co-creation and negotiation of departmental/disciplinary insights across data silos, using both internal and external data. This activity was designed within a much larger project aiming to translate practitioner stories and experiences in using visual analytics into educational scenarios and innovative industry-informed learning activities for students. In addition to giving students access to state-of-the-art tools for visualization (SAS-VA) and collaboration (Yammer), an even more important educational objective is to expose students to current industry practices with individual data-driven disciplinary insights no longer considered to sufficient when dealing with complex multi-disciplinary challenges. Starting from a data-informed business scenario, the paper describes the main steps of our innovative data visualisation and collaboration activity, discusses possible alternative software platforms and offers some ideas for the future work.
