Composing applications with OntoCompo

In this paper, we present an ontology-based approach to compose applications while preserving their former look. Our composition process relies on the manipulation of User Interfaces (UI) and on several ontologies describing relationships between tasks, UI and Functionalities. Our tool, called OntoCompo, supports compositions realized by the developer thanks to the selection, extraction and positioning of UI elements to constitute the newapplication.
