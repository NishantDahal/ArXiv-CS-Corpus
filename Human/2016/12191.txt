Dual User Selection for Security Enhancement in Uplink Multiuser Systems

This letter proposes a novel dual user selection scheme for uplink transmission with multiple users, where a jamming user and a served user are jointly selected to improve the secrecy performance. Specifically, the jamming user transmits jamming signal with a certain rate, so that the base station (BS) can decode the jamming signal before detecting the secret information signal. By carefully selecting the jamming user and the served user, it makes the eavesdropper decode the jamming signal with a low probability meanwhile the BS can achieve a high receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, the uplink transmission achieves the dual secrecy improvement by jamming and scheduling. It is shown that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the security of the uplink transmission.
