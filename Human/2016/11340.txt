Design and Analysis of Optimal Threshold Offloading (OTO) Algorithm for LTE Femtocell/Macrocell Networks

LTE femtocells have been widely deployed to increase network capacity and to offload mobile data traffic from macrocells. While cellular users' mobility behaviors are taken into consideration, a dilemma is formed: Should a User Equipment (UE) either handover into a femtocell or keep the current connection with a macrocell? Indeed, various user mobility behaviors may incur significant signaling overhead and degrade femtocell offloading capability due to frequent handover in/out femtocells. To address this dilemma, in this paper we propose an Optimal Threshold Offloading (OTO) algorithm considering the tradeoff between the signaling overhead and femtocell offloading capability. We develop an analytical model and define two performance metrics to quantify the tradeoff. The proposed model not only models user mobility behaviors but also captures femtocell offloading benefits, and shed light on their fundamental relationship. The correctness of analytical model and simulation model are cross-validated by extensive ns2 simulations. Both analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the OTO algorithm can significantly reduce signaling overhead at the minor cost of femtocell offloading capability. The results enable wide applicability in various scenarios, and therefore, have important theoretical significance. Moreover, the analytical results provide a quick way to evaluate signaling overhead and offloading capability in LTE networks without wide deployment, saving on cost and time.
