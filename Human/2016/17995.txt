Proceedings of the Workshop on Brain Analysis using COnnectivity Networks - BACON 2016

Understanding brain connectivity in a network-theoretic context has shown much promise in recent years. This type of analysis identifies brain organisational principles, bringing a new perspective to neuroscience. At the same time, large public databases of connectomic data are now available. However, connectome analysis is still an emerging field and there is a crucial need for robust computational methods to fully unravelits potential. This workshop provides a platform to discuss the development of new analytic techniques; methods for evaluating and validating commonly used approaches; as well as the effects of variations in pre-processing steps.
