Generalized LR parsing and the shuffle operator

We adapt Tomita's Generalized LR algorithm to languages generated by context-free grammars enriched with a shuffle operator. The change involves extensions to the underlying handle-finding finite automaton, construction of parser tables, and the necessary optimizations in constructing a deterministic parser. Our system is motivated by an application from artificial intelligence plan recognition. We argue for the correctness of the system, and discuss future extensions of this work.
