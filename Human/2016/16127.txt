Multi-Message Broadcast in Dynamic Radio Networks

We continue the recent line of research studying information dissemination problems in adversarial dynamic radio networks. We give two generic algorithms which allow to transform generalized version of single-message broadcast algorithms into multi-message broadcast algorithms. Based on these generic algorithms, we obtain multi-message broadcast algorithms for dynamic radio networks for a number of different dynamic network settings. For one of the modeling assumptions, our algorithms are complemented by a lower bound which shows that the upper bound is close to optimal.
