Radio Tomography for Roadside Surveillance

Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) has recently been proposed for tracking object location via radio waves without requiring the objects to transmit or receive radio signals. The position is extracted by inferring which voxels are obstructing a subset of radio links in a dense wireless sensor network. This paper proposes a variety of modeling and algorithmic improvements to RTI for the scenario of roadside surveillance. These include the use of a more physically motivated weight matrix, a method for mitigating negative (aphysical) data due to noisy observations, and a method for combining frames of a moving vehicle into a single image. The proposed approaches are used to show improvement in both imaging (useful for human-in-the-loop target recognition) and automatic target recognition in a measured data set.
