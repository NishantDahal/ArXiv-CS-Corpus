Technical Report : ContikiMAC vs X-MAC performance analysis

This paper try to better understand the performance of ContikiMAC compared to X-MAC. ContikiMAC achieves a transmission by repeatedly transmitting a data packet until the reception of an ACK from the destination. While X-MAC uses a stream of small size strobes to advertise the destination of the incoming transmission. A priori, X-MAC is then less bandwidth consumptive. To better understand the efficiency of ContikiMAC, despite an intuitively more consumptive transmitting procedure, we have compared this protocol to an updated version of X-MAC which has been designed with the goal to obtain a more objective comparison. At our best knowledge, this kind of "objective" and detailed analysis has never been produced. Both protocols performances are evaluated in terms of number of retransmissions, latency, packet delivery ratio (PDR) and duty-cycle. Our study reveals that the combination of the fast-sleep optimization shortening the wake-up period with a transmission procedure more efficient helps ContikiMAC to obtain a better PDR at the cost of a reduced latency and energy consumption.
