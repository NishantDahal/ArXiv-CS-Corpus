Toward the Hanani-Tutte Theorem for Clustered Graphs

The weak variant of Hanani-Tutte theorem says that a graph is planar, if it can be drawn in the plane so that every pair of edges cross an even number of times. Moreover, we can turn such a drawing into an embedding without changing the order in which edges leave the vertices. We prove a generalization of the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem that also easily implies the monotone variant of the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem by Pach and TÃ³th. Thus, our result can be thought of as a common generalization of these two neat results. In other words, we prove the weak Hanani-Tutte theorem for strip clustered graphs, whose clusters are linearly ordered vertical strips in the plane and edges join only vertices in the same cluster or in neighboring clusters with respect to this order. In order to prove our main result we first obtain a forbidden substructure characterization of embedded strip clustered planar graphs.
  The Hanani-Tutte theorem says that a graph is planar, if it can be drawn in the plane so that every pair of edges not sharing a vertex cross an even number of times. We prove the variant of Hanani-Tutte theorem for strip clustered graphs if the underlying abstract graph is three connected or a tree. In the case of trees our result implies that c-planarity for flat clustered graphs with three clusters is solvable in a polynomial time if the underlying abstract graph is a tree. The proof of the latter result combines our forbidden substructure characterization of embedded strip clustered planar graphs with Tucker's characterization of 0-1 matrices with consecutive ones property.
