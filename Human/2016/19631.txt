Comments on Improving Transferability Between Different Engineering Stages in the Development of Automated Material Flow Modules

In the paper by D. Regulin et al. (IEEE Trans. On Automation Science and Engineering, vol. 13, no. 4, 1422-1432, October 2016) authors claim that they present a meta-model for the modeling of the Automated Material Flow Module (aMFM) and a model-driven design approach for aMFMs. In this letter we comment on the presented meta-model and the proposed model-driven approach regarding their potential for exploitation. We present specific arguments and make cases that call the authors design decision into question.
