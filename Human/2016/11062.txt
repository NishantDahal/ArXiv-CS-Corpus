Identity of King and Flajolet & al. Formulae for LRU Miss Rate Exact Computation

This short paper gives a detailed proof of identity between two classic formulas for the computation of the exact Miss Rate of LRU caches. An extension to the identity of two formulas of the expected time of a partial collection in the coupon collector problem is also presented.
