Locally Served Network Computers

NCs are the natural evolution of PCs, ubiquitous computers everywhere. The current vision of NCs requires two improbable developments: (1) inexpensive high-bandwidth WAN links to the Internet, and (2) inexpensive centralized servers. The large NC bandwidth requirements will force each home or office to have a local server LAN attached to the NCs. These servers will be much less expensive to purchase and manage than a centralized solution. Centralized staff are expensive and unresponsive.
