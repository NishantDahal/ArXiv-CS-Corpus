Spotting Prosodic Boundaries in Continuous Speech in French

A radio speech corpus of 9mn has been prosodically marked by a phonetician expert, and non expert listeners. this corpus is large enough to train and test an automatic boundary spotting system, namely a time delay neural network fed with F0 values, vowels and pseudo-syllable durations. Results validate both prosodic marking and automatic spotting of prosodic events.
