Segregatory Coordination and Ellipsis in Text Generation

In this paper, we provide an account of how to generate sentences with coordination constructions from clause-sized semantic representations. An algorithm is developed to generate sentences with ellipsis, gapping, right-node-raising, and non-constituent coordination constructions. Various examples from linguistic literature will be used to demonstrate that the algorithm does its job well.
