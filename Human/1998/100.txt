A Generalized Quantifier Concept in Computational Complexity Theory

A notion of generalized quantifier in computational complexity theory is explored and used to give a unified treatment of leaf language definability, oracle separations, type 2 operators, and circuits with monoidal gates. Relations to Lindstroem quantifiers are pointed out.
