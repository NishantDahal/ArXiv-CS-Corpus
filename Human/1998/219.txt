An Offline Partial Evaluator for Evolving Algebras

We describe the architecture of an evolving algebra partial evaluator, a program which specializes an evolving algebra with respect to a portion of its input. We discuss the particular analysis, specialization, and optimization techniques used and show an example of its use.
