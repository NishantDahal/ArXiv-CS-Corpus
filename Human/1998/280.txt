Making the most of electronic journals

As most electronic journals available today have been derived from print originals, print journals have become a vital element in the broad development of electronic journals publishing. Further dependence on the print publishing model, however, will be a constraint on the continuing development of e-journals, and a series of conflicts are likely to arise. Making the most of e-journals requires that a distinctive new publishing model is developed. We consider some of the issues that will be fundamental in this new model, starting with user motivations and some reported publisher experiences, both of which suggest a broadening desire for comprehensive linked archives. This leads in turn to questions about the impact of rights assignment by authors, in particular the common practice of giving exlusive rights to publishers for individual works. Some non-prescriptive solutions are suggested, and four steps towards optimum e-journals are proposed.
