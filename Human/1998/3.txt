A General, Sound and Efficient Natural Language Parsing Algorithm based on Syntactic Constraints Propagation

This paper presents a new context-free parsing algorithm based on a bidirectional strictly horizontal strategy which incorporates strong top-down predictions (derivations and adjacencies). From a functional point of view, the parser is able to propagate syntactic constraints reducing parsing ambiguity.
  From a computational perspective, the algorithm includes different techniques aimed at the improvement of the manipulation and representation of the structures used.
