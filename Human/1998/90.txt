Genetic Algorithm for SU(2) Gauge Theory on a 2-dimensional Lattice

An algorithm is proposed for the simulation of pure SU(N) lattice gauge theories based on Genetic Algorithms(GAs). We apply GAs to SU(2) pure gauge theory on a 2 dimensional lattice and show the results, the action per plaquette and Wilson loops, are consistent with those by Metropolis method(MP)s and Heatbath method(HB)s. Thermalization speed of GAs is especially faster than the simple MPs.
