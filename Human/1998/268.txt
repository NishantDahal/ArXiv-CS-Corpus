Writing and Editing Complexity Theory: Tales and Tools

Each researcher should have a full shelf---physical or virtual---of books on writing and editing prose. Though we make no claim to any special degree of expertise, we recently edited a book of complexity theory surveys (Complexity Theory Retrospective II, Springer-Verlag, 1997), and in doing so we were brought into particularly close contact with the subject of this article, and with a number of the excellent resources available to writers and editors. In this article, we list some of these resources, and we also relate some of the adventures we had as our book moved from concept to reality.
