Pre-fetching tree-structured data in distributed memory

A distributed heap storage manager has been implemented on the Fujitsu AP1000 multicomputer. The performance of various pre-fetching strategies is experimentally compared. Subjective programming benefits and objective performance benefits of up to 10% in pre-fetching are found for certain applications, but not for all. The performance benefits of pre-fetching depend on the specific data structure and access patterns. We suggest that control of pre-fetching strategy be dynamically under the control of the application.
