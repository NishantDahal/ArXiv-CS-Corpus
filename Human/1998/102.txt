Improving Tagging Performance by Using Voting Taggers

We present a bootstrapping method to develop an annotated corpus, which is specially useful for languages with few available resources. The method is being applied to develop a corpus of Spanish of over 5Mw. The method consists on taking advantage of the collaboration of two different POS taggers. The cases in which both taggers agree present a higher accuracy and are used to retrain the taggers.
