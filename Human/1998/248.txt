A Human - machine interface for teleoperation of arm manipulators in a complex environment

This paper discusses the feasibility of using configuration space (C-space) as a means of visualization and control in operator-guided real-time motion of a robot arm manipulator. The motivation is to improve performance of the human operator in tasks involving the manipulator motion in an environment with obstacles. Unlike some other motion planning tasks, operators are known to make expensive mistakes in such tasks, even in a simpler two-dimensional case. They have difficulty learning better procedures and their performance improves very little with practice. Using an example of a two-dimensional arm manipulator, we show that translating the problem into C-space improves the operator performance rather remarkably, on the order of magnitude compared to the usual work space control. An interface that makes the transfer possible is described, and an example of its use in a virtual environment is shown.
