The Computing Research Repository: Promoting the Rapid Dissemination and Archiving of Computer Science Research

We describe the Computing Research Repository (CoRR), a new electronic archive for rapid dissemination and archiving of computer science research results. CoRR was initiated in September 1998 through the cooperation of ACM, LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) e-Print archive, and NCSTRL (Networked Computer Science Technical Research Library. Through its implementation of the Dienst protocol, CoRR combines the open and extensible architecture of NCSTRL with the reliable access and well-established management practices of the LANL XXX e-Print repository. This architecture will allow integration with other e-Print archives and provides a foundation for a future broad-based scholarly digital library. We describe the decisions that were made in creating CoRR, the architecture of the CoRR/NCSTRL interoperation, and issues that have arisen during the operation of CoRR.
