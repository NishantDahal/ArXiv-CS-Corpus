Distributed Computation, the Twisted Isomorphism, and Auto-Poiesis

This paper presents a synchronization-based, multi-process computational model of anticipatory systems called the Phase Web. It describes a self-organizing paradigm that explicitly recognizes and exploits the existence of a boundary between inside and outside, accepts and exploits intentionality, and uses explicit self-reference to describe eg. auto-poiesis. The model explicitly connects computation to a discrete Clifford algebraic formalization that is in turn extended into homology and co-homology, wherein the recursive nature of objects and boundaries becomes apparent and itself subject to hierarchical recursion. Topsy, a computer program embodying the Phase Web, is available at www.cs.auc.dk/topsy.
