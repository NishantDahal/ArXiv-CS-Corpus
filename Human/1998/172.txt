A Definition of General Weighted Fairness and its Support in Explicit Rate Switch Algorithms

In this paper we give a general definition of weighted fairness and show how this can achieve various fairness definitions, such as those mentioned in the ATM Forum TM 4.0 Specifications. We discuss how a pricing policy can be mapped to general weighted (GW) fairness. The GW fairness can be achieved by calculating the $ExcessFairshare$ (weighted fairshare of the left over bandwidth) for each VC. We show how a switch algorithm can be modified to support the GW fairness by using the $ExcessFairshare$. We use ERICA+ as an example switch algorithm and show how it can be modified to achieve the general fairness. Simulations results are presented to demonstrate that the modified switch algorithm achieves GW fairness. An analytical proof for convergence of the modified ERICA+ algorithm is given in the appendix.
