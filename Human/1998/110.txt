Hyper-Systolic Matrix Multiplication

A novel parallel algorithm for matrix multiplication is presented. The hyper-systolic algorithm makes use of a one-dimensional processor abstraction. The procedure can be implemented on all types of parallel systems. It can handle matrix-vector multiplications as well as transposed matrix products.
