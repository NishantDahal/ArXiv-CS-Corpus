Document Archiving, Replication and Migration Container for Mobile Web Users

With the increasing use of mobile workstations for a wide variety of tasks and associated information needs, and with many variations of available networks, access to data becomes a prime consideration. This paper discusses issues of workstation mobility and proposes a solution wherein the data structures are accessed in an encapsulated form - through the Portable File System (PFS) wrapper. The paper discusses an implementation of the Portable File System, highlighting the architecture and commenting upon performance of an experimental system. Although investigations have been focused upon mobile access of WWW documents, this technique could be applied to any mobile data access situation.
