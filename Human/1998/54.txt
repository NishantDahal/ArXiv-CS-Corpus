A Linguistically Interpreted Corpus of German Newspaper Text

In this paper, we report on the development of an annotation scheme and annotation tools for unrestricted German text. Our representation format is based on argument structure, but also permits the extraction of other kinds of representations. We discuss several methodological issues and the analysis of some phenomena. Additional focus is on the tools developed in our project and their applications.
