Effect of CSMA/CD on Self-Similarity of Network Traffic

It is now well known that Internet traffic exhibits self-similarity, which cannot be described by traditional Markovian models such as the Poisson process. The causes of self-similarity of network traffic must be identified because understanding the nature of network traffic is critical in order to properly design and implement computer networks and network services like the World Wide Web. While some researchers have argued self similarity is generated by the typical applications or caused by Transport layer Protocols, it is also possible that the CSMA/CD protocol may cause or at least contribute to this phenomenon. In this paper, we use NS simulator to study the effect of CSMA/CD Exponential Backoff retransmission algorithm on Traffic Self similarity.
