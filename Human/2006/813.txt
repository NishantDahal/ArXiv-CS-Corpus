Enterprise Content Management: Theory and Engineering for Entire Lifecycle Support

The paper considers enterprise content management (ECM) issues in global heterogeneous distributed computational environment. Present-day enterprises have accumulated a huge data burden. Manipulating with such a bulk becomes an essential problem, particularly due to its global distribution, heterogeneous and weak-structured character. The conceptual approach to integrated ECM lifecycle support is presented, including overview of formal models, software development methodology and innovative software development tools. Implementation results proved shortening terms and reducing costs of implementation compared to commercial software available.
