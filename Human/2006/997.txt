A Study on Learnability for Rigid Lambek Grammars

We present basic notions of Gold's "learnability in the limit" paradigm, first presented in 1967, a formalization of the cognitive process by which a native speaker gets to grasp the underlying grammar of his/her own native language by being exposed to well formed sentences generated by that grammar. Then we present Lambek grammars, a formalism issued from categorial grammars which, although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural languages, is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface between syntax and semantics. In the last part of this work, we present a learnability result for Rigid Lambek grammars from structured examples.
