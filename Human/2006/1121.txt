A comparative analysis of the geometrical surface texture of a real and virtual model of a tooth flank of a cylindrical gear

The paper presents the methodology of modelling tooth flanks of cylindrical gears in the Cad environment. The modelling consists in a computer simulation of gear generation. A model of tooth flanks is an envelope curve of a family of envelopes that originate from the rolling motion of a solid tool model in relation to a solid model of the cylindrical gear. The surface stereometry and topography of the tooth flanks, hobbed and chiselled by Fellows method, are compared to their numerical models. Metrological measurements of the real gears were carried out using a coordinated measuring machine and a two - and a three-dimensional profilometer. A computer simulation of the gear generation was performed in the Mechanical Desktop environment.
