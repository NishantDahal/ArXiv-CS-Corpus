Semantics of Separation-Logic Typing and Higher-order Frame Rules for<br> Algol-like Languages

We show how to give a coherent semantics to programs that are well-specified in a version of separation logic for a language with higher types: idealized algol extended with heaps (but with immutable stack variables). In particular, we provide simple sound rules for deriving higher-order frame rules, allowing for local reasoning.
