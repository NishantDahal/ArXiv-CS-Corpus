Ideas by Statistical Mechanics (ISM)

Ideas by Statistical Mechanics (ISM) is a generic program to model evolution and propagation of ideas/patterns throughout populations subjected to endogenous and exogenous interactions. The program is based on the author's work in Statistical Mechanics of Neocortical Interactions (SMNI), and uses the author's Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) code for optimizations of training sets, as well as for importance-sampling to apply the author's copula financial risk-management codes, Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD), for assessments of risk and uncertainty. This product can be used for decision support for projects ranging from diplomatic, information, military, and economic (DIME) factors of propagation/evolution of ideas, to commercial sales, trading indicators across sectors of financial markets, advertising and political campaigns, etc. A statistical mechanical model of neocortical interactions, developed by the author and tested successfully in describing short-term memory and EEG indicators, is the proposed model. Parameters with a given subset of macrocolumns will be fit using ASA to patterns representing ideas. Parameters of external and inter-regional interactions will be determined that promote or inhibit the spread of these ideas. Tools of financial risk management, developed by the author to process correlated multivariate systems with differing non-Gaussian distributions using modern copula analysis, importance-sampled using ASA, will enable bona fide correlations and uncertainties of success and failure to be calculated. Marginal distributions will be evolved to determine their expected duration and stability using algorithms developed by the author, i.e., PATHTREE and PATHINT codes.
