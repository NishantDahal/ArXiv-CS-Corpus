First Steps in Relational Lattice

Relational lattice reduces the set of six classic relational algebra operators to two binary lattice operations: natural join and inner union. We give an introduction to this theory with emphasis on formal algebraic laws. New results include Spight distributivity criteria and its applications to query transformations.
