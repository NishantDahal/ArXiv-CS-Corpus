List Decoding of Hermitian Codes using Groebner Bases

List decoding of Hermitian codes is reformulated to allow an efficient and simple algorithm for the interpolation step. The algorithm is developed using the theory of Groebner bases of modules. The computational complexity of the algorithm seems comparable to previously known algorithms achieving the same task, and the algorithm is better suited for hardware implementation.
