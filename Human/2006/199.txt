Using Domain Knowledge in Evolutionary System Identification

Two example of Evolutionary System Identification are presented to highlight the importance of incorporating Domain Knowledge: the discovery of an analytical indentation law in Structural Mechanics using constrained Genetic Programming, and the identification of the repartition of underground velocities in Seismic Prospection. Critical issues for sucessful ESI are discussed in the light of these results.
