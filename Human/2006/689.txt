On computing fixpoints in well-structured regular model checking, with applications to lossy channel systems

We prove a general finite convergence theorem for "upward-guarded" fixpoint expressions over a well-quasi-ordered set. This has immediate applications in regular model checking of well-structured systems, where a main issue is the eventual convergence of fixpoint computations. In particular, we are able to directly obtain several new decidability results on lossy channel systems.
