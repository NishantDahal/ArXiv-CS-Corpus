Analog Codes on Graphs

We consider the problem of transmission of a sequence of real data produced by a Nyquist sampled band-limited analog source over a band-limited analog channel, which introduces an additive white Gaussian noise. An analog coding scheme is described, which can achieve a mean-squared error distortion proportional to $(1+SNR)^{-B}$ for a bandwidth expansion factor of $B/R$, where $0 < R < 1$ is the rate of individual component binary codes used in the construction and $B \geq 1$ is an integer. Thus, over a wide range of SNR values, the proposed code performs much better than any single previously known analog coding system.
