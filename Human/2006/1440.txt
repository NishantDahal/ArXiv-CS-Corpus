HowTo Authenticate and Encrypt

Recently, various side-channel attacks on widely used encryption methods have been discovered. Extensive research is currently undertaken to develop new types of combined encryption and authentication mechanisms.

We explain the nature of the attacks and how they can be avoided, and recommend a sound, provably secure solution: the CCM standard.
