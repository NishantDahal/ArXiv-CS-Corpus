Open at the Top; Open at the Bottom; and Continually (but Slowly) Evolving

Systems of systems differ from traditional systems in that they are open at the top, open at the bottom, and continually (but slowly) evolving. "Open at the top" means that there is no pre-defined top level application. New applications may be created at any time. "Open at the bottom" means that the system primitives are defined functionally rather than concretely. This allows the implementation of these primitives to be modified as technology changes. "Continually (but slowly) evolving" means that the system's functionality is stable enough to be useful but is understood to be subject to modification. Systems with these properties tend to be environments within which other systems operate--and hence are systems of systems. It is also important to understand the larger environment within which a system of systems exists.
