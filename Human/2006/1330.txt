Why did the accident happen? A norm-based reasoning approach

In this paper we describe an architecture of a system that answer the question : Why did the accident happen? from the textual description of an accident. We present briefly the different parts of the architecture and then we describe with more detail the semantic part of the system i.e. the part in which the norm-based reasoning is performed on the explicit knowlege extracted from the text.
