Duality of Fix-Points for Distributive Lattices

We present a novel algorithm for calculating fix-points. The algorithm calculates fix-points of an endo-function f on a distributive lattice, by performing reachability computation a graph derived from the dual of f; this is in comparison to traditional algorithms that are based on iterated application of f until a fix-point is reached.
