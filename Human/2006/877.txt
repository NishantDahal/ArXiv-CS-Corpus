Set-Theoretic Preliminaries for Computer Scientists

The basics of set theory are usually copied, directly or indirectly, by computer scientists from introductions to mathematical texts. Often mathematicians are content with special cases when the general case is of no mathematical interest. But sometimes what is of no mathematical interest is of great practical interest in computer science. For example, non-binary relations in mathematics tend to have numerical indexes and tend to be unsorted. In the theory and practice of relational databases both these simplifications are unwarranted. In response to this situation we present here an alternative to the ``set-theoretic preliminaries'' usually found in computer science texts. This paper separates binary relations from the kind of relations that are needed in relational databases. Its treatment of functions supports both computer science in general and the kind of relations needed in databases. As a sample application this paper shows how the mathematical theory of relations naturally leads to the relational data model and how the operations on relations are by themselves already a powerful vehicle for queries.
