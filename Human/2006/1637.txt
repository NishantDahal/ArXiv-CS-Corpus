The Importance of the Algorithmic Information Theory to Construct a Possible Example Where NP # P - II: An Irreducible Sentence

In this short communication it is discussed the relation between disentangled states and algorithmic information theory aiming to construct an irreducible sentence whose length increases in a non-polynomial way when the number of qubits increases.
