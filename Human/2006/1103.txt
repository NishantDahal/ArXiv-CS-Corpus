Algebraic recognizability of languages

Recognizable languages of finite words are part of every computer science cursus, and they are routinely described as a cornerstone for applications and for theory. We would like to briefly explore why that is, and how this word-related notion extends to more complex models, such as those developed for modeling distributed or timed behaviors.
