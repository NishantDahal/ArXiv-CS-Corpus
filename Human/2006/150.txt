Digital Libraries: From Process Modelling to Grid-based Service Oriented Architecture

Graphical Business Process Modelling Languages (BPML) like Role Activity Diagrams (RAD) provide ease and flexibility for modelling business behaviour. However, these languages show limited applicability in terms of enactment over distributed systems paradigms like Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based grid computing. This paper investigates RAD modelling of a Scientific Publishing Process (SPP) for Digital Libraries (DL) and tries to determine the suitability of Pi-Calculus based formal approaches to enact SOA based grid computing. In order to achieve this purpose, the Pi-Calculus based formal transformation from a RAD model of SPP for DL draws attention towards a number of challenging issues including issues that require particular design considerations for appropriate enactment in a SOA based grid system.
