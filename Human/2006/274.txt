A New Reversible TSG Gate and Its Application For Designing Efficient Adder Circuits

In the recent years, reversible logic has emerged as a promising technology having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. The classical set of gates such as AND, OR, and EXOR are not reversible. This paper proposes a new 4 * 4 reversible gate called TSG gate. The proposed gate is used to design efficient adder units. The most significant aspect of the proposed gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder i.e reversible full adder can now be implemented with a single gate only. The proposed gate is then used to design reversible ripple carry and carry skip adders. It is demonstrated that the adder architectures designed using the proposed gate are much better and optimized, compared to their existing counterparts in literature; in terms of number of reversible gates and garbage outputs. Thus, this paper provides the initial threshold to building of more complex system which can execute more complicated operations using reversible logic.
