Direct and dual laws for automata with multiplicities

We present here theoretical results coming from the implementation of the package called AMULT (automata with multiplicities in several noncommutative variables). We show that classical formulas are ``almost every time'' optimal, characterize the dual laws preserving rationality and also relators that are compatible with these laws.
