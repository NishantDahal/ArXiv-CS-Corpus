Survey propagation for the cascading Sourlas code

We investigate how insights from statistical physics, namely survey propagation, can improve decoding of a particular class of sparse error correcting codes. We show that a recently proposed algorithm, time averaged belief propagation, is in fact intimately linked to a specific survey propagation for which Parisi's replica symmetry breaking parameter is set to zero, and that the latter is always superior to belief propagation in the high connectivity limit. We briefly look at further improvements available by going to the second level of replica symmetry breaking.
