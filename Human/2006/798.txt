A Foundation to Perception Computing, Logic and Automata

In this report, a novel approach to intelligence and learning is introduced, this approach is based on what we call 'perception logic'. Based on this logic, a computing mechanism and automata are introduced. Multi-resolution analysis of perceptual information is given, in which learning is accomplished in at most O(log(N))epochs, where N is the number of samples, and the convergence is guarnteed. This approach combines the favors of computational modeles in the sense that they are structured and mathematically well-defined, and the adaptivity of soft computing approaches, in addition to the continuity and real-time response of dynamical systems.
