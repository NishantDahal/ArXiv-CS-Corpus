Evolutionary Socioeconomics: a Schumpeterian Computer Simulation

The following note contains a computer simulation concerning the struggle between two companies: the first one is "the biggest zaibatsu of all", while the second one is "small, fast, ruthless". The model is based on a neo-Schumpeterian framework operating in a Darwinian evolutionary environment. After running the program a large number of times, two characteristics stand out: -- There is always a winner which takes it all, while the loser disappears. -- The key to success is the ability to employ efficiently the technological innovations. The topic of the present paper is strictly related with the content of the following notes: Michele Tucci, Evolution and Gravitation: a Computer Simulation of a Non-Walrasian Equilibrium Model; Michele Tucci, Oligopolistic Competition in an Evolutionary Environment: a Computer Simulation.
