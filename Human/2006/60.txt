CAGD - Computer Aided Gripper Design for a Flexible Gripping System

This paper is a summary of the recently accomplished research work on flexible gripping systems. The goal is to develop a gripper which can be used for a great amount of geometrically variant workpieces. The economic aspect is of particular importance during the whole development. The high flexibility of the gripper is obtained by three parallel used principles. These are human and computer based analysis of the gripping object as well as mechanical adaptation of the gripper to the object with the help of servo motors. The focus is on the gripping of free-form surfaces with suction cup.
