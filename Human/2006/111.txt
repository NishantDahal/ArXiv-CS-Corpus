Pbit and other list sorting algorithms

Pbit, besides its simplicity, is definitely the fastest list sorting algorithm. It considerably surpasses all already known methods. Among many advantages, it is stable, linear and be made to run in place. I will compare Pbit with algorithm described by Donald E. Knuth in the third volume of ''The Art of Computer Programming'' and other (QuickerSort, MergeSort) list sorting algorithms.
