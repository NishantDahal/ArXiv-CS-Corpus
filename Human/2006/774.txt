Content Based Image Retrieval with Mobile Agents and Steganography

In this paper we present an image retrieval system based on Gabor texture features, steganography, and mobile agents.. By employing the information hiding technique, the image attributes can be hidden in an image without degrading the image quality. Thus the image retrieval process becomes simple. Java based mobile agents manage the query phase of the system. Based on the simulation results, the proposed system not only shows the efficiency in hiding the attributes but also provides other advantages such as: (1) fast transmission of the retrieval image to the receiver, (2) searching made easy.
