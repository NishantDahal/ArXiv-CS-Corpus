A Chaotic Cipher Mmohocc and Its Randomness Evaluation

After a brief introduction to a new chaotic stream cipher Mmohocc which utilizes the fundamental chaos characteristics of mixing, unpredictability, and sensitivity to initial conditions, we conducted the randomness statistical tests against the keystreams generated by the cipher. Two batteries of most stringent randomness tests, namely the NIST Suite and the Diehard Suite, were performed. The results showed that the keystreams have successfully passed all the statistical tests. We conclude that Mmohocc can generate high-quality pseudorandom numbers from a statistical point of view.
