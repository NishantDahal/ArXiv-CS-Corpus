ECA-LP / ECA-RuleML: A Homogeneous Event-Condition-Action Logic Programming Language

Event-driven reactive functionalities are an urgent need in nowadays distributed service-oriented applications and (Semantic) Web-based environments. An important problem to be addressed is how to correctly and efficiently capture and process the event-based behavioral, reactive logic represented as ECA rules in combination with other conditional decision logic which is represented as derivation rules. In this paper we elaborate on a homogeneous integration approach which combines derivation rules, reaction rules (ECA rules) and other rule types such as integrity constraint into the general framework of logic programming. The developed ECA-LP language provides expressive features such as ID-based updates with support for external and self-updates of the intensional and extensional knowledge, transac-tions including integrity testing and an event algebra to define and process complex events and actions based on a novel interval-based Event Calculus variant.
