Vector field visualization with streamlines

We have recently developed an algorithm for vector field visualization with oriented streamlines, able to depict the flow directions everywhere in a dense vector field and the sense of the local orientations. The algorithm has useful applications in the visualization of the director field in nematic liquid crystals. Here we propose an improvement of the algorithm able to enhance the visualization of the local magnitude of the field. This new approach of the algorithm is compared with the same procedure applied to the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) visualization.
