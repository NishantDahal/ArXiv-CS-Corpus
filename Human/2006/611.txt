Toward a Collection-based Metadata Maintenance Model

In this paper, the authors identify key entities and relationships in the operational management of metadata catalogs that describe digital collections, and they draft a data model to support the administration of metadata maintenance for collections. Further, they consider this proposed model in light of other data schemes to which it relates and discuss the implications of the model for library metadata maintenance operations.
