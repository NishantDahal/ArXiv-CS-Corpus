On Orthogonalities in Matrices

In this paper we have discussed different possible orthogonalities in matrices, namely orthogonal, quasi-orthogonal, semi-orthogonal and non-orthogonal matrices including completely positive matrices, while giving some of their constructions besides studying some of their properties.
