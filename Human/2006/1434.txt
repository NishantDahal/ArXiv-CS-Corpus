Formalising Sylow's theorems in Coq

This report presents a formalisation of Sylow's theorems done in {\sc Coq}. The formalisation has been done in a couple of weeks on top of Georges Gonthier's {\sc ssreflect} \cite{ssreflect}. There were two ideas behind formalising Sylow's theorems. The first one was to get familiar with Georges way of doing proofs. The second one was to contribute to the collective effort to formalise a large subset of group theory in {\sc Coq} with some non-trivial proofs.}
