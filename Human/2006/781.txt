Architecture of an Open-Sourced, Extensible Data Warehouse Builder: InterBase 6 Data Warehouse Builder (IB-DWB)

We report the development of an open-sourced data warehouse builder, InterBase Data Warehouse Builder (IB-DWB), based on Borland InterBase 6 Open Edition Database Server. InterBase 6 is used for its low maintenance and small footprint. IB-DWB is designed modularly and consists of 5 main components, Data Plug Platform, Discoverer Platform, Multi-Dimensional Cube Builder, and Query Supporter, bounded together by a Kernel. It is also an extensible system, made possible by the Data Plug Platform and the Discoverer Platform. Currently, extensions are only possible via dynamic linked-libraries (DLLs). Multi-Dimensional Cube Builder represents a basal mean of data aggregation. The architectural philosophy of IB-DWB centers around providing a base platform that is extensible, which is functionally supported by expansion modules. IB-DWB is currently being hosted by sourceforge.net (Project Unix Name: ib-dwb), licensed under GNU General Public License, Version 2.
