Constant for associative patterns ensemble

Creation procedure of associative patterns ensemble in terms of formal logic with using neural net-work (NN) model is formulated. It is shown that the associative patterns set is created by means of unique procedure of NN work which having individual parameters of entrance stimulus transformation. It is ascer-tained that the quantity of the selected associative patterns possesses is a constant.
