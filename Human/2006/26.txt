Compression Scheme for Faster and Secure Data Transmission Over Internet

Compression algorithms reduce the redundancy in data representation to decrease the storage required for that data. Data compression offers an attractive approach to reducing communication costs by using available bandwidth effectively. Over the last decade there has been an unprecedented explosion in the amount of digital data transmitted via the Internet, representing text, images, video, sound, computer programs, etc. With this trend expected to continue, it makes sense to pursue research on developing algorithms that can most effectively use available network bandwidth by maximally compressing data. It is also important to consider the security aspects of the data being transmitted while compressing it, as most of the text data transmitted over the Internet is very much vulnerable to a multitude of attacks. This paper is focused on addressing this problem of lossless compression of text files with an added security.
