Weighted Norms of Ambiguity Functions and Wigner Distributions

In this article new bounds on weighted p-norms of ambiguity functions and Wigner functions are derived. Such norms occur frequently in several areas of physics and engineering. In pulse optimization for Weyl--Heisenberg signaling in wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channels for example it is a key step to find the optimal waveforms for a given scattering statistics which is a problem also well known in radar and sonar waveform optimizations. The same situation arises in quantum information processing and optical communication when optimizing pure quantum states for communicating in bosonic quantum channels, i.e. find optimal channel input states maximizing the pure state channel fidelity. Due to the non-convex nature of this problem the optimum and the maximizers itself are in general difficult find, numerically and analytically. Therefore upper bounds on the achievable performance are important which will be provided by this contribution. Based on a result due to E. Lieb, the main theorem states a new upper bound which is independent of the waveforms and becomes tight only for Gaussian weights and waveforms. A discussion of this particular important case, which tighten recent results on Gaussian quantum fidelity and coherent states, will be given. Another bound is presented for the case where scattering is determined only by some arbitrary region in phase space.
