Intrinsically Legal-For-Trade Objects by Digital Signatures

The established techniques for legal-for-trade registration of weight values meet the legal requirements, but in praxis they show serious disadvantages. We report on the first implementation of intrinsically legal-for-trade objects, namely weight values signed by the scale, that is accepted by the approval authority. The strict requirements from both the approval- and the verification-authority as well as the limitations due to the hardware of the scale were a special challenge. The presented solution fulfills all legal requirements and eliminates the existing practical disadvantages.
