A Taxonomy of Peer-to-Peer Based Complex Queries: a Grid perspective

Grid superscheduling requires support for efficient and scalable discovery of resources. Resource discovery activities involve searching for the appropriate resource types that match the user's job requirements. To accomplish this goal, a resource discovery system that supports the desired look-up operation is mandatory. Various kinds of solutions to this problem have been suggested, including the centralised and hierarchical information server approach. However, both of these approaches have serious limitations in regards to scalability, fault-tolerance and network congestion. To overcome these limitations, organising resource information using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network model has been proposed. Existing approaches advocate an extension to structured P2P protocols, to support the Grid resource information system (GRIS). In this paper, we identify issues related to the design of such an efficient, scalable, fault-tolerant, consistent and practical GRIS system using a P2P network model. We compile these issues into various taxonomies in sections III and IV. Further, we look into existing works that apply P2P based network protocols to GRIS. We think that this taxonomy and its mapping to relevant systems would be useful for academic and industry based researchers who are engaged in the design of scalable Grid systems.
