NLOMJ--Natural Language Object Model in Java

In this paper we present NLOMJ--a natural language object model in Java with English as the experiment language. This modal describes the grammar elements of any permissible expression in a natural language and their complicated relations with each other with the concept "Object" in OOP(Object Oriented Programming). Directly mapped to the syntax and semantics of the natural language, it can be used in information retrieval as a linguistic method. Around the UML diagram of the NLOMJ the important classes(Sentence, Clause and Phrase) and their sub classes are introduced and their syntactic and semantic meanings are explained.
