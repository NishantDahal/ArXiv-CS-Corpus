Generalized Majority-Minority Operations are Tractable

Generalized majority-minority (GMM) operations are introduced as a common generalization of near unanimity operations and Mal'tsev operations on finite sets. We show that every instance of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), where all constraint relations are invariant under a (fixed) GMM operation, is solvable in polynomial time. This constitutes one of the largest tractable cases of the CSP.
