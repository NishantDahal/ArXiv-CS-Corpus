The virtual reality framework for engineering objects

A framework for virtual reality of engineering objects has been developed. This framework may simulate different equipment related to virtual reality. Framework supports 6D dynamics, ordinary differential equations, finite formulas, vector and matrix operations. The framework also supports embedding of external software.
