A Recursive Method for Determining the One-Dimensional Submodules of Laurent-Ore Modules

We present a method for determining the one-dimensional submodules of a Laurent-Ore module. The method is based on a correspondence between hyperexponential solutions of associated systems and one-dimensional submodules. The hyperexponential solutions are computed recursively by solving a sequence of first-order ordinary matrix equations. As the recursion proceeds, the matrix equations will have constant coefficients with respect to the operators that have been considered.
