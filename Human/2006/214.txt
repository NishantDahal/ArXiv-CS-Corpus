Watermarking Using Decimal Sequences

This paper introduces the use of decimal sequences in a code division multiple access (CDMA) based watermarking system to hide information for authentication in black and white images. Matlab version 6.5 was used to implement the algorithms discussed in this paper. The advantage of using d-sequences over PN sequences is that one can choose from a variety of prime numbers which provides a more flexible system.
