From Grid Middleware to a Grid Operating System

Grid computing has made substantial advances during the last decade. Grid middleware such as Globus has contributed greatly in making this possible. There are, however, significant barriers to the adoption of Grid computing in other fields, most notably day-to-day user computing environments. We will demonstrate in this paper that this is primarily due to the limitations of the existing Grid middleware which does not take into account the needs of everyday scientific and business users. In this paper we will formally advocate a Grid Operating System and propose an architecture to migrate Grid computing into a Grid operating system which we believe would help remove most of the technical barriers to the adoption of Grid computing and make it relevant to the day-to-day user. We believe this proposed transition to a Grid operating system will drive more pervasive Grid computing research and application development and deployment in future.
