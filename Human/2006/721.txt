Trusted Computing in Mobile Action

Due to the convergence of various mobile access technologies like UMTS, WLAN, and WiMax the need for a new supporting infrastructure arises. This infrastructure should be able to support more efficient ways to authenticate users and devices, potentially enabling novel services based on the security provided by the infrastructure. In this paper we exhibit some usage scenarios from the mobile domain integrating trusted computing, which show that trusted computing offers new paradigms for implementing trust and by this enables new technical applications and business scenarios. The scenarios show how the traditional boundaries between technical and authentication domains become permeable while a high security level is maintained.
