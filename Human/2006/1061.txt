Redundancies of Correction-Capability-Optimized Reed-Muller Codes

This article is focused on some variations of Reed-Muller codes that yield improvements to the rate for a prescribed decoding performance under the Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm with majority voting. Explicit formulas for the redundancies of the new codes are given.
