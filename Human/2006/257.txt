Remote-control and clustering of physical computations using the XML-RPC protocol and the open-Mosix system

The applications of the remote control of physical simulations performed in clustered computers running under an open-Mosix system are presented. Results from the simulation of a 2-dimensional ferromagnetic system of spins in the Ising scheme are provided. Basic parameters of a simulated hysteresis loop like coercivity and exchange bias due to pinning of ferromagnetic spins are given. The paper describes in physicists terminology a cost effective solution which utilizes an XML-RPC protocol (Extensible Markup Language - Remote Procedure Calling) and standard C++ and Python languages.
