The evolution of the parametric models of drawings (modules) in the enterprises reconstruction CAD system

Progressing methods of drawings creating automation is discussed on the basis of so-called modules containing parametric representation of a part of the drawing and the geometrical elements. The stages of evolution of modular technology of automation of engineering are describing alternatives of applying of moduluss for simple association of elements of the drawing without parametric representation with an opportunity of its commenting, for graphic symbols creating in the schemas of automation and drawings of pipelines, for storage of the specific properties of elements, for development of the specialized parts of the project: the axonometric schemas, profiles of outboard pipe networks etc.
