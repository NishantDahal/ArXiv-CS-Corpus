Data in the ADS -- Understanding How to Use it Better

The Smithsonian/NASA ADS Abstract Service contains a wealth of data for astronomers and librarians alike, yet the vast majority of usage consists of rudimentary searches. Hints on how to obtain more focused search results by using more of the various capabilities of the ADS are presented, including searching by affiliation. We also discuss the classification of articles by content and by referee status.
  The ADS is funded by NASA Grant NNG06GG68G-16613687.
