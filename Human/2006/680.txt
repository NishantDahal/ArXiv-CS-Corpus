Human Information Processing with the Personal Memex

In this report, we describe the work done in a project that explored the human information processing aspects of a personal memex (a memex to organize personal information). In the project, we considered the use of the personal memex, focusing on information recall, by three populations: people with Mild Cognitive Impairment, those diagnosed with Macular Degeneration, and a high-functioning population. The outcomes of the project included human information processing-centered design guidelines for the memex interface, a low-fidelity prototype, and an annotated bibliography for human information processing, usability and design literature relating to the memex and the populations we explored.
