Analyse non standard du bruit

Thanks to the nonstandard formalization of fast oscillating functions, due to P. Cartier and Y. Perrin, an appropriate mathematical framework is derived for new non-asymptotic estimation techniques, which do not necessitate any statistical analysis of the noises corrupting any sensor. Various applications are deduced for multiplicative noises, for the length of the parametric estimation windows, and for burst errors.
