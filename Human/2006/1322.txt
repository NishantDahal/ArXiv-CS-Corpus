Network calculus based FDI approach for switched Ethernet architecture

The Networked Control Systems (NCS) are complex systems which integrate information provided by several domians such as automatic control, computer science, communication network. The work presented in this paper concerns fault detection, isolation and compensation of communication network. The proposed method is based on the classical approach of Fault Detection and Isolation and Fault Tolerant Control (FDI/FTC) currently used in diagnosis. The modelling of the network to be supervised is based on both couloured petri nets and network calculus theory often used to represent and analyse the network behaviour. The goal is to implement inside network devices algorithms enabling to detect, isolate and compensate communication faults in an autonomous way.
