Automatic Detection of Trends in Dynamical Text: An Evolutionary Approach

This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm for modeling the arrival dates of document streams, which is any time-stamped collection of documents, such as newscasts, e-mails, IRC conversations, scientific journals archives and weblog postings. This algorithm assigns frequencies (number of document arrivals per time unit) to time intervals so that it produces an optimal fit to the data. The optimization is a trade off between accurately fitting the data and avoiding too many frequency changes; this way the analysis is able to find fits which ignore the noise. Classical dynamic programming algorithms are limited by memory and efficiency requirements, which can be a problem when dealing with long streams. This suggests to explore alternative search methods which allow for some degree of uncertainty to achieve tractability. Experiments have shown that the designed evolutionary algorithm is able to reach the same solution quality as those classical dynamic programming algorithms in a shorter time. We have also explored different probabilistic models to optimize the fitting of the date streams, and applied these algorithms to infer whether a new arrival increases or decreases {\em interest} in the topic the document stream is about.
