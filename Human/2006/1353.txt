Beyond i.i.d. in Quantum Information Theory

The information spectrum approach gives general formulae for optimal rates of codes in many areas of information theory. In this paper the quantum spectral divergence rates are defined and properties of the rates are derived. The entropic rates, conditional entropic rates, and spectral mutual information rates are then defined in terms of the spectral divergence rates. Properties including subadditivity, chain rules, Araki-Lieb inequalities, and monotonicity are then explored.
