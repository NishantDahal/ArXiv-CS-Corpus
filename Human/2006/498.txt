Three Logistic Models for the Ecological and Economic Interactions: Symbiosis, Predator-Prey and Competition

If one isolated species (corporation) is supposed to evolve following the logistic mapping, then we are tempted to think that the dynamics of two species (corporations) can be expressed by a coupled system of two discrete logistic equations. As three basic relationships between two species are present in Nature, namely symbiosis, predator-prey and competition, three different models are obtained. Each model is a cubic two-dimensional discrete logistic-type equation with its own dynamical properties: stationary regime, periodicity, quasi-periodicity and chaos. We also propose that these models could be useful for thinking in the different interactions happening in the economic world, as for instance for the competition and the collaboration between corporations. Furthermore, these models could be considered as the basic ingredients to construct more complex interactions in the ecological and economic networks.
