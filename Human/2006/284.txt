Yet Another Efficient Unification Algorithm

The unification algorithm is at the core of the logic programming paradigm, the first unification algorithm being developed by Robinson [5]. More efficient algorithms were developed later [3] and I introduce here yet another efficient unification algorithm centered on a specific data structure, called the Unification Table.
