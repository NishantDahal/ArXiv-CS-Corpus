Linguistically Grounded Models of Language Change

Questions related to the evolution of language have recently known an impressive increase of interest (Briscoe, 2002). This short paper aims at questioning the scientific status of these models and their relations to attested data. We show that one cannot directly model non-linguistic factors (exogenous factors) even if they play a crucial role in language evolution. We then examine the relation between linguistic models and attested language data, as well as their contribution to cognitive linguistics.
