Parallel Symbolic Computation of Curvature Invariants in General Relativity

We present a practical application of parallel symbolic computation in General Relativity: the calculation of curvature invariants for large dimension. We discuss the structure of the calculations, an implementation of the technique and scaling of the computation with spacetime dimension for various invariants.
