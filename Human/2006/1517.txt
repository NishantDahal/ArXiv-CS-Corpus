Exact solutions for the two- and all-terminal reliabilities of the Brecht-Colbourn ladder and the generalized fan

The two- and all-terminal reliabilities of the Brecht-Colbourn ladder and the generalized fan have been calculated exactly for arbitrary size as well as arbitrary individual edge and node reliabilities, using transfer matrices of dimension four at most. While the all-terminal reliabilities of these graphs are identical, the special case of identical edge ($p$) and node ($ρ$) reliabilities shows that their two-terminal reliabilities are quite distinct, as demonstrated by their generating functions and the locations of the zeros of the reliability polynomials, which undergo structural transitions at $ρ= \displaystyle {1/2}$.
