Object-Based Groupware: Theory, Design and Implementation Issues

Document management software systems are having a wide audience at present. However, groupware as a term has a wide variety of possible definitions. Groupware classification attempt is made in this paper. Possible approaches to groupware are considered including document management, document control and mailing systems. Lattice theory and concept modelling are presented as a theoretical background for the systems in question. Current technologies in state-of-the-art document managenent software are discussed. Design and implementation aspects for user-friendly integrate enterprise systems are described. Results for a real system to be implemented are given. Perspectives of the field in question are discussed.
