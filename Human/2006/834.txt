Finite element method for thermal analysis of concentrating solar receivers

Application of finite element method and heat conductivity transfer model for calculation of temperature distribution in receiver for dish-Stirling concentrating solar system is described. The method yields discretized equations that are entirely local to the elements and provides complete geometric flexibility. A computer program solving the finite element method problem is created and great number of numerical experiments is carried out. Illustrative numerical results are given for an array of triangular elements in receiver for dish-Stirling system.
