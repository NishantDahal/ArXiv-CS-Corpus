Deriving Conceptual Data Models from Domain Ontologies for Bioinformatics

This paper studies the role that ontologies can play in establishing conceptual data models during the process of information systems development. A mapping algorithm has been proposed and embedded in a special purpose Transformation-Engine to generate a conceptual data model from a given domain ontology. In addition, this paper focuses on applying the proposed approach to a bioinformatics context as the nature of biological data is considered a barrier in representing biological conceptual data models. Both quantitative and qualitative methods have been adopted to critically evaluate this new approach. The results of this evaluation indicate that the quality of the generated conceptual data models can reflect the problem domain entities and the associations between them. The results are encouraging and support the potential role that this approach can play in providing a suitable starting point for conceptual data model development.
