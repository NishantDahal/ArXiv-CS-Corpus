Primitive Quantum BCH Codes over Finite Fields

An attractive feature of BCH codes is that one can infer valuable information from their design parameters (length, size of the finite field, and designed distance), such as bounds on the minimum distance and dimension of the code. In this paper, it is shown that one can also deduce from the design parameters whether or not a primitive, narrow-sense BCH contains its Euclidean or Hermitian dual code. This information is invaluable in the construction of quantum BCH codes. A new proof is provided for the dimension of BCH codes with small designed distance, and simple bounds on the minimum distance of such codes and their duals are derived as a consequence. These results allow us to derive the parameters of two families of primitive quantum BCH codes as a function of their design parameters.
