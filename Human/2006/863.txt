Craig's Interpolation Theorem formalised and mechanised in Isabelle/HOL

We formalise and mechanise a construtive, proof theoretic proof of Craig's Interpolation Theorem in Isabelle/HOL. We give all the definitions and lemma statements both formally and informally. We also transcribe informally the formal proofs. We detail the main features of our mechanisation, such as the formalisation of binding for first order formulae. We also give some applications of Craig's Interpolation Theorem.
