Entity Based Peer-to-Peer in a Data Grid Environment

During the last decade there has been a huge interest in Grid technologies, and numerous Grid projects have been initiated with various visions of the Grid. While all these visions have the same goal of resource sharing, they differ in the functionality that a Grid supports, the grid characterisation, programming environments, etc. In this paper we present a new Grid system dedicated to deal with data issues, called DGET (Data Grid Environment and Tools). DGET is characterized by its peer-to-peer communication system and entity-based architecture, therefore, taking advantage of the main functionality of both systems; P2P and Grid. DGET is currently under development and a prototype implementing the main components is in its first phase of testing. In this paper we limit our description to the system architectural features and to the main differences with other systems.
