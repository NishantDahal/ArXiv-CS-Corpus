Working times in atypical forms of employment: the special case of part-time work

In the present article, we attempt to devise a typology of forms of part-time employment by applying a widely used neuronal methodology called Kohonen maps. Starting out with data that we describe using category-specific variables, we show how it is possible to represent observations and the modalities of the variables that define them simultaneously, on a single map. This allows us to ascertain, and to try to describe, the main categories of part-time employment.
