A Novel Bayesian Classifier using Copula Functions

A useful method for representing Bayesian classifiers is through \emph{discriminant functions}. Here, using copula functions, we propose a new model for discriminants. This model provides a rich and generalized class of decision boundaries. These decision boundaries significantly boost the classification accuracy especially for high dimensional feature spaces. We strengthen our analysis through simulation results.
