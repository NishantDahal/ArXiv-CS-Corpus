D2D: Digital Archive to MPEG-21 DIDL

Digital Archive to MPEG-21 DIDL (D2D) analyzes the contents of the digital archive and produces an MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language (DIDL) encapsulating the analysis results. DIDL is an extensible XML-based language that aggregates resources and the metadata. We provide a brief report on several analysis techniques applied on the digital archive by the D2D and provide an evaluation of its run-time performance.
