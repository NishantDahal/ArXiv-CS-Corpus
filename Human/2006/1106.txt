Throughput Optimal Distributed Control of Stochastic Wireless Networks

The Maximum Differential Backlog (MDB) control policy of Tassiulas and Ephremides has been shown to adaptively maximize the stable throughput of multi-hop wireless networks with random traffic arrivals and queueing. The practical implementation of the MDB policy in wireless networks with mutually interfering links, however, requires the development of distributed optimization algorithms. Within the context of CDMA-based multi-hop wireless networks, we develop a set of node-based scaled gradient projection power control algorithms which solves the MDB optimization problem in a distributed manner using low communication overhead. As these algorithms require time to converge to a neighborhood of the optimum, the optimal rates determined by the MDB policy can only be found iteratively over time. For this, we show that the iterative MDB policy with convergence time remains throughput optimal.
