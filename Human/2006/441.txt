A Fixed-Point Type for Octave

This paper announces the availability of a fixed point toolbox for the Matlab compatible software package Octave. This toolbox is released under the GNU Public License, and can be used to model the losses in algorithms implemented in hardware. Furthermore, this paper presents as an example of the use of this toolbox, the effects of a fixed point implementation on the precision of an OFDM modulator.
