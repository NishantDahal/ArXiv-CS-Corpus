Using Users' Expectations to Adapt Business Intelligence Systems

This paper takes a look at the general characteristics of business or economic intelligence system. The role of the user within this type of system is emphasized. We propose two models which we consider important in order to adapt this system to the user. The first model is based on the definition of decisional problem and the second on the four cognitive phases of human learning. We also describe the application domain we are using to test these models in this type of system.
