Une expérience de sémantique inférentielle

We develop a system which must be able to perform the same inferences that a human reader of an accident report can do and more particularly to determine the apparent causes of the accident. We describe the general framework in which we are situated, linguistic and semantic levels of the analysis and the inference rules used by the system.
