The Case for Modeling Security, Privacy, Usability and Reliability (SPUR) in Automotive Software

Over the past five years, there has been considerable growth and established value in the practice of modeling automotive software requirements. Much of this growth has been centered on requirements of software associated with the established functional areas of an automobile, such as those associated with powertrain, chassis, body, safety and infotainment. This paper makes a case for modeling four additional attributes that are increasingly important as vehicles become information conduits: security, privacy, usability, and reliability. These four attributes are important in creating specifications for embedded in-vehicle automotive software.
