ECA-RuleML: An Approach combining ECA Rules with temporal interval-based KR Event/Action Logics and Transactional Update Logics

An important problem to be addressed within Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is how to correctly and efficiently capture and process the event/action-based logic. This paper endeavors to bridge the gap between the Knowledge Representation (KR) approaches based on durable events/actions and such formalisms as event calculus, on one hand, and event-condition-action (ECA) reaction rules extending the approach of active databases that view events as instantaneous occurrences and/or sequences of events, on the other. We propose formalism based on reaction rules (ECA rules) and a novel interval-based event logic and present concrete RuleML-based syntax, semantics and implementation. We further evaluate this approach theoretically, experimentally and on an example derived from common industry use cases and illustrate its benefits.
