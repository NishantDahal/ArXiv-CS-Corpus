An application-oriented terminology evaluation: the case of back-of-the book indexes

This paper addresses the problem of computational terminology evaluation not per se but in a specific application context. This paper describes the evaluation procedure that has been used to assess the validity of our overall indexing approach and the quality of the IndDoc indexing tool. Even if user-oriented extended evaluation is irreplaceable, we argue that early evaluations are possible and they are useful for development guidance.
