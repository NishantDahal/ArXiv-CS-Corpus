Iso9000 Based Advanced Quality Approach for Continuous Improvement of Manufacturing Processes

The continuous improvement in TQM is considered as the core value by which organisation could maintain a competitive edge. Several techniques and tools are known to support this core value but most of the time these techniques are informal and without modelling the interdependence between the core value and tools. Thus, technique formalisation is one of TQM challenges for increasing efficiency of quality process implementation. In that way, the paper proposes and experiments an advanced quality modelling approach based on meta-modelling the "process approach" as advocated by the standard ISO9000:2000. This meta-model allows formalising the interdependence between technique, tools and core value
