Instanton analysis of Low-Density-Parity-Check codes in the error-floor regime

In this paper we develop instanton method introduced in [1], [2], [3] to analyze quantitatively performance of Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes decoded iteratively in the so-called error-floor regime. We discuss statistical properties of the numerical instanton-amoeba scheme focusing on detailed analysis and comparison of two regular LDPC codes: Tanner's (155, 64, 20) and Margulis' (672, 336, 16) codes. In the regime of moderate values of the signal-to-noise ratio we critically compare results of the instanton-amoeba evaluations against the standard Monte-Carlo calculations of the Frame-Error-Rate.
