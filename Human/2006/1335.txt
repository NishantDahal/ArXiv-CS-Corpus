Full Text Searching in the Astrophysics Data System

The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) provides a search system for the astronomy and physics scholarly literature. All major and many smaller astronomy journals that were published on paper have been scanned back to volume 1 and are available through the ADS free of charge. All scanned pages have been converted to text and can be searched through the ADS Full Text Search System. In addition, searches can be fanned out to several external search systems to include the literature published in electronic form. Results from the different search systems are combined into one results list.
  The ADS Full Text Search System is available at: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/fulltext_service.html
