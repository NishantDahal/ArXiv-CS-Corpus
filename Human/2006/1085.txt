Semantic Description of Parameters in Web Service Annotations

A modification of OWL-S regarding parameter description is proposed. It is strictly based on Description Logic. In addition to class description of parameters it also allows the modelling of relations between parameters and the precise description of the size of data to be supplied to a service. In particular, it solves two major issues identified within current proposals for a Semantic Web Service annotation standard.
