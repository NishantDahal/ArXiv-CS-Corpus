Quantum Pattern Retrieval by Qubit Networks with Hebb Interactions

Qubit networks with long-range interactions inspired by the Hebb rule can be used as quantum associative memories. Starting from a uniform superposition, the unitary evolution generated by these interactions drives the network through a quantum phase transition at a critical computation time, after which ferromagnetic order guarantees that a measurement retrieves the stored memory. The maximum memory capacity p of these qubit networks is reached at a memory density p/n=1.
