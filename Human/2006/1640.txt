A modular eballot system - V0.6

We consider a reasonably simple voting system which can be implemented for web-based ballots. Simplicity, modularity and the requirement of compatibility with current web browsers leads to a system which satisfies a set of security requirements for a ballot system which is not complete but sufficient in many cases. Due to weak-eligibility and vote-selling, this system cannot be used for political or similar ballots.
