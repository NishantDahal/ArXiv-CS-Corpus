Channel capacities of classical and quantum list decoding

We focus on classical and quantum list decoding. The capacity of list decoding was obtained by Nishimura in the case when the number of list does not increase exponentially. However, the capacity of the exponential-list case is open even in the classical case while its converse part was obtained by Nishimura. We derive the channel capacities in the classical and quantum case with an exponentially increasing list. The converse part of the quantum case is obtained by modifying Nagaoka's simple proof for strong converse theorem for channel capacity. The direct part is derived by a quite simple argument.
