The Aryabhata Algorithm Using Least Absolute Remainders

This paper presents an introduction to the Aryabhata algorithm for finding multiplicative inverses and solving linear congruences, both of which have applications in cryptography. We do so by the use of the least absolute remainders. The exposition of the Aryabhata algorithm provided here can have performance that could exceed what was described recently by Rao and Yang.
