XString: XML as a String

Extensible markup language (XML) is a technology that has been much hyped, so that XML has become an industry buzzword. Behind the hype is a powerful technology for data representation in a platform independent manner. As a text document, however, XML suffers from being too bloated, and requires an XML parser to access and manipulate it. XString is an encoding method for XML, in essence, a markup language's markup language. XString gives the benefit of compressing XML, and allows for easy manipulation and processing of XML source as a very long string.
