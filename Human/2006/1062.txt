A Fast Image Encryption Scheme based on Chaotic Standard Map

In recent years, a variety of effective chaos-based image encryption schemes have been proposed. The typical structure of these schemes has the permutation and the diffusion stages performed alternatively. The confusion and diffusion effect is solely contributed by the permutation and the diffusion stage, respectively. As a result, more overall rounds than necessary are required to achieve a certain level of security. In this paper, we suggest to introduce certain diffusion effect in the confusion stage by simple sequential add-and-shift operations. The purpose is to reduce the workload of the time-consuming diffusion part so that fewer overall rounds and hence a shorter encryption time is needed. Simulation results show that at a similar performance level, the proposed cryptosystem needs less than one-third the encryption time of an existing cryptosystem. The effective acceleration of the encryption speed is thus achieved.
