Analysis of Equality Relationships for Imperative Programs

In this article, we discuss a flow--sensitive analysis of equality relationships for imperative programs. We describe its semantic domains, general purpose operations over abstract computational states (term evaluation and identification, semantic completion, widening operator, etc.) and semantic transformers corresponding to program constructs. We summarize our experiences from the last few years concerning this analysis and give attention to applications of analysis of automatically generated code. Among other illustrating examples, we consider a program for which the analysis diverges without a widening operator and results of analyzing residual programs produced by some automatic partial evaluator. An example of analysis of a program generated by this evaluator is given.
