LiveWN, cpu scavenging in the Grid Era

The goal of this research is to introduce an easy and versatile way to provide and use Grid resources without the need of any OS installation or middleware configuration. At the same time we provide an excellent training tool for newer Grid users and people that want to experiment, without enforcing any installation. We have been testing it thoroughly under different circumstances with firm success.
