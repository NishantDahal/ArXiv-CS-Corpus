Mobile Agent Based Solutions for Knowledge Assessment in elearning Environments

E-learning is nowadays one of the most interesting of the "e- " domains available through the Internet. The main problem to create a Web-based, virtual environment is to model the traditional domain and to implement the model using the most suitable technologies. We analyzed the distance learning domain and investigated the possibility to implement some e-learning services using mobile agent technologies. This paper presents a model of the Student Assessment Service (SAS) and an agent-based framework developed to be used for implementing specific applications. A specific Student Assessment application that relies on the framework was developed.
