Artificial and Biological Intelligence

This article considers evidence from physical and biological sciences to show machines are deficient compared to biological systems at incorporating intelligence. Machines fall short on two counts: firstly, unlike brains, machines do not self-organize in a recursive manner; secondly, machines are based on classical logic, whereas Nature's intelligence may depend on quantum mechanics.
