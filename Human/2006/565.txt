Numeration-automatic sequences

We present a base class of automata that induce a numeration system and we give an algorithm to give the n-th word in the language of the automaton when the expansion of n in the induced numeration system is feeded to the automaton. Furthermore we give some algorithms for reverse reading of this expansion and a way to combine automata to other automata having the same properties.
