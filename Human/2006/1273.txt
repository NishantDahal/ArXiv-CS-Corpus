Combined Integer and Floating Point Multiplication Architecture(CIFM) for FPGAs and Its Reversible Logic Implementation

In this paper, the authors propose the idea of a combined integer and floating point multiplier(CIFM) for FPGAs. The authors propose the replacement of existing 18x18 dedicated multipliers in FPGAs with dedicated 24x24 multipliers designed with small 4x4 bit multipliers. It is also proposed that for every dedicated 24x24 bit multiplier block designed with 4x4 bit multipliers, four redundant 4x4 multiplier should be provided to enforce the feature of self repairability (to recover from the faults). In the proposed CIFM reconfigurability at run time is also provided resulting in low power. The major source of motivation for providing the dedicated 24x24 bit multiplier stems from the fact that single precision floating point multiplier requires 24x24 bit integer multiplier for mantissa multiplication. A reconfigurable, self-repairable 24x24 bit multiplier (implemented with 4x4 bit multiply modules) will ideally suit this purpose, making FPGAs more suitable for integer as well floating point operations. A dedicated 4x4 bit multiplier is also proposed in this paper. Moreover, in the recent years, reversible logic has emerged as a promising technology having its applications in low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. It is not possible to realize quantum computing without reversible logic. Thus, this paper also paper provides the reversible logic implementation of the proposed CIFM. The reversible CIFM designed and proposed here will form the basis of the completely reversible FPGAs.
