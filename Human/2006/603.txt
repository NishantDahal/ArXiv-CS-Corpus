On the Design of Agent-Based Systems using UML and Extensions

The Unified Software Development Process (USDP) and UML have been now generally accepted as the standard methodology and modeling language for developing Object-Oriented Systems. Although Agent-based Systems introduces new issues, we consider that USDP and UML can be used in an extended manner for modeling Agent-based Systems. The paper presents a methodology for designing agent-based systems and the specific models expressed in an UML-based notation corresponding to each phase of the software development process. UML was extended using the provided mechanism: stereotypes. Therefore, this approach can be managed with any CASE tool supporting UML. A Case Study, the development of a specific agent-based Student Evaluation System (SAS), is presented.
