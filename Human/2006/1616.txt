A Classification of 6R Manipulators

This paper presents a classification of generic 6-revolute jointed (6R) manipulators using homotopy class of their critical point manifold. A part of classification is listed in this paper because of the complexity of homotopy class of 4-torus. The results of this classification will serve future research of the classification and topological properties of maniplators joint space and workspace.
