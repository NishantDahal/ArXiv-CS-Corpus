Reversible Programmable Logic Array (RPLA) using Fredkin & Feynman Gates for Industrial Electronics and Applications

In recent years, reversible logic has emerged as a promising computing paradigm having application in low power CMOS, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and optical computing. The classical set of gates such as AND, OR, and EXOR are not reversible. In this paper, the authors have proposed reversible programmable logic array (RPLA) architecture using reversible Fredkin and Feynman gates. The proposed RPLA has n inputs and m outputs and can realize m functions of n variables. In order to demonstrate the design of RPLA, a 3 input RPLA is designed which can perform any 28 functions using the combination of 8 min terms (23). Furthermore, the application of the designed 3 input RPLA is shown by implementing the full adder and full subtractor functions through it.
