Survivable Routing in IP-over-WDM Networks in the Presence of Multiple Failures

Failure restoration at the IP layer in IP-over-WDM networks requires to map the IP topology on the WDM topology in such a way that a failure at the WDM layer leaves the IP topology connected. Such a mapping is called $survivable$. As finding a survivable mapping is known to be NP-complete, in practice it requires a heuristic approach. We have introduced in [1] a novel algorithm called ``SMART'', that is more effective and scalable than the heuristics known to date. Moreover, the formal analysis of SMART [2] has led to new applications: the formal verification of the existence of a survivable mapping, and a tool tracing and repairing the vulnerable areas of the network. In this paper we extend the theoretical analysis in [2] by considering $multiple failures$.
