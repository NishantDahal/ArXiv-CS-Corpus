The `Face on Mars': a photographic approach for the search of signs of past civilizations from a macroscopic point of view, factoring long-term erosion in image reconstruction

This short article presents an alternative view of high resolution imaging from various sources with the aim of the discovery of potential sites of archaeological importance, or sites that exhibit `anomalies' such that they may merit closer inspection and analysis. It is conjectured, and to a certain extent demonstrated here, that it is possible for advanced civilizations to factor in erosion by natural processes into a large scale design so that main features be preserved even with the passage of millions of years. Alternatively viewed, even without such intent embedded in a design left for posterity, it is possible that a gigantic construction may naturally decay in such a way that even cataclysmic (massive) events may leave sufficient information intact with the passage of time, provided one changes the point of view from high resolution images to enhanced blurred renderings of the sites in question.
