Theoretical Setting of Inner Reversible Quantum Measurements

We show that any unitary transformation performed on the quantum state of a closed quantum system, describes an inner, reversible, generalized quantum measurement. We also show that under some specific conditions it is possible to perform a unitary transformation on the state of the closed quantum system by means of a collection of generalized measurement operators. In particular, given a complete set of orthogonal projectors, it is possible to implement a reversible quantum measurement that preserves the probabilities. In this context, we introduce the concept of "Truth-Observable", which is the physical counterpart of an inner logical truth.
