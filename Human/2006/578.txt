An Internet Framework to Bring Coherence between WAP and HTTP Ensuring Better Mobile Internet Security

To bring coherence between Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), in this paper, we have proposed an enhanced Internet framework, which incorporates a new markup language and a browser compatible with both of the access control protocols. This Markup Language and the browser enables co-existence of both Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) and Wireless Markup Language (WML) contents in a single source file, whereas the browser incorporates the ability to hold contents compliant with both HTTP and WAP. The proposed framework also bridges the security gap that is present in the existing mobile Internet framework.
  Keywords: WAP, WML, HTTP, HTML, browser, parser, wireless devices.
