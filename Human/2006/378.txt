Enumeration of non-orientable 3-manifolds using face pairing graphs and union-find

Drawing together techniques from combinatorics and computer science, we improve the census algorithm for enumerating closed minimal P^2-irreducible 3-manifold triangulations. In particular, new constraints are proven for face pairing graphs, and pruning techniques are improved using a modification of the union-find algorithm. Using these results we catalogue all 136 closed non-orientable P^2-irreducible 3-manifolds that can be formed from at most ten tetrahedra.
