Feynman Checkerboard as a Model of Discrete Space-Time

In 1965, Feynman wrote of using a lattice containing one dimension of space and one dimension of time to derive aspects of quantum mechanics. Instead of summing the behavior of all possible paths as he did, this paper will consider the motion of single particles within this discrete Space-Time lattice, sometimes called Feynman's Checkerboard. This empirical approach yielded several predicted emergent properties for a discrete Space-Time lattice, one of which is novel and testable.
