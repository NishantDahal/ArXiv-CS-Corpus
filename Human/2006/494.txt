Maximally Non-Local and Monogamous Quantum Correlations

We introduce a version of the chained Bell inequality for an arbitrary number of measurement outcomes, and use it to give a simple proof that the maximally entangled state of two d dimensional quantum systems has no local component. That is, if we write its quantum correlations as a mixture of local correlations and general (not necessarily quantum) correlations, the coefficient of the local correlations must be zero. This suggests an experimental programme to obtain as good an upper bound as possible on the fraction of local states, and provides a lower bound on the amount of classical communication needed to simulate a maximally entangled state in dxd dimensions. We also prove that the quantum correlations violating the inequality are monogamous among non-signalling correlations, and hence can be used for quantum key distribution secure against post-quantum (but non-signalling) eavesdroppers.
