Solving planning domains with polytree causal graphs is NP-complete

We show that solving planning domains on binary variables with polytree causal graph is \NP-complete. This is in contrast to a polynomial-time algorithm of Domshlak and Brafman that solves these planning domains for polytree causal graphs of bounded indegree.
