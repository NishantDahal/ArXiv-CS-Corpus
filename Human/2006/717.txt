Decentralized Erasure Codes for Distributed Networked Storage

We consider the problem of constructing an erasure code for storage over a network when the data sources are distributed. Specifically, we assume that there are n storage nodes with limited memory and k<n sources generating the data. We want a data collector, who can appear anywhere in the network, to query any k storage nodes and be able to retrieve the data. We introduce Decentralized Erasure Codes, which are linear codes with a specific randomized structure inspired by network coding on random bipartite graphs. We show that decentralized erasure codes are optimally sparse, and lead to reduced communication, storage and computation cost over random linear coding.
