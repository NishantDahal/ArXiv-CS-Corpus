Gridscape II: A Customisable and Pluggable Grid Monitoring Portal and its Integration with Google Maps

Grid computing has emerged as an effective means of facilitating the sharing of distributed heterogeneous resources, enabling collaboration in large scale environments. However, the nature of Grid systems, coupled with the overabundance and fragmentation of information, makes it difficult to monitor resources, services, and computations in order to plan and make decisions. In this paper we present Gridscape II, a customisable portal component that can be used on its own or plugged in to compliment existing Grid portals. Gridscape II manages the gathering of information from arbitrary, heterogeneous and distributed sources and presents them together seamlessly within a single interface. It also leverages the Google Maps API in order to provide a highly interactive user interface. Gridscape II is simple and easy to use, providing a solution to those users who do not wish to invest heavily in developing their own monitoring portal from scratch, and also for those users who want something that is easy to customise and extend for their specific needs.
