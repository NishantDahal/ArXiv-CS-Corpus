Effect of Interface Style in Peer Review Comments for UML Designs

This paper presents our evaluation of using a Tablet-PC to provide peer-review comments in the first year Computer Science course. Our exploration consisted of an evaluation of how students write comments on other students' assignments using three different methods: pen and paper, a Tablet-PC, and a desktop computer. Our ultimate goal is to explore the effect that interface style (Tablet vs. Desktop) has on the quality and quantity of the comments provided.
