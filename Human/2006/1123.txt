Non-photorealistic image rendering with a labyrinthine tiling

The paper describes a new image processing for a non-photorealistic rendering. The algorithm is based on a random generation of gray tones and competing statistical requirements. The gray tone value of each pixel in the starting image is replaced selecting among randomly generated tone values, according to the statistics of nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor pixels. Two competing conditions for replacing the tone values - one position on the local mean value the other on the local variance - produce a peculiar pattern on the image. This pattern has a labyrinthine tiling aspect. For certain subjects, the pattern enhances the look of the image.
