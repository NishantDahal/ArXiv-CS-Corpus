Complexity of the Guarded Two-Variable Fragment with Counting Quantifiers

We show that the finite satisfiability problem for the guarded two-variable fragment with counting quantifiers is in EXPTIME. The method employed also yields a simple proof of a result recently obtained by Y. Kazakov, that the satisfiability problem for the guarded two-variable fragment with counting quantifiers is in EXPTIME.
