Program Spectra Analysis in Embedded Software: A Case Study

Because of constraints imposed by the market, embedded software in consumer electronics is almost inevitably shipped with faults and the goal is just to reduce the inherent unreliability to an acceptable level before a product has to be released. Automatic fault diagnosis is a valuable tool to capture software faults without extra effort spent on testing. Apart from a debugging aid at design and integration time, fault diagnosis can help analyzing problems during operation, which allows for more accurate system recovery. In this paper we discuss perspectives and limitations for applying a particular fault diagnosis technique, namely the analysis of program spectra, in the area of embedded software in consumer electronics devices. We illustrate these by our first experience with a test case from industry.
