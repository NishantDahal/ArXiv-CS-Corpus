Intégration de la synthèse mémoire dans l'outil de synthèse d'architecture GAUT Low Power

The systems supporting signal and image applications process large amount of data. That involves an intensive use of the memory which becomes the bottleneck of systems. Memory limits performances and represents a significant proportion of total consumption. In the development high level synthesis tool called GAUT Low Power, we are interested in the synthesis of the memory unit. In this work, we integrate the data storage and data transfert to constraint the high level synthesis of the datapath's execution unit.
