On the Behavior of Journal Impact Factor Rank-Order Distribution

An empirical law for the rank-order behavior of journal impact factors is found. Using an extensive data base on impact factors including journals on Education, Agrosciences, Geosciences, Biosciences and Environ- mental, Chemical, Computer, Engineering, Material, Mathematical, Medical and Physical Sciences we have found extremely good fits out- performing other rank-order models. Some extensions to other areas of knowledge are discussed.
