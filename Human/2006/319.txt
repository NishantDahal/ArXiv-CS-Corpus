Health-e-Child : An Integrated Biomedical Platform for Grid-Based Paediatric Applications

There is a compelling demand for the integration and exploitation of heterogeneous biomedical information for improved clinical practice, medical research, and personalised healthcare across the EU. The Health-e-Child project aims at developing an integrated healthcare platform for European Paediatrics, providing seamless integration of traditional and emerging sources of biomedical information. The long-term goal of the project is to provide uninhibited access to universal biomedical knowledge repositories for personalised and preventive healthcare, large-scale information-based biomedical research and training, and informed policy making. The project focus will be on individualised disease prevention, screening, early diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of paediatric heart diseases, inflammatory diseases, and brain tumours. The project will build a Grid-enabled European network of leading clinical centres that will share and annotate biomedical data, validate systems clinically, and diffuse clinical excellence across Europe by setting up new technologies, clinical workflows, and standards. This paper outlines the design approach being adopted in Health-e-Child to enable the delivery of an integrated biomedical information platform.
