A Finite Equational Base for CCS with Left Merge and Communication Merge

Using the left merge and communication merge from ACP, we present an equational base (i.e., a ground-complete and $Ï‰$-complete set of valid equations) for the fragment of CCS without recursion, restriction and relabelling. Our equational base is finite if the set of actions is finite.
