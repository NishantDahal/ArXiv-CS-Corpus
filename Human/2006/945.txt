Transparent Migration of Multi-Threaded Applications on a Java Based Grid

Grid computing has enabled pooling a very large number of heterogeneous resource administered by different security domains. Applications are dynamically deployed on the resources available at the time. Dynamic nature of the resources and applications requirements makes needs the grid middleware to support the ability of migrating a running application to a different resource. Especially, Grid applications are typically long running and thus stoping them and starting them from scratch is not a feasible option. This paper presents an overview of migration support in a java based grid middleware called DGET. Migration support in DGET includes multi-threaded migration and asynchronous migration as well.
