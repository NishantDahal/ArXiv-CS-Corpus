Rapport technique du projet OGRE

This repport concerns automatic understanding of (french) iterative sentences, i.e. sentences where one single verb has to be interpreted by a more or less regular plurality of events. A linguistic analysis is proposed along an extension of Reichenbach's theory, several formal representations are considered and a corpus of 18000 newspaper extracts is described.
