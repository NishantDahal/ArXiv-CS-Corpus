One approach to the digital visualization of hedgehogs in holomorphic dynamics

In the field of holomorphic dynamics in one complex variable, hedgehog is the local invariant set arising about a Cremer point and endowed with a very complicate shape as well as relating to very weak numerical conditions. We give a solution to the open problem of its digital visualization, featuring either a time saving approach and a far-reaching insight.
