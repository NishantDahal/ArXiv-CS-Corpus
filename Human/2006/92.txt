The Evolution of Cyberinsurance

Cyberinsurance is a powerful tool to align market incentives toward improving Internet security. We trace the evolution of cyberinsurance from traditional insurance policies to early cyber-risk insurance policies to current comprehensive cyberinsurance products. We find that increasing Internet security risk in combination with the need for compliance with recent corporate legislation has contributed significantly to the demand for cyberinsurance. Cyberinsurance policies have become more comprehensive as insurers better understand the risk landscape and specific business needs. More specifically, cyberinsurers are addressing what used to be considered insurmountable problems (e.g., adverse selection/asymmetric information, moral hazard, etc.) that could lead to a failure of this market solution. Although some implementation issues remain, we suggest the future development of cyberinsurance will resolve these issues as evidenced by insurance solutions in other risk domains.
