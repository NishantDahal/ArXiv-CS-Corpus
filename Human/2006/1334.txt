Connectivity in the Astronomy Digital Library

The Astrophysics Data System (ADS) provides an extensive system of links between the literature and other on-line information. Recently, the journals of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and a group of NASA data centers have collaborated to provide more links between on-line data obtained by space missions and the on-line journals. Authors can now specify which data sets they have used in their article. This information is used by the participants to provide the links between the literature and the data.
  The ADS is available at: http://ads.harvard.edu
