An active curve approach for tomographic reconstruction of binary radially symmetric objects

This paper deals with a method of tomographic reconstruction of radially symmetric objects from a single radiograph, in order to study the behavior of shocked material. The usual tomographic reconstruction algorithms such as generalized inverse or filtered back-projection cannot be applied here because data are very noisy and the inverse problem associated to single view tomographic reconstruction is highly unstable. In order to improve the reconstruction, we propose here to add some a priori assumptions on the looked after object. One of these assumptions is that the object is binary and consequently, the object may be described by the curves that separate the two materials. We present a model that lives in BV space and leads to a non local Hamilton-Jacobi equation, via a level set strategy. Numerical experiments are performed (using level sets methods) on synthetic objects.
