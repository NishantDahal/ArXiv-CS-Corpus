A Novel Application of Lifting Scheme for Multiresolution Correlation of Complex Radar Signals

The lifting scheme of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is now quite well established as an efficient technique for image compression, and has been incorporated into the JPEG2000 standards. However, the potential of the lifting scheme has not been exploited in the context of correlationbased processing, such as encountered in radar applications. This paper presents a complete and consistent framework for the application of DWT for correlation of complex signals. In particular, lifting scheme factorization of biorthogonal filterbanks is carried out in dual analysis basis spaces for multiresolution correlation of complex radar signals in the DWT domain only. A causal formulation of lifting for orthogonal filterbank is also developed. The resulting parallel algorithms and consequent saving of computational effort are briefly dealt with.
