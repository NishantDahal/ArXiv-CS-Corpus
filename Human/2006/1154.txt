Primitive operations for the construction and reorganization of minimally persistent formations

In this paper, we study the construction and transformation of two-dimensional persistent graphs. Persistence is a generalization to directed graphs of the undirected notion of rigidity. In the context of moving autonomous agent formations, persistence characterizes the efficacy of a directed structure of unilateral distances constraints seeking to preserve a formation shape. Analogously to the powerful results about Henneberg sequences in minimal rigidity theory, we propose different types of directed graph operations allowing one to sequentially build any minimally persistent graph (i.e. persistent graph with a minimal number of edges for a given number of vertices), each intermediate graph being also minimally persistent. We also consider the more generic problem of obtaining one minimally persistent graph from another, which corresponds to the on-line reorganization of an autonomous agent formation. We prove that we can obtain any minimally persistent formation from any other one by a sequence of elementary local operations such that minimal persistence is preserved throughout the reorganization process.
