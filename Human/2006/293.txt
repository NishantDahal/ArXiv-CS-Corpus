Predicting the Path of an Open System

The expected path of an open system,which is a big Poincare system,has been found in this paper.This path has been obtained from the actual and from the expected droop of the open system.The actual droop has been reconstructed from the variations in the power and in the frequency of the open system.The expected droop has been found as a function of rotation from the expected potential energy of the open system under synchronization of that system.
