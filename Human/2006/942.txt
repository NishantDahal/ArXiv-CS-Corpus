Security Analysis of A Chaos-based Image Encryption Algorithm

The security of Fridrich Image Encryption Algorithm against brute-force attack, statistical attack, known-plaintext attack and select-plaintext attack is analyzed by investigating the properties of the involved chaotic maps and diffusion functions. Based on the given analyses, some means are proposed to strengthen the overall performance of the focused cryptosystem.
