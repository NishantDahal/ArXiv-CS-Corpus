A Characterization of the Degree Sequences of 2-Trees

A graph G is a 2-tree if G=K_3, or G has a vertex v of degree 2, whose neighbours are adjacent, and G«ês a 2-tree. A characterization of the degree sequences of 2-trees is given. This characterization yields a linear-time algorithm for recognizing and realizing degree sequences of 2-trees.
