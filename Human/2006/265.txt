Enhanced Prolog Remote Predicate Call Protocol

Following the ideas of the Remote Procedure Call model, we have developed a logic programming counterpart, naturally called Prolog Remote Predicate Call (Prolog RPC). The Prolog RPC protocol facilitates the integration of Prolog code in multi-language applications as well as the development of distributed intelligent applications. One use of the protocol's most important uses could be the development of distributed applications that use Prolog at least partially to achieve their goals. Most notably the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) applications that are suitable for logic programming can profit from the use of the protocol. After proving its usefulness, we went further, developing a new version of the protocol, making it more reliable and extending its functionality. Because it has a new syntax and the new set of commands, we call this version Enhanced Prolog Remote Procedure Call. This paper describes the new features and modifications this second version introduced.
