A framework of reusable structures for mobile agent development

Mobile agents research is clearly aiming towards imposing agent based development as the next generation of tools for writing software. This paper comes with its own contribution to this global goal by introducing a novel unifying framework meant to bring simplicity and interoperability to and among agent platforms as we know them today. In addition to this, we also introduce a set of agent behaviors which, although tailored for and from the area of virtual learning environments, are none the less generic enough to be used for rapid, simple, useful and reliable agent deployment. The paper also presents an illustrative case study brought forward to prove the feasibility of our design.
