Quasi-Linear Soft Tissue Models Revisited

Incompressibility, nonlinear deformation under stress and viscoelasticity are the fingerprint of soft tissue mechanical behavior. In order to model soft tissues appropriately, we must pursue to complete these requirements. In this work we revisited different soft tissue quasi-linear model possibilities in trying to achieve for this commitment.
