Spectral approach to linear programming bounds on codes

We give new proofs of asymptotic upper bounds of coding theory obtained within the frame of Delsarte's linear programming method. The proofs rely on the analysis of eigenvectors of some finite-dimensional operators related to orthogonal polynomials. The examples of the method considered in the paper include binary codes, binary constant-weight codes, spherical codes, and codes in the projective spaces.
