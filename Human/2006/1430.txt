Multivariate Integral Perturbation Techniques - I (Theory)

We present a quasi-analytic perturbation expansion for multivariate N-dimensional Gaussian integrals. The perturbation expansion is an infinite series of lower-dimensional integrals (one-dimensional in the simplest approximation). This perturbative idea can also be applied to multivariate Student-t integrals. We evaluate the perturbation expansion explicitly through 2nd order, and discuss the convergence, including enhancement using Pade approximants. Brief comments on potential applications in finance are given, including options, models for credit risk and derivatives, and correlation sensitivities.
