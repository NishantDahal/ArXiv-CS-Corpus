On factorization and solution of multidimensional linear partial differential equations

We describe a method of obtaining closed-form complete solutions of certain second-order linear partial differential equations with more than two independent variables. This method generalizes the classical method of Laplace transformations of second-order hyperbolic equations in the plane and is based on an idea given by Ulisse Dini in 1902.
