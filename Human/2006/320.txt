Final Results from and Exploitation Plans for MammoGrid

The MammoGrid project has delivered the first deployed instance of a healthgrid for clinical mammography that spans national boundaries. During the last year, the final MammoGrid prototype has undergone a series of rigorous tests undertaken by radiologists in the UK and Italy and this paper draws conclusions from those tests for the benefit of the Healthgrid community. In addition, lessons learned during the lifetime of the project are detailed and recommendations drawn for future health applications using grids. Following the completion of the project, plans have been put in place for the commercialisation of the MammoGrid system and this is also reported in this article. Particular emphasis is placed on the issues surrounding the transition from collaborative research project to a marketable product. This paper concludes by highlighting some of the potential areas of future development and research.
