Improved Watermarking Scheme Using Decimal Sequences

This paper presents watermarking algorithms using d-sequences so that the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) is maximized and the distortion introduced in the image due to the embedding is minimized. By exploiting the cross correlation property of decimal sequences, the concept of embedding more than one watermark in the same cover image is investigated.
