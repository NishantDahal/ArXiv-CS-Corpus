Geometric definition of a new skeletonization concept

The Divider set, as an innovative alternative concept to maximal disks, Voronoi sets and cut loci, is presented with a formal definition based on topology and differential geometry. The relevant mathematical theory by previous authors and a comparison with other medial axis definitions is presented. Appropriate applications are proposed and examined.
