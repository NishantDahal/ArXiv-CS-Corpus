Conscious Intelligent Systems - Part II - Mind, Thought, Language and Understanding

This is the second part of a paper on Conscious Intelligent Systems. We use the understanding gained in the first part (Conscious Intelligent Systems Part 1: IXI (arxiv id cs.AI/0612056)) to look at understanding. We see how the presence of mind affects understanding and intelligent systems; we see that the presence of mind necessitates language. The rise of language in turn has important effects on understanding. We discuss the humanoid question and how the question of self-consciousness (and by association mind/thought/language) would affect humanoids too.
