Wikipedia: organisation from a bottom-up approach

Wikipedia can be considered as an extreme form of a self-managing team, as a means of labour division. One could expect that this bottom-up approach, with the absense of top-down organisational control, would lead to a chaos, but our analysis shows that this is not the case. In the Dutch Wikipedia, an integrated and coherent data structure is created, while at the same time users succeed in distributing roles by self-selection. Some users focus on an area of expertise, while others edit over the whole encyclopedic range. This constitutes our conclusion that Wikipedia, in general, is a successful example of a self-managing team.
