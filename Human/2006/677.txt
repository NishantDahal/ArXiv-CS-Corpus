Product Centric Holons for Synchronisation and Interoperability in Manufacturing Environments

In the last few years, lot of work has been done in order to ensure enterprise applications interoperability; however, proposed solutions focus mainly on enterprise processes. Indeed, throughout product lifecycle coordination needs to be established between reality in the physical world (physical view) and the virtual world handled by manufacturing information systems (informational view). This paper presents a holonic approach that enables synchronisation of both physical and informational views. A model driven approach for interoperability is proposed to ensure interoperability of holon based models with other applications in the enterprise.
