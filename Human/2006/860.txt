On Some Peculiarities of Dynamic Switch between Component Implementations in an Autonomic Computing System

Behavior of the delta algorithm of autonomic switch between two component implementations is considered on several examples of a client-server systems involving, in particular, periodic change of intensities of requests for the component. It is shown that in the cases of some specific combinations of elementary requests costs, the number of clients in the system, the number of requests per unit of time, and the cost of switch between the implementations, the algorithm may reveal behavior that is rather far from the desired. A sufficient criterion of a success of the algorithm is proposed based on the analysis of the accumulated implementations costs difference as a function of time. Suggestions are pointed out of practical evaluation of the algorithm functioning regarding the observations made in this paper.
