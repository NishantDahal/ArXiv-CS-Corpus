The Role of Quasi-identifiers in k-Anonymity Revisited

The concept of k-anonymity, used in the recent literature to formally evaluate the privacy preservation of published tables, was introduced based on the notion of quasi-identifiers (or QI for short). The process of obtaining k-anonymity for a given private table is first to recognize the QIs in the table, and then to anonymize the QI values, the latter being called k-anonymization. While k-anonymization is usually rigorously validated by the authors, the definition of QI remains mostly informal, and different authors seem to have different interpretations of the concept of QI. The purpose of this paper is to provide a formal underpinning of QI and examine the correctness and incorrectness of various interpretations of QI in our formal framework. We observe that in cases where the concept has been used correctly, its application has been conservative; this note provides a formal understanding of the conservative nature in such cases.
