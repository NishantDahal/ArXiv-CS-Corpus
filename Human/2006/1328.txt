A Quasigroup Based Cryptographic System

This paper presents a quasigroup encryptor that has very good scrambling properties. We show that the output of the encryptor maximizes the output entropy and the encrypted output for constant and random inputs is very similar. The system architecture of the quasigroup encryptor and the autocorrelation properties of the output sequences are provided.
