Exact Failure Frequency Calculations for Extended Systems

This paper shows how the steady-state availability and failure frequency can be calculated in a single pass for very large systems, when the availability is expressed as a product of matrices. We apply the general procedure to $k$-out-of-$n$:G and linear consecutive $k$-out-of-$n$:F systems, and to a simple ladder network in which each edge and node may fail. We also give the associated generating functions when the components have identical availabilities and failure rates. For large systems, the failure rate of the whole system is asymptotically proportional to its size. This paves the way to ready-to-use formulae for various architectures, as well as proof that the differential operator approach to failure frequency calculations is very useful and straightforward.
