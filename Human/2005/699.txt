High-performance BWT-based Encoders

In 1994, Burrows and Wheeler developed a data compression algorithm which performs significantly better than Lempel-Ziv based algorithms. Since then, a lot of work has been done in order to improve their algorithm, which is based on a reversible transformation of the input string, called BWT (the Burrows-Wheeler transformation). In this paper, we propose a compression scheme based on BWT, MTF (move-to-front coding), and a version of the algorithms presented in [Dragos Trinca, ITCC-2004].
