Yet another normalisation proof for Martin-Lof's logical framework--Terms with correct arities are strongly normalising

In this paper, we prove the strong normalisation for Martin-LÃ¶f's Logical Framework, and suggest that {}``correct arity'', a condition weaker than well-typedness, will also guarantee the strong normalisation.
