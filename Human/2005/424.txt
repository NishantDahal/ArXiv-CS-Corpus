Methods for comparing rankings of search engine results

In this paper we present a number of measures that compare rankings of search engine results. We apply these measures to five queries that were monitored daily for two periods of about 21 days each. Rankings of the different search engines (Google, Yahoo and Teoma for text searches and Google, Yahoo and Picsearch for image searches) are compared on a daily basis, in addition to longitudinal comparisons of the same engine for the same query over time. The results and rankings of the two periods are compared as well.
