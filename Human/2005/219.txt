Construction of Small Worlds in the Physical Topology of Wireless Networks

The concept of small worlds is introduced into the physical topology of wireless networks in this work. A. Helmy provided two con- struction schemes of small worlds for the wireless networks, link rewiring and link addition, but he mainly focused on the virtual topology. Based on the broadcasting nature of the radio transmission, we propose a con- struction scheme of small worlds for the physical topology of Multiple- Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless networks. Besides the topology- related topics, we also evaluate the reduction of the power required by a request.
