location.location.location: Internet Addresses as Evolving Property

I describe recent developments in the rules governing registration and ownership of Internet and World Wide Web addresses or "domain names." I consider the idea that "virtual" properties like domain names are more similar to real estate than to trademarks. Therefore, it would be economically efficient to grant domain name owners stronger rights than those of trademarks and copyright holders.
