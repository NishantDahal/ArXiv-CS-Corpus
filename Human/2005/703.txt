A 3D RGB Axis-based Color-oriented Cryptography

In this document, a formal approach to encrypt, decrypt, transmit and receive information using colors is explored. A piece of information consists of set of symbols with a definite property imposed on the generating set. The symbols are usually encoded using ascii scheme. A linear to 3d transformation is presented. The change of axis from traditional xyz to rgb is highlighted and its effect are studied. A point in this new axis is then represented as a unique color and a vector or matrix is associated with it, making it amenable to standard vector or matrix operations. A formal notion on hybrid cryptography is introduced as the algorithm lies on the boundary of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. No discussion is complete, without mentioning reference to communication aspects of secure information in a channel. Transmission scheme pertaining to light as carrier is introduced and studied. Key-exchanges do not come under the scope of current frame of document.
