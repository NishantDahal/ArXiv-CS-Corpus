On computational complexity of Siegel Julia sets

It has been previously shown by two of the authors that some polynomial Julia sets are algorithmically impossible to draw with arbitrary magnification. On the other hand, for a large class of examples the problem of drawing a picture has polynomial complexity. In this paper we demonstrate the existence of computable quadratic Julia sets whose computational complexity is arbitrarily high.
