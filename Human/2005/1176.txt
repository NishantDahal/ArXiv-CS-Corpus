A fast algorithm for determining the linear complexity of periodic sequences

A fast algorithm is presented for determining the linear complexity and the minimal polynomial of periodic sequences over GF(q) with period q n p m, where p is a prime, q is a prime and a primitive root modulo p2. The algorithm presented here generalizes both the algorithm in [4] where the period of a sequence over GF(q) is p m and the algorithm in [5] where the period of a binary sequence is 2 n p m . When m=0, the algorithm simplifies the generalized Games-Chan algorithm.
