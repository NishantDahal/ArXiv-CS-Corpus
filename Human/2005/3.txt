Spike timing precision and neural error correction: local behavior

The effects of spike timing precision and dynamical behavior on error correction in spiking neurons were investigated. Stationary discharges -- phase locked, quasiperiodic, or chaotic -- were induced in a simulated neuron by presenting pacemaker presynaptic spike trains across a model of a prototypical inhibitory synapse. Reduced timing precision was modeled by jittering presynaptic spike times. Aftereffects of errors -- in this communication, missed presynaptic spikes -- were determined by comparing postsynaptic spike times between simulations identical except for the presence or absence of errors. Results show that the effects of an error vary greatly depending on the ongoing dynamical behavior. In the case of phase lockings, a high degree of presynaptic spike timing precision can provide significantly faster error recovery. For non-locked behaviors, isolated missed spikes can have little or no discernible aftereffects (or even serve to paradoxically reduce uncertainty in postsynaptic spike timing), regardless of presynaptic imprecision. This suggests two possible categories of error correction: high-precision locking with rapid recovery and low-precision non-locked with error immunity.
