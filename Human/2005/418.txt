Optimum Signal Linear Detector in the Discrete Wavelet Transform-Domain

The problem of known signal detection in Additive White Gaussian Noise is considered. In this paper a new detection algorithm based on Discrete Wavelet Transform pre-processing and threshold comparison is introduced. Current approaches described in [7] use the maximum value obtained in the wavelet domain for decision. Here, we use all available information in the wavelet domain with excellent results. Detector performance is presented in Probability of detection curves for a fixed probability of false alarm.
