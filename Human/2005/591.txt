The Entropy of a Binary Hidden Markov Process

The entropy of a binary symmetric Hidden Markov Process is calculated as an expansion in the noise parameter epsilon. We map the problem onto a one-dimensional Ising model in a large field of random signs and calculate the expansion coefficients up to second order in epsilon. Using a conjecture we extend the calculation to 11th order and discuss the convergence of the resulting series.
