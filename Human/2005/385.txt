Parallel Programming with Matrix Distributed Processing

Matrix Distributed Processing (MDP) is a C++ library for fast development of efficient parallel algorithms. It constitues the core of FermiQCD. MDP enables programmers to focus on algorithms, while parallelization is dealt with automatically and transparently. Here we present a brief overview of MDP and examples of applications in Computer Science (Cellular Automata), Engineering (PDE Solver) and Physics (Ising Model).
