Enriching a Text by Semantic Disambiguation for Information Extraction

External linguistic resources have been used for a very long time in information extraction. These methods enrich a document with data that are semantically equivalent, in order to improve recall. For instance, some of these methods use synonym dictionaries. These dictionaries enrich a sentence with words that have a similar meaning. However, these methods present some serious drawbacks, since words are usually synonyms only in restricted contexts. The method we propose here consists of using word sense disambiguation rules (WSD) to restrict the selection of synonyms to only these that match a specific syntactico-semantic context. We show how WSD rules are built and how information extraction techniques can benefit from the application of these rules.
