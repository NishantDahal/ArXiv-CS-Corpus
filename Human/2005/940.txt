Defining a Comprehensive Threat Model for High Performance Computational Clusters

Over the past decade, high performance computational (HPC) clusters have become mainstream in academic and industrial settings as accessible means of computation. Throughout their proliferation, HPC security has been a secondary concern to performance. It is evident, however, that ensuring HPC security presents different challenges than the ones faced when dealing with traditional networks. To design suitable security measures for high performance computing, it is necessary to first realize the threats faced by such an environment. This task can be accomplished by the means of constructing a comprehensive threat model. To our knowledge, no such threat model exists with regards to Cluster Computing. In this paper, we explore the unique challenges of securing HPCs and propose a threat model based on the classical Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability security principles.
