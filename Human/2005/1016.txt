Self-synchronization of Cellular Automata: an attempt to control patterns

The searching for the stable patterns in the evolution of cellular automata is implemented using stochastic synchronization between the present structures of the system and its precedent configurations. For most of the known evolution rules with complex behavior a dynamic competition among all the possible stable patterns is established and no stationary regime is reached. For the particular rule coded by the decimal number 18, a self-synchronization phenomenon can be obtained, even when strong modifications to the synchronization method are applied.
