Comparison of two different implementations of a finite-difference-method for first-order pde in mathematica and matlab

In this article two implementations of a symmetric finite difference algorithm for a first-order partial differential equation are discussed. The considered partial differential equation discribes the time evolution of the crack length distribution of microcracks in brittle materia.
