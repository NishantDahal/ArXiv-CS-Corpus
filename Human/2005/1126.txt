Reversible CAM Processor Modeled After Quantum Computer Behavior

Proposed below is a reversible digital computer modeled after the natural behavior of a quantum system. Using approaches usually reserved for idealized quantum computers, the Reversible CAM, or State Vector Parallel (RSVP) processor can easily find keywords in an unstructured database (that is, it can solve a needle in a haystack problem). The RSVP processor efficiently solves a SAT (Satisfiability of Boolean Formulae) problem; also it can aid in the solution of a GP (Global Properties of Truth Table) problem. The power delay product of the RSVP processor is exponentially lower than that of a standard CAM programmed to perform similar operations.
