Generalized Laplace transformations and integration of hyperbolic systems of linear partial differential equations

We give a new procedure for generalized factorization and construction of the complete solution of strictly hyperbolic linear partial differential equations or strictly hyperbolic systems of such equations in the plane. This procedure generalizes the classical theory of Laplace transformations of second-order equations in the plane.
