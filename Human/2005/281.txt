A Distributed Multimedia Communication System and its Applications to E-Learning

In this paper we report on a multimedia communication system including a VCoIP (Video Conferencing over IP) software with a distributed architecture and its applications for teaching scenarios. It is a simple, ready-to-use scheme for distributed presenting, recording and streaming multimedia content. We also introduce and investigate concepts and experiments to IPv6 user and session mobility, with the special focus on real-time video group communication.
