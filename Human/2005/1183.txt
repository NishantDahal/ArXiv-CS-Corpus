A Software Framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Applications

A growing category of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative (VIC) applications requires telematics software components distributed between an infrastructure-based management center and a number of vehicles. This article presents an approach based on a software framework, focusing on a Telematic Management System (TMS), a component suite aimed to run inside an infrastructure-based operations center, in some cases interacting with legacy systems like Advanced Traffic Management Systems or Vehicle Relationship Management. The TMS framework provides support for modular, flexible, prototyping and implementation of VIC applications. This work has received the support of the European Commission in the context of the projects REACT and CyberCars.
