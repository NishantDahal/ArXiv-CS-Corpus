Processing Uncertainty and Indeterminacy in Information Systems success mapping

IS success is a complex concept, and its evaluation is complicated, unstructured and not readily quantifiable. Numerous scientific publications address the issue of success in the IS field as well as in other fields. But, little efforts have been done for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. This paper shows a formal method for mapping success using Neutrosophic Success Map. This is an emerging tool for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. EIS success have been analyzed using this tool.
