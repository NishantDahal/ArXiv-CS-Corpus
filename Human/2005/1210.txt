General non-asymptotic and asymptotic formulas in channel resolvability and identification capacity and their application to wire-tap channel

Several non-asymptotic formulas are established in channel resolvability and identification capacity, and they are applied to wire-tap channel. By using these formulas, the $Îµ$ capacities of the above three problems are considered in the most general setting, where no structural assumptions such as the stationary memoryless property are made on a channel. As a result, we solve an open problem proposed in Han & Verdu and Han. Moreover, we obtain lower bounds of the exponents of error probability and the wire-tapper's information in wire-tap channel.
