Long-term neuronal behavior caused by two synaptic modification mechanisms

We report the first results of simulating the coupling of neuronal, astrocyte, and cerebrovascular activity. It is suggested that the dynamics of the system is different from systems that only include neurons. In the neuron-vascular coupling, distribution of synapse strengths affects neuronal behavior and thus balance of the blood flow; oscillations are induced in the neuron-to-astrocyte coupling.
