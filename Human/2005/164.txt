Identification of complex systems in the basis of wavelets

In this paper is proposed the method of the identification of complex dynamic systems. Method can be used for the identification of linear and nonlinear complex dynamic systems for the determined or stochastic signals at the inputs and the outputs. It is proposed to use a basis of wavelets for obtaining the impulse transient function (ITF) of system. ITF is considered in the form of surface in the 3D space. Are given the results of experiments on the identification of systems in the basis of wavelets.
