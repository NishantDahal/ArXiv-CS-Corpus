On the existence of truly autonomic computing systems and the link with quantum computing

A theoretical model of truly autonomic computing systems (ACS), with infinitely many constraints, is proposed. An argument similar to Turing's for the unsolvability of the halting problem, which is permitted in classical logic, shows that such systems cannot exist. Turing's argument fails in the recently proposed non-Aristotelian finitary logic (NAFL), which permits the existence of ACS. NAFL also justifies quantum superposition and entanglement, which are essential ingredients of quantum algorithms, and resolves the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox in favour of quantum mechanics and non-locality. NAFL requires that the autonomic manager (AM) must be conceptually and architecturally distinct from the managed element, in order for the ACS to exist as a non-self-referential entity. Such a scenario is possible if the AM uses quantum algorithms and is protected from all problems by (unbreakable) quantum encryption, while the managed element remains classical. NAFL supports such a link between autonomic and quantum computing, with the AM existing as a metamathematical entity. NAFL also allows quantum algorithms to access truly random elements and thereby supports non-standard models of quantum (hyper-) computation that permit infinite parallelism.
