Emergent Statistical Wealth Distributions in Simple Monetary Exchange Models: A Critical Review

This paper reviews recent attempts at modelling inequality of wealth as an emergent phenomenon of interacting-agent processes. We point out that recent models of wealth condensation which draw their inspiration from molecular dynamics have, in fact, reinvented a process introduced quite some time ago by Angle (1986) in the sociological literature. We emphasize some problematic aspects of simple wealth exchange models and contrast them with a monetary model based on economic principles of market mediated exchange. The paper also reports new results on the influence of market power on the wealth distribution in statistical equilibrium. As it turns out, inequality increases but market power alone is not sufficient for changing the exponential tails of simple exchange models into Pareto tails.
