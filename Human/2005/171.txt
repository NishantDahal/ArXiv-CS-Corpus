Corpus based Enrichment of GermaNet Verb Frames

Lexical semantic resources, like WordNet, are often used in real applications of natural language document processing. For example, we integrated GermaNet in our document suite XDOC of processing of German forensic autopsy protocols. In addition to the hypernymy and synonymy relation, we want to adapt GermaNet's verb frames for our analysis. In this paper we outline an approach for the domain related enrichment of GermaNet verb frames by corpus based syntactic and co-occurred data analyses of real documents.
