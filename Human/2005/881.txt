Cobweb posets as noncommutative prefabs

A class of new type graded infinite posets with minimal element are considered. These so called cobweb posets introduced recently by the present author provide a wide range of new noncommutative prefab combinatorial schema with characteristic graded subposets as primes. The schema are defined here via relaxing commutativity and associativity requirements imposed on the composition of prefabs by the fathers of this fertile concept. The construction and the very first basic properties of cobweb prefabs are pointed out in what follows. An another single valued commutative amd associative composision is also considered.
