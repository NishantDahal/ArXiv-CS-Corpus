On umbral extensions of Stirling numbers and Dobinski-like formulas

Umbral extensions of the stirling numbers of the second kind are considered and the resulting dobinski-like various formulas including new ones are presented. These extensions naturally encompass the two well known q-extensions. The further consecutive umbral extensions q-stirling numbers are therefore realized here in a two-fold way. The fact that the umbral q-extended dobinski formula may also be interpreted as the average of powers of random variable with the q-poisson distribution singles out the q-extensions which appear to be a kind of singular point in the domain of umbral extensions as expressed by corresponding two observations. Other relevant possibilities are tackled with the paper`s closing down questions and suggestions with respect to other already existing extensions while a brief limited survey of these other type extensions is being delivered. There the newton interpolation formula and divided differences appear helpful and inevitable along with umbra symbolic language in describing properties of general exponential polynomials of touchard and their possible generalizations. Exponential structures or algebraically equivalent prefabs with their exponential formula appear to be also naturally relevant.
