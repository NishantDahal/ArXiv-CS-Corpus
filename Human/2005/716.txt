Can Small Museums Develop Compelling, Educational and Accessible Web Resources? The Case of Accademia Carrara

Due to the lack of budget, competence, personnel and time, small museums are often unable to develop compelling, educational and accessible web resources for their permanent collections or temporary exhibitions. In an attempt to prove that investing in these types of resources can be very fruitful even for small institutions, we will illustrate the case of Accademia Carrara, a museum in Bergamo, northern Italy, which, for a current temporary exhibition on Cezanne and Renoir's masterpieces from the Paul Guillaume collection, developed a series of multimedia applications, including an accessible website, rich in content and educational material [www.cezannerenoir.it].
