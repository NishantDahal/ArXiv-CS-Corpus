Optimizing semiconductor devices by self-organizing particle swarm

A self-organizing particle swarm is presented. It works in dissipative state by employing the small inertia weight, according to experimental analysis on a simplified model, which with fast convergence. Then by recognizing and replacing inactive particles according to the process deviation information of device parameters, the fluctuation is introduced so as to driving the irreversible evolution process with better fitness. The testing on benchmark functions and an application example for device optimization with designed fitness function indicates it improves the performance effectively.
