Automatic extraction of paraphrastic phrases from medium size corpora

This paper presents a versatile system intended to acquire paraphrastic phrases from a representative corpus. In order to decrease the time spent on the elaboration of resources for NLP system (for example Information Extraction, IE hereafter), we suggest to use a machine learning system that helps defining new templates and associated resources. This knowledge is automatically derived from the text collection, in interaction with a large semantic network.
