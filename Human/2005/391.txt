On the Solution of Graph Isomorphism by Dynamical Algorithms

In the recent years, several polynomial algorithms of a dynamical nature have been proposed to address the graph isomorphism problem. In this paper we propose a generalization of an approach exposed in cond-mat/0209112 and find that this dynamical algorithm is covered by a combinatorial approach. It is possible to infer that polynomial dynamical algorithms addressing graph isomorphism are covered by suitable polynomial combinatorial approaches and thus are tackled by the same weaknesses as the last ones.
