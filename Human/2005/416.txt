Improved Combinatorial Group Testing Algorithms for Real-World Problem Sizes

We study practically efficient methods for performing combinatorial group testing. We present efficient non-adaptive and two-stage combinatorial group testing algorithms, which identify the at most d items out of a given set of n items that are defective, using fewer tests for all practical set sizes. For example, our two-stage algorithm matches the information theoretic lower bound for the number of tests in a combinatorial group testing regimen.
