An Example of Clifford Algebras Calculations with GiNaC

This example of Clifford algebras calculations uses GiNaC (http://www.ginac.de/) library, which includes a support for generic Clifford algebra starting from version~1.3.0. Both symbolic and numeric calculation are possible and can be blended with other functions of GiNaC. This calculations was made for the paper math.CV/0410399.
 Described features of GiNaC are already available at PyGiNaC (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyginac/) and due to course should propagate into other software like GNU Octave (http://www.octave.org/), gTybalt (http://www.fis.unipr.it/~stefanw/gtybalt.html), which use GiNaC library as their back-end.
