Multipartite Secret Correlations and Bound Information

We consider the problem of secret key extraction when $n$ honest parties and an eavesdropper share correlated information. We present a family of probability distributions and give the full characterization of its distillation properties. This formalism allows us to design a rich variety of cryptographic scenarios. In particular, we provide examples of multipartite probability distributions containing non-distillable secret correlations, also known as bound information.
