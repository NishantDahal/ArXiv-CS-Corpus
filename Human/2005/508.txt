Measuring Woody: The Size of Debian 3.0

Debian is possibly the largest free software distribution, with well over 4,500 source packages in the latest stable release (Debian 3.0) and more than 8,000 source packages in the release currently in preparation. However, we wish to know what these numbers mean. In this paper, we use David A. Wheeler's SLOCCount system to determine the number of physical source lines of code (SLOC) of Debian 3.0 (aka woody). We show that Debian 3.0 includes more than 105,000,000 physical SLOC (almost twice than Red Hat 9, released about 8 months later), showing that the Debian development model (based on the work of a large group of voluntary developers spread around the world) is at least as capable as other development methods (like the more centralized one, based on the work of employees, used by Red Hat or Microsoft) to manage distributions of this size.
  It is also shown that if Debian had been developed using traditional proprietary methods, the COCOMO model estimates that its cost would be close to $6.1 billion USD to develop Debian 3.0. In addition, we offer both an analysis of the programming languages used in the distribution (C amounts for about 65%, C++ for about 12%, Shell for about 8% and LISP is around 4%, with many others to follow), and the largest packages (The Linux kernel, Mozilla, XFree86, PM3, etc.)
