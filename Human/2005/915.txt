Applying Evolutionary Optimisation to Robot Obstacle Avoidance

This paper presents an artificial evolutionbased method for stereo image analysis and its application to real-time obstacle detection and avoidance for a mobile robot. It uses the Parisian approach, which consists here in splitting the representation of the robot's environment into a large number of simple primitives, the "flies", which are evolved following a biologically inspired scheme and give a fast, low-cost solution to the obstacle detection problem in mobile robotics.
