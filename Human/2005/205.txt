Improved message passing for inference in densely connected systems

An improved inference method for densely connected systems is presented. The approach is based on passing condensed messages between variables, representing macroscopic averages of microscopic messages. We extend previous work that showed promising results in cases where the solution space is contiguous to cases where fragmentation occurs. We apply the method to the signal detection problem of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) for demonstrating its potential. A highly efficient practical algorithm is also derived on the basis of insight gained from the analysis.
