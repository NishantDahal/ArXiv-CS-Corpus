Cryptanalysis of Key Issuing Protocols in ID-based Cryptosystems

To remove key escrow problem and avoid the need of secure channel in ID based cryptosystem Lee et al. proposed a secure key issuing protocol. However we show that it suffers from impersonation, insider attacks and incompetency of the key privacy authorities. We also cryptanalyze Sui et al.'s separable and anonymous key issuing protocol.
