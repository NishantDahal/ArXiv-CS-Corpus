The Peculiarities of Nonstationary Formation of Inhomogeneous Structures of Charged Particles in the Electrodiffusion Processes

In this paper the distribution of charged particles is constructed under the approximation of ambipolar diffusion. The results of mathematical modelling in two-dimensional case taking into account the velocities of the system are presented.
