A generalized skew information and uncertainty relation

A generalized skew information is defined and a generalized uncertainty relation is established with the help of a trace inequality which was recently proven by J.I.Fujii. In addition, we prove the trace inequality conjectured by S.Luo and Z.Zhang. Finally we point out that Theorem 1 in {\it S.Luo and Q.Zhang, IEEE Trans.IT, Vol.50, pp.1778-1782 (2004)} is incorrect in general, by giving a simple counter-example.
