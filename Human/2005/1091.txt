A Survey of Virtualization Techniques Focusing on Secure On-Demand Cluster Computing

Virtualization, a technique once used to multiplex the resources of high-priced mainframe hardware, is seeing a resurgence in applicability with the increasing computing power of commodity computers. By inserting a layer of software between the machine and traditional operating systems, this technology allows access to a shared computing medium in a manner that is secure, resource-controlled, and efficient. These properties are attractive in the field of on-demand computing, where the fine-grained subdivision of resources provided by virtualized systems allows potentially higher utilization of computing resources.
  It this work, we survey a number of virtual machine systems with the goal of finding an appropriate candidate to serve as the basis for the On-Demand Secure Cluster Computing project at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. Contenders are reviewed on a number of desirable properties including portability and security. We conclude with a comparison and justification of our choice.
