Solving Satisfiability Problems by the Ground-State Quantum Computer

A quantum algorithm is proposed to solve the Satisfiability problems by the ground-state quantum computer. The scale of the energy gap of the ground-state quantum computer is analyzed for the 3-bit Exact Cover problem. The time cost of this algorithm on the general SAT problems is discussed.
