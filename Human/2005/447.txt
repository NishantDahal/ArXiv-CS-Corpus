Adaptive Codes: A New Class of Non-standard Variable-length Codes

We introduce a new class of non-standard variable-length codes, called adaptive codes. This class of codes associates a variable-length codeword to the symbol being encoded depending on the previous symbols in the input data string. An efficient algorithm for constructing adaptive codes of order one is presented. Then, we introduce a natural generalization of adaptive codes, called GA codes.
