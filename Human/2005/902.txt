Prefab posets` Whitney numbers

We introduce a natural partial order in structurally natural finite subsets the cobweb prefabs sets recently constructed by the present author. Whitney numbers of the second kind of the corresponding subposet which constitute Stirling-like numbers` triangular array are then calculated and the explicit formula for them is provided. Next - in the second construction - we endow the set sums of prefabiants with such an another partial order that their their bell like numbers include fibonacci triad sequences introduced recently by the present author in order to extend famous relation between binomial newton coefficients and fibonacci numbers onto the infinity of their relatives among which there are also the fibonacci triad sequences and binomial-like coefficients (incidence coefficients included).
