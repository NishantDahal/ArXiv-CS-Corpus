COMODI: On the Graphical User Interface

We propose a series of features for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the COmputational MOdule Integrator (COMODI) \cite{Synasc05a}\cite{COMODI}. In view of the special requirements that a COMODI type of framework for scientific computing imposes and inspiring from existing solutions that provide advanced graphical visual programming environments, we identify those elements and associated behaviors that will have to find their way into the first release of COMODI.
