Logic Column 13: Reasoning Formally about Quantum Systems: An Overview

This article is intended as an introduction to the subject of quantum logic, and as a brief survey of the relevant literature. Also discussed here are logics for specification and analysis of quantum information systems, in particular, recent work by P. Mateus and A. Sernadas, and also by R. van der Meyden and M. Patra. Overall, our objective is to provide a high-level presentation of the logical aspects of quantum theory. Mateus' and Sernadas' EQPL logic is illustrated with a small example, namely the state of an entangled pair of qubits. The "KT" logic of van der Meyden and Patra is demonstrated briefly in the context of the B92 protocol for quantum key distribution.
