MAEC : A Movement-Assisted Energy Conserving Method in Event Driven Wireless Sensor Networks

Energy is one of the most important resources in wireless sensor networks. Recently, the mobility of base station has been exploited to preserve the energy. But in event driven networks, the mobility issue is quite different from the continuous monitoring one because only a small portion of sensor node has data to send at one time. The number of sensor node that forward traffic should be minimized to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a movement-assisted energy conserving method which tries to reduce the amount of forwarding sensor node by directing the base station to move close to the hotspots. This method achieves good performance especially when applied to a network with a set of cooperative mobile base station. Extensive simulation has been done to verify the effectiveness of the propose schema.
