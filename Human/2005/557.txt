Authentication and routing in simple Quantum Key Distribution networks

We consider various issues which arise as soon as one tries to practically implement simple networks of quantum relays for QKD. In particular we discuss authentication and routing which are essential ingredients of any QKD network. This paper aims to address some gaps between quantum and networking aspects of QKD networks usually reserved to specialist in physics and computer science respectively.
