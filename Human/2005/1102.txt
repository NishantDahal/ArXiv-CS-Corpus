Chosen-ciphertext attack on noncommutative Polly Cracker

We propose a chosen-ciphertext attack on recently presented noncommutative variant of the well-known Polly Cracker cryptosystem. We show that if one chooses parameters for this noncommutative Polly Cracker as initially proposed, than the system should be claimed as insecure.
