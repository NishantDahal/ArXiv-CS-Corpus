Quantum Information Theoretical Analysis of Various Constructions for Quantum Secret Sharing

Recently, an information theoretical model for Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS) schemes was introduced. By using this model, we prove that pure state Quantum Threshold Schemes (QTS) can be constructed from quantum MDS codes and vice versa. In particular, we consider stabilizer codes and give a constructive proof of their relation with QTS. Furthermore, we reformulate the Monotone Span Program (MSP) construction according to the information theoretical model and check the recoverability and secrecy requirement. Finally, we consider QSS schemes which are based on quantum teleportation.
