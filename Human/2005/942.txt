On Minimal Pseudo-Codewords of Tanner Graphs from Projective Planes

We would like to better understand the fundamental cone of Tanner graphs derived from finite projective planes. Towards this goal, we discuss bounds on the AWGNC and BSC pseudo-weight of minimal pseudo-codewords of such Tanner graphs, on one hand, and study the structure of minimal pseudo-codewords, on the other.
