Text Compression and Superfast Searching

In this paper, a new compression scheme for text is presented. The same is efficient in giving high compression ratios and enables super fast searching within the compressed text. Typical compression ratios of 70-80% and reducing the search time by 80-85% are the features of this paper. Till now, a trade-off between high ratios and searchability within compressed text has been seen. In this paper, we show that greater the compression, faster the search. This finds applicability in so many places where data as natural language text is present.
