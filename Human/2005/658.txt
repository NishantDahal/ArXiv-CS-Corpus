On a Duality between Metrics and $Σ$-Proximities

: In studies of discrete structures, functions are frequently used that express proximity, but are not metrics. We consider a class of such functions that is characterized by a normalization condition and an inequality that plays the same role as the triangle inequality does for metrics. We show that the introduced functions, named $Σ$-proximities, are in a definite sense dual to metrics: there exists a natural one-to-one correspondence between metrics and $Σ$-proximities defined on the same finite set; in contrast to metrics, $Σ$-proximities measure {\it comparative} proximity; the closer the objects, the greater the $Σ$-proximity; diagonal entries of the $Σ$-proximity matrix characterize the ``centrality'' of elements. The results are extended to arbitrary infinite sets.
