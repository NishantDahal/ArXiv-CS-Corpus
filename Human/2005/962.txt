Sur le statut référentiel des entités nommées

We show in this paper that, on the one hand, named entities can be designated using different denominations and that, on the second hand, names denoting named entities are polysemous. The analysis cannot be limited to reference resolution but should take into account naming strategies, which are mainly based on two linguistic operations: synecdoche and metonymy. Lastly, we present a model that explicitly represents the different denominations in discourse, unifying the way to represent linguistic knowledge and world knowledge.
