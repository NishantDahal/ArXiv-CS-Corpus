An Efficient Scheme for Sensitive Message Transmission using Blind Signcryption

Blind signature schemes enable a useful protocol that guarantee the anonymity of the participants while Signcryption offers authentication of message and confidentiality of messages at the same time and more efficiently. In this paper, we present a blind signcryption scheme that combines the functionality of blind signature and signcryption. This blind Signcryption is useful for applications that are based on anonymity untracebility and unlinkability.
