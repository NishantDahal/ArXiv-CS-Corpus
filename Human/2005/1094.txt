Evolutionary Computing

Evolutionary computing (EC) is an exciting development in Computer Science. It amounts to building, applying and studying algorithms based on the Darwinian principles of natural selection. In this paper we briefly introduce the main concepts behind evolutionary computing. We present the main components all evolutionary algorithms (EA), sketch the differences between different types of EAs and survey application areas ranging from optimization, modeling and simulation to entertainment.
