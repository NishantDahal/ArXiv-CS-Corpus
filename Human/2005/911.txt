Virtual Environments for multiphysics code validation on Computing Grids

We advocate in this paper the use of grid-based infrastructures that are designed for seamless approaches to the numerical expert users, i.e., the multiphysics applications designers. It relies on sophisticated computing environments based on computing grids, connecting heterogeneous computing resources: mainframes, PC-clusters and workstations running multiphysics codes and utility software, e.g., visualization tools. The approach is based on concepts defined by the HEAVEN* consortium. HEAVEN is a European scientific consortium including industrial partners from the aerospace, telecommunication and software industries, as well as academic research institutes. Currently, the HEAVEN consortium works on a project that aims to create advanced services platforms. It is intended to enable "virtual private grids" supporting various environments for users manipulating a suitable high-level interface. This will become the basis for future generalized services allowing the integration of various services without the need to deploy specific grid infrastructures.
