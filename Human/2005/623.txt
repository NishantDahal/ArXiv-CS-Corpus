Minimizing makespan in flowshop with time lags

We consider the problem of minimizing the makespan in a flowshop involving maximal and minimal time lags. Time lag constraints generalize the classical precedence constraints between operations. We assume that such constraints are only defined between operations of the same job. We propose a solution method and present several extensions.
