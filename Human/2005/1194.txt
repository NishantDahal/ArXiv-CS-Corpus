Amazing geometry of genetic space or are genetic algorithms convergent?

There is no proof yet of convergence of Genetic Algorithms. We do not supply it too. Instead, we present some thoughts and arguments to convince the Reader, that Genetic Algorithms are essentially bound for success. For this purpose, we consider only the crossover operators, single- or multiple-point, together with selection procedure. We also give a proof that the soft selection is superior to other selection schemes.
