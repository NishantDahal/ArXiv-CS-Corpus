Exploitation de dictionnaires électroniques pour la désambiguïsation sémantique lexicale

This paper presents a lexical disambiguation system, initially developed for English and now adapted to French. This system associates a word with its meaning in a given context using electronic dictionaries as semantically annotated corpora in order to extract semantic disambiguation rules. We describe the rule extraction and application process as well as the evaluation of the system. The results for French give us insight information on some possible improvments of the nature and content of lexical resources adapted for disambiguation in this framework.
