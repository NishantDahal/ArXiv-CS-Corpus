New Tales of the Mean King

The Mean King's problem asks to determine the outcome of a measurement that is randomly selected from a set of complementary observables. We review this problem and offer a combinatorial solution. More generally, we show that whenever an affine resolvable design exists, then a state reconstruction problem similar to the Mean King's problem can be defined and solved. As an application of this general framework we consider a problem involving three qubits in which the outcome of nine different measurements can be determined without using ancillary qubits. The solution is based on a measurement derived from Hadamard designs.
