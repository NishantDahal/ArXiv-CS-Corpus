Toward Compact Interdomain Routing

Despite prevailing concerns that the current Internet interdomain routing system will not scale to meet the needs of the 21st century global Internet, networking research has not yet led to the construction of a new routing architecture with satisfactory and mathematically provable scalability characteristics. Worse, continuing empirical trends of the existing routing and topology structure of the Internet are alarming: the foundational principles of the current routing and addressing architecture are an inherently bad match for the naturally evolving structure of Internet interdomain topology. We are fortunate that a sister discipline, theory of distributed computation, has developed routing algorithms that offer promising potential for genuinely scalable routing on realistic Internet-like topologies. Indeed, there are many recent breakthroughs in the area of compact routing, which has been shown to drastically outperform, in terms of efficiency and scalability, even the boldest proposals developed in networking research. Many open questions remain, but we believe the applicability of compact routing techniques to Internet interdomain routing is a research area whose potential payoff for the future of networking is too high to ignore.
