A Categorical Quantum Logic

We define a strongly normalising proof-net calculus corresponding to the logic of strongly compact closed categories with biproducts. The calculus is a full and faithful representation of the free strongly compact closed category with biproducts on a given category with an involution. This syntax can be used to represent and reason about quantum processes.
