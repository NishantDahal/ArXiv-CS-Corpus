A Generalised Hadamard Transform

A Generalised Hadamard Transform for multi-phase or multilevel signals is introduced, which includes the Fourier, Generalised, Discrete Fourier, Walsh-Hadamard and Reverse Jacket Transforms. The jacket construction is formalised and shown to admit a tensor product decomposition. Primary matrices under this decomposition are identified. New examples of primary jacket matrices of orders 8 and 12 are presented.
