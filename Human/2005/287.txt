A New Remote User Authentication Scheme Using Smart Cards with Check Digits

Since 1981, when Lamport introduced the remote user authentication scheme using table, a plenty of schemes had been proposed with table and without table using. In 1993, Chang and Wu [5] introduced Remote password authentication scheme with smart cards. A number of remote authentication schemes with smart cards have been proposed since then. These schemes allow a valid user to login a remote server and access the services provided by the remote server. But still there is no scheme to authenticate the remote proxy user. In this paper we propose firstly, a protocol to authenticate a proxy user remotely using smartcards.
