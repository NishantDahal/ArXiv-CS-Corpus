A Monte Carlo algorithm for efficient large matrix inversion

This paper introduces a new Monte Carlo algorithm to invert large matrices. It is based on simultaneous coupled draws from two random vectors whose covariance is the required inverse. It can be considered a generalization of a previously reported algorithm for hermitian matrices inversion based in only one draw. The use of two draws allows the inversion on non-hermitian matrices. Both the conditions for convergence and the rate of convergence are similar to the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. Results on two examples are presented, a real non-symmetric matrix related to quantitative genetics and a complex non-hermitian matrix relevant for physicists. Compared with other Monte Carlo algorithms it reveals a large reduction of the processing time showing eight times faster processing in the examples studied.
