An Objectives-Driven Process for Selecting Methods to Support Requirements Engineering Activities

This paper presents a framework that guides the requirements engineer in the implementation and execution of an effective requirements generation process. We achieve this goal by providing a well-defined requirements engineering model and a criteria based process for optimizing method selection for attendant activities. Our model, unlike other models, addresses the complete requirements generation process and consists of activities defined at more adequate levels of abstraction. Additionally, activity objectives are identified and explicitly stated - not implied as in the current models. Activity objectives are crucial as they drive the selection of methods for each activity. Our model also incorporates a unique approach to verification and validation that enhances quality and reduces the cost of generating requirements. To assist in the selection of methods, we have mapped commonly used methods to activities based on their objectives. In addition, we have identified method selection criteria and prescribed a reduced set of methods that optimize these criteria for each activity defined by our requirements generation process. Thus, the defined approach assists in the task of selecting methods by using selection criteria to reduce a large collection of potential methods to a smaller, manageable set. The model and the set of methods, taken together, provide the much needed guidance for the effective implementation and execution of the requirements generation process.
