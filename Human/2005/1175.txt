Generalized partially bent functions

Based on the definition of generalized partially bent functions, using the theory of linear transformation, the relationship among generalized partially bent functions over ring Z N, generalized bent functions over ring Z N and affine functions is discussed. When N is a prime number, it is proved that a generalized partially bent function can be decomposed as the addition of a generalized bent function and an affine function. The result obtained here generalizes the main works concerning partially bent functions by Claud Carlet in [1].
