Programmable Quantum Networks with Pure States

Modern classical computing devices, except of simplest calculators, have von Neumann architecture, i.e., a part of the memory is used for the program and a part for the data. It is likely, that analogues of such architecture are also desirable for the future applications in quantum computing, communications and control. It is also interesting for the modern theoretical research in the quantum information science and raises challenging questions about an experimental assessment of such a programmable models. Together with some progress in the given direction, such ideas encounter specific problems arising from the very essence of quantum laws. Currently are known two different ways to overcome such problems, sometime denoted as a stochastic and deterministic approach. The presented paper is devoted to the second one, that is also may be called the programmable quantum networks with pure states.
  In the paper are discussed basic principles and theoretical models that can be used for the design of such nano-devices, e.g., the conditional quantum dynamics, the Nielsen-Chuang "no-programming theorem, the idea of deterministic and stochastic quantum gates arrays. Both programmable quantum networks with finite registers and hybrid models with continuous quantum variables are considered. As a basic model for the universal programmable quantum network with pure states and finite program register is chosen a "Control-Shift" quantum processor architecture with three buses introduced in earlier works. It is shown also, that quantum cellular automata approach to the construction of an universal programmable quantum computer often may be considered as the particular case of such design.
