Weakly complete axiomatization of exogenous quantum propositional logic

A weakly complete finitary axiomatization for EQPL (exogenous quantum propositional logic) is presented. The proof is carried out using a non trivial extension of the Fagin-Halpern-Megiddo technique together with three Henkin style completions.
