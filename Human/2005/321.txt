Self-Organizing Multilayered Neural Networks of Optimal Complexity

The principles of self-organizing the neural networks of optimal complexity is considered under the unrepresentative learning set. The method of self-organizing the multi-layered neural networks is offered and used to train the logical neural networks which were applied to the medical diagnostics.
