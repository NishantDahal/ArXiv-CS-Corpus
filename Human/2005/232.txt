Comment on "Some non-conventional ideas about algorithmic complexity"

We comment on a recent paper by D'Abramo [Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, 25 (2005) 29], focusing on the author's statement that an algorithm can produce a list of strings containing at least one string whose algorithmic complexity is greater than that of the entire list. We show that this statement, although perplexing, is not as paradoxical as it seems when the definition of algorithmic complexity is applied correctly.
