Combining Structured Corporate Data and Document Content to Improve Expertise Finding

In this paper, we present an algorithm for automatically building expertise evidence for finding experts within an organization by combining structured corporate information with different content. We also describe our test data collection and our evaluation method. Evaluation of the algorithm shows that using organizational structure leads to a significant improvement in the precision of finding an expert. Furthermore we evaluate the impact of using different data sources on the quality of the results and conclude that Expert Finding is not a "one engine fits all" solution. It requires an analysis of the information space into which a solution will be placed and the appropriate selection and weighting scheme of the data sources.
