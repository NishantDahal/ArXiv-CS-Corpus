Perspectives for Strong Artificial Life

This text introduces the twin deadlocks of strong artificial life. Conceptualization of life is a deadlock both because of the existence of a continuum between the inert and the living, and because we only know one instance of life. Computationalism is a second deadlock since it remains a matter of faith. Nevertheless, artificial life realizations quickly progress and recent constructions embed an always growing set of the intuitive properties of life. This growing gap between theory and realizations should sooner or later crystallize in some kind of paradigm shift and then give clues to break the twin deadlocks.
