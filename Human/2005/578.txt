Methods for the construction of generators of algebraic curvature tensors

We demonstrate the use of several tools from Algebraic Combinatorics such as Young tableaux, symmetry operators, the Littlewood-Richardson rule and discrete Fourier transforms of symmetric groups in investigations of algebraic curvature tensors.
