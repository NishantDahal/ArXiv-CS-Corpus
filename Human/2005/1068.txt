Logic Programming with Default, Weak and Strict Negations

This paper treats logic programming with three kinds of negation: default, weak and strict negations. A 3-valued logic model theory is discussed for logic programs with three kinds of negation. The procedure is constructed for negations so that a soundness of the procedure is guaranteed in terms of 3-valued logic model theory.
