Data Mining on Crash Simulation Data

The work presented in this paper is part of the cooperative research project AUTO-OPT carried out by twelve partners from the automotive industries. One major work package concerns the application of data mining methods in the area of automotive design. Suitable methods for data preparation and data analysis are developed. The objective of the work is the re-use of data stored in the crash-simulation department at BMW in order to gain deeper insight into the interrelations between the geometric variations of the car during its design and its performance in crash testing. In this paper a method for data analysis of finite element models and results from crash simulation is proposed and application to recent data from the industrial partner BMW is demonstrated. All necessary steps from data pre-processing to re-integration into the working environment of the engineer are covered.
