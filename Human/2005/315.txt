Selection in Scale-Free Small World

In this paper we compare the performance characteristics of our selection based learning algorithm for Web crawlers with the characteristics of the reinforcement learning algorithm. The task of the crawlers is to find new information on the Web. The selection algorithm, called weblog update, modifies the starting URL lists of our crawlers based on the found URLs containing new information. The reinforcement learning algorithm modifies the URL orderings of the crawlers based on the received reinforcements for submitted documents. We performed simulations based on data collected from the Web. The collected portion of the Web is typical and exhibits scale-free small world (SFSW) structure. We have found that on this SFSW, the weblog update algorithm performs better than the reinforcement learning algorithm. It finds the new information faster than the reinforcement learning algorithm and has better new information/all submitted documents ratio. We believe that the advantages of the selection algorithm over reinforcement learning algorithm is due to the small world property of the Web.
