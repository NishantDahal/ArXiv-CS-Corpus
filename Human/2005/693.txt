Summarizing Reports on Evolving Events; Part I: Linear Evolution

We present an approach for summarization from multiple documents which report on events that evolve through time, taking into account the different document sources. We distinguish the evolution of an event into linear and non-linear. According to our approach, each document is represented by a collection of messages which are then used in order to instantiate the cross-document relations that determine the summary content. The paper presents the summarization system that implements this approach through a case study on linear evolution.
