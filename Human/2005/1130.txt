Mathematical models of the complex surfaces in simulation and visualization systems

Modeling, simulation and visualization of three-dimension complex bodies widely use mathematical model of curves and surfaces. The most important curves and surfaces for these purposes are curves and surfaces in Hermite and Bezier forms, splines and NURBS. Article is devoted to survey this way to use geometrical data in various computer graphics systems and adjacent fields.
