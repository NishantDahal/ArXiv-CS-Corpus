Authoring case based training by document data extraction

In this paper, we propose an scalable approach to modeling based upon word processing documents, and we describe the tool Phoenix providing the technical infrastructure.
  For our training environment d3web.Train, we developed a tool to extract case knowledge from existing documents, usually dismissal records, extending Phoenix to d3web.CaseImporter. Independent authors used this tool to develop training systems, observing a significant decrease of time for setteling-in and a decrease of time necessary for developing a case.
