Distance-Increasing Maps of All Length by Simple Mapping Algorithms

Distance-increasing maps from binary vectors to permutations, namely DIMs, are useful for the construction of permutation arrays. While a simple mapping algorithm defining DIMs of even length is known, existing DIMs of odd length are either recursively constructed by merging shorter DIMs or defined by much complicated mapping algorithms. In this paper, DIMs of all length defined by simple mapping algorithms are presented.
