LSJK - a C++ library for arbitrary-precision numeric evaluation of the generalized log-sine functions

Generalized log-sine functions appear in higher order epsilon-expansion of different Feynman diagrams. We present an algorithm for numerical evaluation of these functions of real argument. This algorithm is implemented as C++ library with arbitrary-precision arithmetics for integer 0 < k < 9 and j > 1. Some new relations and representations for the generalized log-sine functions are given.
