An elitist approach for extracting automatically well-realized speech sounds with high confidence

This paper presents an "elitist approach" for extracting automatically well-realized speech sounds with high confidence. The elitist approach uses a speech recognition system based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The HMM are trained on speech sounds which are systematically well-detected in an iterative procedure. The results show that, by using the HMM models defined in the training phase, the speech recognizer detects reliably specific speech sounds with a small rate of errors.
