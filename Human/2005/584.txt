On parity check collections for iterative erasure decoding that correct all correctable erasure patterns of a given size

Recently there has been interest in the construction of small parity check sets for iterative decoding of the Hamming code with the property that each uncorrectable (or stopping) set of size three is the support of a codeword and hence uncorrectable anyway. Here we reformulate and generalise the problem, and improve on this construction. First we show that a parity check collection that corrects all correctable erasure patterns of size m for the r-th order Hamming code (i.e, the Hamming code with codimension r) provides for all codes of codimension $r$ a corresponding ``generic'' parity check collection with this property. This leads naturally to a necessary and sufficient condition on such generic parity check collections. We use this condition to construct a generic parity check collection for codes of codimension r correcting all correctable erasure patterns of size at most m, for all r and m <= r, thus generalising the known construction for m=3. Then we discussoptimality of our construction and show that it can be improved for m>=3 and r large enough. Finally we discuss some directions for further research.
