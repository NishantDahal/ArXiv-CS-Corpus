A Semantic Grid-based E-Learning Framework (SELF)

E-learning can be loosely defined as a wide set of applications and processes, which uses available electronic media (and tools) to deliver vocational education and training. With its increasing recognition as an ubiquitous mode of instruction and interaction in the academic as well as corporate world, the need for a scaleable and realistic model is becoming important. In this paper we introduce SELF; a Semantic grid-based E-Learning Framework. SELF aims to identify the key-enablers in a practical grid-based E-learning environment and to minimize technological reworking by proposing a well-defined interaction plan among currently available tools and technologies. We define a dichotomy with E-learning specific application layers on top and semantic grid-based support layers underneath. We also map the latest open and freeware technologies with various components in SELF.
