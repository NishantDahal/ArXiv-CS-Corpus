A Rule-Based Logic for Quantum Information

In the present article, we explore a new approach for the study of orthomodular lattices, where we replace the problematic conjunction by a binary operator, called the Sasaki projection. We present a characterization of orthomodular lattices based on the use of an algebraic version of the Sasaki projection operator (together with orthocomplementation) rather than on the conjunction. We then define of a new logic, which we call Sasaki Orthologic, which is closely related to quantum logic, and provide a rule-based definition of this logic.
