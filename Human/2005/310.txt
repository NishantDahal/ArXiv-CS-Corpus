Self-Organization of the Neuron Collective of Optimal Complexity

The optimal complexity of neural networks is achieved when the self-organization principles is used to eliminate the contradictions existing in accordance with the K. Godel theorem about incompleteness of the systems based on axiomatics. The principle of S. Beer exterior addition the Heuristic Group Method of Data Handling by A. Ivakhnenko realized is used.
