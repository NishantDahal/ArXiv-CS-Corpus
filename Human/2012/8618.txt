Three dimensional tracking of gold nanoparticles using digital holographic microscopy

In this paper we present a digital holographic microscope to track gold colloids in three dimensions. We report observations of 100nm gold particles in motion in water. The expected signal and the chosen method of reconstruction are described. We also discuss about how to implement the numerical calculation to reach real-time 3D tracking.
