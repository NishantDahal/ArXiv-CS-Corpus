On verification of software components

Utilizing third party software components in the development of new systems became somewhat unfavourable approach among many organizations nowadays. This reluctance is primarily built due to the lack of support to verify the quality attributes of software components in order to avoid potential mismatches with systems requirements. This paper presents an approach to overcome this problem by providing a tool support to check component compatibility to a specification provided by developers. So, components compatibility can be checked and developers can verify components that match their quality attributes prior of integrating them into their system.
