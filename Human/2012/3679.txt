Juppix: a Linux Live-CD for Undergraduate Students

Juppix is a Linux Live-CD with a comfortable programming environment for the Java, C and O'Caml programming languages that has been distributed to hundreds of undergaduate students at the University of Paris 7 over the last few years. We describe the lessons we learnt while compiling and distributing Juppix, and outline our future plans.
