A New Recursive Algorithm For Inverting A General Comrade Matrix

In this paper, the author present a reliable symbolic computational algorithm for inverting a general comrade matrix by using parallel computing along with recursion. The computational cost of our algorithm is O(n^2). The algorithm is implementable to the Computer Algebra System (CAS) such as MAPLE, MATLAB and MATHEMATICA. Three examples are presented for the sake of illustration.
