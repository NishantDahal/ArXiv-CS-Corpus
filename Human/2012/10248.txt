easyGWAS: An integrated interspecies platform for performing genome-wide association studies

Motivation: The rapid growth in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in plants and animals has brought about the need for a central resource that facilitates i) performing GWAS, ii) accessing data and results of other GWAS, and iii) enabling all users regardless of their background to exploit the latest statistical techniques without having to manage complex software and computing resources.
  Results: We present easyGWAS, a web platform that provides methods, tools and dynamic visualizations to perform and analyze GWAS. In addition, easyGWAS makes it simple to reproduce results of others, validate findings, and access larger sample sizes through merging of public datasets.
  Availability: Detailed method and data descriptions as well as tutorials are available in the supplementary materials. easyGWAS is available at http://easygwas.tuebingen.mpg.de/.
