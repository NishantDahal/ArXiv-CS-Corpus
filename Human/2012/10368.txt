Proceedings Fifth Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE'12, the 5th Interaction and Concurrency Experience workshop, which was held in Stockholm, Sweden on the 16th of June 2012 as a satellite event of DisCoTec'12. The topic of ICE'12 was Distributed Coordination, Execution Models, and Resilient Interaction. The ICE procedure for paper selection allows for PC members to interact, anonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a Wiki and associated with a discussion forum whose access is restricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of interests. The PC members post comments and questions that the authors reply to. Each paper was reviewed by four PC members, and altogether 8 papers were accepted for publication. We were proud to host two invited talks, Marcello Bonsangue and Ichiro Hasuo, whose abstracts are included in this volume together with the regular papers.
