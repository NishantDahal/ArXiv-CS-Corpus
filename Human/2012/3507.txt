On Equilibria in Quantitative Games with Reachability/Safety Objectives

In this paper, we study turn-based quantitative multiplayer non zero-sum games played on finite graphs with both reachability and safety objectives. In this framework a player with a reachability objective aims at reaching his own goal as soon as possible, whereas a player with a safety objective aims at avoiding his bad set or, if impossible, delaying its visit as long as possible. We prove the existence of Nash equilibria with finite memory in quantitative multiplayer reachability/safety games. Moreover, we prove the existence of finite-memory secure equilibria for quantitative two-player reachability games.
