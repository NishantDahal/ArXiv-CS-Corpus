Multiple model approach and experimental validation of a residential air-to-air heat pump

The beginning of this work is the achievement of a design tool, which is a multiple model software called " CODYRUN ", suitable for professionnals and usable by researchers. The original aspect of this software is that the designer has at his disposal a wide panel of choices between different heat transfer models More precisely, it consists in a multizone software integrating both natural ventilation and moisture tranfers . This software is developed on PC micro computer and gets advantage of the Microsoft WINDOWS front-end. Most of time, HVAC systems and specially domestic air conditioners, are taken into account in a very simplified way, or in a elaborated one. On one side,they are just supposed to supply the demand of cooling loads with an ideal control loop (no delay between the sollicitations and the time response of the system), The available outputs are initially the hourly cooling and heating consumptions without integrating the real caracteristics of the HVAC system This paper is also following the same multiple model approach than for the building modelling by defining different modelling levels for the air conditionning systems, from a very simplified one to a detailled one. An experimental validation is achieved in order to compare the sensitivity of each defined model and to point out the interaction between the thermal behaviour of the envelop and the electrical system consumption. For validation purposes, we will describe the data acquisition system. and the used real size test cell located in the University of Reunion island, Indian Ocean.
