Some New Methodologies for Image Hiding using Steganographic Techniques

Security and memory management are the major demands for electronics devices like ipods, cell phones, pmps, iphones and digital cameras. In this paper, we have suggested a high level of security mechanism by considering the concept of steganography along with the principle of cryptography. Four different methods that can save a considerable amount of memory space have been discussed. Based on these methods, we have constructed secured stego image creator and secured multi image viewer in Microsoft platform so as to provide high level of security and using less memory space for storage of image files in the above said electronic devices
