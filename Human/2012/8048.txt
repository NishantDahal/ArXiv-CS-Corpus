Learning Measurement Models for Unobserved Variables

Observed associations in a database may be due in whole or part to variations     in unrecorded (latent) variables. Identifying such variables and their causal     relationships with one another is a principal goal in many scientific and     practical domains. Previous work shows that, given a partition of observed     variables such that members of a class share only a single latent common cause,     standard search algorithms for causal Bayes nets can infer structural relations     between latent variables. We introduce an algorithm for discovering such     partitions when they exist. Uniquely among available procedures, the algorithm     is (asymptotically) correct under standard assumptions in causal Bayes net     search algorithms, requires no prior knowledge of the number of latent     variables, and does not depend on the mathematical form of the relationships     among the latent variables. We evaluate the algorithm on a variety of simulated     data sets.
