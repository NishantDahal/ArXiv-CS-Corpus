A Survey of Prediction Using Social Media

Social media comprises interactive applications and platforms for creating, sharing and exchange of user-generated contents. The past ten years have brought huge growth in social media, especially online social networking services, and it is changing our ways to organize and communicate. It aggregates opinions and feelings of diverse groups of people at low cost. Mining the attributes and contents of social media gives us an opportunity to discover social structure characteristics, analyze action patterns qualitatively and quantitatively, and sometimes the ability to predict future human related events. In this paper, we firstly discuss the realms which can be predicted with current social media, then overview available predictors and techniques of prediction, and finally discuss challenges and possible future directions.
