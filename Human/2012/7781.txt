Linear Transformations for Randomness Extraction

Information-efficient approaches for extracting randomness from imperfect sources have been extensively studied, but simpler and faster ones are required in the high-speed applications of random number generation. In this paper, we focus on linear constructions, namely, applying linear transformation for randomness extraction. We show that linear transformations based on sparse random matrices are asymptotically optimal to extract randomness from independent sources and bit-fixing sources, and they are efficient (may not be optimal) to extract randomness from hidden Markov sources. Further study demonstrates the flexibility of such constructions on source models as well as their excellent information-preserving capabilities. Since linear transformations based on sparse random matrices are computationally fast and can be easy to implement using hardware like FPGAs, they are very attractive in the high-speed applications. In addition, we explore explicit constructions of transformation matrices. We show that the generator matrices of primitive BCH codes are good choices, but linear transformations based on such matrices require more computational time due to their high densities.
