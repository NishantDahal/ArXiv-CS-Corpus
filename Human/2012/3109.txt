Windows And Linux Operating Systems From A Security Perspective

Operating systems are vital system software that, without them, humans would not be able to manage and use computer systems. In essence, an operating system is a collection of software programs whose role is to manage computer resources and provide an interface for client applications to interact with the different computer hardware. Most of the commercial operating systems available today on the market have buggy code and they exhibit security flaws and vulnerabilities. In effect, building a trusted operating system that can mostly resist attacks and provide a secure computing environment to protect the important assets of a computer is the goal of every operating system manufacturer. This paper deeply investigates the various security features of the two most widespread and successful operating systems, Microsoft Windows and Linux. The different security features, designs, and components of the two systems are to be covered elaborately, pin-pointing the key similarities and differences between them. In due course, a head-to-head comparison is to be drawn for each security aspect, exposing the advantage of one system over the other.
