Linear functional classes over cellular automata

Cellular automata are a discrete dynamical system which models  massively parallel computation. Much attention is devoted to  computations with small time complexity for which the parallelism  may provide further possibilities. In this paper, we investigate the  ability of cellular automata related to functional computation. We  introduce several functional classes of low time complexity which  contain "natural" problems. We examine their inclusion  relationships and emphasize that several questions arising from this  functional framework are related to current ones coming from the  recognition context. We also provide a negative result which  explicits limits on the information transmission whose consequences  go beyond the functional point of view.
