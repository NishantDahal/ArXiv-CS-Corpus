Collaborative Applications over Peer-to-Peer Systems - Challenges and Solutions

Emerging collaborative Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems require discovery and utilization of diverse, multi-attribute, distributed, and dynamic groups of resources to achieve greater tasks beyond conventional file and processor cycle sharing. Collaborations involving application specific resources and dynamic quality of service goals are stressing current P2P architectures. Salient features and desirable characteristics of collaborative P2P systems are highlighted. Resource advertising, selecting, matching, and binding, the critical phases in these systems, and their associated challenges are reviewed using examples from distributed collaborative adaptive sensing systems, cloud computing, and mobile social networks. State-of-the-art resource discovery/aggregation solutions are compared with respect to their architecture, lookup overhead, load balancing, etc., to determine their ability to meet the goals and challenges of each critical phase. Incentives, trust, privacy, and security issues are also discussed, as they will ultimately determine the success of a collaborative P2P system. Open issues and research opportunities that are essential to achieve the true potential of collaborative P2P systems are discussed.
