Implementation and Comparison of Solution Methods for Decision Processes with Non-Markovian Rewards

This paper examines a number of solution methods for decision processes with     non-Markovian rewards (NMRDPs). They all exploit a temporal logic specification     of the reward function to automatically translate the NMRDP into an equivalent     Markov decision process (MDP) amenable to well-known MDP solution methods. They     differ however in the representation of the target MDP and the class of MDP     solution methods to which they are suited. As a result, they adopt different     temporal logics and different translations. Unfortunately, no implementation of     these methods nor experimental let alone comparative results have ever been     reported. This paper is the first step towards filling this gap. We describe an     integrated system for solving NMRDPs which implements these methods and several     variants under a common interface; we use it to compare the various approaches     and identify the problem features favoring one over the other.
