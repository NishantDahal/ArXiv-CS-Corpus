Sense me: Supporting awareness in parent-child relationships through mobile sensing

We introduce SenseÎ¼ (pronounced "sense me"), a mobile application that aims at supporting awareness in parent- child relationships through the sensing capabilities of mobile devices. We discuss the relevance of three types of awareness information: physical activity inferred from accelerometers, verbal activity during class hours inferred from microphones, and social activity inferred from Bluetooth pair-wise proximity sensing. We describe how we attempt to contextualize these sensing data with the goal of supporting parents' awareness of the educational performance and social wellbeing of their children, as well as motivating and sustaining a two-way communication between parents and teachers over the long term.
