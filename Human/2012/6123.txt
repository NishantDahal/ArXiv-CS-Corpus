Polarimetric SAR Image Smoothing with Stochastic Distances

Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images are establishing as an important source of information in remote sensing applications. The most complete format this type of imaging produces consists of complex-valued Hermitian matrices in every image coordinate and, as such, their visualization is challenging. They also suffer from speckle noise which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. Smoothing techniques have been proposed in the literature aiming at preserving different features and, analogously, projections from the cone of Hermitian positive matrices to different color representation spaces are used for enhancing certain characteristics. In this work we propose the use of stochastic distances between models that describe this type of data in a Nagao-Matsuyama-type of smoothing technique. The resulting images are shown to present good visualization properties (noise reduction with preservation of fine details) in all the considered visualization spaces.
