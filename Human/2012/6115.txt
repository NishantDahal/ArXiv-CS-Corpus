Memristor-based mono-stable oscillator

In this letter, a reactance-less mono-stable oscillator is introduced for the first time using memristors. By replacing bulky inductors and capacitors with memristors, the novel mono-stable oscillator can be an area-efficient solution for on-chip fully integrated systems. The proposed circuit is described, mathematically analysed and verified by circuit simulations.
