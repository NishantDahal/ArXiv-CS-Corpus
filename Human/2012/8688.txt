Sudoku as a special transportation problem

Sudoku is a popular combinatorial puzzle. A new method of solving Sudoku is presented, which involves formulating a puzzle as a special type of transportation problem. This model allows one to solve puzzles with more than one solution, keeping the constraints of the problem fixed, and simply changing a cost matrix between solutions.
