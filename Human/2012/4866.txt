Community-detection cellular automata with local and long-range connectivity

We explore a community-detection cellular automata algorithm inspired by human heuristics, based on information diffusion and a non-linear processing phase with a dynamics inspired by human heuristics. The main point of the methods is that of furnishing different "views" of the clustering levels from an individual point of view. We apply the method to networks with local connectivity and long-range rewiring.
