Enhanced skin colour classifier using RGB Ratio model

Skin colour detection is frequently been used for searching people, face detection, pornographic filtering and hand tracking. The presence of skin or non-skin in digital image can be determined by manipulating pixels colour or pixels texture. The main problem in skin colour detection is to represent the skin colour distribution model that is invariant or least sensitive to changes in illumination condition. Another problem comes from the fact that many objects in the real world may possess almost similar skin-tone colour such as wood, leather, skin-coloured clothing, hair and sand. Moreover, skin colour is different between races and can be different from a person to another, even with people of the same ethnicity. Finally, skin colour will appear a little different when different types of camera are used to capture the object or scene. The objective in this study is to develop a skin colour classifier based on pixel-based using RGB ratio model. The RGB ratio model is a newly proposed method that belongs under the category of an explicitly defined skin region model. This skin classifier was tested with SIdb dataset and two benchmark datasets; UChile and TDSD datasets to measure classifier performance. The performance of skin classifier was measured based on true positive (TF) and false positive (FP) indicator. This newly proposed model was compared with Kovac, Saleh and Swift models. The experimental results showed that the RGB ratio model outperformed all the other models in term of detection rate. The RGB ratio model is able to reduce FP detection that caused by reddish objects colour as well as be able to detect darkened skin and skin covered by shadow.
