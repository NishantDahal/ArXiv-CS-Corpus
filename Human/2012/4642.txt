Improved DWT Based Watermarking Using JPEG-YCbCr

In this paper a blind, Secure, imperceptible and robust watermarking algorithm based on wavelet transform domain is proposed in which for more security, the watermark W is converted to a sequence and then a random binary sequence R of size n is adopted to encrypt the watermark, where n is the size of the watermark image. Afterwards, the encrypted watermark sequence W1 is generated by executing exclusive-OR operation on W and R. This generated watermark embeds into low frequency selected coefficients of Y channel wavelet decomposition of JPEG-YCbCr using LSB insertion technique. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm increases the security and imperceptibility of watermark and has better robustness against wavelet compression and cropping attacks compared to the earlier work in [1].
