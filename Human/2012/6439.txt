Sequence Randomization Using Convolutional Codes and Probability Functions

This paper investigates the use of different transformations for improving the randomness of sequences. In particular, convolutional codes are used for increasing the size of a given sequence and then a random mapping function is used for further randomization. We have shown how such a method can convert highly correlated sequences into random ones.
