Nonlinear Trellis Description for Convolutionally Encoded Transmission Over ISI-channels with Applications for CPM

In this paper we propose a matched decoding scheme for convolutionally encoded transmission over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and devise a nonlinear trellis description. As an application we show that for coded continuous phase modulation (CPM) using a non-coherent receiver the number of states of the super trellis can be significantly reduced by means of a matched non-linear trellis encoder.
