Perceptual quality comparison between single-layer and scalable videos at the same spatial, temporal and amplitude resolutions

In this paper, the perceptual quality difference between scalable and single-layer videos coded at the same spatial, temporal and amplitude resolution (STAR) is investigated through a subjective test using a mobile platform. Three source videos are considered and for each source video single-layer and scalable video are compared at 9 different STARs. We utilize paired comparison methods with and without tie option. Results collected from 10 subjects in the without "tie" option and 6 subjects in the with "tie" option show that there is no significant quality difference between scalable and singlelayer video when coded at the same STAR. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is also performed to further confirm the finding.
