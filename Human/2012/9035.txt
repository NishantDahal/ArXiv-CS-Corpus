Super-FEC Codes for 40/100 Gbps Networking

This paper presents a simple approach to evaluate the performance bound at very low bit-error-rate (BER) range for binary pseudo-product codes and true-product codes. Moreover it introduces a super-product BCH code that can achieve near-Shannon limit performance with very low decoding complexity.
