Multiple Service providers sharing Spectrum using Cognitive Radio in Wireless Communication Networks

The current utilization of the spectrum is quite inefficient; consequently, if properly used, there is no shortage of the spectrum that is at present available. Therefore, it is anticipated that more flexible use of spectrum and spectrum sharing between radio systems will be key enablers to facilitate the successful implementation of future systems. Cognitive radio, however, is known as the most intelligent and promising technique in solving the problem of spectrum sharing. In this paper, we consider the technique of spectrum sharing among users of service providers to share the licensed spectrum of licensed service providers. It is shown that the proposed technique reduces the call blocking rate and improves the spectrum utilization.
