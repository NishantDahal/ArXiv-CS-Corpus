Enhanced Mobile Digital Video Broadcasting with Distributed Space-Time Coding

This paper investigates the distributed space-time (ST) coding proposals for the future Digital Video Broadcasting--Next Generation Handheld (DVB-NGH) standard. We first theoretically show that the distributed MIMO scheme is the best broadcasting scenario in terms of channel capacity. Consequently we evaluate the performance of several ST coding proposals for DVB-NGH with practical system specifications and channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the 3D code is the best ST coding solution for broadcasting in the distributed MIMO scenario.
