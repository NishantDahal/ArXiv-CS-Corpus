This paper investigates human dynamics in a large online dating site with 3,000 new users daily who stay in the system for 3 months on the average. The daily activity is also quite large such as 500,000 massage transactions, 5,000 photo uploads, and 20,000 votes.
  The data investigated has 276, 210 male and 483, 963 female users. Based on the activity that they made, there are clear distinctions between men and women in their pattern of behavior. Men prefer lower, women prefer higher qualifications in their partner.
