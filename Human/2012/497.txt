Proceedings Second Workshop on Developments in Implicit Computational Complexity

This volume contains the proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Developments in Implicit Computational complExity (DICE 2011), which took place on April 2-3 2011 in Saarbruecken, Germany, as a satellite event of the Joint European Conference on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2011.  Implicit Computational Complexity aims at studying computational complexity without referring to external measuring conditions or particular machine models, but instead by considering restrictions on programming languages or logical principles implying complexity properties. The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers working on implicit computational complexity, from its logical and semantics aspects to those related to the static analysis of programs, so as to foster their interaction and to give newcomers an overview of the current trends in this area.
  The first DICE workshop was held in 2010 at ETAPS and published in EPTCS, volume 23 (http://eptcs.org/content.cgi?DICE2010).
