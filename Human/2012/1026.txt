Recommender System Based on Algorithm of Bicluster Analysis RecBi

In this paper we propose two new algorithms based on biclustering analysis, which can be used at the basis of a recommender system for educational orientation of Russian School graduates. The first algorithm was designed to help students make a choice between different university faculties when some of their preferences are known. The second algorithm was developed for the special situation when nothing is known about their preferences. The final version of this recommender system will be used by Higher School of Economics.
