Discrete Chaotic Sequence based on Logistic Map in Digital Communications

The chaotic systems have been found applications in diverse fields such as pseudo random number generator, coding, cryptography, spread spectrum (SS) communications etc. The inherent capability of generating a large space of PN sequences due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions has been the main reason for exploiting chaos in spread spectrum communication systems. This behaviour suggests that it is straightforward to generate a variety of initial condition induced PN sequences with nice statistical properties by quantising the output of an iterated chaotic map. In the present paper the study has been carried out for the feasibility and usefulness of chaotic sequence in SS based applications like communication and watermarking.
