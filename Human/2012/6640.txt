Structured Prediction Cascades

Structured prediction tasks pose a fundamental trade-off between the need for model complexity to increase predictive power and the limited computational resources for inference in the exponentially-sized output spaces such models require. We formulate and develop the Structured Prediction Cascade architecture: a sequence of increasingly complex models that progressively filter the space of possible outputs. The key principle of our approach is that each model in the cascade is optimized to accurately filter and refine the structured output state space of the next model, speeding up both learning and inference in the next layer of the cascade. We learn cascades by optimizing a novel convex loss function that controls the trade-off between the filtering efficiency and the accuracy of the cascade, and provide generalization bounds for both accuracy and efficiency. We also extend our approach to intractable models using tree-decomposition ensembles, and provide algorithms and theory for this setting. We evaluate our approach on several large-scale problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in handwriting recognition and human pose recognition. We find that structured prediction cascades allow tremendous speedups and the use of previously intractable features and models in both settings.
