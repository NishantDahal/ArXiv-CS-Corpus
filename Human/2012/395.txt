Mathematical Modeling of the Weaving Structure Design

An equivalence relation in the set of all square binary matrices is described in this work. It is discussed a combinatoric problem about finding the cardinal number and the elements of the factor set according to this relation. We examine the possibility to get some special elements of this factor set. We propose an algorithm, which solves these problems. The results we have received are used to describe the topology of the different weaving structures.
