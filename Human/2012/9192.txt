Generalized Distributed Compressive Sensing

Distributed Compressive Sensing (DCS) improves the signal recovery performance of multi signal ensembles by exploiting both intra- and inter-signal correlation and sparsity structure. However, the existing DCS was proposed for a very limited ensemble of signals that has single common information \cite{Baron:2009vd}. In this paper, we propose a generalized DCS (GDCS) which can improve sparse signal detection performance given arbitrary types of common information which are classified into not just full common information but also a variety of partial common information. The theoretical bound on the required number of measurements using the GDCS is obtained. Unfortunately, the GDCS may require much a priori-knowledge on various inter common information of ensemble of signals to enhance the performance over the existing DCS. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that can search for the correlation structure among the signals, with which the proposed GDCS improves detection performance even without a priori-knowledge on correlation structure for the case of arbitrarily correlated multi signal ensembles.
