Performance Analysis of Wavelet Based MC-CDMA System with Implementation of Various Antenna Diversity Schemes

The impact of using wavelet based technique on the performance of a MC-CDMA wireless communication system has been investigated. The system under proposed study incorporates Walsh Hadamard codes to discriminate the message signal for individual user. A computer program written in Mathlab source code is developed and this simulation study is made with implementation of various antenna diversity schemes and fading (Rayleigh and Rician) channel. Computer simulation results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet based MC-CDMA system outperforms in Alamouti (two transmit antenna and one receive antenna) under AWGN and Rician channel.
