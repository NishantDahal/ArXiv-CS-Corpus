Sysml Knowledge base for Designing Dependable Complex System

The work presented in this paper is part of a proposed framework as complete and rigorous as possible for the design of complex systems. The methodological framework used is System Engineering, which is a methodological approach to control the design of complex systems. The practices of this approach are transcribed in standards, realized by methods and supported by tools. In our case, the standard EIA-632 was adopted. Specifically, to deal with the dependability of these complex systems and to improve the processes dealing with dependability, we have defined a global approach. This approach incorporates the consideration of dependability in system engineering processes. The work presented in this paper supports and complements the overall approach: it is the proposal of an information model based on the SysML language, allowing the requirements management, including safety requirements
