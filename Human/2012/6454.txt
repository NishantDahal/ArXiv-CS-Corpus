Compression and Sieve: Reducing Communication in Parallel Breadth First Search on Distributed Memory Systems

For parallel breadth first search (BFS) algorithm on large-scale distributed memory systems, communication often costs significantly more than arithmetic and limits the scalability of the algorithm. In this paper we sufficiently reduce the communication cost in distributed BFS by compressing and sieving the messages. First, we leverage a bitmap compression algorithm to reduce the size of messages before communication. Second, we propose a novel distributed directory algorithm, cross directory, to sieve the redundant data in messages. Experiments on a 6,144-core SMP cluster show our algorithm outperforms the baseline implementation in Graph500 by 2.2 times, reduces its communication time by 79.0%, and achieves a performance rate of 12.1 GTEPS (billion edge visits per second)
