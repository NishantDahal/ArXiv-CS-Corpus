Prover and Verifier Based Password Protection: PVBPP

In today's world password are mostly used for authentication. This makes them prone to various kinds of attacks like dictionary attacks. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking the password by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password. This attack leads to an overload on the server leading to denial of service attack. This paper presents a protocol to reduce the rate of dictionary attack by using a prover and a verifier system. This system makes it difficult for the attacker to prove it as a valid user by becoming computationally intensive. The rate of attempts is also reduced and thus restricting the Denial of Service attack.
