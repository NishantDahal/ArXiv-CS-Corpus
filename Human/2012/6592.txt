Modelling Dead Rocking In Online Multiplayer Games

This is the web based application, here we analysis the network traffic which occurs when the player plays an online game. Here we are going to trace the current position of the player to rectify the traffic while playing the game. There are different types of measures for different applications, those can be normalized and compared with one another but my application can resolve the inconsistency by knowing the positions quickly and focus on quality of network (QON) which affects a player to leave the game in middle because of poor quality of service (QOS). The existing model leads to leave the game because of network loss from both sides. The proposed model can resolve this problem by applying the replacement of TCP along with the dejitter buffer (DB) it can reduce the network loss and by applying the DEAD RECKONING (DR) vector we can recover the network access because it can view the current position of the player through this we can rectify why the player leaving the game and checks the network conditions and try to reactive the game by using mobile devices automatically or else they receive the message according to the network conditions.
