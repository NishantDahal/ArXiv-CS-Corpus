Separating the Effect of Independent Interference Sources with Rayleigh Faded Signal Link: Outage Analysis and Applications

We show that, for independent interfering sources and a signal link with exponentially distributed received power, the total probability of outage can be decomposed as a simple expression of the outages from the individual interfering sources. We give a mathematical proof of this result, and discuss some immediate implications, showing how it results in important simplifications to statistical outage analysis. We also discuss its application to two active topics of study: spectrum sharing, and sum of interference powers (e.g., lognormal) analysis.
