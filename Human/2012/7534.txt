New Transience Bounds for Long Walks

Linear max-plus systems describe the behavior of a large variety of complex systems. It is known that these systems show a periodic behavior after an initial transient phase. Assessment of the length of this transient phase provides important information on complexity measures of such systems, and so is crucial in system design. We identify relevant parameters in a graph representation of these systems and propose a modular strategy to derive new upper bounds on the length of the transient phase. By that we are the first to give asymptotically tight and potentially subquadratic transience bounds. We use our bounds to derive new complexity results, in particular in distributed computing.
