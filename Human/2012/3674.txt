An Adaptive Watermarking Technique for the copyright of digital images and Digital Image Protection

The Internet as a whole does not use secure links, thus information in transit may be vulnerable to interruption as well. The important of reducing a chance of the information being detected during the transmission is being an issue in the real world now days. The Digital watermarking method provides for the quick and inexpensive distribution of digital information over the Internet. This method provides new ways of ensuring the sufficient protection of copyright holders in the intellectual property dispersion process. The property of digital watermarking images allows insertion of additional data in the image without altering the value of the image.In this paper investigate the following relevant concepts and terminology, history of watermarks and the properties of a watermarking system and applications. We are proposing edge detection using Gabor Filters. In this paper we are proposed least significant bit (LSB) substitution method to encrypt the message in the watermark image file. The benefits of the LSB are its simplicity to embed the bits of the message directly into the LSB plane of cover-image and many techniques using these methods. The LSB does not result in a human perceptible difference because the amplitude of the change is little therefore the human eye the resulting stego image will look identical to the cover image and this allows high perceptual transparency of the LSB. The spatial domain technique LSB substitution it would be able to use a pseudo-random number generator to determine the pixels to be used for embedding based on a given key. We are using DCT transform watermark algorithms based on robustness. The watermarking robustness have been calculated by the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Normalized cross correlation (NC) is used to quantify by the similarity between the real watermark and after extracting watermark.
