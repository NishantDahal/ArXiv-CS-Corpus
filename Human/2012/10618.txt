Design of Experiments for Calibration of Planar Anthropomorphic Manipulators

The paper presents a novel technique for the design of optimal calibration experiments for a planar anthropomorphic manipulator with n degrees of freedom. Proposed approach for selection of manipulator configurations allows essentially improving calibration accuracy and reducing parameter identification errors. The results are illustrated by application examples that deal with typical anthropomorphic manipulators.
