Design Space Exploration to Find the Optimum Cache and Register File Size for Embedded Applications

In the future, embedded processors must process more computation-intensive network applications and internet traffic and packet-processing tasks become heavier and sophisticated. Since the processor performance is severely related to the average memory access delay and also the number of processor registers affects the performance, cache and register file are two major parts in designing embedded processor architecture. Although increasing cache and register file size leads to performance improvement in embedded applications and packet-processing tasks in high traffic networks with too much packets, the increased area, power consumption and memory hierarchy delay are the overheads of these techniques. Therefore, implementing these components in the optimum size is of significant interest in the design of embedded processors. This paper explores the effect of cache and register file size on the processor performance to calculate the optimum size of these components for embedded applications. Experimental results show that although having bigger cache and register file is one of the performance improvement approaches in embedded processors, however, by increasing the size of these parameters over a threshold level, performance improvement is saturated and then, decreased.
