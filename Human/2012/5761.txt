Infinite ternary square-free words concatenated from permutations of a single word

We answer a question of Harju: An infinite square-free ternary word with an $n$-stem factorization exists for any $n\ge 13$. We show that there are uniform ternary morphisms of length $k$ for every $k\ge 23$. This resolves almost completely a problem of the author and Rampersad.
