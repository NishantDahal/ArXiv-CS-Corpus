Probabilistic cellular automata and random fields with i.i.d. directions

Let us consider the simplest model of one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata (PCA). The cells are indexed by the integers, the alphabet is {0, 1}, and all the cells evolve synchronously. The new content of a cell is randomly chosen, independently of the others, according to a distribution depending only on the content of the cell itself and of its right neighbor. There are necessary and sufficient conditions on the four parameters of such a PCA to have a Bernoulli product invariant measure. We study the properties of the random field given by the space-time diagram obtained when iterating the PCA starting from its Bernoulli product invariant measure. It is a non-trivial random field with very weak dependences and nice combinatorial properties. In particular, not only the horizontal lines but also the lines in any other direction consist in i.i.d. random variables. We study extensions of the results to Markovian invariant measures, and to PCA with larger alphabets and neighborhoods.
