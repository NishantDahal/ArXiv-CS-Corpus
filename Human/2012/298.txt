An efficient FPGA implementation of MRI image filtering and tumor characterization using Xilinx system generator

This paper presents an efficient architecture for various image filtering algorithms and tumor characterization using Xilinx System Generator (XSG). This architecture offers an alternative through a graphical user interface that combines MATLAB, Simulink and XSG and explores important aspects concerned to hardware implementation. Performance of this architecture implemented in SPARTAN-3E Starter kit (XC3S500E-FG320) exceeds those of similar or greater resources architectures. The proposed architecture reduces the resources available on target device by 50%.
