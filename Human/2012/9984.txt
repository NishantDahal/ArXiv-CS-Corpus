Protecting Online Documents from an Unauthorized External Access (in Bulgarian)

The modern multi-tier web applications and information systems store and process various types of data. Some of them are stored in a database, controlled by an external database management system, while other data are stored directly within the server's file system. The database is secured by the database management system itself, but it is a programmer's responsibility to design and develop a security protection of the files managed by the information system. This paper summarizes the existing and suggests new rules for design and implementation of an in-depth security protection of file resources, published on the Internet, from an unauthorized external access. The paper is in Bulgarian.
