Roughly Weighted Hierarchical Simple Games

Hierarchical simple games - both disjunctive and conjunctive - are natural generalizations of simple majority games. They take their origin in the theory of secret sharing. Another important generalization of simple majority games with origin in economics and politics are weighted and roughly weighted majority games. In this paper we characterize roughly weighted hierarchical games identifying where the two approaches coincide.
