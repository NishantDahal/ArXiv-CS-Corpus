Ultra Low Complexity Soft Output Detector for Non-Binary LDPC Coded Large MIMO Systems

The theoretic results of MIMO capacity tell us that the higher the number of antennas are employed, the higher the transmission rate is. This makes MIMO systems with hundreds of antennas very attractive but one of the major problems that obstructs such large dimensional MIMO systems from the practical realization is a high complexity of the MIMO detector. We present in this paper the new soft output MIMO detector based on matched filtering that can be applied to the large MIMO systems which are coded by the powerful non-binary LDPC codes. The per-bit complexity of the proposed detector is just 0.28% to that of low complexity soft output MMSE detector and scales only linearly with a number of antennas. Furthermore, the coded performances with small information length 800 bits are within 4.2 dB from the associated MIMO capacity.
