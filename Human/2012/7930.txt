We provide some examples showing how game-theoretic arguments can be used in computability theory and algorithmic information theory: unique numbering theorem (Friedberg), the gap between conditional complexity and total conditional complexity, Epstein--Levin theorem and some (yet unpublished) result of Muchnik and Vyugin
