NanoInfoBio: A case-study in interdisciplinary research

A significant amount of high-impact contemporary scientific research occurs where biology, computer science, engineering and chemistry converge. Although programmes have been put in place to support such work, the complex dynamics of interdisciplinarity are still poorly understood. In this paper we highlight potential barriers to effective research across disciplines, and suggest, using a case study, possible mechanisms for removing these impediments.
