Flexible Data Dissemination Strategy for Effective Cache Consistency in Mobile Wireless Communication Networks

In mobile wireless communication network, caching data items at the mobile clients is important to reduce the data access delay. However, efficient cache invalidation strategies are used to ensure the consistency between the data in the cache of mobile clients and at the database server. Servers use invalidation reports (IRs) to inform the mobile clients about data item updates. This paper proposes and implements a multicast based strategy to maintain cache consistency in mobile environment using AVI as the cache invalidation scheme. The proposed algorithm is outlined as follows - To resolve a query, the mobile client searches its cache to check if its data is valid. If yes, then query is answered, otherwise the client queries the DTA (Dynamic Transmitting Agent) for latest updates and the query is answered. If DTA doesn't have the latest updates, it gets it from the server. So, the main idea here is that DTA will be multicasting updates to the clients and hence the clients need not uplink to the server individually, thus preserving the network bandwidth. The scenario of simulation is developed in Java. The results demonstrate that the traffic generated in the proposed multicast model is simplified and it also retains cache consistency when compared to the existing methods that used broadcast strategy.
