Online Financial Algorithms Competitive Analysis

Analysis of algorithms with complete knowledge of its inputs is sometimes not up to our expectations. Many times we are surrounded with such scenarios where inputs are generated without any prior knowledge. Online Algorithms have found their applicability in broad areas of computer engineering. Among these, an online financial algorithm is one of the most important areas where lots of efforts have been used to produce an efficient algorithm. In this paper various Online Algorithms have been reviewed for their efficiency and various alternative measures have been explored for analysis purposes.
