Optimized on-line computation of PageRank algorithm

In this paper we present new ideas to accelerate the computation of the eigenvector of the transition matrix associated to the PageRank algorithm. New ideas are based on the decomposition of the matrix-vector product that can be seen as a fluid diffusion model, associated to new algebraic equations. We show through experiments on synthetic data and on real data-sets how much this approach can improve the computation efficiency.
