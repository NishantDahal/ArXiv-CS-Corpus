The Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention Systems 2.0 Toolkit: A Study Case

This paper reviews the aspects of the LEGO\textregistered Mindstorms\trademark robotics invention system 2.0 \trademark (RIS), by presenting the different elements of the kit, and relating them to actual robot components and norms. Furthermore a comparison between the LCS and Java is made, as well as comparing the RCX board to other technologies, specifically LEGO \textregistered NXT and MIT's "Handy Board". Also, concrete examples of application using the RIS are presented.
