Demodulating Subsampled Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Signals using Compressive Signal Processing

We show that to lower the sampling rate in a spread spectrum communication system using Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), compressive signal processing can be applied to demodulate the received signal. This may lead to a decrease in the power consumption or the manufacturing price of wireless receivers using spread spectrum technology. The main novelty of this paper is the discovery that in spread spectrum systems it is possible to apply compressive sensing with a much simpler hardware architecture than in other systems, making the implementation both simpler and more energy efficient. Our theoretical work is exemplified with a numerical experiment using the IEEE 802.15.4 standard's 2.4 GHz band specification. The numerical results support our theoretical findings and indicate that compressive sensing may be used successfully in spread spectrum communication systems. The results obtained here may also be applicable in other spread spectrum technologies, such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems.
