Period-halving Bifurcation of a Neuronal Recurrence Equation

We study the sequences generated by neuronal recurrence equations of the form $x(n) = {\bf 1}[\sum_{j=1}^{h} a_{j} x(n-j)- θ]$. From a neuronal recurrence equation of memory size $h$ which describes a cycle of length $ρ(m) \times lcm(p_0, p_1,..., p_{-1+ρ(m)})$, we construct a set of $ρ(m)$ neuronal recurrence equations whose dynamics describe respectively the transient of length $O(ρ(m) \times lcm(p_0, ..., p_{d}))$ and the cycle of length $O(ρ(m) \times lcm(p_{d+1}, ..., p_{-1+ρ(m)}))$ if $0 \leq d \leq -2+ρ(m)$ and 1 if $d=ρ(m)-1$.
  This result shows the exponential time of the convergence of neuronal recurrence equation to fixed points and the existence of the period-halving bifurcation.
