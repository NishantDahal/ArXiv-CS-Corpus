Proceedings Fourth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming

This volume contains the proceedings of the Fourth Workshop  on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2012), taking place on 25 March, 2012 in Tallinn, Estonia,  as a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software,  ETAPS 2012.  
  MSFP is devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure.  It highlights concepts from algebra, semantics and type theory as they are increasingly reflected in programming practice, especially functional programming.   The workshop consists of two invited presentations and eight contributed papers on a range of topics at that interface.
