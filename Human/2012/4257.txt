TexComp - A Text Complexity Analyzer for Student Texts

This paper describes a method for providing feedback about the degree of complexity that is present in particular texts. Both the method and the software tool called TexComp are designed for use during the assessment of student compositions (such as essays and theses). The method is based on a cautious approach to the application of readability and lexical diversity formulas for reasons that are analyzed in detail in this paper. We evaluated the tool by using USE and BAWE, two corpora of texts that originate from students who use English as a medium of instruction.
