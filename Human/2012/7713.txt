The effect of network structure on phase transitions in queuing networks

Recently, De Martino et al have presented a general framework for the study of transportation phenomena on complex networks. One of their most significant achievements was a deeper understanding of the phase transition from the uncongested to the congested phase at a critical traffic load. In this paper, we also study phase transition in transportation networks using a discrete time random walk model. Our aim is to establish a direct connection between the structure of the graph and the value of the critical traffic load. Applying spectral graph theory, we show that the original results of De Martino et al showing that the critical loading depends only on the degree sequence of the graph -- suggesting that different graphs with the same degree sequence have the same critical loading if all other circumstances are fixed -- is valid only if the graph is dense enough. For sparse graphs, higher order corrections, related to the local structure of the network, appear.
