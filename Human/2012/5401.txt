Optimal Sequential Wireless Relay Placement on a Random Lattice Path

Our work is motivated by the need for impromptu (or "as-you-go") deployment of relay nodes (for establishing a packet communication path with a control centre) by fire-men/commandos while operating in an unknown environment. We consider a model, where a deployment operative steps along a random lattice path whose evolution is Markov. At each step, the path can randomly either continue in the same direction or take a turn "North" or "East," or come to an end, at which point a data source (e.g., a temperature sensor) has to be placed that will send packets to a control centre at the origin of the path. A decision has to be made at each step whether or not to place a wireless relay node. Assuming that the packet generation rate by the source is very low, and simple link-by-link scheduling, we consider the problem of relay placement so as to minimize the expectation of an end-to-end cost metric (a linear combination of the sum of convex hop costs and the number of relays placed). This impromptu relay placement problem is formulated as a total cost Markov decision process. First, we derive the optimal policy in terms of an optimal placement set and show that this set is characterized by a boundary beyond which it is optimal to place. Next, based on a simpler alternative one-step-look-ahead characterization of the optimal policy, we propose an algorithm which is proved to converge to the optimal placement set in a finite number of steps and which is faster than the traditional value iteration. We show by simulations that the distance based heuristic, usually assumed in the literature, is close to the optimal provided that the threshold distance is carefully chosen.
