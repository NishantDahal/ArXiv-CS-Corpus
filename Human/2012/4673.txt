Image based Cryptography from a distance

An information is a message which is received and understood. Information can be sent one person to another over a long range but the process of sending information must be done in a secure way especially in case of a private message. Mathematicians and Engineers have historically relied on different algorithmic techniques to secure messages and signals. Cryptography, to most people, is concerned with keeping communications private. Indeed, the protection of sensitive communications has been the emphasis of cryptography throughout much of its history. Sometimes it is safer to send a message using an image and thus cryptography can also be done using images during an emergency. The need to extract information from images and interpret their contents has been one of the driving factors in the development of image processing and cryptography during the past decades. In this paper, a simple cryptographic method was used to decode a message which was in an image and it was done using a popular computational software.
