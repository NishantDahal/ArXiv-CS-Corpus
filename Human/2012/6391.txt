Impact of E-Banking on Traditional Banking Services

Internet banking is changing the banking industry, having the major effects on banking relationships. Banking is now no longer confined to the branches were one has to approach the branch in person, to withdraw cash or deposit a cheque or request a statement of accounts. In true Internet banking, any inquiry or transaction is processed online without any reference to the branch (anywhere banking) at any time. Providing Internet banking is increasingly becoming a "need to have" than a "nice to have" service. The net banking, thus, now is more of a norm rather than an exception in many developed countries due to the fact that it is the cheapest way of providing banking services. This research paper will introduce you to e-banking, giving the meaning, functions, types, advantages and limitations of e-banking. It will also show the impact of e-banking on traditional services and finally the result documentation.
