Data Shapes and Data Transformations

Nowadays, information management systems deal with data originating from different sources including relational databases, NoSQL data stores, and Web data formats, varying not only in terms of data formats, but also in the underlying data model. Integrating data from heterogeneous data sources is a time-consuming and error-prone engineering task; part of this process requires that the data has to be transformed from its original form to other forms, repeating all along the life cycle. With this report we provide a principled overview on the fundamental data shapes tabular, tree, and graph as well as transformations between them, in order to gain a better understanding for performing said transformations more efficiently and effectively.
