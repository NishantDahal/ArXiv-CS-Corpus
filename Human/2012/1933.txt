Comparison Based Analysis of Different Cryptographic and Encryption Techniques Using Message Authentication Code (MAC) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are becoming popular day by day, however one of the main issue in WSN is its limited resources. We have to look to the resources to create Message Authentication Code (MAC) keeping in mind the feasibility of technique used for the sensor network at hand. This research work investigates different cryptographic techniques such as symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography. Furthermore, it compares different encryption techniques such as stream cipher (RC4), block cipher (RC2, RC5, RC6 etc) and hashing techniques (MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, SHA1 etc). The result of our work provides efficient techniques for communicating device, by selecting different comparison matrices i.e. energy consumption, processing time, memory and expenses that satisfies both the security and restricted resources in WSN environment to create MAC.
