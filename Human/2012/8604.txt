Microelectromechanical system cantilever-based frequency doublers

Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based on-chip resonators offer great potential for high frequency signal processing circuits like reference oscillators and filters. This is due to their exceptional features like small size, large frequency-quality factor product, integrability with CMOS ICs, low power consumption, low cost batch fabrication etc. A capacitively transduced cantilever beam resonator is one such popular MEMS resonator topology. In this letter, the inherent square-law nonlinearity of the voltage-to-force transfer function of a cantilever resonator's capacitive transducer has been employed for the realization of frequency doubling effect. Using this concept, frequency doubling of input signals of 500 kHz to 1 MHz, and 227.5 kHz to 455 kHz has been experimentally demonstrated for two cantilever beams of length 51.75 and 76.75 micrometer respectively. The MEMS cantilevers have been fabricated with polysilicon using the PolyMUMPs surface micromachining process, and their testing has been performed using Laser Doppler Vibrometry. The test results obtained are in reasonable compliance with the analytical and CoventorWare finite-element simulation results. The high efficiency demonstrated by the cantilever frequency doubler makes it a promising choice for signal generation at high frequencies.
