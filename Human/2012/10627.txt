Design and Implementation of Flight Visual Simulation System

The design requirement for flight visual simulation system is studied and the overall structure and development process are proposed in this paper. Through the construction of 3D scene model library and aircraft model, the rendering and interaction of visual scene are implemented. The changes of aircraft flight attitude in visual system are controlled by real-time calculation of aircraft aerodynamic and dynamic equations and flight simulation effect is enhanced by this kind of control. Several key techniques for optimizing 3D model and relative methods for large terrain modeling are explored for improving loading ability and rendering speed of the system. Experiment shows that, with specific function and performance guaranteed as a premise, the system achieves expected results, that is, precise real-time calculation of flight attitude and smooth realistic screen effect.
