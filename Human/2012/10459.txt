Information spreading with aging in heterogeneous populations

We study the critical properties of a model of information spreading based on the SIS epidemic model. Spreading rates decay with time, as ruled by two parameters, $ε$ and $l$, that can be either constant or randomly distributed in the population. The spreading dynamics is developed on top of Erdös-Renyi networks. We present the mean-field analytical solution of the model in its simplest formulation, and Monte Carlo simulations are performed for the more heterogeneous cases. The outcomes show that the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition whose critical point depends on the parameters $ε$ and $l$. In addition, we conclude that the more heterogeneous the population, the more favored the information spreading over the network.
