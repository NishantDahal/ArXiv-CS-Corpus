An Extended Network Coding Opportunity Discovery Scheme in Wireless Networks

Network coding is known as a promising approach to improve wireless network performance. How to discover the coding opportunity in relay nodes is really important for it. There are more coding chances, there are more times it can improve network throughput by network coding operation. In this paper, an extended network coding opportunity discovery scheme (ExCODE) is proposed, which is realized by appending the current node ID and all its 1-hop neighbors' IDs to the packet. ExCODE enables the next hop relay node to know which nodes else have already overheard the packet, so it can discover the potential coding opportunities as much as possible. ExCODE expands the region of discovering coding chance to n-hops, and have more opportunities to execute network coding operation in each relay node. At last, we implement ExCODE over the AODV protocol, and efficiency of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated with NS2 simulations, compared to the existing coding opportunity discovery scheme.
