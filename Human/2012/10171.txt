Multiple model software for airflow and thermal building simulation. A case study under tropical humid climate, in RÃ©union Island

The first purpose of our work has been to allow -as far as heat transfer modes, airflow calculation and meteorological data reconstitution are concerned- the integration of diverse interchangeable physical models in a single software tool for professional use, CODYRUN. The designer's objectives, precision requested and calculation time consideration, lead us to design a structure accepting selective use of models, taking into account multizone description and airflow patterns. With a building case study in Reunion Island, we first analyse the sensibility of the thermal model to diffuse radiation reconstitution on tilted surfaces. Then, a realistic balance between precision required and calculation time leads us to select detailed models for the zone of main interest, but to choose simplified models for the other zones.
