OCT Segmentation Survey and Summary Reviews and a Novel 3D Segmentation Algorithm and a Proof of Concept Implementation

We overview the existing OCT work, especially the practical aspects of it. We create a novel algorithm for 3D OCT segmentation with the goals of speed and/or accuracy while remaining flexible in the design and implementation for future extensions and improvements. The document at this point is a running draft being iteratively "developed" as a progress report as the work and survey advance. It contains the review and summarization of select OCT works, the design and implementation of the OCTMARF experimentation application and some results.
