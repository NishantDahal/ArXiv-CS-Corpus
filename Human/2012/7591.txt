A Robust Cryptographic System using Neighborhood-Generated Keys

The ability to hide information from unauthorized individuals has been a prevalent issue over the years. Countless algorithms such as DES, AES and SHA have been developed. These algorithms depend on varying key length and key management strategies to encrypt and decrypt messages. The size of the encrypted message is so large that it therefore consumes and wastes valuable storage space when implemented in organizations that store and handle large volumes of small data. The ability to share the generated keys securely also poses a problem. This paper proposes a robust cryptographic algorithm which generates its keys from the surroundings and already-designed coding schemes. The proposed system conserves storage space and processing power.The algorithm is implemented and tested using PHP and MySQL DBMS.
