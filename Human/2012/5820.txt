On Methods for the Formal Specification of Fault Tolerant Systems

This paper introduces different views for understanding problems and faults with the goal of defining a method for the formal specification of systems. The idea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification (LFTS) is proposed to make the method extensible to fault tolerant systems. The principle is layering the specification in different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and the others for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is described in terms of an Error Injector (EI), which represents a model of the erroneous interference coming from the environment. This structure has been inspired by the notion of idealized fault tolerant component but the combination of LFTS and EI using Rely/Guarantee reasoning to describe their interaction can be considered as a novel contribution. The progress toward this method and this way to organize fault tolerant specifications has been made experimenting on case studies and an example is presented.
