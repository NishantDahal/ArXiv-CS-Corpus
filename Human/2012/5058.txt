Introducing the Computable Universe

Some contemporary views of the universe assume information and computation to be key in understanding and explaining the basic structure underpinning physical reality. We introduce the Computable Universe exploring some of the basic arguments giving foundation to these visions. We will focus on the algorithmic and quantum aspects, and how these may fit and support the computable universe hypothesis.
