Performance Analysis of HR Portal Domain Components Extraction

Extraction of components pertaining to a particular domain not only reduces the cost but also helps in delivering a quality product. However, the advantages of the Component Level Interaction's (CLI's) are not clearly presented. In the first part of the paper the design of HR Portal application is described. Later the results are simulated using the Netbeans Profiler tool which exposes and highlights the performance characteristics of component based system pertaining to HR domain.
