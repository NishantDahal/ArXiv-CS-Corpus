Model based Software Develeopment: Issues & Challenges

One of the goals of software design is to model a system in such a way that it is easily understandable. Nowadays the tendency for software development is changing from manual coding to automatic code generation; it is becoming model-based. This is a response to the software crisis, in which the cost of hardware has decreased and conversely the cost of software development has increased sharply. The methodologies that allowed this change are model-based, thus relieving the human from detailed coding. Still there is a long way to achieve this goal, but work is being done worldwide to achieve this objective. This paper presents the drastic changes related to modeling and important challenging issues and techniques that recur in MBSD.
