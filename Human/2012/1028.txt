Visual definition of procedures for automatic virtual scene generation

With more and more digital media, especially in the field of virtual reality where detailed and convincing scenes are much required, procedural scene generation is a big helping tool for artists. A problem is that defining scene descriptions through these procedures usually requires a knowledge in formal language grammars, programming theory and manually editing textual files using a strict syntax, making it less intuitive to use. Luckily, graphical user interfaces has made a lot of tasks on computers easier to perform and out of the belief that creating computer programs can also be one of them, visual programming languages (VPLs) have emerged. The goal in VPLs is to shift more work from the programmer to the integrated development environment (IDE), making programming an user-friendlier task.
  In this thesis, an approach of using a VPL for defining procedures that automatically generate virtual scenes is presented. The methods required to build a VPL are presented, including a novel method of generating readable code in a structured programming language. Also, the methods for achieving basic principles of VPLs will be shown -- suitable visual presentation of information and guiding the programmer in the right direction using constraints. On the other hand, procedural generation methods are presented in the context of visual programming -- adapting the application programming interface (API) of these methods to better serve the user. The main focus will be on the methods for urban modeling, such as building, city layout and details generation with random number generation used to create non-deterministic scenes.
