What is the Nature of Chinese MicroBlogging: Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo

China has the largest number of online users in the world and about 20% internet users are from China. This is a huge, as well as a mysterious, market for IT industry due to various reasons such as culture difference. Twitter is the largest microblogging service in the world and Tencent Weibo is one of the largest microblogging services in China. Employ the two data sets as a source in our study, we try to unveil the unique behaviors of Chinese users. We have collected the entire Tencent Weibo from 10th, Oct, 2011 to 5th, Jan, 2012 and obtained 320 million user profiles, 5.15 billion user actions. We study Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels. From the macro level, Tencent users are more active on forwarding messages, but with less reciprocal relationships than Twitter users, their topic preferences are very different from Twitter users from both content and time consuming; besides, information can be diffused more efficient in Tencent Weibo. From the micro level, we mainly evaluate users' social influence from two indexes: "Forward" and \Follower", we study how users' actions will contribute to their social influences, and further identify unique features of Tencent users. According to our studies, Tencent users' actions are more personalized and diversity, and the influential users play a more important part in the whole networks. Based on the above analysis, we design a graphical model for predicting users' forwarding behaviors. Our experimental results on the large Tencent Weibo data validate the correctness of the discoveries and the effectiveness of the proposed model. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Tencentsphere and information diffusion on it.
