High-dimensional noise-based logical controller

We introduce a scheme for controlling physical and other quantities; utilizing noise-based logic for control-and-optimization with high dimensionality, similarly how the Hilbert space of quantum informatics can be utilized for such purpose. As a concrete realization of the noise-based control scheme, we introduce "Dictatorial control" where noise-based logic results in an exponential speedup of operation.
