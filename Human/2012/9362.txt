Minimal Evacuation Times and Stability

We consider a system where packets (jobs) arrive for processing using one of the policies in a given class. We study the connection between the minimal evacuation times and the stability region of the system under the given class of policies. The result is used to establish the equality of information theoretic capacity region and system stability region for the multiuser broadcast erasure channel with feedback.
