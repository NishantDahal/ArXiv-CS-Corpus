Factors influencing the decision of Saudi consumers to purchase form online retailers: Quantitative Analysis

This paper presents the preliminary findings of a study researching the diffusion and the adoption of online retailing in Saudi Arabia. It reports new research that identifies and explores the key issues that positively and negatively influence the decision of Saudi customers to buy from online retailers in Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi Arabia has the largest and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces in the Arab region, e-commerce activities are not progressing at the same speed. While the overall research project involves exploratory research using mixed methods, the focus of this paper is on a quantitative analysis of responses obtained from a survey of Saudi customers, with the design of the questionnaire instrument being based on the findings of a qualitative analysis reported in a previous paper. The main findings of the current analysis include a list of key factors that affect Saudi customers' purchase from Saudi online retailers, and quantitative indications of the relative strengths of the various relationships.
