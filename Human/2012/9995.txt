Loopy Belief Propogation and Gibbs Measures

We address the question of convergence in the loopy belief propagation (LBP) algorithm.  Specifically, we relate convergence of LBP to the existence of a weak limit for a sequence of Gibbs measures defined on the LBP      s associated computation tree.Using tools FROM the theory OF Gibbs measures we develop easily testable sufficient      conditions FOR     convergence.The failure OF convergence OF LBP implies the existence      OF multiple phases FOR     the associated Gibbs specification.These results give new insight INTO the mechanics OF the algorithm.
