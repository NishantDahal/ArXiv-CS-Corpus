Performance Improvement of VOD System by Policy Based Traffic Handle

The distributed system use to enhance the performance of all types of multimedia service in the next generation network. The packet loss occurs in the video on demand system due to delay and huge traffic load from the both sides of client request and server response. It's bring a real challenge to the researcher how to minimize the traffic load in the video on demand system to provide better utilization of the available bandwidth in the very race situation. The normal client server type architecture can't solve the huge client requirement. In this work, I have used number of remote servers that partly shears the total load in the video on demand system on behalf of the total system load. This work presents the scenario of controlling the traffic load in the localization wise sub domain that gives good impact to control the traffic in the whole distributed system. The user increased rapidly in the network it posed heavy load to the video servers. The requested clients, servers are all distributed in nature and the data stream delivered according to client request. In this work presents the performance of the video on demand server by policy based traffic handle, at real time with respect to incoming multi rate traffic pattern.
