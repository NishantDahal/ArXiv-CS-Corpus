Modeling and Evaluating Enhancements in Expanding Ring Search Algorithm for Wireless Reactive Protocols

In case of high dynamic topology, reactive routing protocols provide quick convergence by faster route discoveries and route maintenance. Frequent roadcasts reduce routing efficiency in terms of broadcast cost; Bk, and expected time cost; E[t]. These costs are optimized using different mechanisms. So, we select three reactive routing protocols; Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), and DYnamic Manet On-demad (DYMO). We model expanding Ring Search (ERS); an optimization mechanism in the selected protocols to reduce Bk and E[t]. A novel contribution of this work is enhancement of default ERS in the protocols to optimize Bk and E[t]. Using NS-2, we evaluate and compare default-ERS used by these protocols; AODV-ERS1, DSR-ERS1 and DYMO-ERS1 with enhanced-ERS; AODVERS2, DSR-ERS2 and DYMO-ERS2. From modeling and analytical comparison, we deduce that by adjusting Time-To-Live (T TL) value of a network, efficient optimizations of Bk and E[t] can be achieved.
