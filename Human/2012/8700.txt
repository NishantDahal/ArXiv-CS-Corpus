Level Set Estimation from Compressive Measurements using Box Constrained Total Variation Regularization

Estimating the level set of a signal from measurements is a task that arises in a variety of fields, including medical imaging, astronomy, and digital elevation mapping. Motivated by scenarios where accurate and complete measurements of the signal may not available, we examine here a simple procedure for estimating the level set of a signal from highly incomplete measurements, which may additionally be corrupted by additive noise. The proposed procedure is based on box-constrained Total Variation (TV) regularization. We demonstrate the performance of our approach, relative to existing state-of-the-art techniques for level set estimation from compressive measurements, via several simulation examples.
