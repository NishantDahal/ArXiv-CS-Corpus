Survey and comparison for Open and closed sources in cloud computing

Cloud computing is a new technology widely studied in recent years. Now there are many cloud platforms both in industry and in academic circle. How to understand and use these platforms is a big issue. A detailed comparison has been presented in this paper focused on the aspects such as the architecture, characteristics, application and so on. To know the differences between open source and close source in cloud environment we mention some examples for Software-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service. We made comparison between them. Before conclusion we demonstrate some convergences and differences between open and closed platform, but we realized open source should be the best option.
