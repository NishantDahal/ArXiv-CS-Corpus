Clustered Sparsity and Separation of Cartoon and Texture

Natural images are typically a composition of cartoon and texture structures. A medical image might, for instance, show a mixture of gray matter and the skull cap. One common task is to separate such an image into two single images, one containing the cartoon part and the other containing the texture part. Recently, a powerful class of algorithms using sparse approximation and $\ell_1$ minimization has been introduced to resolve this problem, and numerous inspiring empirical results have already been obtained.
  In this paper we provide the first thorough theoretical study of the separation of a combination of cartoon and texture structures in a model situation using this class of algorithms. The methodology we consider expands the image in a combined dictionary consisting of a curvelet tight frame and a Gabor tight frame and minimizes the $\ell_1$ norm on the analysis side. Sparse approximation properties then force the cartoon components into the curvelet coefficients and the texture components into the Gabor coefficients, thereby separating the image. Utilizing the fact that the coefficients are clustered geometrically, we prove that at sufficiently fine scales arbitrarily precise separation is possible. Main ingredients of our analysis are the novel notion of cluster coherence and clustered/geometric sparsity. Our analysis also provides a deep understanding on when separation is still possible.
