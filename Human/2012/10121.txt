Design and Performance Study of Smart Antenna Systems for WIMAX Applications

In this paper we propose an approach that uses homodyne receivers to design smart antenna systems. The receivers functions are to detect angles of arrivals of seven incoming RF signals using MUSIC or ESPRIT algorithms. The characteristics of each algorithm are critical for the systems precision as well as receivers types. Results are deduced from the simulation of each system, using the Advanced Design System (ADS) and MATLAB. These are compared to results deduced from real systems in the WIMAX (3.5GHz) domains.
