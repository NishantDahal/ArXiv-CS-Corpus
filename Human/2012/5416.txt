A Unified Approach of Observability Analysis for Airborne SLAM

Observability is a key aspect of the state estimation problem of SLAM, However, the dimension and variables of SLAM system might be changed with new features, to which little attention is paid in the previous work. In this paper, a unified approach of observability analysis for SLAM system is provided, whether the dimension and variables of SLAM system are changed or not, we can use this approach to analyze the local or total observability of the SLAM system.
