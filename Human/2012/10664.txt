How to make dull cellular automata complex by adding memory: Rule 126 case study

Using Rule 126 elementary cellular automaton (ECA) we demonstrate that a chaotic discrete system --- when enriched with memory -- hence exhibits complex dynamics where such space exploits on an ample universe of periodic patterns induced from original information of the ahistorical system. First we analyse classic ECA Rule 126 to identify basic characteristics with mean field theory, basins, and de Bruijn diagrams. In order to derive this complex dynamics, we use a kind of memory on Rule 126; from here interactions between gliders are studied for detecting stationary patterns, glider guns and simulating specific simple computable functions produced by glider collisions.
