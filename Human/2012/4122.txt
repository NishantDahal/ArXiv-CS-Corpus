Visualization techniques for data mining of Latur district satellite imagery

This study presents a new visualization tool for classification of satellite imagery. Visualization of feature space allows exploration of patterns in the image data and insight into the classification process and related uncertainty. Visual Data Mining provides added value to image classifications as the user can be involved in the classification process providing increased confidence in and understanding of the results. In this study, we present a prototype visualization tool for visual data mining (VDM) of satellite imagery. The visualization tool is showcased in a classification study of highresolution imageries of Latur district in Maharashtra state of India.
