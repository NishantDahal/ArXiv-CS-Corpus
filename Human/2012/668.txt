D-iteration: evaluation of the update algorithm

The aim of this paper is to analyse the gain of the update algorithm associated to the recently proposed D-iteration: the D-iteration is a fluid diffusion based new iterative method. It exploits a simple intuitive decomposition of the product matrix-vector as elementary operations of fluid diffusion (forward scheme) associated to a new algebraic representation. We show through experimentations on real datasets how much this approach can improve the computation efficiency in presence of the graph evolution.
