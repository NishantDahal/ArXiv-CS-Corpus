Non-null Infinitesimal Micro-steps: a Metric Temporal Logic Approach

Many systems include components interacting with each other that evolve with possibly very different speeds. To deal with this situation many formal models adopt the abstraction of "zero-time transitions", which do not consume time. These however have several drawbacks in terms of naturalness and logic consistency, as a system is modeled to be in different states at the same time. We propose a novel approach that exploits concepts from non-standard analysis to introduce a notion of micro- and macro-steps in an extension of the TRIO metric temporal logic, called X-TRIO. We use X-TRIO to provide a formal semantics and an automated verification technique to Stateflow-like notations used in the design of flexible manufacturing systems.
