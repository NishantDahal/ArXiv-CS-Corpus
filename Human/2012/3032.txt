Timing acquisition and demodulation of an UWB system based on the differential scheme

Blind synchronization constitutes a major challenge in realizing highly efficient ultra wide band (UWB) systems because of the short pulse duration which requires a fast synchronization algorithm to accommodate several asynchronous users. In this paper, we present a new Code Block Synchronization Algorithm (CBSA) based on a particular code design for a non coherent transmission. Synchronization algorithm is applied directly on received signal to estimate timing offset, without needing any training sequence. Different users can share the available bandwidth by means of different spreading codes with different lengths. This allows the receiver to separate users, and to recover the timing information of the transmitted symbols. Simulation results and comparisons validate the promising performance of the proposed scheme even in a multi user scenario. In fact, the proposed algorithm offers a gain of about 3 dB in comparison with reference [5].
