Region-based Approach for Determining the Optimal Path Using PSO

Many research works have been carried out recently to find the optimal path in network routing. Among them the evolutionary algorithms is an area where work is carried out extensively. We in this paper, have used PSO for finding the optimal path and the concept of region based network is introduced along with the use of indirect encoding. A comparative study of genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is carried out, and it was found that PSO performed better than GA.
