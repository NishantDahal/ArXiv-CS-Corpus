A Conceptual Framework for the Promotion of Trusted Online Retailing Environment in Saudi Arabia

This paper presents a model conceptual framework that is aimed at promoting trust in the online retailing environment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Despite rapid Internet growth, the development of online retailing in Saudi Arabia continues to progress very slowly compared to that of the developed and leading developing countries. To determine the reason behind the sluggish growth of online retailing in the KSA, a mixed methods study involving retailers and customers was conducted in four stages. The outcomes of the study point to distrust in the online retailing environment in Saudi Arabia as a key inhibitory factor for growth. As such, a five-part model is proposed to promote trust in the online shopping environment in the KSA.
