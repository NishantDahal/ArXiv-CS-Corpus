Enumeration of sequences with large alphabets

This study focuses on efficient schemes for enumerative coding of $σ$--ary sequences by mainly borrowing ideas from Öktem & Astola's \cite{Oktem99} hierarchical enumerative coding and Schalkwijk's \cite{Schalkwijk72} asymptotically optimal combinatorial code on binary sequences. By observing that the number of distinct $σ$--dimensional vectors having an inner sum of $n$, where the values in each dimension are in range $[0...n]$ is $K(σ,n) = \sum_{i=0}^{σ-1} {{n-1} \choose {σ-1-i}} {σ \choose {i}}$, we propose representing $C$ vector via enumeration, and present necessary algorithms to perform this task. We prove $\log K(σ,n)$ requires approximately $ (σ-1) \log (σ-1) $ less bits than the naive $(σ-1)\lceil \log (n+1) \rceil$ representation for relatively large $n$, and examine the results for varying alphabet sizes experimentally. We extend the basic scheme for the enumerative coding of $σ$--ary sequences by introducing a new method for large alphabets. We experimentally show that the newly introduced technique is superior to the basic scheme by providing experiments on DNA sequences.
