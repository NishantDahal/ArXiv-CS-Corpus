Search on the Brink of Chaos

The classical linear search problem is studied from the view point of Hamiltonian dynamics. For the specific, yet representative case of exponentially distributed position of the hidden object, we show that the optimal plan follows an unstable separatrix which is present in the associated Hamiltonian system.
