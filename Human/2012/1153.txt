The impact of propagation environment and traffic load on the performance of routing protocols in ad hoc networks

Wireless networks are characterized by a dynamic topology triggered by the nodes mobility. Thus, the wireless multi-hops connection and the channel do not have a determinist behaviour such as: interference or multiple paths. Moreover, the nodes' invisibility makes the wireless channel difficult to detect. This wireless networks' behaviour should be scrutinized. In our study, we mainly focus on radio propagation models by observing the evolution of the routing layer's performances in terms of the characteristics of the physical layer. For this purpose, we first examine and then display the simulation findings of the impact of different radio propagation models on the performance of ad hoc networks. To fully understand how these various radio models influence the networks performance, we have compared the performances of several routing protocols (DSR, AODV, and DSDV) for each propagation model. To complete our study, a comparison of energy performance based routing protocols and propagation models are presented. In order to reach credible results, we focused on the notion of nodes' speed and the number of connections by using the well known network simulator NS-2.
