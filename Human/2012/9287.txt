Estimate of resources required for a meaningful reform of education

A simple estimate in terms of currency units shows that a meaningful educational reform process can be launched and sustained over many generations of teachers with support of parents of students. In the estimate, the steady inflow of resources from parents provides support for advanced studies by teachers. Not to waste the resources on spurious activities, the estimated inflow proceeds directly from the parents as clients to the providers of required reform program. The providers are the experts in various disciplines who excel in helping teachers become great. Their services to teachers are ultimately assessed by parents on the basis of changes in behavior of children. The resulting reform program grows slowly from small seeds. The running cost of the reform process to parents appears surprisingly low while its development leads to the desired changes over time.
