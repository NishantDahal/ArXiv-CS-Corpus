A Comprehensive Model to achieve Service Reusability for Multi level stakeholders using Non-Functional attributes of Service Oriented Architecture

SOA is a prominent paradigm for accomplishing reuse of services. Service reusability is one dominant factor which has a greater influence on achieving quality in SOA systems. There exists sufficient research in this area and researchers have contributed many works towards achieving quality in SOA systems but much emphasis was not provided on service reusability [1] [2] [3]. Few authors have addressed reusability factor with limited non-functional attributes. Our study focuses on identifying the non-functional attributes which have major or greater influence towards obtaining reusability in SOA systems. The objective of this study goes into the next level, to categorize the non-functional attributes on multi stakeholder's perspective i.e. Service Consumer, Service Provider and Service Developer which paves the way to build a comprehensive quality model for achieving Service Reusability
