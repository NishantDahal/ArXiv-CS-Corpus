Design and Fabrication of Micromachined Resonators

Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based on-chip resonators offer great potential for sensing and high frequency signal processing applications due to their exceptional features like small size, large frequency-quality factor product, integrability with CMOS ICs, low power consumption etc. This work is mainly aimed at the design, modeling, simulation, and fabrication of micromachined polysilicon disk resonators exhibiting radial-contour mode vibrations. A few other bulk mode modified resonator geometries are also being explored. The resonator structures have been designed and simulated in CoventorWare finite-element platform and fabricated by the PolyMUMPs surface micromachining process.
