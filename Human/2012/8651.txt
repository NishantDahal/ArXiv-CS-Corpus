A new application of Multi modal Biometrics in home and office security system

Biometric door lock security systems are used at those places where you have important information and stuffs. In that kind of places multibiometric electronic door lock security systems that are based on finger print and iris recognization.Multibiometric door lock security systems are used to prevent the door related burglaries such as break ins occurred in different forms so this is the best method to prevent this type of happenings. Unlike keyed locks, there is no need to take the keys with you when you go out without necessary of worrying about losing keys.This paper proposes a multimodal biometrics door lock system with iris and fingerprint as a computer application for automatically identifying or verifying a person from fingerprint iris recognition system. The first stage is identification and second one is verifying that whether he is a genuine user or imposter. During second stage system compares the input set with all available stored set in database. This comparison gives a ranked list of matches. Based on the rank retrieved an alarm is activated automatically when any unauthorized person tries to open the door. So this kind of multimodal biometrics will provide a highly secured and authenticated access.
