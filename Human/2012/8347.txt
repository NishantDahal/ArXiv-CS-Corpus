Proceedings 8th International Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems

This volume contains the final and revised versions of the papers presented at the 8th International Workshop on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems (WWV 2012). The workshop was held in Stockholm, Sweden, on June 16, 2012, as part of DisCoTec 2012.
  WWV is a yearly workshop that aims at providing an interdisciplinary forum to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the advancement of hybrid methods that exploit concepts and tools drawn from Rule-based programming, Software engineering, Formal methods and Web-oriented research. WWV has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. The proceedings have been produced after the symposium to allow the authors to incorporate the feedback gathered during the event in the published papers.
  All papers submitted to the workshop were reviewed by at least three Program Committee members or external referees. The Program Committee held an electronic discussion leading to the acceptance of all papers for presentation at the workshop. In addition to the presentation of the contributed papers, the scientific programme included the invited talks by two outstanding speakers: Rocco De Nicola (IMT, Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca, Italy) and Jos√® Luiz Fiadeiro (Royal Holloway, United Kingdom).
