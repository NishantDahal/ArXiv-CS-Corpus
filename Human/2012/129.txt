Mathematical and computational modeling for describing the basic behavior of free radicals and antioxidants within epithelial cells

The traditional methods of the biology, based on illustrative descriptions and linear logic explanations, are discussed. This work aims to improve this approach by introducing alternative tools to describe and represent complex biological systems. Two models were developed, one mathematical and another computational, both were made in order to study the biological process between free radicals and antioxidants. Each model was used to study the same process but in different scenarios. The mathematical model was used to study the biological process in an epithelial cells culture; this model was validated with the experimental data of Anne Hanneken's research group from the Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, published by the journal Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science in July 2006. The computational model was used to study the same process in an individual. The model was made using C++ programming language, supported by the network theory of aging.
