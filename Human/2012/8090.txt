Budgeted Learning of Naive-Bayes Classifiers

Frequently, acquiring training data has an associated cost. We consider the     situation where the learner may purchase      data during training, subject TO a budget. IN particular,     we examine the CASE WHERE each feature label has an associated cost, AND     the total cost OF ALL feature labels acquired during training must      NOT exceed the budget.This paper compares methods FOR     choosing which feature label TO purchase next,     given the budget AND     the CURRENT belief state OF naive Bayes model parameters.Whereas      active learning has traditionally focused ON myopic(greedy)     strategies FOR query selection,     this paper presents a tractable method FOR     incorporating knowledge OF the budget INTO the decision making process,     which improves performance.
