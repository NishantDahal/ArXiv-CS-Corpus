All Spin Nano-magnetic State Elements

We propose an all spin state element to enable all spin state machines using spin currents and nanomagnets. We demonstrate via numerical simulations the operation of a state element a critical building block for synchronous, sequential logic computation. The numerical models encompass Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) nanomagnet dynamics with stochastic models and vector spin-transport in metallic magnetic and non-magnetic channels. Combined with all spin combinatorial logic, the state elements can enable synchronous and asynchronous computing elements.
