Pragmatic Physical Layer Encryption for Achieving Perfect Secrecy

Conventionally, secrecy is achieved using cryptographic techniques beyond the physical layer. Recent studies raise the interest of performing encryption within the physical layer by exploiting some unique features of the physical wireless channel. Following this spirit, we present a novel physical layer encryption (PLE) scheme that randomizes the radio signal using a secret key extracted from the wireless channel under the assumption of channel reciprocity. Specifically, we propose to jointly design the encryption function and the secret-key generation method. On one hand, we establish a sufficient and necessary condition for the encryption function to achieve perfect secrecy. Based on that, several candidate encryption functions are proposed and compared. We show that, given the secret key available to the legitimate users, perfect secrecy can be achieved without compromising the capability of the communication channel. On the other hand, we study the practical design of the secret-key generation method based on the channel reciprocity. We show that, by introducing marginal system overhead, the key agreement between the legitimate users can be done with a high success probability. The performance advantages of the proposed PLE method is verified through comparisons against other existing PLE methods.
