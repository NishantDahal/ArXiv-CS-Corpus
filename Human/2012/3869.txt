A simpler derivation of the coding theorem

A simple proof for the Shannon coding theorem, using only the Markov inequality, is presented. The technique is useful for didactic purposes, since it does not require many preliminaries and the information density and mutual information follow naturally in the proof. It may also be applicable to situations where typicality is not natural.
