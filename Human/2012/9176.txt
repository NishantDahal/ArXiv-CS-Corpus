Various approaches to a human preference analysis in a digital signage display design

The paper is concerned with various ways of analysing the subjective assessment of displaying digital signage content. In the beginning the brief description of the signage system evolution is described and next, the carried out ex-periment is depicted. The preferences of the 32 subjects were obtained using pairwise comparisons of the designed screen formats. Then the priorities were derived by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1977; 1980) framework. The gathered data were modelled and analysed by means of the analysis of variance, multiple regression, conjoint and factor analysis. The results suggest that the application of different methods of preference analysis may provide additional information, which could facilitate more in-depth understanding of the given preference structure.
