We.I.Pe: Web Identification of People using e-mail ID

With the phenomenal growth of content in the World Wide Web, the diversity of user supplied queries have become vivid. Searching for people on the web has become an important type of search activity in the web search engines. This paper proposes a model named "We.I.Pe" to identify people on the World Wide Web using e-mail Id as the primary input. The approach followed in this research work provides the collected information, based on the user supplied e-mail id, in an easier to navigate manner. The grouping of collected information based on various sources makes the result visualization process more effective. The proposed model is validated by a prototype implementation. Experiments conducted on the prototype implementation provide encouraging results
