Reproduction of Images by Gamut Mapping and Creation of New Test Charts in Prepress Process

With the advent of digital images the problem of keeping picture visualization uniformity arises because each printing or scanning device has its own color chart. So, universal color profiles are made by ICC to bring uniformity in various types of devices. Keeping that color profile in mind various new color charts are created and calibrated with the help of standard IT8 test charts available in the market. The main objective to color reproduction is to produce the identical picture at device output. For that principles for gamut mapping has been designed
