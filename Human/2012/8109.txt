A possibilistic handling of partially ordered information

In a standard possibilistic logic, prioritized information are encoded by     means of weighted knowledge base. This paper proposes an extension of     possibilistic logic for dealing with partially ordered information. We Show     that all basic notions of standard possibilitic logic (sumbsumption, syntactic     and semantic inference, etc.) have natural couterparts when dealing with     partially ordered information. We also propose an algorithm which computes     possibilistic conclusions of a partial knowledge base of a partially ordered     knowlege base.
