Co-community Structure in Time-varying Networks

In this report, we introduce the concept of co-community structure in time-varying networks. We propose a novel optimization algorithm to rapidly detect co-community structure in these networks. Both theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed method not only can resolve detailed co-communities, but also can effectively identify the dynamical phenomena in these networks.
