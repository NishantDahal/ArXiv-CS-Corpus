Bridging the Gap between Technical Heterogeneity of Context-Aware Platforms: Experimenting a Service Based Connectivity between Adaptable Android, WComp and OpenORB

Many companies include in their Information Systems (IS) several communicating heterogeneous middleware according to their technical needs. The need is the same when IS requires using context aware platforms for different aims. Moreover, users may be mobile and want to receive and send services with their PDA that more often supports Android based Human Man Interface. In this paper, we show how we extend Android to make it adaptable and open. We also present how we communicate between different heterogeneous context aware platforms as WComp and OpenORB by using Android and Web Services. We introduce a concrete case study to explain our approach.
