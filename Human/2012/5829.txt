Secure Cloud Communication for Effective Cost Management System through MSBE

In Cloud Computing Architecture, Brokers are responsible to provide services to the end users. An Effective Cost Management System (ECMS) which works over Secure Cloud Communication Paradigm (SCCP) helps in finding a communication link with overall minimum cost of links. We propose an improved Broker Cloud Communication Paradigm (BCCP) with integration of security issues. Two algorithms are included, first is Secure Optimized Route Cost Finder (S-ORCF) to find optimum route between broker and cloud on the behalf of cost factor and second is Secure Optimized Route Management (S-ORM) to maintain optimum route. These algorithms proposed with cryptographic integrity of the secure route discovery process in efficient routing approaches between broker and cloud. There is lack in Dynamic Source Routing Approach to verify whether any intermediate node has been deleted, inserted or modified with no valid authentication. We use symmetric cryptographic primitives, which is made possible due to multisource broadcast encryption scheme. This paper outlines the use of secure route discovery protocol (SRDP)that employs such a security paradigm in cloud computing.
