CLP(BN): Constraint Logic Programming for Probabilistic Knowledge

We present CLP(BN), a novel approach that aims at expressing Bayesian     networks through the constraint logic programming framework. Arguably, an     important limitation of traditional Bayesian networks is that they are     propositional, and thus cannot represent relations between multiple similar     objects in multiple contexts. Several researchers have thus proposed     first-order languages to describe such networks. Namely, one very successful     example of this approach are the Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), that     combine Bayesian networks with relational database technology. The key     difficulty that we had to address when designing CLP(cal{BN}) is that logic     based representations use ground terms to denote objects. With probabilitic     data, we need to be able to uniquely represent an object whose value we are not     sure about. We use {sl Skolem functions} as unique new symbols that uniquely     represent objects with unknown value. The semantics of CLP(cal{BN}) programs     then naturally follow from the general framework of constraint logic     programming, as applied to a specific domain where we have probabilistic data.     This paper introduces and defines CLP(cal{BN}), and it describes an     implementation and initial experiments. The paper also shows how     CLP(cal{BN}) relates to Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs), Ngo and     Haddawys Probabilistic Logic Programs, AND Kersting AND     De Raedts Bayesian     Logic Programs.
