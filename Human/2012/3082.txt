How China Is Blocking Tor

Not only the free web is victim to China's excessive censorship, but also the Tor anonymity network: the Great Firewall of China prevents thousands of potential Tor users from accessing the network. In this paper, we investigate how the blocking mechanism is implemented, we conjecture how China's Tor blocking infrastructure is designed and we propose countermeasures. Our work bolsters the understanding of China's censorship capabilities and thus paves the way towards more effective evasion techniques.
