Concurrent Models for Object Execution

In previous work we developed a framework of computational models for the concurrent execution of functions on different levels of abstraction. It shows that the traditional sequential execution of function is just a possible implementation of an abstract computational model that allows for the concurrent execution of function. We use this framework as base for the development of abstract computational models that allow for the concurrent execution of objects.
