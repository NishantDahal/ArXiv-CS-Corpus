House of Graphs: a database of interesting graphs

In this note we present House of Graphs (http://hog.grinvin.org) which is a new database of graphs. The key principle is to have a searchable database and offer -- next to complete lists of some graph classes -- also a list of special graphs that already turned out to be interesting and relevant in the study of graph theoretic problems or as counterexamples to conjectures. This list can be extended by users of the database.
