Dynamic Priority Queue: An SDRAM Arbiter With Bounded Access Latencies for Tight WCET Calculation

This report introduces a shared resource arbitration scheme "DPQ - Dynamic Priority Queue" which provides bandwidth guarantees and low worst case latency to each master in an MPSoC. Being a non-trivial candidate for timing analysis, SDRAM has been chosen as a showcase, but the approach is valid for any shared resource arbitration.
  Due to its significant cost, data rate and physical size advantages, SDRAM is a potential candidate for cost sensitive, safety critical and space conserving systems. The variable access latency is a major drawback of SDRAM that induces largely over estimated Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) bounds of applications. In this report we present the DPQ together with an algorithm to predict the shared SDRAM's worst case latencies. We use the approach to calculate WCET bounds of six hardware tasks executing on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA with shared DDR2 memory. The results show that the DPQ is a fair arbitration scheme and produces low WCET bounds.
