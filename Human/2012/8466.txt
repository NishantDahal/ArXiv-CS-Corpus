Incentive Decision Processes

We consider Incentive Decision Processes, where a principal seeks to reduce its costs due to another agent's behavior, by offering incentives to the agent for alternate behavior. We focus on the case where a principal interacts with a greedy agent whose preferences are hidden and static. Though IDPs can be directly modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), we show that it is possible to directly reduce or approximate the IDP as a polynomially-sized MDP: when this representation is approximate, we prove the resulting policy is boundedly-optimal for the original IDP. Our empirical simulations demonstrate the performance benefit of our algorithms over simpler approaches, and also demonstrate that our approximate representation results in a significantly faster algorithm whose performance is extremely close to the optimal policy for the original IDP.
