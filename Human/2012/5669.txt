Compact Value-Function Representations for Qualitative Preferences

We consider the challenge of preference elicitation in systems that help users discover the most desirable item(s) within a given database. Past work on preference elicitation focused on structured models that provide a factored representation of users' preferences. Such models require less information to construct and support efficient reasoning algorithms. This paper makes two substantial contributions to this area: (1) Strong representation theorems for factored value functions. (2) A methodology that utilizes our representation results to address the problem of optimal item selection.
