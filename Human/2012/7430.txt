Applicability of Crisp and Fuzzy Logic in Intelligent Response Generation

This paper discusses the merits and demerits of crisp logic and fuzzy logic with respect to their applicability in intelligent response generation by a human being and by a robot. Intelligent systems must have the capability of taking decisions that are wise and handle situations intelligently. A direct relationship exists between the level of perfection in handling a situation and the level of completeness of the available knowledge or information or data required to handle the situation. The paper concludes that the use of crisp logic with complete knowledge leads to perfection in handling situations whereas fuzzy logic can handle situations imperfectly only. However, in the light of availability of incomplete knowledge fuzzy theory is more effective but may be disadvantageous as compared to crisp logic.
