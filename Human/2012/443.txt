Novel Modulation Techniques using Isomers as Messenger Molecules for Molecular Communication via Diffusion

In this paper, we propose novel modulation techniques using isomers as messenger molecules for nano communication via diffusion. To evaluate achievable rate performance, we compare the proposed techniques with concentration-based and molecular-type-based methods. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed modulation techniques achieve higher data transmission rate performance than conventional insulin based concepts.
