Some Computational Aspects of Essential Properties of Evolution and Life

While evolution has inspired algorithmic methods of heuristic optimisation, little has been done in the way of using concepts of computation to advance our understanding of salient aspects of biological phenomena. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, interesting conclusions can be drawn that are of relevance to behavioural evolution. We will focus on two important features of life--robustness and fitness--which, we will argue, are related to algorithmic probability and to the thermodynamics of computation, disciplines that may be capable of modelling key features of living organisms, and which can be used in formulating new algorithms of evolutionary computation.
