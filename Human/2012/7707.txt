A Comparative Study between Moravec and Harris Corner Detection of Noisy Images Using Adaptive Wavelet Thresholding Technique

In this paper a comparative study between Moravec and Harris Corner Detection has been done for obtaining features required to track and recognize objects within a noisy image. Corner detection of noisy images is a challenging task in image processing. Natural images often get corrupted by noise during acquisition and transmission. As Corner detection of these noisy images does not provide desired results, hence de-noising is required. Adaptive wavelet thresholding approach is applied for the same.
