An Automated Petri-Net Based Approach for Change Management in Distributed Telemedicine Environment

The worldwide healthcare industry is facing a number of daunting challenges which are forcing healthcare systems worldwide to adapt and transform, and will ultimately completely redefine the way they do business and deliver care for patients. In this paper, we present a distributed telemedicine environement reaping from both the benefits of Service Oriented Approach (SOA) and the strong telecoms capabilities. We propose an automated approach to handle changes in a distributed telemedicine environement. A combined Petri nets model to handle changes and Reconfigurable Petri nets model to react to these changes are used to fulfill telemedicine functional and non functional requirements.
