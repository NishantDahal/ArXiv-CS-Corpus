Association schemes related to Delsarte-Goethals codes

In this paper, we construct an infinite series of 9-class association schemes from a refinement of the partition of Delsarte-Goethals codes by their Lee weights. The explicit expressions of the dual schemes are determined through direct manipulations of complicated exponential sums. As a byproduct, the other three infinite families of association schemes are also obtained as fusion schemes and quotient schemes.
