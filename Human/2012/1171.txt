Pattern classes and priority queues

When a set of permutations comprising a pattern class C is submitted as input to a priority queue the resulting output is again a pattern class C'. The basis of C' is determined for pattern classes C whose basis elements have length 3, and is finite in these cases. An example is given of a class C with basis 2431 for which C is not finitely based.
