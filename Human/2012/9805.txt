An Efficient Biological Sequence Compression Technique Using LUT And Repeat In The Sequence

Data compression plays an important role to deal with high volumes of DNA sequences in the field of Bioinformatics. Again data compression techniques directly affect the alignment of DNA sequences. So the time needed to decompress a compressed sequence has to be given equal priorities as with compression ratio. This article contains first introduction then a brief review of different biological sequence compression after that my proposed work then our two improved Biological sequence compression algorithms after that result followed by conclusion and discussion, future scope and finally references. These algorithms gain a very good compression factor with higher saving percentage and less time for compression and decompression than the previous Biological Sequence compression algorithms. Keywords: Hash map table, Tandem repeats, compression factor, compression time, saving percentage, compression, decompression process.
