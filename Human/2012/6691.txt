Transductions Computed by One-Dimensional Cellular Automata

Cellular automata are investigated towards their ability to compute  transductions, that is, to transform inputs into outputs.  The families of transductions computed are classified with regard to  the time allowed to process the input and to compute the output.  Since there is a particular interest in fast transductions,  we mainly focus on the time complexities real time and linear time.  We first investigate the computational capabilities of cellular automaton  transducers by comparing them to iterative array transducers, that is,  we compare parallel input/output mode to sequential input/output mode  of massively parallel machines.  By direct simulations, it turns out that the parallel mode is not  weaker than the sequential one.  Moreover, with regard to certain time complexities cellular  automaton transducers are even more powerful than iterative arrays.  In the second part of the paper, the model in question is compared  with the sequential devices single-valued finite state transducers  and deterministic pushdown transducers. It turns out that both models  can be simulated by cellular automaton transducers faster than by iterative  array transducers.
