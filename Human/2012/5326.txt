Noise Analysis for two Quantum Cryptography Protocols

This paper presents noise analysis for the two-stage and the three-stage quantum cryptographic protocols based on random polarization rotations. The noise model used is that of uniform distribution of error over a certain small range that is associated with each link without regard for the source of the error. The noise in different links is taken to be independent. Advantages of the use of these protocols in low intensity laser systems are given.
