A Novel Data Hiding Scheme for Binary Images

This paper presents a new scheme for hiding a secret message in binary images. Given m*n cover image block, the new scheme can conceal as many as log(m*n +1) bits of data in block, by changing at most one bit in the block. The hiding ability of the new scheme is the same as Chang et al.'s scheme and higher than Tseng et al.'s scheme. Additionally, the security of the new scheme is higher than the two above schemes.
