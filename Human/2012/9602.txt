MaTrust: An Effective Multi-Aspect Trust Inference Model

Trust is a fundamental concept in many real-world applications such as e-commerce and peer-to-peer networks. In these applications, users can generate local opinions about the counterparts based on direct experiences, and these opinions can then be aggregated to build trust among unknown users. The mechanism to build new trust relationships based on existing ones is referred to as trust inference. State-of-the-art trust inference approaches employ the transitivity property of trust by propagating trust along connected users. In this paper, we propose a novel trust inference model (MaTrust) by exploring an equally important property of trust, i.e., the multi-aspect property. MaTrust directly characterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee from the locally-generated trust relationships. Furthermore, it can naturally incorporate prior knowledge as specified factors. These factors in turn serve as the basis to infer the unseen trustworthiness scores. Experimental evaluations on real data sets show that the proposed MaTrust significantly outperforms several benchmark trust inference models in both effectiveness and efficiency.
