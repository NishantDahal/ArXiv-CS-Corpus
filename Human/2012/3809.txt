Text Steganography using LSB insertion method along with Chaos Theory

The art of information hiding has been around nearly as long as the need for covert communication. Steganography, the concealing of information, arose early on as an extremely useful method for covert information transmission. Steganography is the art of hiding secret message within a larger image or message such that the hidden message or an image is undetectable; this is in contrast to cryptography, where the existence of the message itself is not disguised, but the content is obscure. The goal of a steganographic method is to minimize the visually apparent and statistical differences between the cover data and a steganogram while maximizing the size of the payload. Current digital image steganography presents the challenge of hiding message in a digital image in a way that is robust to image manipulation and attack. This paper explains about how a secret message can be hidden into an image using least significant bit insertion method along with chaos.
