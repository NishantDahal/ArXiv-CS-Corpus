Mobile Learning Environment System (MLES): The Case of Android-based Learning Application on Undergraduates' Learning

Of late, mobile technology has introduced new, novel environment that can be capitalized to further enrich the teaching and learning process in classrooms. Taking cognizance of this promising setting, a study was undertaken to investigate the impact of such an environment enabled by android platform on the learning process among undergraduates of Sultan Idris Education University, Malaysia; in particular, this paper discusses critical aspects of the design and implementation of the android learning system. Data were collected through a survey involving 56 respondents, and these data were analyzed by using SPSS 12.0. Findings showed that the respondents were very receptive to the interactivity, accessibility, and convenience of the system, but they were quite frustrated with the occasional interruptions due to internet connectivity problems. Overall, the mobile learning system can be utilized as an inexpensive but potent learning tool that complements undergraduates' learning process.
