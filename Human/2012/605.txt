The Quantum Query Complexity of AC0

We show that any quantum algorithm deciding whether an input function $f$ from $[n]$ to $[n]$ is 2-to-1 or almost 2-to-1 requires $Θ(n)$ queries to $f$. The same lower bound holds for determining whether or not a function $f$ from $[2n-2]$ to $[n]$ is surjective. These results yield a nearly linear $Ω(n/\log n)$ lower bound on the quantum query complexity of $\cl{AC}^0$. The best previous lower bound known for any $\cl{AC^0}$ function was the $Ω((n/\log n)^{2/3})$ bound given by Aaronson and Shi's $Ω(n^{2/3})$ lower bound for the element distinctness problem.
