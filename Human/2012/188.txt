An Entertaining Example for the Usage of Bitwise Operations in Programming

The present study is meant to fill in some information gaps occurring in the most widespread and well-known educational and reference literature about programming. The stress is laid on a very useful instrument - the bitwise operations, topic which is, unfortunately, seldom dealt with in most of the well-known books on programming. In addition, the research is very useful as regards the topic of overloading operators in any Object-oriented programming course. Given some appropriate examples, with the emphasis being laid on some particular and data structures language constructions, the results are quite interesting. The algorithm of solving the popular Sudoku puzzle is one such entertaining example.
