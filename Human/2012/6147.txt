Universal Witnesses for State Complexity of Basic Operations Combined with Reversal

We study the state complexity of boolean operations, concatenation and star with one or two of the argument languages reversed. We derive tight upper bounds for the symmetric differences and differences of such languages. We prove that the previously discovered bounds for union, intersection, concatenation and star of such languages can all be met by the recently introduced universal witnesses and their variants.
