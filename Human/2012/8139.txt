Bayesian inference and the world mind

Knowledge is a central concept within both Bayesian inference and the mathematical and philosophical program of logic and semiotics initiated by Charles Sanders Peirce and further developed by George Spencer-Brown and Louis Kauffman. The latter school is more philosophical than is usual with the practitioners of Bayesian inference and claims the existence of a world mind. When these two disciplines inform each other semiotics is provided with mathematical mechanism and Bayesian inference is seen to be closely related to the act of distinction, the fundamental basis of logic in the work of Spencer-Brown. This hybridization also suggests a definition for knowledge within Bayesian inference; a definition that has been curiously lacking. Given that Darwinian processes are physical implementations of Bayesian inference and are utilized within numerous scientific theories across a wide range of disciplines as mechanisms for the creation and evolution of knowledge we may view the conjunction of these theories, within universal Darwinism, as descriptive of a world mind. Placing the world mind in this context provides detailed support from the scientific literature and goes some way to refute the charges of mysticism which have been leveled at the semiotic approach.
