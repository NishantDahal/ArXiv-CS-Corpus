A Scheme for Automation of Telecom Data Processing for Business Application

As the telecom industry is witnessing a large scale growth, one of the major challenges faced in the domain deals with the analysis and processing of telecom transactional data which are generated in large volumes by embedded system communication controllers having various functions. This paper deals with the analysis of such raw data files which are made up of the sequences of the tokens. It also depicts the method in which the files are parsed for extracting the information leading to the final storage in predefined data base tables. The parser is capable of reading the file in a line structured way and store the tokens into the predefined tables of data bases. The whole process is automated using the SSIS tools available in the SQL server. The log table is maintained in each step of the process which will enable tracking of the file for any risk mitigation. It can extract, transform and load data resulting in the processing.
