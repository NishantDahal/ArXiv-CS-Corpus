Contemporary Semantic Web Service Frameworks: An Overview and Comparisons

The growing proliferation of distributed information systems, allows organizations to offer their business processes to a worldwide audience through Web services. Semantic Web services have emerged as a means to achieve the vision of automatic discovery, selection, composition, and invocation of Web services by encoding the specifications of these software components in an unambiguous and machine-interpretable form. Several frameworks have been devised as enabling technologies for Semantic Web services. In this paper, we survey the prominent Semantic Web service frameworks. In addition, a set of criteria is identified and the discussed frameworks are evaluated and compared with respect to these criteria. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the Semantic Web service frameworks can help researchers to utilize the most appropriate one according to their needs.
