The devil is in Asymmetries (Rough Version)

We formally investigate some computational obstacles to tractability of computing the variety determined by K complex polynomials in N boolean variables. We show that using algebraic methods for solving combinatorial problems, the obstacles to tractability lies in the order of magnitude of asymmetries admitted by the given system of equations.
