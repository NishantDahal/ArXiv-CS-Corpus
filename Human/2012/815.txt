Computable Hilbert Schemes

In this PhD thesis we propose an algorithmic approach to the study of the Hilbert scheme. Developing algorithmic methods, we also obtain general results about Hilbert schemes. In Chapter 1 we discuss the equations defining the Hilbert scheme as subscheme of a suitable Grassmannian and in Chapter 5 we determine a new set of equations of degree lower than the degree of equations known so far. In Chapter 2 we study the most important objects used to project algorithmic techniques, namely Borel-fixed ideals. We determine an algorithm computing all the saturated Borel-fixed ideals with Hilbert polynomial assigned and we investigate their combinatorial properties. In Chapter 3 we show a new type of flat deformations of Borel-fixed ideals which lead us to give a new proof of the connectedness of the Hilbert scheme. In Chapter 4 we construct families of ideals that generalize the notion of family of ideals sharing the same initial ideal with respect to a fixed term ordering. Some of these families correspond to open subsets of the Hilbert scheme and can be used to a local study of the Hilbert scheme. In Chapter 6 we deal with the problem of the connectedness of the Hilbert scheme of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves in the projective 3-space. We show that one of the Hilbert scheme considered a "good" candidate to be non-connected, is instead connected. Moreover there are three appendices that present and explain how to use the implementations of the algorithms proposed.
