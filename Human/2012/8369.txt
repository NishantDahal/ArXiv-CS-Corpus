Quickest Change Detection

The problem of detecting changes in the statistical properties of a stochastic system and time series arises in various branches of science and engineering. It has a wide spectrum of important applications ranging from machine monitoring to biomedical signal processing. In all of these applications the observations being monitored undergo a change in distribution in response to a change or anomaly in the environment, and the goal is to detect the change as quickly as possibly, subject to false alarm constraints. In this chapter, two formulations of the quickest change detection problem, Bayesian and minimax, are introduced, and optimal or asymptotically optimal solutions to these formulations are discussed. Then some generalizations and extensions of the quickest change detection problem are described. The chapter is concluded with a discussion of applications and open issues.
