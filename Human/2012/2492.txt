Performance of Polar Codes on wireless communications Channel

We discuss the performance of polar codes, the capacity-achieving channel codes, on wireless communication channel in this paper. By generalizing the definition of Bhattacharyya Parameter in discrete memoryless channel, we present the special expression of the parameter for Gaussian and Rayleigh fading the two continuous channels, including the recursive formulas and the initial values. We analyze the applications of polar codes with the defined parameter over Rayleigh fading channel by transmitting image and speech. By comparing with low density parity-check codes(LDPC) at the same cases, our simulation results show that polar codes have better performance than that of LDPC codes. Polar codes will be good candidate for wireless communication channel.
