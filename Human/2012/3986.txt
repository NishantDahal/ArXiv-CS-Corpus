Proceedings of the first International Workshop On Open Data, WOD-2012

WOD-2012 aims at facilitating new trends and ideas from a broad range of topics concerned within the widely-spread Open Data movement, from the viewpoint of computer science research.
  While being most commonly known from the recent Linked Open Data movement, the concept of publishing data explicitly as Open Data has meanwhile developed many variants and facets that go beyond publishing large and highly structured RDF/S repositories. Open Data comprises text and semi-structured data, but also open multi-modal contents, including music, images, and videos. With the increasing amount of data that is published by governments (see, e.g., data.gov, data.gov.uk or data.gouv.fr), by international organizations (data.worldbank.org or data.undp.org) and by scientific communities (tdar.org, cds.u-strasbg.fr, GenBank, IRIS or KNB) explicitly under an Open Data policy, new challenges arise not only due to the scale at which this data becomes available.
  A number of community-based conferences accommodate tracks or workshops which are dedicated to Open Data. However, WOD aims to be a premier venue to gather researchers and practitioners who are contributing to and interested in the emerging field of managing Open Data from a computer science perspective. Hence, it is a unique opportunity to find in a single place up-to-date scientific works on Web-scale Open Data issues that have so far only partially been addressed by different research communities such as Databases, Data Mining and Knowledge Management, Distributed Systems, Data Privacy, and Data Visualization.
