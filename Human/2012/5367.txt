FMLtoHOL (version 1.0): Automating First-order Modal Logics with LEO-II and Friends

A converter from first-order modal logics to classical higher- order logic is presented. This tool enables the application of off-the-shelf higher-order theorem provers and model finders for reasoning within first- order modal logics. The tool supports logics K, K4, D, D4, T, S4, and S5 with respect to constant, varying and cumulative domain semantics.
