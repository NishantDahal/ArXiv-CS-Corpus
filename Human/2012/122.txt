Discrete Opinion models as a limit case of the CODA model

Opinion Dynamics models can be, for most of them, divided between discrete and continuous. They are used in different circumstances and the relationship between them is not clear. Here we will explore the relationship between a model where choices are discrete but opinions are a continuous function (the Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions, CODA, model) and traditional discrete models. I will show that, when CODA is altered to include reasoning about the influence one agent can have on its own neighbors, agreement and disagreement no longer have the same importance. The limit when an agent considers itself to be more and more influential will be studied and we will see that one recovers discrete dynamics, like those of the Voter model in that limit
