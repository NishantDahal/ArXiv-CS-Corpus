Nested Lattice Codes for Arbitrary Continuous Sources and Channels

In this paper, we show that nested lattice codes achieve the capacity of arbitrary channels with or without non-casual state information at the transmitter. We also show that nested lattice codes are optimal for source coding with or without non-causal side information at the receiver for arbitrary continuous sources.
