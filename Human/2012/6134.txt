Computer Administering of the Psychological Investigations: Set-relational Representation

Computer administering of a psychological investigation is the computer representation of the entire procedure of psychological assessments - test construction, test implementation, results evaluation, storage and maintenance of the developed database, its statistical processing, analysis and interpretation. A mathematical description of psychological assessment with the aid of personality tests is discussed in this article. The set theory and the relational algebra are used in this description. A relational model of data, needed to design a computer system for automation of certain psychological assessments is given. Some finite sets and relation on them, which are necessary for creating a personality psychological test, are described. The described model could be used to develop real software for computer administering of any psychological test and there is full automation of the whole process: test construction, test implementation, result evaluation, storage of the developed database, statistical implementation, analysis and interpretation. A software project for computer administering personality psychological tests is suggested.
