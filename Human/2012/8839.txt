Blurred Image Classification based on Adaptive Dictionary

Two types of framework for blurred image classification based on adaptive dictionary are proposed. Given a blurred image, instead of image deblurring, the semantic category of the image is determined by blur insensitive sparse coefficients calculated depending on an adaptive dictionary. The dictionary is adaptive to the Point Spread Function (PSF) estimated from input blurred image. The PSF is assumed to be space invariant and inferred separately in one framework or updated combining with sparse coefficients calculation in an alternative and iterative algorithm in the other framework. The experiment has evaluated three types of blur, naming defocus blur, simple motion blur and camera shake blur. The experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks.
