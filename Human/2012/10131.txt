Toward New Vision in Teaching Calculus

Usually the first course in mathematics is calculus. Its a core course in the curriculum of the Business, Engineering and the Sciences. However many students face difficulties to learn calculus. These difficulties are often caused by the prior fear of mathematics. The students today cant live without using computer technology. The uses of computer for teaching and learning can transform the boring traditional methodology of teach to more active and attractive method. In this paper, we will show how we can use Excel in teaching calculus to improve our students learning and understanding through different types of applications ranging from Business to Engineering. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was tested on a random sample of 45 students from different majors over a period of two semesters.
