A New Design Technique of Reversible BCD Adder Based on NMOS With Pass Transistor Gates

In this paper, we have proposed a new design technique of BCD Adder using newly constructed reversible gates are based on NMOS with pass transistor gates, where the conventional reversible gates are based on CMOS with transmission gates. We also compare the proposed reversible gates with the conventional CMOS reversible gates which show that the required number of Transistors is significantly reduced.
