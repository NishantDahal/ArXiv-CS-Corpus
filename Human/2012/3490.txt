Neutron Star Evolutions using Tabulated Equations of State with a New Execution Model

The addition of nuclear and neutrino physics to general relativistic fluid codes allows for a more realistic description of hot nuclear matter in neutron star and black hole systems. This additional microphysics requires that each processor have access to large tables of data, such as equations of state, and in large simulations the memory required to store these tables locally can become excessive unless an alternative execution model is used. In this work we present relativistic fluid evolutions of a neutron star obtained using a message driven multi-threaded execution model known as ParalleX. These neutron star simulations would require substantial memory overhead dedicated entirely to the equation of state table if using a more traditional execution model. We introduce a ParalleX component based on Futures for accessing large tables of data, including out-of-core sized tables, which does not require substantial memory overhead and effectively hides any increased network latency.
