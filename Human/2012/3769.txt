AGEM: Adaptive Greedy-Compass Energy-aware Multipath Routing Protocol for WMSNs

This paper presents an Adaptive Greedy-compass Energy-aware Multipath protocol (AGEM), a novel routing protocol for wireless multimedia sensors networks (WMSNs). AGEM uses sensors node positions to make packet forwarding decisions. These decisions are made online, at each forwarding node, in such a way that there is no need for global network topology knowledge and maintenance. AGEM routing protocol performs load-balancing to minimize energy consumption among nodes using twofold policy: (1) smart greedy forwarding, based on adaptive compass and (2) walking back forwarding to avoid holes. Performance evaluations of AGEM compared to GPSR (Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing) show that AGEM can: (a) maximize the network lifetime, (b) guarantee quality of service for video stream transmission, and (c) scale better on densely deployed wireless sensors network.
