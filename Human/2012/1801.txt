Moreover, there is a brief comparison between Waterfall and User-centered methodology in terms of addressing the issues of time saving and addressing fulfilment of users' needs. The data required to conduct this study was acquired using two research methods; the questionnaire and direct user observation, in order to address all the performance related attributes in the usability stage of the evaluation. An evaluation of the website, based on statements of usability goals and criteria, was undertaken in relation to the implementation and testing of the new design.
