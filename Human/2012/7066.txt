Collective Intelligence 2012: Proceedings

This volume holds the proceedings of the Collective Intelligence 2012 conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contains the full papers, poster papers, and plenary abstracts.
  Collective intelligence has existed at least as long as humans have, because families, armies, countries, and companies have all - at least sometimes - acted collectively in ways that seem intelligent. But in the last decade or so a new kind of collective intelligence has emerged: groups of people and computers, connected by the Internet, collectively doing intelligent things. For example, Google technology harvests knowledge generated by millions of people creating and linking web pages and then uses this knowledge to answer queries in ways that often seem amazingly intelligent. Or in Wikipedia, thousands of people around the world have collectively created a very large and high quality intellectual product with almost no centralized control, and almost all as volunteers! These early examples of Internet-enabled collective intelligence are not the end of the story but just the beginning. And in order to understand the possibilities and constraints of these new kinds of intelligence, we need a new interdisciplinary field.
