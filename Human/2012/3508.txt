Hybrid Parallel Bidirectional Sieve based on SMP Cluster

In this article, hybrid parallel bidirectional sieve method is implemented by SMP Cluster, the individual computational units joined together by the communication network, are usually shared-memory systems with one or more multicore processor. To high-efficiency optimization, we propose average divide data into nodes, generating double-ended queues (deque) for sieve method that are able to exploit dual-cores simultaneously start sifting out primes from the head and tail.And each node create a FIFO queue as dynamic data buffer to ache temporary data from another nodes send to. The approach obtains huge speedup and efficiency on SMP Cluster.
