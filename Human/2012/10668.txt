Performance Improvement by Changing Modulation Methods for Software Defined Radios

This paper describes an automatic switching of modulation method to reconfigure transceivers of Software Defined Radio (SDR) based wireless communication system. The programmable architecture of Software Radio promotes a flexible implementation of modulation methods. This flexibility also translates into adaptively, which is used here to optimize the throughput of a wireless network, operating under varying channel conditions. It is robust and efficient with processing time overhead that still allows the SDR to maintain its real-time operating objectives. This technique is studied for digital wireless communication systems. Tests and simulations using an AWGN channel show that the SNR threshold is 5dB for the case study.
