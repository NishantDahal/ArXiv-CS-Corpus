Cost-Effective Integration of MKM Semantic Services into Editing Environments

Integration of MKM services into editors has been of big interest in both formal as well as informal areas of MKM. Until now, most of the efforts to integrate MKM services into editing environments are done on an individual basis which results in high creation and maintenance costs. In this paper, I propose an architecture which allows editing environments and MKM services to be integrated in a more efficient way. This is accomplished by integrating editors and services only once with a real-time document synchronization and service broker. Doing so, simplifies the development of services as well as of editor integrations. My experience suggests that integrating new services into an arbitrary number of already integrated editors can take as little as 3-4 hours of work.
