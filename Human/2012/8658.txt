Auditory Steady-State Response Stimuli based BCI Application - The Optimization of the Stimuli Types and Lengths

We propose a method for an improvement of auditory BCI (aBCI) paradigm based on a combination of ASSR stimuli optimization by choosing the subjects' best responses to AM-, flutter-, AM/FM and click-envelope modulated sounds. As the ASSR response features we propose pairwise phase-locking-values calculated from the EEG and next classified using binary classifier to detect attended and ignored stimuli. We also report on a possibility to use the stimuli as short as half a second, which is a step forward in ASSR based aBCI. The presented results are helpful for optimization of the aBCI stimuli for each subject.
