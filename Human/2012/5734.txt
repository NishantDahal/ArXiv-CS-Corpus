Multi-dimensional password generation technique for accessing cloud services

Cloud computing is drastically growing technology which provides an on-demand software, hardware, infrastructure and data storage as services. This technology is used worldwide to improve the business infrastructure and performance. However, to utilize these services by intended customer, it is necessary to have strong password authentication. At present, cloud password authentication can be done in several ways, such as, textual password, graphical and 3D password. In this paper, we are proposing the strong password generation technique by considering multiple input parameters of cloud paradigm referred as a multidimensional password. This paper presents the multidimensional password generation technique along with architecture, sequence diagrams, algorithms and typical user interfaces. At the end, we derive the probability of breaking our authentication system.
