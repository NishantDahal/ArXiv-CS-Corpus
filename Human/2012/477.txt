Magic Knight's Tours in Higher Dimensions

A knight's tour on a board is a sequence of knight moves that visits each square exactly once. A knight's tour on a square board is called magic knight's tour if the sum of the numbers in each row and column is the same (magic constant). Knight's tour in higher dimensions (n > 3) is a new topic in the age-old world of knight's tours. In this paper, it has been proved that there can't be magic knight's tour or closed knight's tour in an odd order n-dimensional hypercube. 3 \times 4 \times 2n-2 is the smallest cuboid (n \geq 2) and 4 \times 4 \times 4n-2 is the smallest cube in which knight's tour is possible in n-dimensions (n \geq 3). Magic knight's tours are possible in 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 and 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 hypercube.
