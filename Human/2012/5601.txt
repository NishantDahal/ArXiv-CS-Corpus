Frame Interpretation and Validation in a Open Domain Dialogue System

Our goal in this paper is to establish a means for a dialogue platform to be able to cope with open domains considering the possible interaction between the embodied agent and humans. To this end we present an algorithm capable of processing natural language utterances and validate them against knowledge structures of an intelligent agent's mind. Our algorithm leverages dialogue techniques in order to solve ambiguities and acquire knowledge about unknown entities.
