Integrated three-dimensional reconstruction using reflectance fields

A method to obtain three-dimensional data of real-world objects by integrating their material properties is presented. The material properties are defined by capturing the Reflectance Fields of the real-world objects. It is shown, unlike conventional reconstruction methods, the method is able to use the reflectance information to recover surface depth for objects having a non-Lambertian surface reflectance. It is, for recovering 3D data of objects exhibiting an anisotropic BRDF with an error less than 0.3%.
