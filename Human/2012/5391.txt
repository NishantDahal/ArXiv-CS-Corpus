About the Linear Complexity of Ding-Hellesth Generalized Cyclotomic Binary Sequences of Any Period

We defined sufficient conditions for designing Ding-Helleseth sequences with arbitrary period and high linear complexity for generalized cyclotomies. Also we discuss the method of computing the linear complexity of Ding-Helleseth sequences in the general case.
