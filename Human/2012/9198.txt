Measuring Time in Sporting Competitions with the Domain-Specific Language EasyTime

Measuring time in mass sporting competitions is unthinkable manually today because of their long duration and unreliability. Besides, automatic timing devices based on the RFID technology have become cheaper. However, these devices cannot operate stand-alone. To work efficiently, they need a computer timing system for monitoring results. Such system should be capable of processing the incoming events, encoding and assigning results to a individual competitor, sorting results according to the achieved time and printing them. In this paper, a domain-specific language named EasyTime will be defined. It enables controlling an agent by writing events to a database. Using the agent, the number of measuring devices can be reduced. Also, EasyTime is of a universal type that can be applied to many different sporting competitions
