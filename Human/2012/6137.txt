Optimization of Quadratic Forms: NP Hard Problems : Neural Networks

In this research paper, the problem of optimization of a quadratic form over the convex hull generated by the corners of hypercube is attempted and solved. Some results related to stable states/vectors, anti-stable states/vectors (over the hypercube) are discussed. Some results related to the computation of global optimum stable state (an NP hard problem) are discussed. It is hoped that the results shed light on resolving the P \neq NP problem.
