Flexible Dynamic Information Flow Control in the Presence of Exceptions

We describe a new, dynamic, floating-label approach to language-based information flow control. A labeled IO monad, LIO, keeps track of a current label and permits restricted access to IO functionality. The current label floats to exceed the labels of all data observed and restricts what can be modified. Unlike other language-based work, LIO also bounds the current label with a current clearance that provides a form of discretionary access control. Computations may encapsulate and pass around the results of computations with different labels. In addition, the LIO monad offers a simple form of labeled mutable references and exception handling. We give precise semantics and prove confidentiality and integrity properties of a call-by-name Î»-calculus and provide an implementation in Haskell.
