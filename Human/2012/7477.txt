Performance Analysis of MIMO Radar Waveform using Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm

The Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm is promoted to numerically design orthogonal Discrete Frequency Waveforms and Modified Discrete Frequency Waveforms (DFCWs) with good correlation properties for MIMO radar. We employ Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (ACC_PSO), Particles of a swarm communicate good positions, velocity and accelerations to each other as well as dynamically adjust their own position, velocity and acceleration derived from the best of all particles. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for the design of DFCWs signal used in MIMO radar.
