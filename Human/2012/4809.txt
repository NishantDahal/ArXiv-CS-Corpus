Convexity Conditions for 802.11 WLANs

In this paper we characterise the maximal convex subsets of the (non-convex) rate region in 802.11 WLANs. In addition to being of intrinsic interest as a fundamental property of 802.11 WLANs, this characterisation can be exploited to allow the wealth of convex optimisation approaches to be applied to 802.11 WLANs.
