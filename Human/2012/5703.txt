Effect of Interleaved FEC Code on Wavelet Based MC-CDMA System with Alamouti STBC in Different Modulation Schemes

In this paper, the impact of Forward Error Correction (FEC) code namely Trellis code with interleaver on the performance of wavelet based MC-CDMA wireless communication system with the implementation of Alamouti antenna diversity scheme has been investigated in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) per bit. Simulation of the system under proposed study has been done in M-ary modulation schemes (MPSK, MQAM and DPSK) over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channel incorporating Walsh Hadamard code as orthogonal spreading code to discriminate the message signal for individual user. It is observed via computer simulation that the performance of the interleaved coded based proposed system outperforms than that of the uncoded system in all modulation schemes over Rayleigh fading channel.
