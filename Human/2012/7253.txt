SEGNET: Secure Geo-Sensor Network Model

Wireless Geo-Sensor Networks (GEONET) are suitable for critical applications in hostile environments due to its flexibility in deployment. But low power geo-sensor nodes are easily compromised by security threats like battery exhaustion attack which may give rise to unavoidable circumstances. In this type of attack, intruder forcefully resists legitimate sensor nodes from going into low-power sleep state. So that compromised sensor node's battery power is drained out and it stops working. Due to the limited capability of sensor nodes, it is very difficult to prevent a sensor node from this type of attack which apparently appears as innocent interaction. In this paper, a framework of secure GEONET model (SEGNET) is proposed, based on dynamic load distribution mechanism for heterogeneous environment. It considers hybrid detection approach using three modules for anomaly detection, intrusion confirmation and decision making to reduce the probability of false detection, compared to other existing approaches.
