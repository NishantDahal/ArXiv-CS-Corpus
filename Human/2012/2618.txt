Padded polynomials, their cousins, and geometric complexity theory

We establish basic facts about the varieties of homogeneous polynomials divisible by powers of linear forms, and explain consequences for geometric complexity theory. This includes quadratic set-theoretic equations, a description of the ideal in terms of the kernel of a linear map that generalizes the Foulkes-Howe map, and an explicit description of the coordinate ring of the normalization. We also prove asymptotic injectivity of the Foulkes-Howe map.
