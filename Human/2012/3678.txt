Multi-Prover Quantum Merlin-Arthur Proof Systems with Small Gap

This paper studies multiple-proof quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA) proof systems in the setting when the completeness-soundness gap is small. Small means that we only lower-bound the gap with an inverse-exponential function of the input length, or with an even smaller function. Using the protocol of Blier and Tapp [arXiv:0709.0738], we show that in this case the proof system has the same expressive power as non-deterministic exponential time (NEXP). Since single-proof QMA proof systems, with the same bound on the gap, have expressive power at most exponential time (EXP), we get a separation between single and multi-prover proof systems in the 'small-gap setting', under the assumption that EXP is not equal to NEXP. This implies, among others, the nonexistence of certain operators called disentanglers (defined by Aaronson et al. [arXiv:0804.0802]), with good approximation parameters.
  We also show that in this setting the proof system has the same expressive power if we restrict the verifier to be able to perform only Bell-measurements, i.e., using a BellQMA verifier. This is not known to hold in the usual setting, when the gap is bounded by an inverse-polynomial function of the input length. To show this we use the protocol of Chen and Drucker [arXiv:1011.0716]. The only caveat here is that we need at least a linear amount of proofs to achieve the power of NEXP, while in the previous setting two proofs were enough.
  We also study the case when the proof-lengths are only logarithmic in the input length and observe that in some cases the expressive power decreases. However, we show that it doesn't decrease further if we make the proof lengths to be even shorter.
