Asymptotically Good Codes Over Non-Abelian Groups

It has been shown that good structured codes over non-Abelian groups do exist. Specifically, we construct codes over the smallest non-Abelian group $\mathds{D}_6$ and show that the performance of these codes is superior to the performance of Abelian group codes of the same alphabet size. This promises the possibility of using non-Abelian codes for multi-terminal settings where the structure of the code can be exploited to gain performance.
