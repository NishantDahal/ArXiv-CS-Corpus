An L(1/3) algorithm for discrete logarithm computation and principality testing in certain number fields

We analyse the complexity of solving the discrete logarithm problem and of testing the principality of ideals in a certain class of number fields. We achieve the subexponential complexity in $O(L(1/3,O(1)))$ when both the discriminant and the degree of the extension tend to infinity by using techniques due to Enge, Gaudry and Thom√© in the context of algebraic curves over finite fields.
