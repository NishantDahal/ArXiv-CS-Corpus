Study Paper on Test Case generation for GUI Based Testing

With the advent of WWW and outburst in technology and software development, testing the software became a major concern. Due to the importance of the testing phase in a software development life cycle, testing has been divided into graphical user interface (GUI) based testing, logical testing, integration testing, etc.GUI Testing has become very important as it provides more sophisticated way to interact with the software. The complexity of testing GUI increased over time. The testing needs to be performed in a way that it provides effectiveness, efficiency, increased fault detection rate and good path coverage. To cover all use cases and to provide testing for all possible (success/failure) scenarios the length of the test sequence is considered important. Intent of this paper is to study some techniques used for test case generation and process for various GUI based software applications.
