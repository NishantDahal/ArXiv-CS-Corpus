Application of sensitivity analysis in building energy simulations: combining first and second order elementary effects Methods

Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in the understanding of complex models. It helps to identify influence of input parameters in relation to the outputs. It can be also a tool to understand the behavior of the model and then can help in its development stage. This study aims to analyze and illustrate the potential usefulness of combining first and second-order sensitivity analysis, applied to a building energy model (ESP-r). Through the example of a collective building, a sensitivity analysis is performed using the method of elementary effects (also known as Morris method), including an analysis of interactions between the input parameters (second order analysis). Importance of higher-order analysis to better support the results of first order analysis, highlighted especially in such complex model. Several aspects are tackled to implement efficiently the multi-order sensitivity analysis: interval size of the variables, management of non-linearity, usefulness of various outputs.
