Product/Brand extraction from WikiPedia

In this paper we describe the task of extracting product and brand pages from wikipedia. We present an experimental environment and setup built on top of a dataset of wikipedia pages we collected. We introduce a method for recognition of product pages modelled as a boolean probabilistic classification task. We show that this approach can lead to promising results and we discuss alternative approaches we considered.
