Context-Awareness for Service Oriented Systems

Today, service oriented systems need to be enhanced to sense and react to users context in order to provide a better user experience. To meet this requirement, Context-Aware Services (CAS) have emerged as an underling design and development paradigm for the development of context-aware systems. The fundamental challenges for such systems development are context-awareness management and service adaptation to the users context. To cope with such requirements, we propose a well designed architecture, named ACAS, to support the development of Context-Aware Service Oriented Systems (CASOS). This architecture relies on a set of context-awareness and CAS specifications and metamodels to enhance a core service, in service oriented systems, to be context-aware. This enhancement is fulfilled by the Aspect Adaptations Weaver (A2W) which, based on the Aspect Paradigm (AP) concepts, considers the services adaptations as aspects.
