A Simple Quantifier-free Formula of Positive Semidefinite Cyclic Ternary Quartic Forms

Quantifier elimination of positive semidefinite cyclic ternary quartic forms is studied in this paper. We solve the problem by the theory of complete discrimination systems, function \RealTriangularize in Maple15 and the so-called Criterions on Equality of Symmetric Inequalities method. The equivalent simple quantifier-free formula is proposed and is difficult to obtain automatically by previous methods or quantifier elimination tools.
