Pairings on Generalized Huff Curves

This paper presents the Tate pairing computation on generalized Huff curves proposed by Wu and Feng. In fact, we extend the results of the Tate pairing computation on the standard Huff elliptic curves done previously by Joye, Tibouchi and Vergnaud. We show that the addition step of the Miller loop can be performed in $1\mathbf{M}+(k+15)\mathbf{m}+2\mathbf{c}$ and the doubling one in $1\mathbf{M} + 1\mathbf{S} + (k + 12) \mathbf{m} + 5\mathbf{s} + 2\mathbf{c}$ on the generalized Huff curve.
