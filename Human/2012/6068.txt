On the toggling-branching recurrence of Computability Logic

We introduce a new, substantially simplified version of the toggling-branching recurrence operation of Computability Logic, prove its equivalence to Japaridze's old, "canonical" version, and also prove that both versions preserve the static property of their arguments.
