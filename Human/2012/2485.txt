Revisiting the D-iteration method: runtime comparison

In this paper, we revisit the D-iteration algorithm in order to better explain different performance results that were observed for the numerical computation of the eigenvector associated to the PageRank score. We revisit here the practical computation cost based on the execution runtime compared to the theoretical number of iterations.
