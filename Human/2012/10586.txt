Stochastic Models of Misinformation Distribution in Online Social Networks

This report contains results of an experimental study of the distribution of misinformation in online social networks (OSNs). We consider the classification of the topologies of OSNs and analyze the parameters identified in order to relate the topology of a real network with one of the classes. We propose an algorithm for conducting a search for the percolation cluster in the social graph.
