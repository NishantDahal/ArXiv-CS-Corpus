A Note on a Conjecture for Balanced Elementary Symmetric Boolean Functions

In 2008, Cusick {\it et al.} conjectured that certain elementary symmetric Boolean functions of the form $σ_{2^{t+1}l-1, 2^t}$ are the only nonlinear balanced ones, where $t$, $l$ are any positive integers, and $σ_{n,d}=\bigoplus_{1\le i_1<...<i_d\le n}x_{i_1}x_{i_2}...x_{i_d}$ for positive integers $n$, $1\le d\le n$. In this note, by analyzing the weight of $σ_{n, 2^t}$ and $σ_{n, d}$, we prove that ${\rm wt}(σ_{n, d})<2^{n-1}$ holds in most cases, and so does the conjecture. According to the remainder of modulo 4, we also consider the weight of $σ_{n, d}$ from two aspects: $n\equiv 3({\rm mod\}4)$ and $n\not\equiv 3({\rm mod\}4)$. Thus, we can simplify the conjecture. In particular, our results cover the most known results. In order to fully solve the conjecture, we also consider the weight of $σ_{n, 2^t+2^s}$ and give some experiment results on it.
