'Say EM' for Selecting Probabilistic Models for Logical Sequences

Many real world sequences such as protein secondary structures or shell logs exhibit a rich internal structures. Traditional probabilistic models of sequences, however, consider sequences of flat symbols only. Logical hidden Markov models have been proposed as one solution. They deal with logical sequences, i.e., sequences over an alphabet of logical atoms. This comes at the expense of a more complex model selection problem. Indeed, different abstraction levels have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel method for selecting logical hidden Markov models from data called SAGEM. SAGEM combines generalized expectation maximization, which optimizes parameters, with structure search for model selection using inductive logic programming refinement operators. We provide convergence and experimental results that show SAGEM's effectiveness.
