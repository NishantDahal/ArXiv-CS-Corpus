Automated Analytic Asymptotic Evaluation of the Marginal Likelihood for Latent Models

We present and implement two algorithms for analytic asymptotic evaluation of     the marginal likelihood of data given a Bayesian network with hidden nodes. As     shown by previous work, this evaluation is particularly hard for latent     Bayesian network models, namely networks that include hidden variables, where     asymptotic approximation deviates from the standard BIC score. Our algorithms     solve two central difficulties in asymptotic evaluation of marginal likelihood     integrals, namely, evaluation of regular dimensionality drop for latent     Bayesian network models and computation of non-standard approximation formulas     for singular statistics for these models. The presented algorithms are     implemented in Matlab and Maple and their usage is demonstrated for marginal     likelihood approximations for Bayesian networks with hidden variables.
