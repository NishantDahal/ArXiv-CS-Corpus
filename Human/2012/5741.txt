Adaptive-Reliable Medium Access Control Protocol for Wireless Body Area Networks

Extensive energy is consumed by Transceiver communication operation [1]. Existing research on MAC layer focuses to maximize battery-powered sensor node's life. Bottleneck of MAC layer protocol design for WBAN is to achieve high reliability and energy minimization. Majority of MAC protocols designed for WBANs are based upon TDMA approach. However, a new protocol needs to be defined to achieve high energy efficiency, fairness and avoid extra energy consumption due to synchronization.
