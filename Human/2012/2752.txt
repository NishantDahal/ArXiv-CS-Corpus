Unequal Error Protected JPEG 2000 Broadcast Scheme with Progressive Fountain Codes

This paper proposes a novel scheme, based on progressive fountain codes, for broadcasting JPEG 2000 multimedia. In such a broadcast scheme, progressive resolution levels of images/video have been unequally protected when transmitted using the proposed progressive fountain codes. With progressive fountain codes applied in the broadcast scheme, the resolutions of images (JPEG 2000) or videos (MJPEG 2000) received by different users can be automatically adaptive to their channel qualities, i.e. the users with good channel qualities are possible to receive the high resolution images/vedio while the users with bad channel qualities may receive low resolution images/vedio. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated with the MJPEG 2000 broadcast prototype.
