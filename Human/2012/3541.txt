ISWAR: An Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience

With the explosive growth of internet technology, easy transfer of digital multimedia is feasible. However, this kind of convenience with which authorized users can access information, turns out to be a mixed blessing due to information piracy. The emerging field of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems addresses issues related to the intellectual property rights of digital content. In this paper, an object-oriented (OO) DRM system, called "Imaging System with Watermarking and Attack Resilience" (ISWAR), is presented that generates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for protection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security attacks. In addition to the methods, in the object-oriented sense, for performing traditional encryption and decryption, the system implements methods for visible and invisible watermarking. This paper presents one visible and one invisible watermarking algorithm that have been integrated in the system. The qualitative and quantitative results obtained for these two watermarking algorithms with several benchmark images indicate that high-quality watermarked images are produced by the algorithms. With the help of experimental results it is demonstrated that the presented invisible watermarking techniques are resilient to the well known benchmark attacks and hence a fail-safe method for providing constant protection to ownership rights.
