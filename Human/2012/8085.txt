1 Billion Pages = 1 Million Dollars? Mining the Web to Play "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

We exploit the redundancy and volume of information on the web to build a     computerized player for the ABC TV game show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?'     The player consists of a question-answering module and a decision-making     module. The question-answering module utilizes question transformation     techniques, natural language parsing, multiple information retrieval     algorithms, and multiple search engines; results are combined in the spirit of     ensemble learning using an adaptive weighting scheme. Empirically, the system     correctly answers about 75% of questions from the Millionaire CD-ROM, 3rd     edition - general-interest trivia questions often about popular culture and     common knowledge. The decision-making module chooses from allowable actions in     the game in order to maximize expected risk-adjusted winnings, where the     estimated probability of answering correctly is a function of past performance     and confidence in in correctly answering the current question. When given a six     question head start (i.e., when starting from the $2,000 level), we find that     the system performs about as well on average as humans starting at the     beginning. Our system demonstrates the potential of simple but well-chosen     techniques for mining answers from unstructured information such as the web.
