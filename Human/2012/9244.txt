Low complexity sum rate maximization for single and multiple stream MIMO AF relay networks

A multiple-antenna amplify-and-forward two-hop interference network with multiple links and multiple relays is considered. We optimize transmit precoders, receive decoders and relay AF matrices to maximize the achievable sum rate. Under per user and total relay sum power constraints, we propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the total signal to total interference plus noise ratio (TSTINR). Computational complexity analysis shows that our proposed algorithm for TSTINR has lower complexity than the existing weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm. We analyze and confirm by simulations that the TSTINR, WMMSE and the total leakage interference plus noise (TLIN) minimization models with per user and total relay sum power constraints can only transmit a single data stream for each user. Thus we propose a novel multiple stream TSTINR model with requirement of orthogonal columns for precoders, in order to support multiple data streams and thus utilize higher Degrees of Freedom. Multiple data streams and larger multiplexing gains are guaranteed. Simulation results show that for single stream models, our TSTINR algorithm outperforms the TLIN algorithm generally and outperforms WMMSE in medium to high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio scenarios; the system sum rate significantly benefits from multiple data streams in medium to high SNR scenarios.
