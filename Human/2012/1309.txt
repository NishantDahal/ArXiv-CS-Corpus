Increasing Randomness Using Permutations on Blocks

This paper investigates the effect of permutations on blocks of a prime reciprocal sequence on its randomness. A relationship between the number of permutations used and the improvement of performance is presented. This can be used as a method for increasing the cryptographic strength of pseudorandom sequences.
