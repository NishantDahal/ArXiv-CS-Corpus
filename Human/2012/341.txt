Early Performance Prediction of Web Services

Web Service is an interface which implements business logic. Performance is an important quality aspect of Web services because of their distributed nature. Predicting the performance of web services during early stages of software development is significant. In this paper we model web service using Unified Modeling Language, Use Case Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Deployment Diagram. We obtain the Performance metrics by simulating the web services model using a simulation tool Simulation of Multi-Tier Queuing Architecture. We have identified the bottle neck resources.
