Proceedings 6th Workshop on Logical and Semantic Frameworks with Applications

This volume contains the proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Logical and Semantic Frameworks with Applications (LSFA 2011). The workshop will be hold in Belo Horizonte, on August 27th 2011.
  Logical and semantic frameworks are formal languages used to represent logics, languages and systems. These frameworks provide foundations for formal specification of systems and programming languages, supporting tool development and reasoning.
  The objective of this one-day workshop is to put together theoreticians and practitioners to promote new techniques and results, from the theoretical side, and feedback on the implementation and the use of such techniques and results, from the practical side.
