A Cyclic Representation of Discrete Coordination Procedures

We show that any discrete opinion pooling procedure with positive weights can be asymptotically approximated by DeGroot's procedure whose communication digraph is a Hamiltonian cycle with loops. In this cycle, the weight of each arc (which is not a loop) is inversely proportional to the influence of the agent the arc leads to.
