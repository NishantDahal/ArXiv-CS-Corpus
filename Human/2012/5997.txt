Sufficient conditions for convergence of Loopy Belief Propagation

We derive novel sufficient conditions for convergence of Loopy Belief Propagation (also known as the Sum-Product algorithm) to a unique fixed point. Our results improve upon previously known conditions. For binary variables with (anti-)ferromagnetic interactions, our conditions seem to be sharp.
