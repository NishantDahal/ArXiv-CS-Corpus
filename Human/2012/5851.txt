Full Data Controlled Web-Based Feed Aggregator

Feed syndication is analogous to electronic newsletters, both are aimed at delivering feeds to subscribers; the difference is that while newsletter subscription requires e-mail and exposed you to spam and security challenges, feed syndication ensures that you only get what you requested for. This paper reports a review on the state of the art of feed aggregation technology and the development of a locally hosted web based feed aggregator as a research tool using the core features of WordPress; the software was further enhanced with plugins and widgets for dynamic content publishing, database and object caching, social web syndication, back-up and maintenance, among others. The results highlight the current developments in software re-use and describes; how open source content management systems can be used for both online and offline publishing, a means whereby feed aggregator users can control and share feed data, as well as how web developers can focus on extending the features of built-in software libraries in applications rather than reinventing the wheel.
