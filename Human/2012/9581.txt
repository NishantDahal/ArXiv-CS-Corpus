Composite Strategy for Multicriteria Ranking/Sorting (methodological issues, examples)

The paper addresses the modular design of composite solving strategies for multicriteria ranking (sorting). Here a 'scale of creativity' that is close to creative levels proposed by Altshuller is used as the reference viewpoint: (i) a basic object, (ii) a selected object, (iii) a modified object, and (iv) a designed object (e.g., composition of object components). These levels maybe used in various parts of decision support systems (DSS) (e.g., information, operations, user). The paper focuses on the more creative above-mentioned level (i.e., composition or combinatorial synthesis) for the operational part (i.e., composite solving strategy). This is important for a search/exploration mode of decision making process with usage of various procedures and techniques and analysis/integration of obtained results. The paper describes methodological issues of decision technology and synthesis of composite strategy for multicriteria ranking. The synthesis of composite strategies is based on 'hierarchical morphological multicriteria design' (HMMD) which is based on selection and combination of design alternatives (DAs) (here: local procedures or techniques) while taking into account their quality and quality of their interconnections (IC). A new version of HMMD with interval multiset estimates for DAs is used. The operational environment of DSS COMBI for multicriteria ranking, consisting of a morphology of local procedures or techniques (as design alternatives DAs), is examined as a basic one.
