A Metric For The Activeness Of An Object-Oriented Component Library

In this paper, an attempt has been made to analyze the Activeness of an Object Oriented Component Library and develop a special type of software metric called Component Activeness Quotient which is defined as the degree of readiness of an OOCL. The advantages of the CAQ include a possible comparison between various OOCLs leading to selection of the best OOCL for use during the development task, and Stability of the software can be gauged as indicated by the value of the CAQ. The disadvantage of the CAQ is that it may have some error because of its subjective and random nature. The paper also tries to improvise the calculation of the Activeness Quotient. The extreme case of a software organization having an RQ greater than 1 and MQ equal to 0 was not handled by the method of taking an average of RQ and MQ to calculate the AQ. The improvisation is that the AQ must be equal to a product of MQ and RQ and this is mentioned in the Appendix.
