Conception and Use of Ontologies for Indexing and Searching by Semantic Contents of Video Courses

Nowadays, the video documents like educational courses available on the web increases significantly. However, the information retrieval systems today can not return to the users (students or teachers) of parts of those videos that meet their exact needs expressed by a query consisting of semantic information. In this paper, we present a model of pedagogical knowledge of current videos. This knowledge is used throughout the process of indexing and semantic search segments instructional videos. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising.
