Relevant Sampling of Band-limited Functions

We study the random sampling of band-limited functions of several variables. If a bandlimited function with bandwidth one has its essential support on a cube of volume $R^d$, then $\cO (R^d \log R^d)$ random samples suffice to approximate the function up to a given error with high probability.
