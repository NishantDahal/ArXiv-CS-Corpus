Continuous Time Bayesian Networks

In this paper we present a language for finite state continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs), which describe structured stochastic processes that evolve over continuous time.  The state of the system is decomposed into a set of local variables whose values change over time.  The dynamics of the system are described by specifying the behavior of each local variable as a function of its parents in a directed (possibly cyclic) graph.  The model specifies, at any given point in time, the distribution over two aspects: when a local variable changes its value and the next value it takes.  These distributions are determined by the variable      s CURRENT value AND the CURRENT VALUES OF its parents IN the graph.More formally,     each variable IS modelled AS a finite state continuous time Markov      process whose transition intensities are functions OF its parents.We      present a probabilistic semantics FOR     the language IN terms OF the generative model a CTBN defines OVER      sequences OF events.We list types OF queries one might ask OF      a CTBN, discuss the conceptual AND     computational difficulties associated WITH exact inference, AND      provide an algorithm FOR     approximate inference which takes advantage OF the structure within      the process.
