Raw Report on the Model Checking Contest at Petri Nets 2012

This article presents the results of the Model Checking Contest held at Petri Nets 2012 in Hambourg. This contest aimed at a fair and experimental evaluation of the performances of model checking techniques applied to Petri nets. This is the second edition after a successful one in 2011.
  The participating tools were compared on several examinations (state space generation and evaluation of several types of formulae - structural, reachability, LTL, CTL) run on a set of common models (Place/Transition and Symmetric Petri nets).
  After a short overview of the contest, this paper provides the raw results from the context, model per model and examination per examination.
