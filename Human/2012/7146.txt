A simple algorithm for the evaluation of the hypergeometric series using quasi-linear time and linear space

A simple algorithm with quasi-linear time complexity and linear space complexity for the evaluation of the hypergeometric series with rational coefficients is constructed. It is shown that this algorithm is suitable in practical informatics for constructive analogues of often used constants of analysis.
