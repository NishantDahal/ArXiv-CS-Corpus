Performance Measurement of Cloud Computing Services

Cloud computing today has now been growing as new technologies and new business models. In distributed technology perspective, cloud computing most like client-server services like web-based or web-service but it used virtual resources to execute. Currently, cloud computing relies on the use of an elastic virtual machine and the use of network for data exchange. We conduct an experimental setup to measure the quality of service received by cloud computing customers. Experimental setup done by creating a HTTP service that runs in the cloud computing infrastructure. We interest to know about the impact of increasing the number of users on the average quality received by users. The qualities received by user measured within two parameters consist of average response times and the number of requests time out. Experimental results of this study show that increasing the number of users has increased the average response time. Similarly, the number of request time out increasing with increasing number of users. It means that the qualities of service received by user are decreasing also. We found that the impact of the number of users on the quality of service is no longer in linear trend. The results of this study can be used as a reference model for the network operator in performing services in which a certain number of users in order to obtain optimal quality services.
