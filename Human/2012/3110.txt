Management Language Specifications For Digital Ecosystems

This paper defines the specifications of a management language intended to automate the control and administration of various service components connected to a digital ecosystem. It is called EML short for Ecosystem Management Language and it is based on proprietary syntax and notation and contains a set of managerial commands issued by the system's administrator via a command console. Additionally, EML is shipped with a collection of self-adaptation procedures called SAP. Their purpose is to provide self-adaptation properties to the ecosystem allowing it to self-optimize itself based on the state of its execution environment. On top of that, there exists the EMU short for Ecosystem Management Unit which interprets, validates, parses, and executes EML commands and SAP procedures. Future research can improve upon EML so much so that it can be extended to support a larger set of commands in addition to a larger set of SAP procedures.
