A Data Warehouse Design for a Typical University Information System

Presently, large enterprises rely on database systems to manage their data and information. These databases are useful for conducting daily business transactions. However, the tight competition in the marketplace has led to the concept of data mining in which data are analyzed to derive effective business strategies and discover better ways in carrying out business. In order to perform data mining, regular databases must be converted into what so called informational databases also known as data warehouse. This paper presents a design model for building data warehouse for a typical university information system. It is based on transforming an operational database into an informational warehouse useful for decision makers to conduct data analysis, predication, and forecasting. The proposed model is based on four stages of data migration: Data extraction, data cleansing, data transforming, and data indexing and loading. The complete system is implemented under MS Access 2010 and is meant to serve as a repository of data for data mining operations.
