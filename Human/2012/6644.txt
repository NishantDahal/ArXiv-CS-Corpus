AES-CBC Software Execution Optimization

With the proliferation of high-speed wireless networking, the necessity for efficient, robust and secure encryption modes is ever increasing. But, cryptography is primarily a computationally intensive process. This paper investigates the performance and efficiency of IEEE 802.11i approved Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-Rijndael ciphering/deciphering software in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Simulations are used to analyse the speed, resource consumption and robustness of AES-CBC to investigate its viability for image encryption usage on common low power devices. The detailed results presented in this paper provide a basis for performance estimation of AES cryptosystems implemented on wireless devices. The use of optimized AES-CBC software implementation gives a superior encryption speed performance by 12 - 30%, but at the cost of twice more memory for code size.
