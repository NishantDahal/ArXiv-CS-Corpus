Live-Musikprogrammierung in Haskell

We aim to compose algorithmic music in an interactive way with multiple participants. To this end we develop an interpreter for a sub-language of the non-strict functional programming language Haskell that allows to modify the program during its execution. Our system can be used both for musical live-coding and for demonstration and education of functional programming.
