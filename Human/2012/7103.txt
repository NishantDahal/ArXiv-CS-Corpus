A Sufficient Condition for Hanna Neumann Property of Submonoids of a Free Monoid

Using automata-theoretic approach, Giambruno and Restivo have investigated on the intersection of two finitely generated submonoids of the free monoid over a finite alphabet. In particular, they have obtained Hanna Neumann property for a special class of submonoids generated by finite prefix sets. This work continues their work and provides a sufficient condition for Hanna Neumann property for the entire class of submonoids generated by finite prefix sets. In this connection, a general rank formula for the submonoids which are accepted by semi-flower automata is also obtained.
