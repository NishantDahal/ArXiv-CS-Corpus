Condition for neighborhoods in covering based rough sets to form a partition

Neighborhood is an important concept in covering based rough sets. That under what condition neighborhoods form a partition is a meaningful issue induced by this concept. Many scholars have paid attention to this issue and presented some necessary and sufficient conditions. However, there exists one common trait among these conditions, that is they are established on the basis of all neighborhoods have been obtained. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition directly based on the covering itself. First, we investigate the influence of that there are reducible elements in the covering on neighborhoods. Second, we propose the definition of uniform block and obtain a sufficient condition from it. Third, we propose the definitions of repeat degree and excluded number. By means of the two concepts, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for neighborhoods to form a partition. In a word, we have gained a deeper and more direct understanding of the essence over that neighborhoods form a partition.
