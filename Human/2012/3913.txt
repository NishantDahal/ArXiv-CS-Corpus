Development of application for discovering and binding to published geospatial processes in distributed environments

Nowadays, society has recognized that the lack of access to spatial data and tools for their analysis is the limiting factor of economic development. It came to the realization that without the single information space, which is implemented in the form of spatial data infrastructures, a progressive business development is impossible. Spatial data infrastructures will support a variety of tasks, which requires the binding of geospatial information from multiple sources. In the last few years, the rate of progress in spatial data collection was higher, than in management and analysis of data. Infrastructures allow the accumulated data to be available to large groups of users, and infrastructure of analysis allows the data to be effectively used for such tasks as municipal planning, science research, etc. Moreover, free access to the information resources and instruments of analysis will serve as an additional impulse to development of application models in corresponding areas of expertise. The goal of this paper is to indicate possible solutions to the client-side problems of spatial data analysis in distributed environments, using the developing application for data analysis as an example.
