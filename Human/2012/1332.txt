Assessing the Value of 3D Reconstruction in Building Construction

3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is an emerging field in image processing and computer vision that aims to create 3D visualizations/ models of objects/ scenes from image sets. However, its commercial applications and benefits are yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we describe ongoing work towards assessing the value of 3D reconstruction in the building construction domain. We present preliminary results from a user study, where our objective is to understand the use of visual information in building construction in order to determine problems with the use of visual information and identify potential benefits and scenarios for the use of 3D reconstruction.
