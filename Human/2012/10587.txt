BigFoot: Analysis, monitoring, tracking and sharing of bio-medical features of human appendages using consumer-grade home and office based imaging devices

Here we describe a system for personal and professional management and analysis of bio-medical images captured using off-the-shelf, consumer-grade imaging devices such as scanners, digital cameras, cellphones, webcams and tablet PCs. Specifically, we describe an implementation of this system for the analysis, monitoring and tracking of conditions and features of human feet using a flatbed scanner as the image capture device and a custom-designed set of algorithms and software to manage and analyze the acquired data.
