DWDM/OOC and large spectrum sources performance in broadband access network

This work presents a performance evaluation based on elaborated analytical expressions of error probability for broadband access network in the case of a combined technique of dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) and one dimensional optical orthogonal codes (1D-OOC). Optical sources with relatively large spectrum has been considered and simulated. Besides the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) at the receiver due to the access method which is optical code division multiple access (OCDMA), the emitted radiation of these sources in a dense WDM communication link introduces additional interference. Conventional correlation receiver (CCR) and parallel interference cancellation (PIC) receiver limitations are discussed. This paper has investigated the kind of optical sources with large spectrum bandwidth which could be accepted for a targeted bit error rate (BER) and given number of users in broadband access network supporting DWDM with optical orthogonal codes.
