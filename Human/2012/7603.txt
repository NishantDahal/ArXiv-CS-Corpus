Reliability improvement with PSP of Web-based software application

In diverse industrial and academic environments, the quality of the software has been evaluated using different analytic studies. The contribution of the present work is focused on the development of a methodology in order to improve the evaluation and analysis of the reliability of web-based software applications. The Personal Software Process (PSP) was introduced in our methodology for improving the quality of the process and the product. The Evaluation + Improvement (Ei) process is performed in our methodology to evaluate and improve the quality of the software system. We tested our methodology in a web-based software system and used statistical modeling theory for the analysis and evaluation of the reliability. The behavior of the system under ideal conditions was evaluated and compared against the operation of the system executing under real conditions. The results obtained demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of our methodology.
