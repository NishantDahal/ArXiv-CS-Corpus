Fine Residual Carrier Frequency and Sampling Frequency Estimation in Wireless OFDM Systems

This paper presents a novel algorithm for residual phase estimation in wireless OFDM systems, including the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and the sampling frequency offset (SFO). The subcarriers are partitioned into several regions which exhibit pairwise correlations. The phase increment between successive OFDM blocks is exploited which can be estimated by two estimators with different computational loads. Numerical results of estimation variance are presented. Simulations indicate performance improvement of the proposed technique over several conventional schemes in a multipath channel.
