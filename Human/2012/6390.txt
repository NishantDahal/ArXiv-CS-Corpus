A note on "Folding wheels and fans."

In S.Gervacio, R.Guerrero and H.Rara, Folding wheels and fans, Graphs and Combinatorics 18 (2002) 731-737, the authors obtain formulas for the clique numbers onto which wheels and fans fold. We present an interpolation theorem which generalizes their theorems 4.2 and 5.2. We show that their formula for wheels is wrong. We show that for threshold graphs, the achromatic number and folding number coincides with the chromatic number.
