Delay-limited Source and Channel Coding of Quasi-Stationary Sources over Block Fading Channels: Design and Scaling Laws

In this paper, delay-limited transmission of quasi-stationary sources over block fading channels are considered. Considering distortion outage probability as the performance measure, two source and channel coding schemes with power adaptive transmission are presented. The first one is optimized for fixed rate transmission, and hence enjoys simplicity of implementation. The second one is a high performance scheme, which also benefits from optimized rate adaptation with respect to source and channel states. In high SNR regime, the performance scaling laws in terms of outage distortion exponent and asymptotic outage distortion gain are derived, where two schemes with fixed transmission power and adaptive or optimized fixed rates are considered as benchmarks for comparisons. Various analytical and numerical results are provided which demonstrate a superior performance for source and channel optimized rate and power adaptive scheme. It is also observed that from a distortion outage perspective, the fixed rate adaptive power scheme substantially outperforms an adaptive rate fixed power scheme for delay-limited transmission of quasi-stationary sources over wireless block fading channels. The effect of the characteristics of the quasi-stationary source on performance, and the implication of the results for transmission of stationary sources are also investigated.
