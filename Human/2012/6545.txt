The Unified Logging Infrastructure for Data Analytics at Twitter

In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of work on large-scale data analytics using Hadoop-based platforms running on large clusters of commodity machines. A less-explored topic is how those data, dominated by application logs, are collected and structured to begin with. In this paper, we present Twitter's production logging infrastructure and its evolution from application-specific logging to a unified "client events" log format, where messages are captured in common, well-formatted, flexible Thrift messages. Since most analytics tasks consider the user session as the basic unit of analysis, we pre-materialize "session sequences", which are compact summaries that can answer a large class of common queries quickly. The development of this infrastructure has streamlined log collection and data analysis, thereby improving our ability to rapidly experiment and iterate on various aspects of the service.
