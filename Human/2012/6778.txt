Minimizing Electricity Theft using Smart Meters in AMI

Global energy crises are increasing every moment. Every one has the attention towards more and more energy production and also trying to save it. Electricity can be produced through many ways which is then synchronized on a main grid for usage. The main issue for which we have written this survey paper is losses in electrical system. Weather these losses are technical or non-technical. Technical losses can be calculated easily, as we discussed in section of mathematical modeling that how to calculate technical losses. Where as nontechnical losses can be evaluated if technical losses are known. Theft in electricity produce non-technical losses. To reduce or control theft one can save his economic resources. Smart meter can be the best option to minimize electricity theft, because of its high security, best efficiency, and excellent resistance towards many of theft ideas in electromechanical meters. So in this paper we have mostly concentrated on theft issues.
