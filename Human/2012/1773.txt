Scilab and SIP for Image Processing

This paper is an overview of Image Processing and Analysis using Scilab, a free prototyping environment for numerical calculations similar to Matlab. We demonstrate the capabilities of SIP -- the Scilab Image Processing Toolbox -- which extends Scilab with many functions to read and write images in over 100 major file formats, including PNG, JPEG, BMP, and TIFF. It also provides routines for image filtering, edge detection, blurring, segmentation, shape analysis, and image recognition. Basic directions to install Scilab and SIP are given, and also a mini-tutorial on Scilab. Three practical examples of image analysis are presented, in increasing degrees of complexity, showing how advanced image analysis techniques seems uncomplicated in this environment.
