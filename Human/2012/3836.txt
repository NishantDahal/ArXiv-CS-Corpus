DBC based Face Recognition using DWT

The applications using face biometric has proved its reliability in last decade. In this paper, we propose DBC based Face Recognition using DWT (DBC- FR) model. The Poly-U Near Infra Red (NIR) database images are scanned and cropped to get only the face part in pre-processing. The face part is resized to 100*100 and DWT is applied to derive LL, LH, HL and HH subbands. The LL subband of size 50*50 is converted into 100 cells with 5*5 dimention of each cell. The Directional Binary Code (DBC) is applied on each 5*5 cell to derive 100 features. The Euclidian distance measure is used to compare the features of test image and database images. The proposed algorithm render better percentage recognition rate compared to the existing algorithm.
