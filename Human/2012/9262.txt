Optimal Selection of Measurement Configurations for Stiffness Model Calibration of Anthropomorphic Manipulators

The paper focuses on the calibration of elastostatic parameters of spatial anthropomorphic robots. It proposes a new strategy for optimal selection of the measurement configurations that essentially increases the efficiency of robot calibration. This strategy is based on the concept of the robot test-pose and ensures the best compliance error compensation for the test configuration. The advantages of the proposed approach and its suitability for practical applications are illustrated by numerical examples, which deal with calibration of elastostatic parameters of a 3 degrees of freedom anthropomorphic manipulator with rigid links and compliant actuated joints
