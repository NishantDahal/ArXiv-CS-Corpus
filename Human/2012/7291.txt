Diversifying Citation Recommendations

Literature search is arguably one of the most important phases of the academic and non-academic research. The increase in the number of published papers each year makes manual search inefficient and furthermore insufficient. Hence, automatized methods such as search engines have been of interest in the last thirty years. Unfortunately, these traditional engines use keyword-based approaches to solve the search problem, but these approaches are prone to ambiguity and synonymy. On the other hand, bibliographic search techniques based only on the citation information are not prone to these problems since they do not consider textual similarity. For many particular research areas and topics, the amount of knowledge to humankind is immense, and obtaining the desired information is as hard as looking for a needle in a haystack. Furthermore, sometimes, what we are looking for is a set of documents where each one is different than the others, but at the same time, as a whole we want them to cover all the important parts of the literature relevant to our search. This paper targets the problem of result diversification in citation-based bibliographic search. It surveys a set of techniques which aim to find a set of papers with satisfactory quality and diversity. We enhance these algorithms with a direction-awareness functionality to allow the users to reach either old, well-cited, well-known research papers or recent, less-known ones. We also propose a set of novel techniques for a better diversification of the results. All the techniques considered are compared by performing a rigorous experimentation. The results show that some of the proposed techniques are very successful in practice while performing a search in a bibliographic database.
