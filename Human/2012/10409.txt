This paper presents a case study on the application of cause effect graph for representing the college placement process. This paper begins with giving a brief overview of the college placement process which will serve as the basis for developing the cause effect graph and the decision table for the same in a systematic manner. Finally, it concludes with the design of test cases thus giving a complete and clear representation about the application of cause-effect graph in the software testing domain.
