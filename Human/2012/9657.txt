A short proof that $χ$ can be bounded $ε$ away from $Δ+1$ towards $ω$

In 1998 the second author proved that there is an $ε>0$ such that every graph satisfies $χ\leq \lceil (1-ε)(Δ+1)+εω\rceil$. The first author recently proved that any graph satisfying $ω> \frac 23(Δ+1)$ contains a stable set intersecting every maximum clique. In this note we exploit the latter result to give a much shorter, simpler proof of the former. We include, as a certificate of simplicity, an appendix that proves all intermediate results with the exception of Hall's Theorem, Brooks' Theorem, the Lovász Local Lemma, and Talagrand's Inequality.
