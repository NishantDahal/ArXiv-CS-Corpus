Thermal analysis & optimization of a 3 dimensional heterogeneous structure

Besides the lot of advantages offered by the 3D stacking of devices in an integrated circuit there is a chance of device damage due to rise in peak temperature value. Hence, in order to make use of all the potential benefits of the vertical stacking a thermal aware design is very essential. The first step for designing a thermal aware architecture is to analyze the hotspot temperature generated by the devices. In this paper we are presenting the results of our thermal analysis experiments of a 3D heterogeneous structure with three layers. The bottom layer had eight identical processors at 2.4 GHz and the top layer was with four memory units. The intermediate layer was a thermal interface material (TIM). The 2D thermal analysis of the top and bottom layers was also done separately. In the next step simulations were carried out by varying TIM thickness and conductivity to study its affect on hotspot temperature so as to optimize the temperature distribution.
