Possibilities and impossibilities in Kolmogorov complexity extraction

Randomness extraction is the process of constructing a source of randomness of high quality from one or several sources of randomness of lower quality. The problem can be modeled using probability distributions and min-entropy to measure their quality and also by using individual strings and Kolmogorov complexity to measure their quality. Complexity theorists are more familiar with the first approach. In this paper we survey the second approach. We present the connection between extractors and Kolmogorov extractors and the basic positive and negative results concerning Kolmogorov complexity extraction.
