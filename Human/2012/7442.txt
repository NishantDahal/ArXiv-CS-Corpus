Speech Signal Filters based on Soft Computing Techniques: A Comparison

The paper presents a comparison of various soft computing techniques used for filtering and enhancing speech signals. The three major techniques that fall under soft computing are neural networks, fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms. Other hybrid techniques such as neuro-fuzzy systems are also available. In general, soft computing techniques have been experimentally observed to give far superior performance as compared to non-soft computing techniques in terms of robustness and accuracy.
