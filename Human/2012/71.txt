Dynamic Session Key Exchange Method using Two S-Boxes

This paper presents modifications of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange method. The presented modifications provide better security than other key exchange methods. We are going to present a dynamic security that simultaneously realizes all the three functions with a high efficiency and then give a security analysis. It also presents secure and dynamic key exchange method. Signature, encryption and key exchange are some of the most important and foundational Crypto-graphical tools. In most cases, they are all needed to provide different secure functions. On the other hand, there are also some proposals on the efficient combination of key exchange. In this paper, we present a dynamic, reliable and secure method for the exchange of session key. Moreover, the proposed modification method could achieve better performance efficiency.
