The AND-OR game: Equilibrium Characterization (Working Paper)

We consider a simple simultaneous first price auction for multiple items in a complete information setting. Our goal is to completely characterize the mixed equilibria in this setting, for a simple, yet highly interesting, {\tt AND}-{\tt OR} game, where one agent is single minded and the other is unit demand.
