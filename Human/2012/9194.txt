Sum-Rate Optimal Multi-Code CDMA Systems: An Equivalence Result

In this paper, the sum rate of a multi-code CDMA system with asymmetric-power users is maximized, given a processing gain and a power profile of users. Unlike the sum-rate maximization for a single-code CDMA system, the optimization requires the joint optimal distribution of each user's power to its multiple data streams as well as the optimal design of signature sequences. The crucial step is to establish an equivalence of the multi-code CDMA system to restricted FDMA and TDMA systems. The CDMA system has upper limits on the numbers of multi-codes of users, while the FDMA and the TDMA systems have upper limits on the bandwidths and the duty cycles of users, respectively, in addition to total bandwidth constraint. The equivalence facilitates the complete characterization of the maximum sum rate of the multi-code CDMA system and also provides new insights into the single- and the multi-code CDMA systems in terms of the parameters of the equivalent FDMA and TDMA systems.
