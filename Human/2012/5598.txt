Quantum-like Tests for Contextual Querying

Tests are essential in Information Retrieval (IR), in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a query. Tests intended to exhibit the sense of words in con-text were undertaken and linked with Quantum Mechanics (QM). Poll tests were undertaken on heterogeneous media such as music and polysemy in foreign languages. Interference effects are shown in the results. Bell inequality was used leading to a significant spread in the results of the poll tests but without violating the classical limit. Then an automatic pertinence measure tool on texts has been developed using the HAL algorithm using an orthonormal vector decomposition model. In this case the spread in the values can lead to the violation of the Bell inequality even beyond Cirel'son bound.
