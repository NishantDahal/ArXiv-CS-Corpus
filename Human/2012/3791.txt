M-FISH Karyotyping - A New Approach Based on Watershed Transform

Karyotyping is a process in which chromosomes in a dividing cell are properly stained, identified and displayed in a standard format, which helps geneticist to study and diagnose genetic factors behind various genetic diseases and for studying cancer. M-FISH (Multiplex Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization) provides color karyotyping. In this paper, an automated method for M-FISH chromosome segmentation based on watershed transform followed by naive Bayes classification of each region using the features, mean and standard deviation, is presented. Also, a post processing step is added to re-classify the small chromosome segments to the neighboring larger segment for reducing the chances of misclassification. The approach provided improved accuracy when compared to the pixel-by-pixel approach. The approach was tested on 40 images from the dataset and achieved an accuracy of 84.21 %.
