Quality Assurance And Integration Testing Aspects In Web Based Applications

Integration testing is one the important phase in software testing life cycle (STLC). With the fast growth of internet and web services, web-based applications are also growing rapidly and their importance and complexity is also increasing. Heterogeneous and diverse nature of distributed components, applications, along with their multi-platform support and cooperativeness make these applications more complex and swiftly increasing in their size. Quality assurance of these applications is becoming more crucial and important. Testing is one of the key processes to achieve and ensure the quality of these software or Webbased products. There are many testing challenges involved in Web-based applications. But most importantly integration is the most critical testing associated with Web-based applications. There are number of challenging factors involved in integration testing efforts. These factors have almost 70 percent to 80 percent impact on overall quality of Web-based applications. In software industry different kind of testing approaches are used by practitioners to solve the issues associated with integration which are due to ever increasing complexities of Web-based applications.
