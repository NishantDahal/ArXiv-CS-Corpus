Verification and Diagnosis Infrastructure of SoC HDL-model

This article describes technology for diagnosing SoC HDL-models, based on transactional graph. Diagnosis method is focused to considerable decrease the time of fault detection and memory for storage of diagnosis matrix by means of forming ternary relations in the form of test, monitor, and functional component. The following problems are solved: creation of digital system model in the form of transaction graph and multi-tree of fault detection tables, as well as ternary matrices for activating functional components in tests, relative to the selected set of monitors; development of a method for analyzing the activation matrix to detect the faults with given depth and synthesizing logic functions for subsequent embedded hardware fault diagnosing.
