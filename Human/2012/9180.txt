Some results on the Weiss-Weinstein bound for conditional and unconditional signal models in array processing

In this paper, the Weiss-Weinstein bound is analyzed in the context of sources localization with a planar array of sensors. Both conditional and unconditional source signal models are studied. First, some results are given in the multiple sources context without specifying the structure of the steering matrix and of the noise covariance matrix. Moreover, the case of an uniform or Gaussian prior are analyzed. Second, these results are applied to the particular case of a single source for two kinds of array geometries: a non-uniform linear array (elevation only) and an arbitrary planar (azimuth and elevation) array.
