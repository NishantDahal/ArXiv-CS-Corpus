A Representation of Binary Matrices

In this article we discuss the presentation of a random binary matrix using sequence of whole nonnegative numbers. We examine some advantages and disadvantages of this presentation as an alternative of the standard presentation using two-dimensional array. It is shown that the presentation of binary matrices using ordered n-tuples of natural numbers makes the algorithms faster and saves a lot of memory. In this work we use object-oriented programming using the syntax and the semantic of C++ programming language.
