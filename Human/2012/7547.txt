Agent-based Exploration of Wirings of Biological Neural Networks: Position Paper

The understanding of human central nervous system depends on knowledge of its wiring. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of its wiring due to technical difficulties. While some information is coming out from human experiments, medical research is lacking of simulation models to put current findings together to obtain the global picture and to predict hypotheses to lead future experiments. Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) is a strong candidate for the simulation model. In this position paper, we discuss the current status of "neural wiring" and "ABMS in biological systems". In particular, we discuss that the ABMS context provides features required for exploration of biological neural wiring.
