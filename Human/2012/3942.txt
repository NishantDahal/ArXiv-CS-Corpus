Signed and Minus Domination in Complete Multipartite Graphs

In this paper we determine the exact values of the signed domination number, signed total domination number, and minus domination number of complete multipartite graphs, which substantially generalizes some previous results obtained for special subclasses of complete multipartite graphs such as cliques and complete bipartite graphs.
