Semantic snippet construction for search engine results based on segment evaluation

The result listing from search engines includes a link and a snippet from the web page for each result item. The snippet in the result listing plays a vital role in assisting the user to click on it. This paper proposes a novel approach to construct the snippets based on a semantic evaluation of the segments in the page. The target segment(s) is/are identified by applying a model to evaluate segments present in the page and selecting the segments with top scores. The proposed model makes the user judgment to click on a result item easier since the snippet is constructed semantically after a critical evaluation based on multiple factors. A prototype implementation of the proposed model confirms the empirical validation.
