Rule Based Expert System for Diagnosis of Neuromuscular Disorders

In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a rule based expert system for diagnosing neuromuscular diseases. The proposed system is implemented as a rule based expert system in JESS for the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy and Parkinson's disease. In the system, the user is presented with a list of questionnaires about the symptoms of the patients based on which the disease of the patient is diagnosed and possible treatment is suggested. The system can aid and support the patients suffering from neuromuscular diseases to get an idea of their disease and possible treatment for the disease.
