The Parameterized Complexity Analysis of Partition Sort for Negative Binomial Distribution Inputs

The present paper makes a study on Partition sort algorithm for negative binomial inputs. Comparing the results with those for binomial inputs in our previous work, we find that this algorithm is sensitive to parameters of both distributions. But the main effects as well as the interaction effects involving these parameters and the input size are more significant for negative binomial case.
