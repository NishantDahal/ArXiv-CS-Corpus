HMRF-EM-image: Implementation of the Hidden Markov Random Field Model and its Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

In this project, we study the hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model and its expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We implement a MATLAB toolbox named HMRF-EM-image for 2D image segmentation using the HMRF-EM framework. This toolbox also implements edge-prior-preserving image segmentation, and can be easily reconfigured for other problems, such as 3D image segmentation.
