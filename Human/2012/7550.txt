Development of an e-learning system incorporating semantic web

E-Learning is efficient, task relevant and just-in-time learning grown from the learning requirements of the new and dynamically changing world. The term Semantic Web covers the steps to create a new WWW architecture that augments the content with formal semantics enabling better possibilities of navigation through the cyberspace and its contents. In this paper, we present the Semantic Web-Based model for our e-learning system taking into account the learning environment at Saudi Arabian universities. The proposed system is mainly based on ontology-based descriptions of content, context and structure of the learning materials. It further provides flexible and personalized access to these learning materials. The framework has been validated by an interview based qualitative method.
