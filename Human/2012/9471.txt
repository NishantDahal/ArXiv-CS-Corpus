Proceedings 2nd International Workshop on Linearity

This volume contains a selection of the papers presented at the 2nd International Workshop on Linearity (LINEARITY'2012), which took place 1 April 2012 in Tallinn, Estonia. The workshop was a one-day satellite event of ETAPS 2012, the 15th European Joint Conference on Theory and Practice of Software.
  The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers who are currently developing theory and applications of linear calculi, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area.
