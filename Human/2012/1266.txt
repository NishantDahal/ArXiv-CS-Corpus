A Constructive Proof of the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture

The cycle double cover conjecture states that a graph is bridge-free if and only if there is a family of edge-simple cycles such that each edge is contained in exactly two of them. It was formulated independently by Szekeres (1973) and Seymour (1979). In this paper, we settle the conjecture in the affirmative. In particular, we give an algorithm, which inductively constructs a cycle double cover in polynomial time.
