Modified Quine-McCluskey Method

The digital gates are basic electronic component of any digital circuit. Digital circuit should be simplified in order to reduce its cost by reducing number of digital gates required to implement it. To achieve this, we use Boolean expression that helps in obtaining minimum number of terms and does not contain any redundant pair. Karnaugh map(K-map) and Quine-McCluskey(QM) methods are well known methods to simplify Boolean expression. K-map method becomes complex beyond five variable Boolean expression. Quine-McCluskey method is computer based technique for minimization of Boolean function and it is faster than K-map method. This paper proposes E-sum based optimization to Quine-McCluskey Method to increase its performance by reducing number of comparisons between mintermlist in determination of prime implicants. Modified Quine-McCluskey method(MQM) can be implemented to any number of variable.
