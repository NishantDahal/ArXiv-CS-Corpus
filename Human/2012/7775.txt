Data-Oblivious Graph Drawing Model and Algorithms

We study graph drawing in a cloud-computing context where data is stored externally and processed using a small local working storage. We show that a number of classic graph drawing algorithms can be efficiently implemented in such a framework where the client can maintain privacy while constructing a drawing of her graph.
