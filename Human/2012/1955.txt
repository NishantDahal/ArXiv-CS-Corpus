Statistical Characterization and Mitigation of NLOS Errors in UWB Localization Systems

In this paper some new experimental results about the statistical characterization of the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias affecting time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation in ultrawideband (UWB) wireless localization systems are illustrated. Then, these results are exploited to assess the performance of various maximum-likelihood (ML) based algorithms for joint TOA localization and NLOS bias mitigation. Our numerical results evidence that the accuracy of all the considered algorithms is appreciably influenced by the LOS/NLOS conditions of the propagation environment.
