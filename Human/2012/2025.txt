Design of modular wireless sensor

The paper addresses combinatorial approach to design of modular wireless sensor as composition of the sensor element from its component alternatives and aggregation of the obtained solutions into a resultant aggregated solution. A hierarchical model is used for the wireless sensor element. The solving process consists of three stages: (i) multicriteria ranking of design alternatives for system components/parts, (ii) composing the selected design alternatives into composite solution(s) while taking into account ordinal quality of the design alternatives above and their compatibility (this stage is based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design - HMMD), and (iii) aggregation of the obtained composite solutions into a resultant aggregated solution(s). A numerical example describes the problem structuring and solving processes for modular alarm wireless sensor element.
