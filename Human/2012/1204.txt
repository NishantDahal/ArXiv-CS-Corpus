Towards 100 Gbps Ethernet: Development of Ethernet / Physical Layer Aspects

Physical layer features of Ethernet from the first realization towards the 100 Gb Ethernet (100 GbE) development have been considered. Comparisons of these features are made according to the standardized data rates. Feasible physical layer options are then discussed for high data rates.
