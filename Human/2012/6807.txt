Goldbach Ellipse Sequences for Cryptographic Applications

The paper studies cryptographically useful properties of the sequence of the sizes of Goldbach ellipses. We show that binary subsequences based on this sequence have useful properties. They can be used to generate keys and to provide an index-based mapping to numbers. The paper also presents a protocol for secure session keys that is based on Goldbach partitions.
