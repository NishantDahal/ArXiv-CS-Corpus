Privacy, Trust and Identity in Pervasive Computing: A Review of Technical Challenges and Future Research Directions

Developments in pervasive computing introduced a new world of computing where networked processors embedded and distributed in everyday objects communicating with each other over wireless links. Computers in such environments work in the background while establishing connections among them dynamically and hence will be less visible and intrusive. Such a vision raises questions about how to manage issues like privacy, trust and identity in those environments. In this paper, we review the technical challenges that face pervasive computing environments in relation to each of these issues. We then present a number of security related considerations and use them as a basis for comparison between pervasive and traditional computing. We will argue that these considerations pose particular concerns and challenges to the design and implementation of pervasive environments which are different to those usually found in traditional computing environments. To address these concerns and challenges, further research is needed. We will present a number of directions and topics for possible future research with respect to each of the three issues.
