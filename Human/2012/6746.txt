On Generalized Fuzzy Multisets and their Use in Computation

An orthogonal approach to the fuzzification of both multisets and hybrid sets is presented. In particular, we introduce L-multi-fuzzy and L-fuzzy hybrid sets, which are general enough and in spirit with the basic concepts of fuzzy set theory. In addition, we study the properties of these structures. Also, the usefulness of these structures is examined in the framework of mechanical multiset processing. More specifically, we introduce a variant of fuzzy P systems and, since simple fuzzy membrane systems have been introduced elsewhere, we simply extend previously stated results and ideas.
