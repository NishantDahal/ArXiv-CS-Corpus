Proceedings 8th Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science

This volume contains the proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Fixed Points in Computer Science which took place on 24 March 2012 in Tallinn, Estonia as an ETAPS-affiliated workshop.  Past workshops have been held in Brno (1998, MFCS/CSL workshop), Paris (2000, LC workshop), Florence (2001, PLI workshop), Copenhagen (2002, LICS (FLoC) workshop), Warsaw (2003, ETAPS workshop), Coimbra (2009, CSL workshop), and Brno (2010, MFCS-CSL workshop).
  Fixed points play a fundamental role in several areas of computer science and logic by justifying induction and recursive definitions. The construction and properties of fixed points have been investigated in many different frameworks such as: design and implementation of programming languages, program logics, and databases. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to present their results to those members of the computer science and logic communities who study or apply the theory of fixed points.
