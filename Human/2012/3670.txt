Spectral Efficiency of Multiple Access Fading Channels with Adaptive Interference Cancellation

Reliable estimation of users' channels and data in rapidly time varying fading environments is a very challenging task of multiuser detection (MUD) techniques that promise impressive capacity gains for interference limited systems such as non-orthogonal CDMA and spatial multiplexing MIMO based LTE. This paper analyzes relative channel estimation error performances of conventional single user and multiuser receivers for an uplink of DS-CDMA and shows their impact on output signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) performances. Mean squared error (MSE) of channel estimation and achievable spectral efficiencies of these receivers obtained from the output SINR calculations are then compared with that achieved with new adaptive interference canceling receivers. It is shown that the adaptive receivers using successive (SIC) and parallel interference cancellation (PIC) methods offer much improved channel estimation and SINR performances, and hence significant increase in achievable sum date rates.
