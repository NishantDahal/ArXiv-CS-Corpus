Efficient Nash Computation in Large Population Games with Bounded Influence

We introduce a general representation of large-population games in which each player      s influence ON the others IS centralized AND limited,     but may otherwise be arbitrary.This representation significantly generalizes      the class known AS congestion games IN a natural way.Our main      results are provably correct AND efficient algorithms FOR     computing AND     learning approximate Nash equilibria IN this general framework.
