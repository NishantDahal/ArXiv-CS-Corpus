Minimal Convex Decompositions

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points on the plane in general position. We say that a set $Γ$ of convex polygons with vertices in $P$ is a convex decomposition of $P$ if: Union of all elements in $Γ$ is the convex hull of $P,$ every element in $Γ$ is empty, and for any two different elements of $Γ$ their interiors are disjoint. A minimal convex decomposition of $P$ is a convex decomposition $Γ'$ such that for any two adjacent elements in $Γ'$ its union is a non convex polygon. It is known that $P$ always has a minimal convex decomposition with at most $\frac{3n}{2}$ elements. Here we prove that $P$ always has a minimal convex decomposition with at most $\frac{10n}{7}$ elements.
