IDPS: An Integrated Intrusion Handling Model for Cloud

Today, many organizations are moving their computing services towards the Cloud. This makes their computer processing available much more conveniently to users. However, it also brings new security threats and challenges about safety and reliability. In fact, Cloud Computing is an attractive and cost-saving service for buyers as it provides accessibility and reliability options for users and scalable sales for providers. In spite of being attractive, Cloud feature poses various new security threats and challenges when it comes to deploying Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Cloud environments. Most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to handle specific types of attacks. It is evident that no single technique can guarantee protection against future attacks. Hence, there is a need for an integrated scheme which can provide robust protection against a complete spectrum of threats. On the other hand, there is great need for technology that enables the network and its hosts to defend themselves with some level of intelligence in order to accurately identify and block malicious traffic and activities. In this case, it is called Intrusion prevention system (IPS). Therefore, in this paper, we emphasize on recent implementations of IDS on Cloud Computing environments in terms of security and privacy. We propose an effective and efficient model termed as the Integrated Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) which combines both IDS and IPS in a single mechanism. Our mechanism also integrates two techniques namely, Anomaly Detection (AD) and Signature Detection (SD) that can work in cooperation to detect various numbers of attacks and stop them through the capability of IPS.
