Security Threats Analysis in Bluetooth-Enabled Mobile Devices

Exponential growth of the volume of Bluetooth-enabled devices indicates that it has become a popular way of wireless interconnections for exchanging information. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the most critical Bluetooth attacks in real scenarios. In order to find out the major vulnerabilities in modern Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices several attacks have performed successfully such as- Surveillance, Obfuscation, Sniffing, Unauthorized Direct Data Access (UDDA) and Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM). To perform the testbed, several devices are used such as mobile phones, laptops, notebooks, wireless headsets, etc. and all the tests are carried out by pen-testing software like hcittml, braudit, spoafiooph, hridump, bluesnarfer, bluebugger and carwhisperer.
  KEYWORDS: Bluetooth, Security, Surveillance, Obfuscation, Sniffing, Denial of service, Man-in-the-middle.
