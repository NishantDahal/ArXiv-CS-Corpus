Efficient Construction of Dominating Set in Wireless Networks

Considering a communication topology of a wireless network modeled by a graph where an edge exists between two nodes if they are within each other's communication range. A subset $U$ of nodes is a dominating set if each node is either in $U$ or adjacent to some node in $U$. Assume each node has a disparate communication range and is associated with a positive weight, we present a randomized algorithm to find a min-weight dominating set. Considering any orientation of the graph where an arc $\overrightarrow{uv}$ exists if the node $v$ lies in $u$'s communication range. A subset $U$ of nodes is a strongly dominating set if every node except $U$ has both in-neighbor(s) and out-neighbor(s) in $U$. We present a polynomial-time algorithm to find a strongly dominating set of size at most $(2+Îµ)$ times of the optimum. We also investigate another related problem called $K$-Coverage. Given are a set ${\cal D}$ of disks with positive weight and a set ${\cal P}$ of nodes. Assume all input nodes lie below a horizontal line $l$ and all input disks lie above this line $l$ in the plane. The objective is to find a min-weight subset ${\cal D}'\subseteq {\cal D}$ of disks such that each node is covered at least $K$ disks in ${\cal D}'$. We propose a novel two-approximation algorithm for this problem.
