Discriminative Learning via Semidefinite Probabilistic Models

Discriminative linear models are a popular tool in machine learning. These can be generally divided into two types: The first is linear classifiers, such as support vector machines, which are well studied and provide state-of-the-art results. One shortcoming of these models is that their output (known as the 'margin') is not calibrated, and cannot be translated naturally into a distribution over the labels. Thus, it is difficult to incorporate such models as components of larger systems, unlike probabilistic based approaches. The second type of approach constructs class conditional distributions using a nonlinearity (e.g. log-linear models), but is occasionally worse in terms of classification error. We propose a supervised learning method which combines the best of both approaches. Specifically, our method provides a distribution over the labels, which is a linear function of the model parameters. As a consequence, differences between probabilities are linear functions, a property which most probabilistic models (e.g. log-linear) do not have.
  Our model assumes that classes correspond to linear subspaces (rather than to half spaces). Using a relaxed projection operator, we construct a measure which evaluates the degree to which a given vector 'belongs' to a subspace, resulting in a distribution over labels. Interestingly, this view is closely related to similar concepts in quantum detection theory. The resulting models can be trained either to maximize the margin or to optimize average likelihood measures. The corresponding optimization problems are semidefinite programs which can be solved efficiently. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on real world datasets, and show that it outperforms 2nd order kernel methods.
