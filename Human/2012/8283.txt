Resilient Source Coding

This paper provides a source coding theorem for multi-dimensional information signals when, at a given instant, the distribution associated with one arbitrary component of the signal to be compressed is not known and a side information is available at the destination. This new framework appears to be both of information-theoretical and game-theoretical interest: it provides a new type of constraints to compress an information source; it is useful for designing certain types of mediators in games and characterize utility regions for games with signals. Regarding the latter aspect, we apply the derived source coding theorem to the prisoner's dilemma and the battle of the sexes.
