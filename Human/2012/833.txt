When Should I Make Preservation Copies of Myself?

We investigate how different preservation policies ranging from least aggressive to Most aggressive affect the level of preservation achieved by autonomic processes used by smart digital objects (DOs). The mechanisms used to support preservation across different hosts can be used for automatic link generation and support preservation activities by moving data preservation from an archive centric perspective to a data centric preservation. Based on simulations of small-world graphs of DOs created using the Unsupervised Small-World algorithm, we report quantitative and qualitative results for graphs ranging in size from 10 to 5000 DOs. Our results show that a Most aggressive preservation policy makes the best use of distributed host resources while using one half of the number of messages of a Moderately aggressive preservation policy.
