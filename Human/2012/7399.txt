Formal Definition of AI

A definition of Artificial Intelligence was proposed in [1] but this definition was not absolutely formal at least because the word "Human" was used. In this paper we will formalize the definition from [1]. The biggest problem in this definition was that the level of intelligence of AI is compared to the intelligence of a human being. In order to change this we will introduce some parameters to which AI will depend. One of this parameters will be the level of intelligence and we will define one AI to each level of intelligence. We assume that for some level of intelligence the respective AI will be more intelligent than a human being. Nevertheless, we cannot say which is this level because we cannot calculate its exact value.
