Computably Categorical Fields via Fermat's Last Theorem

We construct a computable, computably categorical field of infinite transcendence degree over the rational numbers, using the Fermat polynomials and assorted results from algebraic geometry. We also show that this field has an intrinsically computable (infinite) transcendence basis.
