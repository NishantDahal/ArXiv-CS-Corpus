Logical operations with Localized Structures

We show how to exploit excitable regimes mediated by localized structures (LS) to perform AND, OR, and NOT logical operations providing full logical functionality. Our scheme is general and can be implemented in any physical system displaying LS. In particular, LS in nonlinear photonic devices can be used for all-optical computing applications where several reconfigurable logic gates can be implemented in the transverse plane of a single device, allowing for parallel computing.
