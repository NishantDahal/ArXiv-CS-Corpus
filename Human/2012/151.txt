Applications of topology in computer algorithms

The aim of this paper is to discuss some applications of general topology in computer algorithms including modeling and simulation, and also in computer graphics and image processing. While the progress in these areas heavily depends on advances in computing hardware, the major intellectual achievements are the algorithms. The applications of general topology in other branches of mathematics are not discussed, since they are not applications of mathematics outside of mathematics.
