Ber analysis of iterative turbo encoded miso wireless communication system under implementation of q-ostbc scheme

In this paper, a comprehensive study has been made to evaluate the performance of a MISO wireless communication system. The 4-by-1 spatially multiplexed Turbo encoded system under investigation incorporates Quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding (Q-STBC) and ML signal detection schemes under QPSK, QAM, 16PSK and 16QAM digital modulations. The simulation results elucidate that a significant improvement of system performance is achieved in QAM modulation. The results are also indicative of noticeable system performance enhancement with increasing number of iterations in Turbo encoding/decoding scheme.
