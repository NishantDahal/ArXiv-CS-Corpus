Role of Ranking Algorithms for Information Retrieval

As the use of web is increasing more day by day, the web users get easily lost in the web's rich hyper structure. The main aim of the owner of the website is to give the relevant information according their needs to the users. We explained the Web mining is used to categorize users and pages by analyzing user's behavior, the content of pages and then describe Web Structure mining. This paper includes different Page Ranking algorithms and compares those algorithms used for Information Retrieval. Different Page Rank based algorithms like Page Rank (PR), WPR (Weighted Page Rank), HITS (Hyperlink Induced Topic Selection), Distance Rank and EigenRumor algorithms are discussed and compared. Simulation Interface has been designed for PageRank algorithm and Weighted PageRank algorithm but PageRank is the only ranking algorithm on which Google search engine works.
