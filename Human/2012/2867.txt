Introducing convex layers to the Traveling Salesman Problem

In this paper, we will propose convex layers to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Firstly, we will focus on human performance on the TSP. Experimental data shows that untrained humans appear to have the ability to perform well in the TSP. On the other hand, experimental data also supports the hypothesis of convex hull i.e. human relies on convex hull to search for the optimal tour for the TSP. Secondly, from the paper published by Bonabeau, Dorigo and Theraulaz, social insect behavior would be able to help in some of the optimizing problems, especially the TSP. Thus, we propose convex layers to the TSP based on the argument that, by the analogy to the social insect behavior, untrained humans' cognition should be able to help in the TSP. Lastly, we will use Tour Improvement algorithms on convex layers to search for an optimal tour for a 13-cities problem to demonstrate the idea.
