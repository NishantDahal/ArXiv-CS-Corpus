On Algorithms and Extensions of Coordination Control of Discrete-Event Systems

In this paper, we further develop the coordination control scheme for discrete-event systems based on the Ramadge-Wonham framework. The notions of conditional decomposability, conditional controllability, and conditional closedness are revised and simplified, supremal conditionally controllable sublanguages of general non-prefix-closed languages are discussed, and a procedure for the computation of a coordinator for nonblockingness is presented.
