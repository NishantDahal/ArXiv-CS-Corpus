Cross-View of Testing Techniques Toward Improving Web-Based Application Testing

Web Applications (WA's) failures may lead to collapse of the institutions, therefore the importance of good quality WA's is increasing over the time. Testing is one of the best quality metrics that decide whether WA's are reliable or not. WA's testing approaches suffer from the lack of proper coverage of WA's functional requirements testing. On the other hand some approaches produce test cases that already cover WA's testing but they also produce a great number of irrelevant test cases. This research analyzed the main testing approaches for WA's and GUI applications. Also we have an overview of Test-Driven Development and its effects on the current development. The specification of good testing approach that satisfies the proper testing is then presented.
