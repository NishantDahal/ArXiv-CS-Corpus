Unique Decoding of Plane AG Codes Revisited

We reformulate a recently introduced interpolation-based unique decoding algorithm of algebraic geometry codes using the theory of Gr√∂bner bases of modules on the coordinate ring of the base curve. With the same decoding performance, the new algorithm has a more conceptual description that lets us better understand the majority voting procedure central in the interpolation-based unique decoding.
