Ensemble Clustering with Logic Rules

In this article, the logic rule ensembles approach to supervised learning is applied to the unsupervised or semi-supervised clustering. Logic rules which were obtained by combining simple conjunctive rules are used to partition the input space and an ensemble of these rules is used to define a similarity matrix. Similarity partitioning is used to partition the data in an hierarchical manner. We have used internal and external measures of cluster validity to evaluate the quality of clusterings or to identify the number of clusters.
