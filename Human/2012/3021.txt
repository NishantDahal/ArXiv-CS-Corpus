Experimenting with Component-Based Middleware for Adaptive Fault Tolerant Computing

This short paper describes early experiments to validate the capabilities of a component-based platform to observe and control a software architecture in the small. This is part of a whole process for resilient computing, i.e. targeting the adaptation of fault-tolerance mechanisms at runtime.
