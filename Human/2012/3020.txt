Reducing Total Power Consumption Method in Cloud Computing Environments

The widespread use of cloud computing services is expected to increase the power consumed by ICT equipment in cloud computing environments rapidly. This paper first identifies the need of the collaboration among servers, the communication network and the power network, in order to reduce the total power consumption by the entire ICT equipment in cloud computing environments. Five fundamental policies for the collaboration are proposed and the algorithm to realize each collaboration policy is outlined. Next, this paper proposes possible signaling sequences to exchange information on power consumption between network and servers, in order to realize the proposed collaboration policy. Then, in order to reduce the power consumption by the network, this paper proposes a method of estimating the volume of power consumption by all network devices simply and assigning it to an individual user.
