Decentralized Sensor Fusion With Distributed Particle Filters

This paper presents a scalable Bayesian technique for     decentralized state estimation from multiple platforms in dynamic     environments. As has long been recognized, centralized     architectures impose severe scaling limitations for     distributed systems due to the enormous communication     overheads. We propose a strictly decentralized approach in which only     nearby platforms exchange information. They do so through an     interactive communication protocol aimed at maximizing     information flow. Our approach is evaluated in the context     of a distributed surveillance scenario that arises in a robotic system     for playing the game of laser tag. Our results, both from     simulation and using physical robots, illustrate an unprecedented     scaling capability to large teams of vehicles.
