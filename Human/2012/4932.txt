Measure of Similarity between Fuzzy Concepts for Optimization of Fuzzy Semantic Nets

This paper presents a method to measure the similarity between different fuzzy concepts in order to optimize Semantic networks. The problem approached is the minimization of the time of research and identification of user's Objects and Goals. Indeed, it concerns to determine to each instant the totality of Objects (respectively Goals) among which one can identify rapidly the most satisfactory for the user's Object and Goal. Alone Objects and most similar Goals to Objects and researched Goals of the viewpoint of attribute values will be processed, what will avoid the analysis of all Objects and system Goals far of needs of the user.
