Haptic BCI Paradigm based on Somatosensory Evoked Potential

A new concept and an online prototype of haptic BCI paradigm are presented. Our main goal is to develop a new, alternative and low cost paradigm, with open-source hardware and software components. We also report results obtained with the novel dry EEG electrodes based signal acquisition system by g.tec, which further improves experimental comfort. We address the following points: a novel application of the BCI; a new methodological approach used compared to earlier projects; a new benefit for potential users of a BCI; the approach working online/in real-time; development of a novel stimuli delivery hardware and software. The results with five healthy subjects and discussion of future developments conclude this submission.
