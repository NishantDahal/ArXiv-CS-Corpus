A Novel Approach of Harris Corner Detection of Noisy Images using Adaptive Wavelet Thresholding Technique

In this paper we propose a method of corner detection for obtaining features which is required to track and recognize objects within a noisy image. Corner detection of noisy images is a challenging task in image processing. Natural images often get corrupted by noise during acquisition and transmission. Though Corner detection of these noisy images does not provide desired results, hence de-noising is required. Adaptive wavelet thresholding approach is applied for the same.
