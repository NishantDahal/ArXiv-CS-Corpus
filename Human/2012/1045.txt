Live-marker: A personalized web page content marking tool

The tremendous amount of increase in the quantity of information resources available on the web has made the total time that the user spends on a single page very minimal. Users revisiting the same page would be able to fetch the required information much faster if the information that they consumed during the previous visit(s) gets presented to them with a special style. This paper proposes a model which empowers the users to mark the content interesting to them, so that it can be identified easily during successive visits. In addition to the explicit marking by the users, the model facilitates implicit marking based on the user preferences. The prototype implementation based on proposed model validates the model's efficiency.
