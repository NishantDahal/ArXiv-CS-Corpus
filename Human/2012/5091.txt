Power Consumption in Spatial Cognition

Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) adds a new dimension to be exploited in Cognitive Radio (CR) by simultaneously serving several users. The spatial domain that is added through MIMO is another system resource that has to be optimized, and shared when possible. In this paper, we present a spatial sharing that is carried out through Zero Forcing beamforming (ZFB). Power consumption in such a scenario is discussed and compared to single user case, to evaluate the feasibility of employing spatial cognition from the power perspective. Closed form expressions are derived for the consumed power and data rate at different transmission schemes. Finally, a joint power rate metric is deduced to provide a comprehensive measure of the expediency of spatial cognitive scenario.
