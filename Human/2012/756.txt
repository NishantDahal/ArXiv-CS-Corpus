Innovative SQA Service Maturity Model using CMMI and ITIL

This Journal details a maturity model for SQA services which has been developed during QMS implementation in the IT division of a large multinational organization. The scope of the engagement was to establish a standard set of processes based on CMMI\textregistered and ITIL\textregistered Framework across four business verticals scattered in Europe, United States and Asia. The services of Software Quality Analyst (SQA) from different vendors were leveraged to facilitate implementation of processes which was referred to as the Quality Management System (QMS). To co-ordinate and support QMS implementation, a Software Quality Assurance Group (SQAG) was established at the organizational level. Considering the large number of applications, the business verticals proposed that process implementation should be owned and managed by practitioners themselves so that the mass deployment of QMS can be achieved at a faster rate with the same SQA capacity. This called for a need to devise an innovative implementation solution before moving to a process implementation model which proposed Project Managers implementing processes themself. While there are process models and frameworks available in the market for establishing processes in an organization, there is no model that elaborates activities to be performed by the SQA for effective implementation of processes. SQA service maturity model was proposed as a solution based on CMMI\textregistered and developed to eventually proceed towards a 'Process Implementation Model proposing Project Managers implementing processes themself'.
  SQA Service Maturity Model is a Software Quality Assurance implementation framework that enables organisations to increase Efficiencies in Software Quality Assurance, reduce the Cost of Defects and ultimately Increasing Return on Investment in IT.
