An Evaluation of Arabic Language Learning Websites

As a result of ICT development and the increasingly growing use of the Internet in particular, practices of language teaching and learning are about to evolve significantly. Our study focuses on the Arabic language, and aims to explore and evaluate Arabic language learning websites. To reach these goals, we propose in a first step, to define an evaluation model, based on a set of criteria for assessing the quality of websites dedicated to teaching and learning Arabic. We subsequently apply our model on a set of Arabic sites available on the web and give an assessment of these web sites. We finally discuss their strengths and limitations.
