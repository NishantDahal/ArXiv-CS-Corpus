Saratoga: scalable, speedy data delivery for sensor networks

A networking transport protocol, named Saratoga, has been developed at the University of Surrey for efficient delivery of imagery from Internet-Protocol-based remote-sensing satellites. Saratoga is now being implemented and evaluated for use for the high-end data-delivery needs of astronomers using large, advanced, radio telescopes. These telescopes are expected to take advantage of Internet technologies. This brief paper outlines the reasons for the creation and adoption of this protocol, discusses how it differs from and complements other protocols, and summarises the worldwide collaboration that is making this development possible.
