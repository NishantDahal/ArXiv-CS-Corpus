A survey on data and transaction management in mobile databases

The popularity of the Mobile Database is increasing day by day as people need information even on the move in the fast changing world. This database technology permits employees using mobile devices to connect to their corporate networks, hoard the needed data, work in the disconnected mode and reconnect to the network to synchronize with the corporate database. In this scenario, the data is being moved closer to the applications in order to improve the performance and autonomy. This leads to many interesting problems in mobile database research and Mobile Database has become a fertile land for many researchers. In this paper a survey is presented on data and Transaction management in Mobile Databases from the year 2000 onwards. The survey focuses on the complete study on the various types of Architectures used in Mobile databases and Mobile Transaction Models. It also addresses the data management issues namely Replication and Caching strategies and the transaction management functionalities such as Concurrency Control and Commit protocols, Synchronization, Query Processing, Recovery and Security. It also provides Research Directions in Mobile databases.
