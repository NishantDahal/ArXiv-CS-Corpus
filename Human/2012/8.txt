Comparing Background Subtraction Algorithms and Method of Car Counting

In this paper, we compare various image background subtraction algorithms with the ground truth of cars counted. We have given a sample of thousand images, which are the snap shots of current traffic as records at various intersections and highways. We have also counted an approximate number of cars that are visible in these images. In order to ascertain the accuracy of algorithms to be used for the processing of million images, we compare them on many metrics that includes (i) Scalability (ii) Accuracy (iii) Processing time.
