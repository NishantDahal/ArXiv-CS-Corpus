EDCC 2012 - Fast Abstracts & Student Forum Proceedings

Fast Abstracts at EDCC 2012 are short presentations, aiming to serve as a rapid and flexible mechanism to report on current work that may or may not be complete, introduce new ideas to the community, and state positions on controversial issues or open problems. This way, fast abstracts provide an opportunity to introduce new work, or present radical opinions, and receive early feedback from the community. Contributions are welcome from both academia and industry.
  The goal of the Student Forum is to encourage students to attend EDCC 2012 and present their work, exchange ideas with researchers and practitioners, and get early feedback on their research efforts. All papers were peer-reviewed by at least three program committee members, and the authors were provided with detailed comments on their work. In the end we had one accepted paper for the Student forum.
