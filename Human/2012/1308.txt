On the Capacity of Interference Channel with Causal and Non-causal Generalized Feedback at the Cognitive Transmitter

In this paper, taking into account the effect of link delays, we investigate the capacity region of the Cognitive Interference Channel (C-IFC), where cognition can be obtained from either causal or non-causal generalized feedback. For this purpose, we introduce the Causal Cognitive Interference Channel With Delay (CC-IFC-WD) in which the cognitive user's transmission can depend on $L$ future received symbols as well as the past ones. We show that the CC-IFC-WD model is equivalent to a classical Causal C-IFC (CC-IFC) with link delays. Moreover, CC-IFC-WD extends both genie-aided and causal cognitive radio channels and bridges the gap between them. First, we derive an outer bound on the capacity region for the arbitrary value of $L$ and specialize this general outer bound to the strong interference case. Then, under strong interference conditions, we tighten the outer bound. To derive the achievable rate regions, we concentrate on three special cases: 1) Classical CC-IFC (L=0), 2) CC-IFC without delay (L=1), and 3) CC-IFC with unlimited look-ahead in which the cognitive user non-causally knows its entire received sequence. In each case, we obtain a new inner bound on the capacity region. Moreover, we show that the coding strategy which we use to derive an achievable rate region for the classical CC-IFC achieves the capacity for the classes of degraded and semi-deterministic classical CC-IFC under strong interference conditions. Furthermore, we extend our achievable rate regions to the Gaussian case. Providing some numerical examples for Gaussian CC-IFC-WD, we compare the performances of the different strategies and investigate the rate gain of the cognitive link for different delay values.
