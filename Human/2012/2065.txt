High performance computing network for cloud environment using simulators

Cloud computing is the next generation computing. Adopting the cloud computing is like signing up new form of a website. The GUI which controls the cloud computing make is directly control the hardware resource and your application. The difficulty part in cloud computing is to deploy in real environment. Its' difficult to know the exact cost and it's requirement until and unless we buy the service not only that whether it will support the existing application which is available on traditional data center or had to design a new application for the cloud computing environment. The security issue, latency, fault tolerance are some parameter which we need to keen care before deploying, all this we only know after deploying but by using simulation we can do the experiment before deploying it to real environment. By simulation we can understand the real environment of cloud computing and then after it successful result we can start deploying your application in cloud computing environment. By using the simulator it will save us lots of time and money.
