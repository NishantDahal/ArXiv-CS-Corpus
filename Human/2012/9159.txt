Aspects of Polar-Coded Modulation

We consider the joint design of polar coding and higher-order modulation schemes for ever increased spectral efficiency. The close connection between the polar code construction and the multi-level coding approach is described in detail. Relations between different modulation schemes such as bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) and multi-level coding (MLC) in case of polar-coded modulation as well as the influence of the applied labeling rule and the selection of frozen channels are demonstrated.
