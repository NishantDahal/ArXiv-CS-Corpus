An Effective Fingerprint Classification and Search Method

This paper presents an effective fingerprint classification method designed based on a hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique. The performance of the technique was evaluated in terms of several real-life datasets and a significant improvement in reducing the misclassification error has been noticed. This paper also presents a query based faster fingerprint search method over the clustered fingerprint databases. The retrieval accuracy of the search method has been found effective in light of several real-life databases.
