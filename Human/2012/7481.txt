Cyclic Association Rules Mining under Constraints

Several researchers have explored the temporal aspect of association rules mining. In this paper, we focus on the cyclic association rules, in order to discover correlations among items characterized by regular cyclic variation overtime. The overview of the state of the art has revealed the drawbacks of proposed algorithm literatures, namely the excessive number of generated rules which are not meeting the expert's expectations. To overcome these restrictions, we have introduced our approach dedicated to generate the cyclic association rules under constraints through a new method called Constraint-Based Cyclic Association Rules CBCAR. The carried out experiments underline the usefulness and the performance of our new approach.
