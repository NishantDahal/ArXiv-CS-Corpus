A Revision-Based Approach to Resolving Conflicting Information

In this paper, we propose a revision-based approach for conflict resolution by generalizing the Disjunctive Maxi-Adjustment (DMA) approach (Benferhat et al. 2004). Revision operators can be classified into two different families: the model-based ones and the formula-based ones. So the revision-based approach has two different versions according to which family of revision operators is chosen. Two particular revision operators are considered, one is the Dalal's revision operator, which is a model-based revision operator, and the other is the cardinality-maximal based revision operator, which is a formulabased revision operator. When the Dalal's revision operator is chosen, the revision-based approach is independent of the syntactic form in each stratum and it captures some notion of minimal change. When the cardinalitymaximal based revision operator is chosen, the revision-based approach is equivalent to the DMA approach. We also show that both approaches are computationally easier than the DMA approach.
