Design of wireless electronic stethoscope based on zigbee

Heart sound stethoscope is primary stage to access diseases. In this paper design of an electronic stethoscope with the functions of wireless transmission is discussed. This electronic stethoscope based on embedded processor. The data can be transmitted through wireless transmission using Zigbee module. A microphone is used to pick up the sound of the heart beat. Acoustic stethoscope can be changed into a digital stethoscope by inserting an electric capacity microphone into its head. The signal is processed and amplified to play with or without earphone. Heart sounds are processed, sampled and sent wirelessly using Zigbee module so that multiple doctors can do auscultation. PC connectivity is provided through serial port where from audio and video can be made available through LAN and internet for telemedicine consultation. Heart beat signals are sensed, sent, displayed, monitored, stored, reviewed, and analysed with ease.
