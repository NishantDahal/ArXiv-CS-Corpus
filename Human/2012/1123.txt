On the Degrees of Freedom of time correlated MISO broadcast channel with delayed CSIT

We consider the time correlated MISO broadcast channel where the transmitter has partial knowledge on the current channel state, in addition to delayed channel state information (CSI). Rather than exploiting only the current CSI, as the zero-forcing precoding, or only the delayed CSI, as the Maddah-Ali-Tse (MAT) scheme, we propose a seamless strategy that takes advantage of both. The achievable degrees of freedom of the proposed scheme is characterized in terms of the quality of the current channel knowledge.
