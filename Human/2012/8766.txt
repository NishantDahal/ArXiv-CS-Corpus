Self-dual Permutation Codes of Finite Groups in Semisimple Case

The existence and construction of self-dual codes in a permutation module of a finite group for the semisimple case are described from two aspects, one is from the point of view of the composition factors which are self-dual modules, the other one is from the point of view of the Galois group of the coefficient field.
