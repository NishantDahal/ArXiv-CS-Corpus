There is No Deadline - Time Evolution of Wikipedia Discussions

Wikipedia articles are by definition never finished: at any moment their content can be edited, or discussed in the associated talk pages. In this study we analyse the evolution of these discussions to unveil patterns of collective participation along the temporal dimension, and to shed light on the process of content creation on different topics. At a micro-scale, we investigate peaks in the discussion activity and we observe a non-trivial relationship with edit activity. At a larger scale, we introduce a measure to account for how fast discussions grow in complexity, and we find speeds that span three orders of magnitude for different articles. Our analysis should help the community in tasks such as early detection of controversies and assessment of discussion maturity.
