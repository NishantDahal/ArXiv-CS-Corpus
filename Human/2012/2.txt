Automating Open Fault Correction in Integrated Circuits via Field Induced Diffusion Limited Aggregation

We perform studies on electric field induced diffusion limited aggregation of conductive particles dispersed in a non conductive medium. The bridges formed across gaps between electrodes with an electric field in between due to the aggregation mechanism provides a means to automate the correction of open interconnect faults for integrated circuit application. We derive an expression for the bridging time and describe the mechanics of bridge formation with the above application in mind.
