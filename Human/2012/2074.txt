The Complexity of the Puzzles of Final Fantasy XIII-2

We analyze the computational complexity of solving the three "temporal rift" puzzles in the recent popular video game Final Fantasy XIII-2. We show that the Tile Trial puzzle is NP-hard and we provide an efficient algorithm for solving the Crystal Bonds puzzle. We also show that slight generalizations of the Crystal Bonds and Hands of Time puzzles are NP-hard.
