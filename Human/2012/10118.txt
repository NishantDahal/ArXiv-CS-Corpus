Beamforming Techniques for Multichannel audio Signal Separation

Beamforming is a signal processing technique. It has been studied in many areas such as radar, sonar, seismology and wireless communications, to name but a few. It can be used for a myriad of purposes, such as detecting the presence of a signal, estimating the direction of arrival, and enhancing a desired signal from its measurements corrupted by noise, competing sources and reverberation. Actually, Beamforming has been adopted by the audio research society, mostly to separate or extract speech for noisy environment. Beamforming techniques basically approach the problem from a spatial point of view. A microphone array is used to form a spatial filter which can extract a signal from a specific direction and reduce the contamination of signals from other directions. In this paper we survey some Beamforming techniques used for multichannel audio signal separation.
