Modulation Diversity for Spatial Modulation Using Complex Interleaved Orthogonal Design

In this paper, we propose modulation diversity techniques for Spatial Modulation (SM) system using Complex Interleaved Orthogonal Design (CIOD) meant for two transmit antennas. Specifically, we show that by using the CIOD for two transmit antenna system, the standard SM scheme, where only one transmit antenna is activated in any symbol duration, can achieve a transmit diversity order of two. We show with our simulation results that the proposed schemes offer transmit diversity order of two, and hence, give a better Symbol Error Rate performance than the SM scheme with transmit diversity order of one.
