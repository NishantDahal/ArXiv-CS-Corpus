A General Form of Attribute Exploration

We present a general form of attribute exploration, a knowledge completion algorithm from Formal Concept Analysis. The aim of our presentation is not only to extend the applicability of attribute exploration by a general description. It may also allow to view different existing variants of attribute exploration as instances of a general form, which may simplify theoretical considerations.
