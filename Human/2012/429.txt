Secure SQL Server - Enabling Secure Access to Remote Relational Data

The Secure SQL Server - SecSS, is a technology primarily developed to enable self-service governance of states, as described in (Paulin 2012). Self-service governance is a novel model of governance that rejects service-based public administration and instead proposes that governed subjects manage their legal relations in a self-service manner, based on ad-hoc determination of eligibilities. In this article we describe the prototype SecSS and its evaluation in a complex governmental scenario.
