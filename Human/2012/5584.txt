Pareto Local Optima of Multiobjective NK-Landscapes with Correlated Objectives

In this paper, we conduct a fitness landscape analysis for multiobjective combinatorial optimization, based on the local optima of multiobjective NK-landscapes with objective correlation. In single-objective optimization, it has become clear that local optima have a strong impact on the performance of metaheuristics. Here, we propose an extension to the multiobjective case, based on the Pareto dominance. We study the co-influence of the problem dimension, the degree of non-linearity, the number of objectives and the correlation degree between objective functions on the number of Pareto local optima.
