The model of information retrieval based on the theory of hypercomplex numerical systems

The paper provided a description of a new model of information retrieval, which is an extension of vector-space model and is based on the principles of the theory of hypercomplex numerical systems. The model allows to some extent realize the idea of fuzzy search and allows you to apply in practice the model of information retrieval practical developments in the field of hypercomplex numerical systems.
