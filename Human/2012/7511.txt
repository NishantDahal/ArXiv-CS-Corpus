A short note on the kissing number of the lattice in Gaussian wiretap coding

We show that on an $n=24m+8k$-dimensional even unimodular lattice, if the shortest vector length is $\geq 2m$, then as the number of vectors of length $2m$ decreases, the secrecy gain increases. We will also prove a similar result on general unimodular lattices. Furthermore, assuming the conjecture by Belfiore and Sol√©, we will calculate the difference between inverses of secrecy gains as the number of vectors varies. Finally, we will show by an example that there exist two lattices in the same dimension with the same shortest vector length and the same kissing number, but different secrecy gains.
