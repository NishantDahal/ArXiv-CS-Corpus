Teacher Module in an Assistance Tool - Adaptating a device to a teaching context and and teacher's preferences

This communication presents the genesis and the implementation of a teacher module, which is included in an Assistance Tool (AT). The teacher module is based on a teacher model for which we did a thorough analysis of the state of the art. The aim of the AT is to help a teacher to design pedagogical devices. Teachers can formulate their needs (assistance in the design) and the AT can relieve them from repetitive tasks related to the deployment of a teaching device (assistance in the deployment).
