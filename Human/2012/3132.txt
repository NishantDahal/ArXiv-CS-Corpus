TSET: Token based Secure Electronic Transaction

Security and trust are the most important factors in online transaction, this paper introduces TSET a Token based Secure Electronic Transaction which is an improvement over the existing SET, Secure Electronic Transaction protocol. We take the concept of tokens in the TSET protocol to provide end to end security. It also provides trust evaluation mechanism so that trustworthiness of the merchants can be known by customers before being involved in the transaction. Moreover, we also propose a grading mechanism so that quality of service in the transactions improves.
