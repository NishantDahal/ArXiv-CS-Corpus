Vibrotactile Stimulus Frequency Optimization for the Haptic BCI Prototype

The paper presents results from a psychophysical study conducted to optimize vibrotactile stimuli delivered to subject finger tips in order to evoke the somatosensory responses to be utilized next in a haptic brain computer interface (hBCI) paradigm. We also present the preliminary EEG evoked responses for the chosen stimulating frequency. The obtained results confirm our hypothesis that the hBCI paradigm concept is valid and it will allow for rapid stimuli presentation in order to improve information-transfer-rate (ITR) of the BCI.
