Localisation of Numerical Date Field in an Indian Handwritten Document

This paper describes a method to localise all those areas which may constitute the date field in an Indian handwritten document. Spatial patterns of the date field are studied from various handwritten documents and an algorithm is developed through statistical analysis to identify those sets of connected components which may constitute the date. Common date patterns followed in India are considered to classify the date formats in different classes. Reported results demonstrate promising performance of the proposed approach
