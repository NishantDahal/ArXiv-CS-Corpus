Geometric Separation by Single-Pass Alternating Thresholding

Modern data is customarily of multimodal nature, and analysis tasks typically require separation into the single components. Although a highly ill-posed problem, the morphological difference of these components sometimes allow a very precise separation such as, for instance, in neurobiological imaging a separation into spines (pointlike structures) and dendrites (curvilinear structures). Recently, applied harmonic analysis introduced powerful methodologies to achieve this task, exploiting specifically designed representation systems in which the components are sparsely representable, combined with either performing $\ell_1$ minimization or thresholding on the combined dictionary.
  In this paper we provide a thorough theoretical study of the separation of a distributional model situation of point- and curvilinear singularities exploiting a surprisingly simple single-pass alternating thresholding method applied to the two complementary frames: wavelets and curvelets. Utilizing the fact that the coefficients are clustered geometrically, thereby exhibiting clustered/geometric sparsity in the chosen frames, we prove that at sufficiently fine scales arbitrarily precise separation is possible. Even more surprising, it turns out that the thresholding index sets converge to the wavefront sets of the point- and curvilinear singularities in phase space and that those wavefront sets are perfectly separated by the thresholding procedure. Main ingredients of our analysis are the novel notion of cluster coherence and clustered/geometric sparsity as well as a microlocal analysis viewpoint.
