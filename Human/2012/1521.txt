MIMO Z Channel Interference Management

MIMO Z Channel is investigated in this paper. We focus on how to tackle the interference when different users try to send their codewords to their corresponding receivers while only one user will cause interference to the other. We assume there are two transmitters and two receivers each with two antennas. We propose a strategy to remove the interference while allowing different users transmit at the same time. Our strategy is low-complexity while the performance is good. Mathematical analysis is provided and simulations are given based on our system.
