Decomposition of Kolmogorov Complexity And Link To Geometry

A link between Kolmogorov Complexity and geometry is uncovered. A similar concept of projection and vector decomposition is described for Kolmogorov Complexity. By using a simple approximation to the Kolmogorov Complexity, coded in Mathematica, the derived formulas are tested and used to study the geometry of Light Cone.
