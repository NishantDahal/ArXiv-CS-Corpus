Fixed Interfaces, Adaptive Interfaces... What is next? Total movability - a new paradigm for the user interface

Users can't talk with computers in their natural language (machine codes), so there are interfaces that allow such communication. 40 years ago the outcome of computer programs was in the form of long listings covered by numbers and even the format of those numbers was determined by developers. Throughout the latest 25 years: program views and results are shown in a wide variety of shapes and variants, but all these possibilities are predefined and fixed in code by developers; nothing outside of their approved solutions is allowed. My vision from now on into the future: developers are responsible only for correct work of a program (calculations, link with the database, etc.) and suggest a good default interface, but not determine all possible scenarios; only users decide WHAT, WHEN, and HOW to show. This will be a revolution in our dealing with computers, but there are obvious questions. How this step can be made? Do all users need such change? Is it going to be a burden for users or a welcome revolution?
