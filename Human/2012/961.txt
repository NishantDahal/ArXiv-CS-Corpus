They Know Where You Live!

In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of predicting people's hometowns by using their geotagged photos posted on Flickr website. We employ Kruskal's algorithm to cluster photos taken by a user and predict the user's hometown. Our results prove that using social profiles of photographers allows researchers to predict the locations of their taken photos with higher accuracies. This in return can improve the previous methods which were purely based on visual features of photos \cite{Hays:im2gps}.
