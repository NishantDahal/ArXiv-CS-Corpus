Efficient parallel algorithms for tandem queueing system simulation

Parallel algorithms designed for simulation and performance evaluation of single-server tandem queueing systems with both infinite and finite buffers are presented. The algorithms exploit a simple computational procedure based on recursive equations as a representation of system dynamics. A brief analysis of the performance of the algorithms are given to show that they involve low time and memory requirements.
