An Entertaining Example of Using the Concepts of Context-Free Grammar and Pushdown Automation

A formal-linguistic approach for solving an entertaining task is made in this paper. The well-known task of the Hanoi towers is discussed in relation to some concepts of discrete mathematics. A context-free grammar which generate an algorithm for solving this task is described. A deterministic pushdown automation which in its work imitates the work of monks in solving the task of the Hanoi towers is built.
