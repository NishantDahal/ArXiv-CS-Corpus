Some bounds on the size of codes

We present some upper bounds on the size of non-linear codes and their restriction to systematic codes and linear codes. These bounds are independent of other known theoretical bounds, e.g. the Griesmer bound, the Johnson bound or the Plotkin bound, and one of these is actually an improvement of a bound by Litsyn and Laihonen. Our experiments show that in some cases (the majority of cases for some q) our bounds provide the best value, compared to all other theoretical bounds.
