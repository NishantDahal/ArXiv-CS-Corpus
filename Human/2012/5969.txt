Super-Mixed Multiple Attribute Group Decision Making Method Based on Hybrid Fuzzy Grey Relation Approach Degree

The feature of our method different from other fuzzy grey relation method for supermixed multiple attribute group decision-making is that all of the subjective and objective weights are obtained by interval grey number and that the group decisionmaking is performed based on the relative approach degree of grey TOPSIS, the relative approach degree of grey incidence and the relative membership degree of grey incidence using 4-dimensional Euclidean distance. The weighted Borda method is used to obtain final rank by using the results of four methods. An example shows the applicability of the proposed approach.
