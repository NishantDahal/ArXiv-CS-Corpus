A partial order structure on interval orders

We introduce a partial order structure on the set of interval orders of a given size, and prove that such a structure is in fact a lattice. We also provide a way to compute meet and join inside this lattice. Finally, we show that, if we restrict to series parallel interval order, what we obtain is the classical Tamari poset.
