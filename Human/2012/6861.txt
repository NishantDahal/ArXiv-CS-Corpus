Design For Change: Information-Centric Architecture to Support Agile Disaster Response

This paper presents a case for the adoption of an information-centric architecture for a global disaster management system. Drawing from a case study of the 2010/2011 Queensland floods, we describe the challenges in providing every participant with relevant and actionable information. We use various examples to argue for a more flexible information dissemination framework which is designed from the ground up to minimise the effort needed to fix the unexpected and unavoidable information acquisition, quality, and dissemination challenges posed by any real disaster.
