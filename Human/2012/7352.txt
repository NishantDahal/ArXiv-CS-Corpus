A Model of Decision-Making in Groups of Humans

Decisions by humans depend on their estimations given some uncertain sensory data. These decisions can also be influenced by the behavior of others. Here we present a mathematical model to quantify this influence, inviting a further study on the cognitive consequences of social information. We also expect that the present model can be used for a better understanding of the neural circuits implicated in social processing.
