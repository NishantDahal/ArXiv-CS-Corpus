Graphic lambda calculus and knot diagrams

In arXiv:1207.0332 [cs.LO] was proposed a graphic lambda calculus formalism, which has sectors corresponding to untyped lambda calculus and emergent algebras.
  Here we explore the sector covering knot diagrams, which are constructed as macros over the graphic lambda calculus.
