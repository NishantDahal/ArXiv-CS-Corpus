Bond percolation on a class of correlated and clustered random graphs

We introduce a formalism for computing bond percolation properties of a class of correlated and clustered random graphs. This class of graphs is a generalization of the Configuration Model where nodes of different types are connected via different types of hyperedges, edges that can link more than 2 nodes. We argue that the multitype approach coupled with the use of clustered hyperedges can reproduce a wide spectrum of complex patterns, and thus enhances our capability to model real complex networks. As an illustration of this claim, we use our formalism to highlight unusual behaviors of the size and composition of the components (small and giant) in a synthetic, albeit realistic, social network.
