Topological Features of Online Social Networks

The importance of modeling and analyzing Social Networks is a consequence of the success of Online Social Networks during last years. Several models of networks have been proposed, reflecting the different characteristics of Social Networks. Some of them fit better to model specific phenomena, such as the growth and the evolution of the Social Networks; others are more appropriate to capture the topological characteristics of the networks. Because these networks show unique and different properties and features, in this work we describe and exploit several models in order to capture the structure of popular Online Social Networks, such as Arxiv, Facebook, Wikipedia and YouTube. Our experimentation aims at verifying the structural characteristics of these networks, in order to understand what model better depicts their structure, and to analyze the inner community structure, to illustrate how members of these Online Social Networks interact and group together into smaller communities.
