Designing of RF Single Balanced Mixer with a 65nm CMOS Technology Dedicated to Low Power Consumption Wireless Applications

The present work consists of designing a Single Balanced Mixer(SBM) with the 65 nm CMOS technology, this for a 1.9 GHz RF channel, dedicated to wireless applications. This paper shows; the polarization chosen for this structure, models of evaluating parameters of the mixer, then simulation of the circuit in 65nm CMOS technology and comparison with previously treated. Keywords: SBM Mixer, Radio Frequency, 65 nm CMOS Technology, Non-Linearity, Power Consumption.
