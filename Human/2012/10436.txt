Coevolving Cellular Automata with Memory for Chemical Computing: Boolean Logic Gates in the B-Z Reaction

We propose that the behaviour of non-linear media can be controlled automatically through coevolutionary systems. By extension, forms of unconventional computing, i.e., massively parallel non-linear computers, can be realised by such an approach. In this study a light-sensitive sub-excitable Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is controlled using various heterogeneous cellular automata. A checkerboard image comprising of varying light intensity cells is projected onto the surface of a catalyst-loaded gel resulting in rich spatio-temporal chemical wave behaviour. The coevolved cellular automata are shown to be able to control chemical activity through dynamic control of the light intensity. The approach is demonstrated through the creation of a number of simple Boolean logic gates.
