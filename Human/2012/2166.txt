Towards Electronic Shopping of Composite Product

In the paper, frameworks for electronic shopping of composite (modular) products are described: (a) multicriteria selection (product is considered as a whole system, it is a traditional approach), (b) combinatorial synthesis (composition) of the product from its components, (c) aggregation of the product from several selected products/prototypes. The following product model is examined: (i) general tree-like structure, (ii) set of system parts/components (leaf nodes), (iii) design alternatives (DAs) for each component, (iv) ordinal priorities for DAs, and (v) estimates of compatibility between DAs for different components. The combinatorial synthesis is realized as morphological design of a composite (modular) product or an extended composite product (e.g., product and support services as financial instruments). Here the solving process is based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD): (i) multicriteria selection of alternatives for system parts, (ii) composing the selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account ordinal quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility). The aggregation framework is based on consideration of aggregation procedures, for example: (i) addition procedure: design of a products substructure or an extended substructure ('kernel') and addition of elements, and (ii) design procedure: design of the composite solution based on all elements of product superstructure. Applied numerical examples (e.g., composite product, extended composite product, product repair plan, and product trajectory) illustrate the proposed approaches.
