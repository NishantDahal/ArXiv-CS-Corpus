A Metric for the Activeness of a Distributed Object Oriented Component Library

This paper makes an attempt to analyze the Activeness of a Distributed Object Oriented Component Library and develops a software metric called Distributed Component Activeness Quotient which is defined as the degree of readiness of a DOOCL. The advantages of the DCAQ include a possible comparison between various DOOCLs leading to selection of the best DOOCL for use during the development task, and providing a measure for gauging the usefulness of the DOOCL as indicated by the value of the DCAQ. The disadvantage of the DCAQ is that it may have some error because of its subjective and random nature. The Stability of a DOOCL is another characteristic which is indicated by the DCAQ. The greater the value of the DCAQ, greater will be the stability of the corresponding DOOCL.
