Low Cost PC Based Real Time Data Logging System Using PCs Parallel Port For Slowly Varying Signals

A low cost PC based real time data logging system can be used in the laboratories for the measurement, monitoring and storage of the data for slowly varying signals in science and engineering stream. This can be designed and interfaced to the PCs Parallel Port, which is common to all desktop computers or Personal Computers (PCs). By the use of this data logging system one can monitor, measure and store data for slowly varying signals, which is hard to visualise the signal waveforms by ordinary CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope) and DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope). The data so stored can be used for further study and analysis. It can be used for a wide range of applications to monitor and store data of temperature, humidity, light intensity, ECG signals etc. with proper signal conditioning circuitry.
