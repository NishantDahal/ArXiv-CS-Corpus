Estimates on the Size of Symbol Weight Codes

The study of codes for powerlines communication has garnered much interest over the past decade. Various types of codes such as permutation codes, frequency permutation arrays, and constant composition codes have been proposed over the years. In this work we study a type of code called the bounded symbol weight codes which was first introduced by Versfeld et al. in 2005, and a related family of codes that we term constant symbol weight codes. We provide new upper and lower bounds on the size of bounded symbol weight and constant symbol weight codes. We also give direct and recursive constructions of codes for certain parameters.
