Dependability-Explicit Engineering with Event-B: Overview of Recent Achievements

Event-B has been actively used within the EU Deploy project to model dependable systems from various application domains. As a result, we have created a number of formal approaches to explicitly reason about dependability in the refinement process. In this paper we overview the work on formal engineering of dependable systems carried out in the Deploy project. We outline our approaches to integrating safety analysis into the development process, modelling fault tolerant systems and probabilistic dependability evaluation. We discuss achievements and challenges in development of dependable systems within the Event-B framework.
