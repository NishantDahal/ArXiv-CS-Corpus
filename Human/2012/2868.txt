Feature Extraction Methods for Color Image Similarity

Many User interactive systems are proposed all methods are trying to implement as a user friendly and various approaches proposed but most of the systems not reached to the use specifications like user friendly systems with user interest, all proposed method implemented basic techniques some are improved methods also propose but not reaching to the user specifications. In this proposed paper we concentrated on image retrieval system with in early days many user interactive systems performed with basic concepts but such systems are not reaching to the user specifications and not attracted to the user so a lot of research interest in recent years with new specifications, recent approaches have user is interested in friendly interacted methods are expecting, many are concentrated for improvement in all methods. In this proposed system we focus on the retrieval of images within a large image collection based on color projections and different mathematical approaches are introduced and applied for retrieval of images. before Appling proposed methods images are sub grouping using threshold values, in this paper R G B color combinations considered for retrieval of images, in proposed methods are implemented and results are included, through results it is observed that we obtaining efficient results comparatively previous and existing.
