Temporal Psychovisual Modulation: a new paradigm of information display

We report on a new paradigm of information display that greatly extends the utility and versatility of current optoelectronic displays. The main innovation is to let a display of high refresh rate optically broadcast so-called atom frames, which are designed through non-negative matrix factorization to form bases for a class of images, and different viewers perceive selfintended images by using display-synchronized viewing devices and their own human visual systems to fuse appropriately weighted atom frames. This work is essentially a scheme of temporal psychovisual modulation in visible spectrum, using an optoelectronic modulator coupled with a biological demodulator.
