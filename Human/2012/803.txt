Stochastic-Based Pattern Recognition Analysis

In this work we review the basic principles of stochastic logic and propose its application to probabilistic-based pattern-recognition analysis. The proposed technique is intrinsically a parallel comparison of input data to various pre-stored categories using Bayesian techniques. We design smart pulse-based stochastic-logic blocks to provide an efficient pattern recognition analysis. The proposed rchitecture is applied to a specific navigation problem. The resulting system is orders of magnitude faster than processor-based solutions.
