Evaluation of the Causal Effect of Control Plans in Nonrecursive Structural Equation Models

When observational data is available from practical studies and a directed cyclic graph for how various variables affect each other is known based on substantive understanding of the process, we consider a problem in which a control plan of a treatment variable is conducted in order to bring a response variable close to a target value with variation reduction. We formulate an optimal control plan concerning a certain treatment variable through path coefficients in the framework of linear nonrecursive structural equation models. Based on the formulation, we clarify the properties of causal effects when conducting a control plan. The results enable us to evaluate the effect of a control plan on the variance from observational data.
