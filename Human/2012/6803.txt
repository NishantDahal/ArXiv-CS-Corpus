Discovery of Malicious Attacks to Improve Mobile Collaborative Learning (MCL)

Mobile collaborative learning (MCL) is highly acknowledged and focusing paradigm in eductional institutions and several organizations across the world. It exhibits intellectual synergy of various combined minds to handle the problem and stimulate the social activity of mutual understanding. To improve and foster the baseline of MCL, several supporting architectures, frameworks including number of the mobile applications have been introduced. Limited research was reported that particularly focuses to enhance the security of those pardigms and provide secure MCL to users. The paper handles the issue of rogue DHCP server that affects and disrupts the network resources during the MCL. The rogue DHCP is unauthorized server that releases the incorrect IP address to users and sniffs the traffic illegally. The contribution specially provides the privacy to users and enhances the security aspects of mobile supported collaborative framework (MSCF). The paper introduces multi-frame signature-cum anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (MSAIDS) supported with novel algorithms through addition of new rules in IDS and mathematcal model. The major target of contribution is to detect the malicious attacks and blocks the illegal activities of rogue DHCP server. This innovative security mechanism reinforces the confidence of users, protects network from illicit intervention and restore the privacy of users. Finally, the paper validates the idea through simulation and compares the findings with other existing techniques.
