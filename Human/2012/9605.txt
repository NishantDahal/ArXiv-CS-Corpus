An ICT Enhanced Life Quality for the Elderly in Developing Countries: Analysis Study Applied to Sri Lanka

In the recent years, the entire world has seen a tremendous increase in the elderly population. Even though countries differ in the numerical criterion for defining the old age, the UN has agreed that the cutoff of 60+ years refers to the older population. When the percentage of older population increases in a country, the country faces new challenges in the form of economical as well as social impacts. The economic impacts are felt in the form of a shortfall in labor supply, income, household savings while an increase in the payment of retirement benefits and healthcare expenditures. On the social side, the elderly population feels continuously isolated due to the changes in the value system. The United Nations has identified five quality of life characteristics for the elderly in its 1991 resolution named the United Nations Principles for Older Persons. In this paper the authors initially look at the trends in the increase of aged population in Asia in general and Sri Lanka in particular. Then they discuss how the quality of life characteristics can be achieved in a cost effective way through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The authors take an in depth look at the recent developments in field of ICT and its penetration in developing countries especially Sri Lanka with special emphasis to constraints and challenges in adopting ICT for the improving the quality of life of elderly.
