A Novel Technique for Secret Message / Image Transmission through (2, 2)Visual Cryptographic Protocol (SMITVCP)

In this paper a secret message/image transmission technique has been proposed through (2, 2) visual cryptographic share which is non-interpretable in general. A binary image is taken as cover image and authenticating message/image has been fabricated into it through a hash function where two bits in each pixel within four bits from LSB of the pixel is embedded and as a result it converts the binary image to gray scale one. (2,2) visual cryptographic shares are generated from this converted gray scale image. During decoding shares are combined to regenerate the authenticated image from where the secret message/image is obtained through the same hash function along with reduction of noise. Noise reduction is also done on regenerated authenticated image to regenerate original cover image at destination.
