A Hybrid Bacterial Foraging Algorithm For Solving Job Shop Scheduling Problems

Bio-Inspired computing is the subset of Nature-Inspired computing. Job Shop Scheduling Problem is categorized under popular scheduling problems. In this research work, Bacterial Foraging Optimization was hybridized with Ant Colony Optimization and a new technique Hybrid Bacterial Foraging Optimization for solving Job Shop Scheduling Problem was proposed. The optimal solutions obtained by proposed Hybrid Bacterial Foraging Optimization algorithms are much better when compared with the solutions obtained by Bacterial Foraging Optimization algorithm for well-known test problems of different sizes. From the implementation of this research work, it could be observed that the proposed Hybrid Bacterial Foraging Optimization was effective than Bacterial Foraging Optimization algorithm in solving Job Shop Scheduling Problems. Hybrid Bacterial Foraging Optimization is used to implement real world Job Shop Scheduling Problems.
