Improved Channel Estimation Methods based on PN sequence for TDS-OFDM

An accurate channel estimation is crucial for the novel time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) scheme in which pseudo noise (PN) sequences serve as both guard intervals (GI) for OFDM data symbols and training sequences for synchronization/channel estimation. This paper studies the channel estimation method based on the cross-correlation of PN sequences. A theoretical analysis of this estimator is conducted and several improved estimators are then proposed to reduce the estimation error floor encountered by the PN-correlation-based estimator. It is shown through mathematical derivations and simulations that the new estimators approach or even achieve the Cramer-Rao bound.
