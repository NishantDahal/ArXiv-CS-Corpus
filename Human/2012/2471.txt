FuGeIDS: Fuzzy Genetic paradigms in Intrusion Detection Systems

With the increase in the number of security threats, Intrusion Detection Systems have evolved as a significant countermeasure against these threats. And as such, the topic of Intrusion Detection Systems has become one of the most prominent research topics in recent years. This paper gives an overview of the Intrusion Detection System and looks at two major machine learning paradigms used in Intrusion Detection System, Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Logic and how to apply them for intrusion detection.
