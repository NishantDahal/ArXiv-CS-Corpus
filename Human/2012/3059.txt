Mitigating Timing Errors in Time-Interleaved ADCs: a signal conditioning approach

Novel techniques based on signal-conditioning are presented to mitigate timing errors in time-interleaved ADCs. A theoretical bound on the achievable spurious signal content, on applying the techniques, is also derived. Behavioral simulations corroborating the same are presented.
