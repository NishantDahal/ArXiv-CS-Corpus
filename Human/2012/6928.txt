Triggercast: Enabling Wireless Collisions Constructive

It is generally considered that concurrent transmissions should be avoided in order to reduce collisions in wireless sensor networks. Constructive interference (CI) envisions concurrent transmissions to positively interfere at the receiver. CI potentially allows orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumptions and improvements on link quality. In this paper, we theoretically introduce a sufficient condition to construct CI with IEEE 802.15.4 radio for the first time. Moreover, we propose Triggercast, a distributed middleware, and show it is feasible to generate CI in TMote Sky sensor nodes. To synchronize transmissions of multiple senders at the chip level, Triggercast effectively compensates propagation and radio processing delays, and has $95^{th}$ percentile synchronization errors of at most 250ns. Triggercast also intelligently decides which co-senders to participate in simultaneous transmissions, and aligns their transmission time to maximize the overall link PRR, under the condition of maximal system robustness. Extensive experiments in real testbeds reveal that Triggercast significantly improves PRR from 5% to 70% with 7 concurrent senders. We also demonstrate that Triggercast provides on average $1.3\times$ PRR performance gains, when integrated with existing data forwarding protocols.
