New Technique for Proposing Network's Topology using GPS and GIS

The problem of proposed topology for network comes when using Prim's algorithm with default distance (unrealistic distances) between network's nodes and don't care about the lakes, high hills, buildings, etc. This problem will cause incorrect estimations for cost (budget) of requirements like the media (optic fibre) and the number or type of Access-points, regenerator, Optic Amplifier, etc. This paper proposed a new technique of implementing Prim's algorithm to obtain realistic topology using realistic distances between network's nodes via Global Positioning System GPS and Geographic Information Systems GIS packages. Applying the new technique on academic institutes network of Erbil city from view of media (optic fibre) shows that there is disability in cost (budget) of the media which is needed (nearly) 4 times if implement default Prim's algorithm (don't using GPS & GIS) base on unrealistic distances between the nodes.
