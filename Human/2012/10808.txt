Linear Nearest Neighbor Synthesis of Reversible Circuits by Graph Partitioning

Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) synthesis in reversible circuits has emerged as an important issue in terms of technological implementation for quantum computation. The objective is to obtain a LNN architecture with minimum gate cost. As achieving optimal synthesis is a hard problem, heuristic methods have been proposed in recent literature. In this work we present a graph partitioning based approach for LNN synthesis with reduction in circuit cost. In particular, the number of SWAP gates required to convert a given gate-level quantum circuit to its equivalent LNN configuration is minimized. Our algorithm determines the reordering of indices of the qubit line(s) for both single control and multiple controlled gates. Experimental results for placing the target qubits of Multiple Controlled Toffoli (MCT) library of benchmark circuits show a significant reduction in gate count and quantum gate cost compared to those of related research works.
