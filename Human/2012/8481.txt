Sample-efficient Nonstationary Policy Evaluation for Contextual Bandits

We present and prove properties of a new offline policy evaluator for an exploration learning setting which is superior to previous evaluators. In particular, it simultaneously and correctly incorporates techniques from importance weighting, doubly robust evaluation, and nonstationary policy evaluation approaches. In addition, our approach allows generating longer histories by careful control of a bias-variance tradeoff, and further decreases variance by incorporating information about randomness of the target policy. Empirical evidence from synthetic and realworld exploration learning problems shows the new evaluator successfully unifies previous approaches and uses information an order of magnitude more efficiently.
