Universality of One-Dimensional Reversible and Number-Conserving Cellular Automata

We study one-dimensional reversible and number-conserving  cellular automata (RNCCA) that have both properties of  reversibility and number-conservation.  In the case of 2-neighbor RNCCA, Garc√≠a-Ramos proved  that every RNCCA shows trivial behavior in the sense that  all the signals in the RNCCA do not interact each other.  However, if we increase the neighborhood size, we can  find many complex RNCCAs.  Here, we show that for any one-dimensional 2-neighbor reversible  partitioned CA (RPCA) with s states, we can construct   a 4-neighbor RNCCA with 4s states that simulates the former.  Since it is known that there is a computationally universal  24-state 2-neighbor RPCA, we obtain a universal 96-state  4-neighbor RNCCA.
