Preference-based Graphic Models for Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a very useful general technique for exploiting the     preference patterns of a group of users to predict the utility of items to a     particular user. Previous research has studied several probabilistic graphic     models for collaborative filtering with promising results. However, while these     models have succeeded in capturing the similarity among users and items in one     way or the other, none of them has considered the fact that users with similar     interests in items can have very different rating patterns; some users tend to     assign a higher rating to all items than other users. In this paper, we propose     and study of two new graphic models that address the distinction between user     preferences and ratings. In one model, called the decoupled model, we introduce     two different variables to decouple a users preferences FROM his ratings. IN the other, called the preference model,     we model the orderings OF items preferred BY a USER,     rather than the USERs numerical ratings of items.     Empirical study over two datasets of movie ratings shows that appropriate     modeling of the distinction between user preferences and ratings improves the     performance substantially and consistently. Specifically, the proposed     decoupled model outperforms all five existing approaches that we compare with     significantly, but the preference model is not very successful. These results     suggest that explicit modeling of the underlying user preferences is very     important for collaborative filtering, but we can not afford ignoring the     rating information completely.
