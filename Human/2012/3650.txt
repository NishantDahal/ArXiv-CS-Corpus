Community-Quality-Based Player Ranking in Collaborative Games with no Explicit Objectives

Player ranking can be used to determine the quality of the contributions of a player to a collaborative community. However, collaborative games with no explicit objectives do not support player ranking, as there is no metric to measure the quality of player contributions. An implicit objective of such communities is not being disruptive towards other players. In this paper, we propose a parameterizable approach for real-time player ranking in collaborative games with no explicit objectives. Our method computes a ranking by applying a simple heuristic community quality function. We also demonstrate the capabilities of our approach by applying several parameterizations of it to a case study and comparing the obtained results.
