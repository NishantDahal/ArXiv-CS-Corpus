Arabic CALL system based on pedagogically indexed text

This article introduces the benefits of using computer as a tool for foreign language teaching and learning. It describes the effect of using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for learning Arabic. The technique explored in this particular case is the employment of pedagogically indexed corpora. This text-based method provides the teacher the advantage of building activities based on texts adapted to a particular pedagogical situation. This paper also presents ARAC: a Platform dedicated to language educators allowing them to create activities within their own pedagogical area of interest.
