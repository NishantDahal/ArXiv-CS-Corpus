Coded Path Protection Part 2: Design, Implementation, and Performance

In Part 1 of this paper, we introduced a coding-based proactive network protection scheme, named Coded Path Protection (CPP). In CPP, a backup stream of the primary data is encoded with other data streams, resulting in capacity savings. In addition to being a systematic approach of building valid coding structures, CPP is an optimal and simple capacity placement and coding group formation algorithm. It converts the sharing structure of any solution of a Shared Path Protection (SPP) technique into a coding structure with minimum extra capacity. In this Part 2 of the paper, we describe the implementation of our algorithm using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), its timing and synchronization requirements, and implementation issues in networks. We present simulation results which confirm that CPP provides faster link failure recovery than SPP while it incurs marginal extra capacity beyond that of SPP.
