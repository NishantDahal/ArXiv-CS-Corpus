Interroom radiative couplings through windows and large openings in buildings: Proposal of a simplified model

A simplified model of indoor short wave radiation couplings adapted to multi-zone simulations is proposed, thanks to a simplifying hypothesis and to the introduction of an indoor short wave exchange matrix. The specific properties of this matrix appear useful to quantify the thermal radiation exchanges between the zones separated by windows or large openings. Integrated in CODYRUN software, this module is detailed and compared to experimental measurements carried out on a real scale tropical building.
