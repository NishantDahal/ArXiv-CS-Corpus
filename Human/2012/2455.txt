Interval-valued fuzzy graphs

We define the Cartesian product, composition, union and join on interval-valued fuzzy graphs and investigate some of their properties. We also introduce the notion of interval-valued fuzzy complete graphs and present some properties of self complementary and self weak complementary interval-valued fuzzy complete graphs.
