Probabilistic Reasoning about Actions in Nonmonotonic Causal Theories

We present the language {m P}{cal C}+ for probabilistic reasoning about actions, which is a generalization of the action language {cal C}+ that allows to deal with probabilistic as well as nondeterministic effects of actions. We define a formal semantics of {m P}{cal C}+ in terms of probabilistic transitions between sets of states. Using a concept of a history and its belief state, we then show how several important problems in reasoning about actions can be concisely formulated in our formalism.
