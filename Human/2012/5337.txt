Vérification d'assemblages de composants logiciels : Application aux modèles de composants UML2.0 et Ugatze

The component approach aims for the reuse by a coherent and easy components assembly. But obtaining a coherent components assembly is not an easy exercise. To achieve this, we advocate a contractual approach distinguishing different syntactic, structural, semantic, synchronization and service quality contracts. We have successfully applied this approach on two models of semi-formal contractual components: UML2.0 and Ugatze. Indeed, we propose two approaches: VerifComponentUML2.0 and VerifComponentUgatze. The VerifComponentUML2.0 approach aims the verification of syntactic, structural, synchronization and quality service contracts on a UML2.0 component assembly through two formal component models Acme/Armani and Wright. VerifComponentUML2.0 has two tools: Wr2fdr and Wright2Ada. The tool Wr2fdr allows translating Wright expression to CSP contracts in order to verify synchronization using the model checker FDR. It is a IDM tool Wright2Ada which allow is transforming Wright code to Ada, in order to open UML2.0 on static analysis and dynamic tools associated with Ada. VerifComponentUgatze approach provides a frame allowing to check syntactic and structural contracts of an Ugatze component assembly through Acme/Armani.
