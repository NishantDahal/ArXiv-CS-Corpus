Local Rules for Computable Planar Tilings

Aperiodic tilings are non-periodic tilings characterized by local constraints. They play a key role in the proof of the undecidability of the domino problem (1964) and naturally model quasicrystals (discovered in 1982). A central question is to characterize, among a class of non-periodic tilings, the aperiodic ones. In this paper, we answer this question for the well-studied class of non-periodic tilings obtained by digitizing irrational vector spaces. Namely, we prove that such tilings are aperiodic if and only if the digitized vector spaces are computable.
