Join-graph based cost-shifting schemes

We develop several algorithms taking advantage of two common approaches for bounding MPE queries in graphical models: minibucket elimination and message-passing updates for linear programming relaxations. Both methods are quite similar, and offer useful perspectives for the other; our hybrid approaches attempt to balance the advantages of each. We demonstrate the power of our hybrid algorithms through extensive empirical evaluation. Most notably, a Branch and Bound search guided by the heuristic function calculated by one of our new algorithms has recently won first place in the PASCAL2 inference challenge.
