Interactive Learning through Hands-on Practice using Electronic Mini - Lab (EML): a Case Study

-- In this paper, a new approach to impart practical skill based technical education is presented in comprehensive manner. An Electronic Mini-Lab (EML) is devised containing basic design and test instruments with electronic components, ICs, connecting wires and battery. Using the EML, students perform various formal and informal digital and analog circuit practicals as well as design prototype of projects. This gives them a hands-on experience, sense of belonging and sense of cooperation. The EML is useful for performing many practicals of various subjects. The EML also reduces the workload of college laboratories. Students have their own individual EML at their disposal anytime, which can be used to design hobby projects as a fun too. This will make them skilled engineers. This provides tremendous benefits in teaching learning process. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students and teachers. Incorporating active/ cooperative learning into traditional instruction can be a useful pedagogical tool to help students to perform practicals and project work any time anywhere. This concept is remarkably simple and cost effective but the dividends can be profound.
