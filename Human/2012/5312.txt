Patterns of technological progress: A Predictability-Based Perspective

The paper tries to identify new emerging patterns in the context of technological progress. Just as industrialization is associated with rationalization, mechanization, and automation, the Internet age is associated with computer models, embedded knowledge, and collaboration. Comparison among patterns is highlighted and analysis is done from predictability-based perspective.
