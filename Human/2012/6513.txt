On Multisequences and their extensions

In this paper we deal with the dimension of multisequences and related properties. For a given multisequence W and an m tuple of positive integers R, we define the R extension of W. Further we count the number of multisequences W whose R extensions have maximum dimension and give an algorithm to derive such multisequences. We then go on to use this theory to count the number of Linear Feedback Shift Register(LFSR) configurations with multi input multi output delay blocks for any given primitive characteristic polynomial and also to design such LFSRs. Further, we use the result on multisequences to count the number of Hankel matrices of any given dimension.
