Logic Characterization of Floyd Languages

Floyd languages (FL), alias Operator Precedence Languages, have recently received renewed attention thanks to their closure properties and local parsability which allow one to apply automatic verification techniques (e.g. model checking) and parallel and incremental parsing. They properly include various other classes, noticeably Visual Pushdown languages. In this paper we provide a characterization of FL in terms a monadic second order logic (MSO), in the same style as Buchi's one for regular languages. We prove the equivalence between automata recognizing FL and the MSO formalization.
