Isomorphism of graph classes related to the circular-ones property

We give a linear-time algorithm that checks for isomorphism between two 0-1 matrices that obey the circular-ones property. This algorithm leads to linear-time isomorphism algorithms for related graph classes, including Helly circular-arc graphs, Î“-circular-arc graphs, proper circular-arc graphs and convex-round graphs.
