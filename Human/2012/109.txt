Voting Power : A Generalised Framework

This paper examines an area of Game Theory called Voting Power Theory. With the adoption of a measure theoretic framework it argues that the many different indices and tools currently used for measuring voting power can be replaced by just three simple probabilities. The framework is sufficiently general to be applicable to every conceivable type of voting game, and every possible decision rule.
