Creation of Digital Test Form for Prepress Department

The main problem in colour management in prepress department is lack of availability of literature on colour management and knowledge gap between prepress department and press department. So a digital test from has been created by Adobe Photoshop to analyse the ICC profile and to create a new profile and this analysed data is used to study about various grey scale of RGB and CMYK images. That helps in conversion of image from RGB to CMYK in prepress department.
