Comparative analysis of ADTCP and M-ADTCP: Congestion Control Techniques for improving TCP performance over Ad-hoc Networks

Identifying the occurrence of congestion in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a major task. The inbuilt congestion control techniques of existing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) designed for wired networks do not handle the unique properties of shared wireless multi-hop link. There are several approaches proposed for detecting and overcoming the congestion in the mobile ad-hoc network. In this paper we present a Modified AD-hoc Transmission Control Protocol (M-ADTCP) method where the receiver detects the probable current network status and transmits this information to the sender as feedback. The sender behavior is altered appropriately. The proposed technique is also compatible with standard TCP.
