Nearest Neighbour Decoding with Pilot-Assisted Channel Estimation for Fading Multiple-Access Channels

We study a noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading multiple-access channel (MAC), where the transmitters and the receiver are aware of the statistics of the fading, but not of its realisation. We analyse the rate region that is achievable with nearest neighbour decoding and pilot-assisted channel estimation and determine the corresponding pre-log region, which is defined as the limiting ratio of the rate region to the logarithm of the SNR as the SNR tends to infinity.
