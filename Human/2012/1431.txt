RASID: A Robust WLAN Device-free Passive Motion Detection System

WLAN Device-free passive DfP indoor localization is an emerging technology enabling the localization of entities that do not carry any devices nor participate actively in the localization process using the already installed wireless infrastructure. This technology is useful for a variety of applications such as intrusion detection, smart homes and border protection. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of RASID, a DfP system for human motion detection. RASID combines different modules for statistical anomaly detection while adapting to changes in the environment to provide accurate, robust, and low-overhead detection of human activities using standard WiFi hardware. Evaluation of the system in two different testbeds shows that it can achieve an accurate detection capability in both environments with an F-measure of at least 0.93. In addition, the high accuracy and low overhead performance are robust to changes in the environment as compared to the current state of the art DfP detection systems. We also relay the lessons learned during building our system and discuss future research directions.
