Privacy Preserving and Ownership Authentication in Ubiquitous Computing Devices using Secure Three Way Authentication

In todays world of technology and gadgets almost every person is having a portable device, be it a laptop or the smart phones. The user would like to have all the services at his fingertips and access them through the portable device he owns. Maybe he wants some data from the fellow user or from the service provider or maybe he wants to control his smart devices at home from wherever he is. In the present era of mobile environments, interactions between the user device and the service provider must be secure enough regardless of the type of device used to access or utilize the services. In this paper we propose a "Secure Three Way Authentication (STWA)" technique intended to preserve the user privacy and to accomplish ownership authentication in order to securely deliver the services to the user devices. This technique will also help the users or the service providers to check if the device is compromised or not with the help of the encrypted pass-phrases that are being exchanged.
