Notions of Chaotic Cryptography: Sketch of a Chaos based Cryptosystem

Chaotic cryptography describes the use of chaos theory (in particular physical dynamical systems working in chaotic regime as part of communication techniques and computation algorithms) to perform different cryptographic tasks in a cryptographic system. In the end, the question is, can chaotic systems provide alternative techniques able to enhance cryptographic algorithms?. This chapter can be a worthy material to guide the reader in order to answer himself this question. Thus, the objective of this chapter is to give a general vision of what chaotic cryptography is and a comprehensive example that illustrates the main techniques used in this field.
