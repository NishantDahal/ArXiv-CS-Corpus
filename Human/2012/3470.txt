The Capacity Loss of Dense Constellations

We determine the loss in capacity incurred by using signal constellations with a bounded support over general complex-valued additive-noise channels for suitably high signal-to-noise ratio. Our expression for the capacity loss recovers the power loss of 1.53dB for square signal constellations.
