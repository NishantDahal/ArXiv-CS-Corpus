Notes on random reals

The theory of random real numbers is exceedingly well-developed, and fascinating from many points of view. It is also quite challenging mathematically. The present notes are intended as no more than a gateway to the larger theory. They review just the most elementary part of the theory (bearing on Kolmogorov- and ML-randomness). We hope that the simple arguments presented here will encourage the enterprising student to examine richer treatments of the subject available elsewhere, notably, in Downey and Hirschfeldt (2010).
