Concept of the abstract program

The aim of this paper is to alter the abstract definition of the program of the theoretical programming model which has been developed at Eotvos Lorand University for many years in order to investigate methods that support designing correct programs. The motivation of this modification was that the dynamic properties of programs appear in the model. This new definition of the program gives a hand to extend the model with the concept of subprograms while the earlier results of the original programming model are preserved.
