Analysis of Magnification in Depth from Defocus

In depth from defocus (DFD), when images are captured with different camera parameters, a relative magnification is induced between them. Image warping is a simpler solution to account for magnification than seemingly more accurate optical approaches. This work is an investigation into the effects of magnification on the accuracy of DFD. We comment on issues regarding scaling effect on relative blur computation. We statistically analyze accountability of scale factor, commenting on the bias and efficiency of the estimator that does not consider scale. We also discuss the effect of interpolation errors on blur estimation in a warping based solution to handle magnification and carry out experimental analysis to comment on the blur estimation accuracy.
