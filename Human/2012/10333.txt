Brain Connectivity Analysis Methods for Better Understanding of Coupling

Action, cognition, emotion and perception can be mapped in the brain by using set of techniques. Translating unimodal concepts from one modality to another is an important step towards understanding the neural mechanisms. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multimodal analysis of brain signals such as fMRI, EEG, MEG, NIRS and motivations, assumptions and pitfalls associated with it. All these non-invasive brain modalities complement and restrain each other and hence improve our understating of functional and neuronal organization. By combining the various modalities together, we can exploit the strengths and flaws of individual brain imaging methods. Integrated anatomical analysis and functional measurements of human brain offer a powerful paradigm for the brain mapping. Here we provide the brief review on non invasive brain modalities, describe the future of co-analysis of these brain signals.
