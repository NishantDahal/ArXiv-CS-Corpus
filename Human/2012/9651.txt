Explosion prediction of oil gas using SVM and Logistic Regression

The prevention of dangerous chemical accidents is a primary problem of industrial manufacturing. In the accidents of dangerous chemicals, the oil gas explosion plays an important role. The essential task of the explosion prevention is to estimate the better explosion limit of a given oil gas. In this paper, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) are used to predict the explosion of oil gas. LR can get the explicit probability formula of explosion, and the explosive range of the concentrations of oil gas according to the concentration of oxygen. Meanwhile, SVM gives higher accuracy of prediction. Furthermore, considering the practical requirements, the effects of penalty parameter on the distribution of two types of errors are discussed.
