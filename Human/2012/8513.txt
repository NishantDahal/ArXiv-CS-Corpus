Niho Bent Functions and Subiaco/Adelaide Hyperovals

In this paper, the relation between binomial Niho bent functions discovered by Dobbertin et al. and o-polynomials that give rise to the Subiaco and Adelaide classes of hyperovals is found. This allows to expand the class of bent functions that corresponds to Subiaco hyperovals, in the case when $m\equiv 2 (\bmod 4)$.
