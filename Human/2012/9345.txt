Multicore Dynamic Kernel Modules Attachment Technique for Kernel Performance Enhancement

Traditional monolithic kernels dominated kernel structures for long time along with small sized kernels,few hardware companies and limited kernel functionalities. Monolithic kernel structure was not applicable when the number of hardware companies increased and kernel services consumed by different users for many purposes. One of the biggest disadvantages of the monolithic kernels is the inflexibility due to the need to include all the available modules in kernel compilation causing high time consuming. Lately, new kernel structure was introduced through multicore operating systems. Unfortunately, many multicore operating systems such as barrelfish and FOS are experimental. This paper aims to simulate the performance of multicore hybrid kernels through dynamic kernel module customized attachment/ deattachment for multicore machines. In addition, this paper proposes a new technique for loading dynamic kernel modules based on the user needs and machine capabilities.
