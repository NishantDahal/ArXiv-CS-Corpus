On the Impact of Information Technologies on Society: an Historical Perspective through the Game of Chess

The game of chess as always been viewed as an iconic representation  of intellectual prowess. Since the very beginning of computer  science, the challenge of being able to program a computer capable  of playing chess and beating humans has been alive and used both as  a mark to measure hardware/software progresses and as an ongoing  programming challenge leading to numerous discoveries. In the early  days of computer science it was a topic for specialists. But as   computers were democratized, and the strength of chess engines  began to increase, chess players started to appropriate to   themselves these new tools. We show how these interactions between  the world of chess and information technologies have been herald of   broader social impacts of information technologies. The game of  chess, and more broadly the world of chess (chess players,   literature, computer softwares and websites dedicated to chess,  etc.), turns out to be a surprisingly and particularly sharp   indicator of the changes induced in our everyday life by the   information technologies. Moreover, in the same way that chess is a   modelization of war that captures the raw features of strategic   thinking, chess world can be seen as small society making the study   of the information technologies impact easier to analyze and to  grasp.
