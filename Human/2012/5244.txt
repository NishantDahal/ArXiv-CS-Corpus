Prescient Precoding in Heterogeneous DSA Networks with Both Underlay and Interweave MIMO Cognitive Radios

This work examines a novel heterogeneous dynamic spectrum access network where the primary users (PUs) coexist with both underlay and interweave cognitive radios (ICRs); all terminals being potentially equipped with multiple antennas. Underlay cognitive transmitters (UCTs) are allowed to transmit concurrently with PUs subject to interference constraints, while the ICRs employ spectrum sensing and are permitted to access the shared spectrum only when both PUs and UCTs are absent. We investigate the design of MIMO precoding algorithms for the UCT that increase the detection probability at the ICRs, while simultaneously meeting a desired Quality-of-Service target to the underlay cognitive receivers (UCRs) and constraining interference leaked to PUs. The objective of such a proactive approach, referred to as prescient precoding, is to minimize the probability of interference from ICRs to the UCRs and primary receivers due to imperfect spectrum sensing. We begin with downlink prescient precoding algorithms for multiple single-antenna UCRs and multi-antenna PUs/ICRs. We then present prescient block-diagonalization algorithms for the MIMO underlay downlink where spatial multiplexing is performed for a plurality of multi-antenna UCRs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that prescient precoding by UCTs provides a pronounced performance gain compared to conventional underlay precoding strategies.
