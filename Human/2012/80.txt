An Authoring System for Editing Lessons in Phonetic English in SMIL3.0

One of the difficulties of teaching English is the prosody, including the stress. French learners have difficulties to encode this information about the word because it is irrelevant for them. Therefore, they have difficulty to produce this stress when they speak that language. Studies in this area have concluded that the dual-coding approach (auditory and visual) of a phonetic phenomenon helps a lot to improve its perception and memorization for novice learners. The aim of our work is to provide English teachers with an authoring named SaCoPh for editing multimedia courses that support this approach. This course is based on a template that fits the educational aspects of phonetics, exploiting the features of version 3.0 of the standard SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) for the publication of this course on the web.
