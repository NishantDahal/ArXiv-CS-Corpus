Quantum/Relativistic Computation of Security and Efficiency of Electrical Power System for a Day-Ahead

An algorithm for Electric Power System (EPS) quantum/relativistic security and efficiency computation for a day-ahead via perturbative renormalization of the EPS, finding the computation flowcharts, verification and validation is built in this paper.
