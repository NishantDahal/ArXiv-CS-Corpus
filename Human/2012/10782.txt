Performance Optimization of Multiple Interconnected Heterogeneous Sensor Networks via Collaborative Information Sharing

Interconnecting multiple sensor networks is a relatively new research field which has emerged in the Wireless Sensor Network domain. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have typically been seen as logically separate, and few works have considered interconnection and interaction between them. Interconnecting multiple heterogeneous sensor networks therefore opens up a new field besides more traditional research on, e.g., routing, self organization, or MAC layer development. Up to now, some approaches have been proposed for interconnecting multiple sensor networks with goals like information sharing or monitoring multiple sensor networks. In this paper, we propose to utilize inter-WSN communication to enable Collaborative Performance Optimization, i.e., our approach aims to optimize the performance of individual WSNs by taking into account measured information from others. The parameters to be optimized are energy consumption on the one hand and sensing quality on the other.
