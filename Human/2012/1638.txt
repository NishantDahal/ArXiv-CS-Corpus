Incremental Collaborative Filtering Considering Temporal Effects

Recommender systems require their recommendation algorithms to be accurate, scalable and should handle very sparse training data which keep changing over time. Inspired by ant colony optimization, we propose a novel collaborative filtering scheme: Ant Collaborative Filtering that enjoys those favorable characteristics above mentioned. With the mechanism of pheromone transmission between users and items, our method can pinpoint most relative users and items even in face of the sparsity problem. By virtue of the evaporation of existing pheromone, we capture the evolution of user preference over time. Meanwhile, the computation complexity is comparatively small and the incremental update can be done online. We design three experiments on three typical recommender systems, namely movie recommendation, book recommendation and music recommendation, which cover both explicit and implicit rating data. The results show that the proposed algorithm is well suited for real-world recommendation scenarios which have a high throughput and are time sensitive.
