UMTS-WiMAX Vertical Handover in Next Generation Wireless Networks

The vision of next generation wireless network (NGWN) is to integrate different wireless access technologies, each with its own characteristics, into a common IP-based core network to provide mobile user with service continuity and seamless roaming. One of the major issues for the converged heterogeneous networks is providing a seamless vertical handover (VHO) with QoS support. In this paper we have reviewed the various interworking architectures and handover scenarios between UMTS and WiMAX. Also, we have compared the proposed solutions based on different criteria and revealed the pros and cons of each scheme. The comparison aids to adopt a better interworking and handover mechanism in NGWN.
