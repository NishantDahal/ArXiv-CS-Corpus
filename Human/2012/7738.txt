Coordination of autonomic functionalities in communications networks

Future communication networks are expected to feature autonomic (or self-organizing) mechanisms to ease deployment (self-configuration), tune parameters automatically (self-optimization) and repair the network (self-healing). Self-organizing mechanisms have been designed as stand-alone entities, even though multiple mechanisms will run in parallel in operational networks. An efficient coordination mechanism will be the major enabler for large scale deployment of self-organizing networks. We model self-organizing mechanisms as control loops, and study the conditions for stability when running control loops in parallel. Based on control theory and Lyapunov stability, we propose a coordination mechanism to stabilize the system, which can be implemented in a distributed fashion. The mechanism remains valid in the presence of measurement noise via stochastic approximation. Instability and coordination in the context of wireless networks are illustrated with two examples and the influence of network geometry is investigated. We are essentially concerned with linear systems, and the applicability of our results for non-linear systems is discussed.
