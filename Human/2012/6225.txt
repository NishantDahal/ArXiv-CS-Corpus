Better Balance by Being Biased: A 0.8776-Approximation for Max Bisection

Recently Raghavendra and Tan (SODA 2012) gave a 0.85-approximation algorithm for the Max Bisection problem. We improve their algorithm to a 0.8776-approximation. As Max Bisection is hard to approximate within $α_{GW} + ε\approx 0.8786$ under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC), our algorithm is nearly optimal. We conjecture that Max Bisection is approximable within $α_{GW}-ε$, i.e., the bisection constraint (essentially) does not make Max Cut harder.
  We also obtain an optimal algorithm (assuming the UGC) for the analogous variant of Max 2-Sat. Our approximation ratio for this problem exactly matches the optimal approximation ratio for Max 2-Sat, i.e., $α_{LLZ} + ε\approx 0.9401$, showing that the bisection constraint does not make Max 2-Sat harder. This improves on a 0.93-approximation for this problem due to Raghavendra and Tan.
