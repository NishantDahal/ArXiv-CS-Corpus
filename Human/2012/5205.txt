Sparse Differential Resultant for Laurent Differential Polynomials

In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Laurent differentially essential systems and give a criterion for Laurent differentially essential systems in terms of their supports. Then the sparse differential resultant for a Laurent differentially essential system is defined and its basic properties are proved. In particular, order and degree bounds for the sparse differential resultant are given. Based on these bounds, an algorithm to compute the sparse differential resultant is proposed, which is single exponential in terms of the number of indeterminates, the Jacobi number of the system, and the size of the system.
