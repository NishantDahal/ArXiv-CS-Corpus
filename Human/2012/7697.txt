Performance Evaluation of on demand and Table driven Protocol for Wireless Ad hoc Network

Mobile Adhoc Network is a wireless network without infrastructure.It is a kind of wireless adhoc network,and is a self configuring network of mobile routers connected by wireless links.The routers are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily,thus the network's wireless topology may change rapidly and unpredictably. Such a network may operate in a standalone fashion,or may be connected to the larger Internet.There are various routing protocols available for MANET.The most popular ones are DSR,AODV and DSDV.This paper examines two routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks :the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector,the table driven protocol and the Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector routing,an On Demand protocol and evaluates both protocols based on packet delivery fraction, average end to end delay,throughput and routing overhead while varying pause time.The performance evaluation has been done by using simulation tool NS2 which is the main simulator, NAM(Network Animator)and excel graph which is used for preparing the graphs from the trace files.Simulation revealed that although DSDV perfectly scales to small networks with low node speeds,AODV is preferred due to its more efficient use of bandwidth.
