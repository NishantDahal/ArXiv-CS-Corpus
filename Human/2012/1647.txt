Parameterized Proof Complexity and W[1]

We initiate a program of parameterized proof complexity that aims to provide evidence that FPT is different from W[1]. A similar program already exists for the classes W[2] and W[SAT]. We contrast these programs and prove upper and lower bounds for W[1]-parameterized Resolution.
