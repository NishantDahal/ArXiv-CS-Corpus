Reply to Comments on Neuroelectrodynamics: Where are the Real Conceptual Pitfalls?

The fundamental, powerful process of computation in the brain has been widely misunderstood. The paper [1] associates the general failure to build intelligent thinking machines with current reductionist principles of temporal coding and advocates for a change in paradigm regarding the brain analogy. Since fragments of information are stored in proteins which can shift between several structures to perform their function, the biological substrate is actively involved in physical computation. The intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of action potentials and synaptic activities maintain physical interactions within and between neurons in the brain. During these events the required information is exchanged between molecular structures (proteins) which store fragments of information and the generated electric flux which carries and integrates information in the brain. The entire process of physical interaction explains how the brain actively creates or experiences meaning. This process of interaction during an action potential generation can be simply seen as the moment when the neuron solves a many-body problem. A neuroelectrodynamic theory shows that the neuron solves equations rather than exclusively computes functions. With the main focus on temporal patterns, the spike timing dogma (STD) has neglected important forms of computation which do occur inside neurons. In addition, artificial neural models have missed the most important part since the real super-computing power of the brain has its origins in computations that occur within neurons.
