Proceedings Second International Workshop on Interactions, Games and Protocols

This volume contains the proceedings of the second International Workshop on Interactions, Games and Protocols (IWIGP 2012). The workshop was held in Tallinn on March 25, 2012, as a satellite event of ETAPS 2012. The previous workshop took place in Saarbr√ºcken as part of ETAPS 2011.
  The goal of this workshop was to bring researchers from industry and academia together and to explore how a better understanding of the interrelation between interactions, games and protocols leads to better-designed and more reliable interacting systems. We invited scientific contributions both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. 
  The program consisted of two invited talks and four refereed papers, selected by a strong program committee of international reputation. The refereed papers are contained in this volume.
