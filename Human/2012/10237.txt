Binary Sequences with Minimum Peak Sidelobe Level up to Length 68

Results of an exhaustive search for minimum peak sidelobe level binary sequences are presented. Several techniques for efficiency implementation of search algorithm are described. A table of number of non-equivalent optimal binary sequences with minimum peak sidelobe (MPS) level up to length 68 is given. This number can be used in prediction of the longest length for a given sidelobe level of binary sequences. The examples of optimal binary MPS sequences having high merit factor are shown.
