Energy-Aware Task Partitioning on Heterogeneous Multiprocessor Platforms

Efficient task partitioning plays a crucial role in achieving high performance at multiprocessor plat forms. This paper addresses the problem of energy-aware static partitioning of periodic real-time tasks on heterogeneous multiprocessor platforms. A Particle Swarm Optimization variant based on Min-min technique for task partitioning is proposed. The proposed approach aims to minimize the overall energy consumption, meanwhile avoid deadline violations. An energy-aware cost function is proposed to be considered in the proposed approach. Extensive simulations and comparisons are conducted in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The achieved results demonstrate that the proposed partitioning scheme significantly surpasses previous approaches in terms of both number of iterations and energy savings.
