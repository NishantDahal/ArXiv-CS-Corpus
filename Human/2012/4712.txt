Approximation Algorithm for Non-Boolean MAX k-CSP

In this paper, we present a randomized polynomial-time approximation algorithm for k-CSPd. In k-CSPd, we are given a set of predicates of arity k over an alphabet of size d. Our goal is to find an assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints.
  Our algorithm has approximation factor Omega(kd/d^k) (when k > Î©(log d)). This bound is asymptotically optimal assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. The best previously known algorithm has approximation factor Omega(k log d/d^k).
  We also give an approximation algorithm for the boolean MAX k-CSP2 problem with a slightly improved approximation guarantee.
