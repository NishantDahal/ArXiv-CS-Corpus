Cognitive Radio Simultaneous Spectrum Access/ One-shot Game Modelling

The aim of this work is to asses simultaneous spectrum access situations that may occur in Cognitive Radio (CR) environments. The approach is that of one shot, noncooperative games describing CR interactions. Open spectrum access scenarios are modelled based on continuous and discrete reformulations of the Cournot game theoretical model. CR interaction situations are described by Nash and Pareto equilibria. Also, the heterogeneity of players is captured by the new concept of joint Nash-Pareto equilibrium, allowing CRs to be biased toward different types of equilibrium. Numerical simulations reveal equilibrium situations that may be reached in simultaneous access scenarios of two and three users.
