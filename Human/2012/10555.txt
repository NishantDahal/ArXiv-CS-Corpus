A Novel Distance-Based Approach to Constrained Rank Aggregation

We consider a classical problem in choice theory -- vote aggregation -- using novel distance measures between permutations that arise in several practical applications. The distance measures are derived through an axiomatic approach, taking into account various issues arising in voting with side constraints. The side constraints of interest include non-uniform relevance of the top and the bottom of rankings (or equivalently, eliminating negative outliers in votes) and similarities between candidates (or equivalently, introducing diversity in the voting process). The proposed distance functions may be seen as weighted versions of the Kendall $Ï„$ distance and weighted versions of the Cayley distance. In addition to proposing the distance measures and providing the theoretical underpinnings for their applications, we also consider algorithmic aspects associated with distance-based aggregation processes. We focus on two methods. One method is based on approximating weighted distance measures by a generalized version of Spearman's footrule distance, and it has provable constant approximation guarantees. The second class of algorithms is based on a non-uniform Markov chain method inspired by PageRank, for which currently only heuristic guarantees are known. We illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms for a number of distance measures for which the optimal solution may be easily computed.
