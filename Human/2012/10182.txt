Étude comparée de quatre logiciels de gestion de références bibliographiques libres ou gratuits

This article is the result of the analysis of various bibliographic reference management tools, especially those that are free. The use of editorial tools by bibliographic editors has evolved rapidly since 2007. But, until recently, free software has fallen short when it comes to ergonomics or use. The functional and technical panorama offered by free software is the result of the comparison of JabRef, Mendeley Desktop, BibDesk and Zotero software undertaken in January 2012 by two research professors affiliated with the Institut national français des techniques de la documentation (INTD).
