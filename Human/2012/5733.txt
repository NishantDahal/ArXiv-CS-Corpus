OGCOSMO: An auxiliary tool for the study of the Universe within hierarchical scenario of structure formation

In this work is presented the software OGCOSMO. This program was written using high level design methodology (HLDM), that is based on the use of very high level (VHL) programing language as main, and the use of the intermediate level (IL) language only for the critical processing time. The languages used are PYTHON (VHL) and FORTRAN (IL). The core of OGCOSMO is a package called OGC{\_}lib. This package contains a group of modules for the study of cosmological and astrophysical processes, such as: comoving distance, relation between redshift and time, cosmic star formation rate, number density of dark matter haloes and mass function of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The software is under development and some new features will be implemented for the research of stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by: stellar collapse to form black holes, binary systems of SMBHs. Even more, we show that the use of HLDM with PYTHON and FORTRAN is a powerful tool for producing astrophysical softwares.
