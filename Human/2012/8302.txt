Novel Architecture for 3D model in virtual communities from detected face

In this research paper we suggest how to extract a face from an image, modify it, characterize it in terms of high-level properties, and apply it to the creation of a personalized avatar. In this research work we tested, we implemented the algorithm on several hundred facial images, including many taken under uncontrolled acquisition conditions, and found to exhibit satisfactory performance for immediate practical use.
