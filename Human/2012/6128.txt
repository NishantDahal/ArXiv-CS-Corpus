The OS* Algorithm: a Joint Approach to Exact Optimization and Sampling

Most current sampling algorithms for high-dimensional distributions are based on MCMC techniques and are approximate in the sense that they are valid only asymptotically. Rejection sampling, on the other hand, produces valid samples, but is unrealistically slow in high-dimension spaces. The OS* algorithm that we propose is a unified approach to exact optimization and sampling, based on incremental refinements of a functional upper bound, which combines ideas of adaptive rejection sampling and of A* optimization search. We show that the choice of the refinement can be done in a way that ensures tractability in high-dimension spaces, and we present first experiments in two different settings: inference in high-order HMMs and in large discrete graphical models.
