Timed Test Case Generation Using Labeled Prioritized Time Petri Nets

Model-based testing of software and hardware systems uses behavioral and formal models of the systems. The paper presents a technique for model-based black-box conformance testing of real-time systems using Labeled Prioritized Time Petri Nets (LPrTPN). The Timed Input/Output Conformance (tioco) relation, which takes environment assumptions into account, serves as reference to decide of implementation correctness. Test suites are derived automatically from a LPrTPN made up of two concurrent sub-nets that respectively specify the system under test and its environment. The result is optimal in the sense that test cases have the shortest possible accumulated time to be executed. Test cases selection combines test purposes and structural coverage criteria associated with the model. A test purpose or a coverage criterion is specified in a SE-LTL formula. The TIme Petri Net Analyzer TINA has been extended to support concurrent composed subnets. Automatic generation of time-optimal test suites with the Tina toolbox combines the model checker selt and the path analyzer plan. selt outputs a sequence that satisfies the logic formula. plan computes the fastest execution of this sequence which will be transformed in a test cases suite.
