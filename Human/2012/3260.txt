Equilibria und weiteres Heiteres II

We investigate several technical and conceptual questions.
  Our main subject is the investigation of independence as a ternary relation in the context of non-monotonic logic. In the context of probability, this investigation was started by W.Spohn et al., and then followed by J.Pearl. We look at products of function sets, and thus continue our own investigation of independence in non-monotonic logic. We show that a finite characterization of this relation in our context is impossible, and indicate how to construct all valid rules.
