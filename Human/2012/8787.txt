Identifying critical features for network forensics investigation perspectives

Research in the field of network forensics is gradually expanding with the propensity to fully accommodate the tenacity to help in adjudicating, curbing and apprehending the exponential growth of cyber crimes. However, investigating cyber crime differs, depending on the perspective of investigation. There is therefore the need for a comprehensive model, containing relevant critical features required for a thorough investigation for each perspective, which can be adopted by investigators. This paper therefore presents the findings on the critical features for each perspective, as well as their characteristics. The paper also presents a review of existing frameworks on network forensics. Furthermore, the paper discussed an illustrative methodological process for each perspective encompassing the relevant critical features. These illustrations present a procedure for the thorough investigation in network forensics.
