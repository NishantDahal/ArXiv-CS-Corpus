BPEL-RF: A formal framework for BPEL orchestrations integrating distributed resources

Web service compositions are gaining attention to develop complex web systems by combination of existing services. Thus, there are many works that leverage the advantages of this approach. However, there are only few works that use web service compositions to manage distributed resources. In this paper, we then present a formal model that combines orchestrations written in BPEL with distributed resources, by using WSRF.
