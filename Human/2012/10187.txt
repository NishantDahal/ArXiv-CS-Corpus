A Blind Time-Reversal Detector in the Presence of Channel Correlation

A blind target detector using the time reversal transmission is proposed in the presence of channel correlation. We calculate the exact moments of the test statistics involved. The derived moments are used to construct an accurate approximative Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) based on multivariate Edgeworth expansion. Performance gain over an existing detector is observed in scenarios with channel correlation and relatively strong target signal.
