A Semantic Approach for Automatic Structuring and Analysis of Software Process Patterns

The main contribution of this paper, is to propose a novel semantic approach based on a Natural Language Processing technique in order to ensure a semantic unification of unstructured process patterns which are expressed not only in different formats but also, in different forms. This approach is implemented using the GATE text engineering framework and then evaluated leading up to high-quality results motivating us to continue in this direction.
