Urgency/Emergency Health Processes' Modelling: A Case Study

The growing complexity and sophistication of the organizational information systems, and hospital ones particularly, render difficult their comprehension and, consequently, the implementation of control mechanisms that may assure, at all times, the auditability of the above mentioned systems, without having to use models. This paper, framed in a wider investigation, aims to describe the application of techniques and methodologies, in the sphere of action of Organizational Engineering, in the modelling of business processes developed in the main Operating Theatre of the Coimbra's University Hospital Emergency Service, as a support for the implementation of an information system architecture, using for that purpose the CEO framework, developed and suggested by the Centre for Organizational Engineering (CEO), based on the UML language.
