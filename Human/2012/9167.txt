Context Visualization for Social Bookmark Management

We present the design of a new social bookmark manager, named GalViz, as part of the interface of the GiveA-Link system. Unlike the interfaces of traditional social tagging tools, which usually display information in a list view, GalViz visualizes tags, resources, social links, and social context in an interactive network, combined with the tag cloud. Evaluations through a scenario case study and log analysis provide evidence of the effectiveness of our design.
