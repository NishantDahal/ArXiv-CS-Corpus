An Improved Lower Bound of The Spark With Application

Spark plays a great role in studying uniqueness of sparse solutions of the underdetermined linear equations. In this article, we derive a new lower bound of spark. As an application, we obtain a new criterion for the uniqueness of sparse solutions of linear equations.
