Trust Management in Cloud Computing: A Critical Review

Cloud computing has been attracting the attention of several researchers both in the academia and the industry as it provides many opportunities for organizations by offering a range of computing services. For cloud computing to become widely adopted by both the enterprises and individuals, several issues have to be solved. A key issue that needs special attention is security of clouds, and trust management is an important component of cloud security. In this paper, the authors look at what trust is and how trust has been applied in distributed computing. Trust models proposed for various distributed system has then been summarized. The trust management systems proposed for cloud computing have been investigated with special emphasis on their capability, applicability in practical heterogonous cloud environment and implementabilty. Finally, the proposed models/systems have been compared with each other based on a selected set of cloud computing parameters in a table.
