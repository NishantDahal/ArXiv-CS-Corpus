Hybrid technique for effective knowledge representation & a comparative study

Knowledge representation (KR) and inference mechanism are most desirable thing to make the system intelligent. System is known to an intelligent if its intelligence is equivalent to the intelligence of human being for a particular domain or general. Because of incomplete ambiguous and uncertain information the task of making intelligent system is very difficult. The objective of this paper is to present the hybrid KR technique for making the system effective & Optimistic. The requirement for (effective & optimistic) is because the system must be able to reply the answer with a confidence of some factor. This paper also presents the comparison between various hybrid KR techniques with the proposed one.
