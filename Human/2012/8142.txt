Reusability Framework for Cloud Computing

Cloud based development is a challenging task for several software engineering projects, especially for those which needs development with reusability. Present time of cloud computing is allowing new professional models for using the software development. The expected upcoming trend of computing is assumed to be this cloud computing because of speed of application deployment, shorter time to market, and lower cost of operation. Until Cloud Co mputing Reusability Model is considered a fundamental capability, the speed of developing services is very slow. Th is paper spreads cloud computing with component based development named Cloud Co mputing Reusability Model (CCR) and enable reusability in cloud computing. In this paper Cloud Co mputing Reusability Model has been proposed. The model has been validated by Cloudsim an d experimental result shows that reusability based cloud computing approach is effective in minimizing cost and time to market.
