Virtual Simulation Objects Concept as a Framework for System-Level Simulation

This paper presents Virtual Simulation Objects (VSO) concept which forms theoretical basis for building tools and framework that is developed for system-level simulations using existing software modules available within cyber-infrastructure. Presented concept is implemented by the software tool for building composite solutions using VSO-based GUI and running them using CLAVIRE simulation environment.
