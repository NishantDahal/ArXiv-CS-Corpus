Broadcast-based Directional Routing in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks

An optimized broadcast protocol is proposed for VANETs. It is based on two key information: the direction to the destination and the beamforming angle θ. The efficiency of this technique is demonstrated in terms of packet delivery, bandwidth gain and probability of transmission success. An analytical model is developed to calculate the transmission area. This model allows capturing the propagation shape of the forwarding area. Comparisons with simulations show that the analytical model is precise.
