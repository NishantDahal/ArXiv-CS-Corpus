Encryption of Data using Elliptic Curve over Finite fields

Cryptography is the study of techniques for ensuring the secrecy and authentication of the information. Public-key encryption schemes are secure only if the authenticity of the public-key is assured. Elliptic curve arithmetic can be used to develop a variety of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) schemes including key exchange, encryption and digital signature. The principal attraction of elliptic curve cryptography compared to RSA is that it offers equal security for a smaller key-size, thereby reducing the processing overhead. In the present paper we propose a new encryption algorithm using some Elliptic Curve over finite fields
