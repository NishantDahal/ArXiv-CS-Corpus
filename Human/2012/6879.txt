Scaling Behaviors of Wireless Device-to-Device Communications with Distributed Caching

We analyze a novel architecture for caching popular video content to enable wireless device-to-device collaboration. We focus on the asymptotic scaling characteristics and show how they depends on video content popularity statistics. We identify a fundamental conflict between collaboration distance and interference and show how to optimize the transmission power to maximize frequency reuse. Our main result is a closed form expression of the optimal collaboration distance as a function of the model parameters. Under the common assumption of a Zipf distribution for content reuse, we show that if the Zipf exponent is greater than 1, it is possible to have a number of D2D interference-free collaboration pairs that scales linearly in the number of nodes. If the Zipf exponent is smaller than 1, we identify the best possible scaling in the number of D2D collaborating links. Surprisingly, a very simple distributed caching policy achieves the optimal scaling behavior and therefore there is no need to centrally coordinate what each node is caching.
