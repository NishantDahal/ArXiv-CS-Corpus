Analysis of cloud storage prices

Cloud storage is fast securing its role as a major repository for both consumers and business customers. Many companies now offer storage solutions, sometimes for free for limited amounts of capacity. We have surveyed the pricing plans of a selection of major cloud providers and compared them using the unit price as the means of comparison. All the providers, excepting Amazon, adopt a bundling pricing scheme; Amazon follows instead a block-declining pricing policy. We compare the pricing plans through a double approach: a pointwise comparison for each value of capacity, and an overall comparison using a two-part tariff approximation and a Pareto-dominance criterion. Under both approaches, most providers appear to offer pricing plans that are more expensive and can be excluded from a procurement selection in favour of a limited number of dominant providers.
