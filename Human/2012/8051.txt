Efficient Parametric Projection Pursuit Density Estimation

Product models of low dimensional experts are a powerful way to avoid the     curse of dimensionality. We present the ``under-complete product of experts'     (UPoE), where each expert models a one dimensional projection of the data. The     UPoE is fully tractable and may be interpreted as a parametric probabilistic     model for projection pursuit. Its ML learning rules are identical to the     approximate learning rules proposed before for under-complete ICA. We also     derive an efficient sequential learning algorithm and discuss its relationship     to projection pursuit density estimation and feature induction algorithms for     additive random field models.
