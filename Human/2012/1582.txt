A Formalization of the Theorem of Existence of First-Order Most General Unifiers

This work presents a formalization of the theorem of existence of  most general unifiers in first-order signatures in the higher-order  proof assistant PVS. The distinguishing feature of this  formalization is that it remains close to the textbook proofs that  are based on proving the correctness of the well-known Robinson's first-order unification algorithm. The formalization was applied  inside a PVS development for term rewriting systems that provides a  complete formalization of the Knuth-Bendix Critical Pair theorem,  among other relevant theorems of the theory of rewriting. In  addition, the formalization methodology has been proved of practical  use in order to verify the correctness of unification algorithms in  the style of the original Robinson's unification algorithm.
