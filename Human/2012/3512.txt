SD-REE: A Cryptographic Method to Exclude Repetition from a Message

In this paper, the author presents a new cryptographic technique, SD-REE, to exclude the repetitive terms in a message, when it is to be encrypted, so that it becomes almost impossible for a person to retrieve or predict the original message from the encrypted message. In modern world, cryptography hackers try to break a code or cryptographic algorithm [1,2] or retrieve the key, used for encryption, by inserting repetitive bytes / characters in the message and encrypt the message or by analyzing repetitions in the encrypted message, to find out the encryption algorithm or retrieve the key used for the encryption. But in SD-REE method the repetitive bytes / characters are removed and there is no trace of any repetition in the message, which was encrypted.
