Data Hiding Techniques using number decompositions

Data hiding is the art of embedding data into digital media in a way such that the existence of data remains concealed from everyone except the intended recipient. In this paper, we discuss the various Least Significant Bit (LSB) data hiding techniques. We first look at the classical LSB data hiding technique and the method to embed secret data into cover media by bit manipulation. We also take a look at the data hiding technique by bit plane decomposition based on Fibonacci numbers. This method generates more bit planes which allows users to embed more data into the cover image without causing significant distortion. We also discuss the data hiding technique based on bit plane decomposition by prime numbers and natural numbers. These methods are based on mapping the sequence of image bit size to the decomposed bit number to hide the intended information. Finally we present a comparative analysis of these data hiding techniques.
