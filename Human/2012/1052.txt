A Simulation Model for Evaluating Distributed Systems Dependability

In this paper we present a new simulation model designed to evaluate the dependability in distributed systems. This model extends the MONARC simulation model with new capabilities for capturing reliability, safety, availability, security, and maintainability requirements. The model has been implemented as an extension of the multithreaded, process oriented simulator MONARC, which allows the realistic simulation of a wide-range of distributed system technologies, with respect to their specific components and characteristics. The extended simulation model includes the necessary components to inject various failure events, and provides the mechanisms to evaluate different strategies for replication, redundancy procedures, and security enforcement mechanisms, as well. The results obtained in simulation experiments presented in this paper probe that the use of discrete-event simulators, such as MONARC, in the design and development of distributed systems is appealing due to their efficiency and scalability.
