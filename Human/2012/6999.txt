Axiomatizing first order consequences in dependence logic

Dependence logic, introduced in [8], cannot be axiomatized. However, first-order consequences of dependence logic sentences can be axiomatized, and this is what we shall do in this paper. We give an explicit axiomatization and prove the respective Completeness Theorem.
