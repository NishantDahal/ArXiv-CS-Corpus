Random Regular Graphs are not Asymptotically Gromov Hyperbolic

In this paper we prove that random $d$--regular graphs with $d\geq 3$ have traffic congestion of the order $O(n\log_{d-1}^{3}(n))$ where $n$ is the number of nodes and geodesic routing is used. We also show that these graphs are not asymptotically $δ$--hyperbolic for any non--negative $δ$ almost surely as $n\to\infty$.
