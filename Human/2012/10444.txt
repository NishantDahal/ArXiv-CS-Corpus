A Lossless Data Hiding Technique based on AES-DWT

In this paper we propose a new data hiding technique. The new technique uses steganography and cryptography on images with a size of 256x256 pixels and an 8-bit grayscale format. There are design restrictions such as a fixed-size cover image, and reconstruction without error of the hidden image. The steganography technique uses a Haar-DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) with hard thresholding and LSB (Less Significant Bit) technique on the cover image. The algorithms used for compressing and ciphering the secret image are lossless JPG and AES, respectively. The proposed technique is used to generate a stego image which provides a double type of security that is robust against attacks. Results are reported for different thresholds levels in terms of PSNR.
