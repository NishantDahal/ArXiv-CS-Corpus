A General Formulation for the Stiffness Matrix of Parallel Mechanisms

Starting from the definition of a stiffness matrix, the authors present a new formulation of the Cartesian stiffness matrix of parallel mechanisms. The proposed formulation is more general than any other stiffness matrix found in the literature since it can take into account the stiffness of the passive joints, it can consider additional compliances in the joints or in the links and it remains valid for large displacements. Then, the validity, the conservative property, the positive definiteness and the relation with other formulations of stiffness matrices are discussed theoretically. Finally, a numerical example is given in order to illustrate the correctness of this matrix.
