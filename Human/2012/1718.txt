On the Boundaries of Trust and Security in Computing and Communications Systems

This article analyzes trust and security in computing and communications systems. While in human-life, trust usually has some kind of commonly understood meaning, in the realm of computing and communications systems, it could be interpreted differently in different environments and settings. On the other hand, security is about making sure that the participating entities are legitimate in a communication event or incident so that the core requirements of privacy, integrity, and authenticity are maintained. This notion is also true for our human life, even for example entering a house needs legitimacy of a person. Some boundary lines preserve the security; otherwise an unwanted access is called a 'security breach'. The intent of this article is to compare and discuss these two terms with our societal behavior and understanding amongst entities. To illustrate these issues especially in computing and communications world, some of the innovating and recent technologies are discussed which demand trust and security within their core operational structures. Alongside presenting generally established ideas, some critical points are mentioned that may be sometimes debatable within the research community.
