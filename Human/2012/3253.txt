LWE-based Identification Schemes

Some hard problems from lattices, like LWE (Learning with Errors), are particularly suitable for application in Cryptography due to the possibility of using worst-case to average-case reductions as evidence of strong security properties. In this work, we show two LWE-based constructions of zero-knowledge identification schemes and discuss their performance and security. We also highlight the design choices that make our solution of both theoretical and practical interest.
