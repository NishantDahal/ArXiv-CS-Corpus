The Distributed Ontology Language (DOL): Ontology Integration and Interoperability Applied to Mathematical Formalization

The Distributed Ontology Language (DOL) is currently being standardized within the OntoIOp (Ontology Integration and Interoperability) activity of ISO/TC 37/SC 3. It aims at providing a unified framework for (1) ontologies formalized in heterogeneous logics, (2) modular ontologies, (3) links between ontologies, and (4) annotation of ontologies.
  This paper focuses on an application of DOL's meta-theoretical features in mathematical formalization: validating relationships between ontological formalizations of mathematical concepts in COLORE (Common Logic Repository), which provide the foundation for formalizing real-world notions such as spatial and temporal relations.
