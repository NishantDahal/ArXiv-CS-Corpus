ViQIE: A New Approach for Visual Query Interpretation and Extraction

Web services are accessed via query interfaces which hide databases containing thousands of relevant information. User's side, distant database is a black box which accepts query and returns results, there is no way to access database schema which reflect data and query meanings. Hence, web services are very autonomous. Users view this autonomy as a major drawback because they need often to combine query capabilities of many web services at the same time. In this work, we will present a new approach which allows users to benefit of query capabilities of many web services while respecting autonomy of each service. This solution is a new contribution in Information Retrieval research axe and has proven good performances on two standard datasets.
