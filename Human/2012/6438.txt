Optimal Fillings - A new spatial subdivision problem related to packing and covering

We present filling as a new type of spatial subdivision problem that is related to covering and packing. Filling addresses the optimal placement of overlapping objects lying entirely inside an arbitrary shape so as to cover the most interior volume. In n-dimensional space, if the objects are polydisperse n-balls, we show that solutions correspond to sets of maximal n-balls and the solution space can reduced to the medial axis of a shape. We examine the structure of the solution space in two dimensions. For the filling of polygons, we provide detailed descriptions of a heuristic and a genetic algorithm for finding solutions of maximal discs. We also consider the properties of ideal distributions of N discs in polygons as N approaches infinity.
