Analytical Nonlocal Electrostatics Using Eigenfunction Expansions of Boundary-Integral Operators

In this paper, we present an analytical solution to nonlocal continuum electrostatics for an arbitrary charge distribution in a spherical solute. Our approach relies on two key steps: (1) re-formulating the PDE problem using boundary-integral equations, and (2) diagonalizing the boundary-integral operators using the fact their eigenfunctions are the surface spherical harmonics. To introduce this uncommon approach for analytical calculations in separable geometries, we rederive Kirkwood's classic results for a protein surrounded concentrically by a pure-water ion-exclusion layer and then a dilute electrolyte (modeled with the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation). Our main result, however, is an analytical method for calculating the reaction potential in a protein embedded in a nonlocal-dielectric solvent, the Lorentz model studied by Dogonadze and Kornyshev. The analytical method enables biophysicists to study the new nonlocal theory in a simple, computationally fast way; an open-source MATLAB implementation is included as supplemental information.
