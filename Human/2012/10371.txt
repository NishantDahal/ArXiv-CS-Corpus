Organic Memristor Devices for Logic Elements with Memory

Memristors are promising next-generation memory candidates that are nonvolatile, possess low power requirements and are capable of nanoscale fabrication. In this article we physically realise and describe the use of organic memristors in designing statefull boolean logic gates for the AND OR and NOT operations. The output of these gates is analog and dependent on the length of time that suitable charge is applied to the inputs, displaying a learning property. Results may be also interpreted in a traditional binary manner through use of a suitable thresholding function at the output. The memristive property of the gate allows the for the production of analog outputs that vary based on the charge-dependent nonvolatile state of the memristor. We provide experimental results of physical fabrication of three types of logic gate. A simulation of a one-bit full adder comprised of memristive logic gates is also included, displaying varying response to two distinct input patterns.
