Pseudo-random Aloha for Enhanced Collision-recovery in RFID

In this letter we motivate the need to revisit the MAC protocol used in Gen2 RFID system in order to leverage receiver structures with Collision Recovery capabilities at the PHY layer. To this end we propose to consider a simple variant of the Framed Slotted Aloha with pseudo-random (deterministic) slot selection as opposite to the classical random selection. Pseudo-random access allows naturally to implement Inter-frame Successive Interference Cancellation (ISIC) without changing the PHY modulation and coding format of legacy RFID standard. By means of simulations we show that ISIC can bring 20-25% gain in throughput with respect to traditional intra-frame SIC. Besides that, we elaborate on the potential of leveraging pseudo-random access protocols in combination with advanced PHY techniques in the context of RFID applications.
