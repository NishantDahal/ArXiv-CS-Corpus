A New Algorithm for the Subtraction Games

Subtraction games is a class of combinatorial games. It was solved since the Sprague-Grundy Theory was put forward. This paper described a new algorithm for subtraction games. The new algorithm can find win or lost positions in subtraction games. In addition, it is much simpler than Sprague-Grundy Theory in one pile of the games.
