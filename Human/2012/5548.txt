Hierarchical Clustering using Randomly Selected Similarities

The problem of hierarchical clustering items from pairwise similarities is found across various scientific disciplines, from biology to networking. Often, applications of clustering techniques are limited by the cost of obtaining similarities between pairs of items. While prior work has been developed to reconstruct clustering using a significantly reduced set of pairwise similarities via adaptive measurements, these techniques are only applicable when choice of similarities are available to the user. In this paper, we examine reconstructing hierarchical clustering under similarity observations at-random. We derive precise bounds which show that a significant fraction of the hierarchical clustering can be recovered using fewer than all the pairwise similarities. We find that the correct hierarchical clustering down to a constant fraction of the total number of items (i.e., clusters sized O(N)) can be found using only O(N log N) randomly selected pairwise similarities in expectation.
