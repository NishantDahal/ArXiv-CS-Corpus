Active Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering (CF) allows the preferences of multiple users to be     pooled to make recommendations regarding unseen products. We consider in this     paper the problem of online and interactive CF: given the current ratings     associated with a user, what queries (new ratings) would most improve the     quality of the recommendations made? We cast this terms of expected value of     information (EVOI); but the online computational cost of computing optimal     queries is prohibitive. We show how offline prototyping and computation of     bounds on EVOI can be used to dramatically reduce the required online     computation. The framework we develop is general, but we focus on derivations     and empirical study in the specific case of the multiple-cause vector     quantization model.
