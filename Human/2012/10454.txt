Self Authentication of color image through Wavelet Transformation Technique (SAWT)

In this paper a self organized legal document/content authentication, copyright protection in composite domain has been proposed without using any external information. Average values of transformed red and green components in frequency domain generated through wavelet transform are embedded into the blue component of the color image matrix in spatial domain. A reverse transformation is made in RG matrix to obtain embedded image in association with blue component in spatial domain. Reverse procedure is done during decoding where transformed average values are obtained from red and green components and compared with the same from blue component for authentication. Results are compared with existing technique which shows better performance interns of PSNR, MSE & IF.
