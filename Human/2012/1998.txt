Multiuser Detection in Asynchronous Multibeam Communications

This paper deals with multi-user detection techniques in asynchronous multibeam satellite communications. The proposed solutions are based on successive interference cancellation architecture (SIC) and channel decoding algorithms. The aim of these detection methods is to reduce the effect of cochannel interference due to co-frequency access, and consequently, improves the capacity of the mulitbeam communications systems, by improving frequency reuse. Channel estimation allows the determination of interference coefficients, which helps their effects compensation. The developed multiuser detections techniques are iterative. Therefore, detection quality is improved from a stage to another. Moreover, a signals combining method, which is integrated into these detection solutions, enhances their capability. The proposed solutions are evaluated through computer simulations, where an asynchronous multibeam satellite link is considered over an AWGN channel. The obtained simulation results showed the robustness of these multi-user detection techniques.
