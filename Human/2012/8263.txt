Short Report on: Possible directions to Auctions with Cryptographic pre-play

In auction theory, cryptography has been used to achieve anonymity of the participants, security and privacy of the bids, secure computation and to simulate mediator (auctioneer). Auction theory focuses on revenue and Cryptography focuses on security and privacy. Involving Cryptography at base level, to enhance revenue gives entirely new perspective and insight to Auction theory, thereby achieving the core goals of auction theory. In this report, we try to investigate an interesting field of study in Auction Theory using Cryptographic primitives.
