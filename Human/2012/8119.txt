Implementation of Radon Transformation for Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)

Radon Transformation is generally used to construct optical image (like CT image) from the projection data in biomedical imaging. In this paper, the concept of Radon Transformation is implemented to reconstruct Electrical Impedance Topographic Image (conductivity or resistivity distribution) of a circular subject. A parallel resistance model of a subject is proposed for Electrical Impedance Topography(EIT) or Magnetic Induction Tomography(MIT). A circular subject with embedded circular objects is segmented into equal width slices from different angles. For each angle, Conductance and Conductivity of each slice is calculated and stored in an array. A back projection method is used to generate a two-dimensional image from one-dimensional projections. As a back projection method, Inverse Radon Transformation is applied on the calculated conductance and conductivity to reconstruct two dimensional images. These images are compared to the target image. In the time of image reconstruction, different filters are used and these images are compared with each other and target image.
