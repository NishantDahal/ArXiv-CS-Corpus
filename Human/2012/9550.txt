On the Existence of Telescopers for Mixed Hypergeometric Terms

We present a criterion for the existence of telescopers for mixed hypergeometric terms, which is based on multiplicative and additive decompositions. The criterion enables us to determine the termination of Zeilberger's algorithms for mixed hypergeometric inputs.
