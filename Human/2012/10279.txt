Assessing Sentiment Strength in Words Prior Polarities

Many approaches to sentiment analysis rely on lexica where words are tagged with their prior polarity - i.e. if a word out of context evokes something positive or something negative. In particular, broad-coverage resources like SentiWordNet provide polarities for (almost) every word. Since words can have multiple senses, we address the problem of how to compute the prior polarity of a word starting from the polarity of each sense and returning its polarity strength as an index between -1 and 1. We compare 14 such formulae that appear in the literature, and assess which one best approximates the human judgement of prior polarities, with both regression and classification models.
