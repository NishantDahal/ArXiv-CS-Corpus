A Large-Scale Study of Online Shopping Behavior

The continuous growth of electronic commerce has stimulated great interest in studying online consumer behavior. Given the significant growth in online shopping, better understanding of customers allows better marketing strategies to be designed. While studies of online shopping attitude are widespread in the literature, studies of browsing habits differences in relation to online shopping are scarce.
  This research performs a large scale study of the relationship between Internet browsing habits of users and their online shopping behavior. Towards this end, we analyze data of 88,637 users who have bought more in total half a milion products from the retailer sites Amazon and Walmart. Our results indicate that even coarse-grained Internet browsing behavior has predictive power in terms of what users will buy online. Furthermore, we discover both surprising (e.g., "expensive products do not come with more effort in terms of purchase") and expected (e.g., "the more loyal a user is to an online shop, the less effort they spend shopping") facts.
  Given the lack of large-scale studies linking online browsing and online shopping behavior, we believe that this work is of general interest to people working in related areas.
