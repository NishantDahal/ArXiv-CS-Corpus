Obesity Heuristic, New Way On Artificial Immune Systems

There is a need for new metaphors from immunology to flourish the application areas of Artificial Immune Systems. A metaheuristic called Obesity Heuristic derived from advances in obesity treatment is proposed. The main forces of the algorithm are the generation omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. The algorithm works with Just-In-Time philosophy; by starting only when desired. A case study of data cleaning is provided. With experiments conducted on standard tables, results show that Obesity Heuristic outperforms other algorithms, with 100% recall. This is a great improvement over other algorithms
