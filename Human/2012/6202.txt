Algebraic Characterization of the Class of Languages recognized by Measure Only Quantum Automata

We study a model of one-way quantum automaton where only measurement operations are allowed (MOn-1qfa). We give an algebraic characterization of LMO, showing that the syntactic monoids of the languages in LMO are exactly the literal pseudovariety of J-trivial literally idempotent monoids, where J is the Green's relation determined by two-sided ideals. We also prove that LMO coincides with the literal variety of literally idempotent piecewise testable regular languages. This allows us to prove the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a regular language belongs to LMO.
