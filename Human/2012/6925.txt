Semantic Web Requirements through Web Mining Techniques

In recent years, Semantic web has become a topic of active research in several fields of computer science and has applied in a wide range of domains such as bioinformatics, life sciences, and knowledge management. The two fast-developing research areas semantic web and web mining can complement each other and their different techniques can be used jointly or separately to solve the issues in both areas. In addition, since shifting from current web to semantic web mainly depends on the enhancement of knowledge, web mining can play a key role in facing numerous challenges of this changing. In this paper, we analyze and classify the application of divers web mining techniques in different challenges of the semantic web in form of an analytical framework.
