Combined Descriptors in Spatial Pyramid Domain for Image Classification

Recently spatial pyramid matching (SPM) with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptor has been successfully used in image classification. Unfortunately, the codebook generation and feature quantization procedures using SIFT feature have the high complexity both in time and space. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an approach which combines local binary patterns (LBP) and three-patch local binary patterns (TPLBP) in spatial pyramid domain. The proposed method does not need to learn the codebook and feature quantization processing, hence it becomes very efficient. Experiments on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method always significantly outperforms the very popular SPM based SIFT descriptor method both in time and classification accuracy.
