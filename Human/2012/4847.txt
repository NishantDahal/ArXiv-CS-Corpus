Information theoretic security by the laws of classical physics

It has been shown recently that the use of two pairs of resistors with enhanced Johnson-noise and a Kirchhoff-loop-i.e., a Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) protocol-for secure key distribution leads to information theoretic security levels superior to those of a quantum key distribution, including a natural immunity against a man-in-the-middle attack. This issue is becoming particularly timely because of the recent full cracks of practical quantum communicators, as shown in numerous peer-reviewed publications. This presentation first briefly surveys the KLJN system and then discusses related, essential questions such as: what are perfect and imperfect security characteristics of key distribution, and how can these two types of securities be unconditional (or information theoretical)? Finally the presentation contains a live demonstration.
