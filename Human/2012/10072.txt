Domain ontology and multi-criteria analysis for enterprise modeling

Knowing that an enterprise is a complex reality, it is necessary to develop a modeling framework allowing the description of system structure and dynamics that alter the structure. The concept of enterprise modeling addresses this need and many techniques have emerged. Our goal is to provide leaders of Algerian enterprise an overview of modeling techniques. Thus these managers may elect, in collaboration with the University, the modeling technique best suited to their requirements. TWe believe that this could be a step towards an effective reorganization of the enterprise leading. TThis article proposes a domain ontology and multi-criteria analysis in the frame of modeling enterprise. Our approach is based on two stages using the Protégé tool for the technique representation and the PROMETHEE method for their evaluation. The result is a ranking between the different techniques, which allows selecting the most appropriate methodology according to the criteria for a given Tenterprise.
