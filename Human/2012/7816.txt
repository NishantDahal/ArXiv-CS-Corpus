Goldbach Triples and Key Distribution

This paper investigates the use of the number of Goldbach triples, or the number of three prime partitions of an odd number, for use in the generation and distribution of cryptographic keys. In addition to presenting randomness properties of these triples, which turn out to be similar to that of prime partitions of even numbers, we explore the question of restricted partition sets. We propose a protocol for key distribution that is based on these numbers. Two of the three partitions of the randomly chosen number serve as cover to send the third number to the two parties that wish to communicate with each other. This third number can serve as session key and the original number of which it is a partition can be used for audit purposes.
