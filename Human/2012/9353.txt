Key Generation and Certification using Multilayer Perceptron in Wireless communication(KGCMLP)

In this paper, a key generation and certification technique using multilayer perceptron (KGCMLP) has been proposed in wireless communication of data/information. In this proposed KGCMLP technique both sender and receiver uses an identical multilayer perceptrons. Both perceptrons are start synchronization by exchanging some control frames. During synchronization process message integrity test and synchronization test has been carried out. Only the synchronization test does not guarantee the security for this reason key certification phase also been introduced in KGCMLP technique. After Key generation and certification procedure synchronized identical weight vector forms the key for encryption/decryption. Parametric tests have been done and results are compared with some existing classical techniques, which show comparable results for the proposed technique.
