Smart Antenna for Cellular Mobile Communication

The adoption of smart / adaptive antenna techniques in future wireless systems is expected to have a significant impact on the efficient use of the spectrum, the minimization of the cost of establishing new wireless networks, the optimization of service quality and realization of transparent operation across multi technology wireless networks [1]. This paper presents brief account on smart antenna (SA) system. SAs can place nulls in the direction of interferers via adaptive updating of weights linked to each antenna element. SAs thus cancel out most of the co-channel interference resulting in better quality of reception and lower dropped calls. SAs can also track the user within a cell via direction of arrival algorithms [2]. This paper explains the architecture, evolution and how the smart / adaptive antenna differs from the basic format of antenna. The paper further explains about the radiation pattern of the antenna and why it is highly preferred in its relative field. The capabilities of smart / adaptive antenna are easily employable to Cognitive Radio and OFDMA system.
