Object Oriented Modelling of Idea using GA based efficient key generation for e-governance security (OOMIG)

Nowadays different state and central government in India as well as abroad are taking initiative to deliver different kind of services electronically specially using Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Intruders or hackers can steal or modify the information communicated between Government and consumer through internet. To implement privacy and confidentiality of the information we must use suitable encryption technique. In this paper an Object Oriented Modelling of International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) using GA based efficient key generation technique has been proposed to incorporate privacy and confidentiality of information which would be communicated between government and consumer.
