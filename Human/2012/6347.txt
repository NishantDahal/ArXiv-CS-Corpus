Expressibility at the machine level versus structure level: ESO universal Horn Logic and the class P

We show that ESO universal Horn logic (existential second logic where the first order part is a universal Horn formula) is insufficient to capture P, the class of problems decidable in polynomial time. This statement is true in the presence of a successor relation in the input vocabulary. We provide two proofs --- one based on reduced products of two structures, and another based on approximability theory (the second proof is under the assumption that P is not the same as NP). We show that the difference between the results here and those in Grädel (1991), is due to the fact that the expressions this paper deals with are at the "structure level", whereas the expressions in Grädel (1991) are at the "machine level" --- a case of Easier done than said.
