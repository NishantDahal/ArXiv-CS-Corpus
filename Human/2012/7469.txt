AutoAmp : An Open-Source Analog Amplifier Design Tool - For Classroom and Lab Purposes

This correspondence presents an open-source tool AutoAmp developed at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati. It is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/autoamp-iitg/ This tool helps the user to design different types of electronic amplifiers, using solid state devices, for a given specification. It can handle several types of designs namely common-emitter BJT amplifier (single and two-stage), operational amplifiers (inverting and non-inverting) and power amplifier. Not only does it design the amplifier, it also simulates the designed amplifier using SPICE simulator and displays the performance curves. This tool is deemed to prove invaluable in undergraduate teaching and labs. Especially in electronics-design related laboratories, the student need not design the amplifiers which are mostly the heart of many electronic designs.
