An Unsupervised Dynamic Image Segmentation using Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network based Genetic Algorithm

This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm based segmentation method that can automatically segment gray-scale images. The proposed method mainly consists of spatial unsupervised grayscale image segmentation that divides an image into regions. The aim of this algorithm is to produce precise segmentation of images using intensity information along with neighborhood relationships. In this paper, Fuzzy Hopfield Neural Network (FHNN) clustering helps in generating the population of Genetic algorithm which there by automatically segments the image. This technique is a powerful method for image segmentation and works for both single and multiple-feature data with spatial information. Validity index has been utilized for introducing a robust technique for finding the optimum number of components in an image. Experimental results shown that the algorithm generates good quality segmented image.
