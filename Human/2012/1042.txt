A Model for Web Page Usage Mining Based on Segmentation

The web page usage mining plays a vital role in enriching the page's content and structure based on the feedbacks received from the user's interactions with the page. This paper proposes a model for micro-managing the tracking activities by fine-tuning the mining from the page level to the segment level. The proposed model enables the web-master to identify the segments which receives more focus from users comparing with others. The segment level analytics of user actions provides an important metric to analyse the factors which facilitate the increase in traffic for the page. The empirical validation of the model is performed through prototype implementation.
