Computation of Difference Groebner Bases

To compute difference Groebner bases of ideals generated by linear polynomials we adopt to difference polynomial rings the involutive algorithm based on Janet-like division. The algorithm has been implemented in Maple in the form of the package LDA (Linear Difference Algebra) and we describe the main features of the package. Its applications are illustrated by generation of finite difference approximations to linear partial differential equations and by reduction of Feynman integrals. We also present the algorithm for an ideal generated by a finite set of nonlinear difference polynomials. If the algorithm terminates, then it constructs a Groebner basis of the ideal.
