Subword Complexity and k-Synchronization

We show that the subword complexity function p_x(n), which counts the number of distinct factors of length n of a sequence x, is k-synchronized in the sense of Carpi if x is k-automatic. As an application, we generalize recent results of Goldstein. We give analogous results for the number of distinct factors of length n that are primitive words or powers. In contrast, we show that the function that counts the number of unbordered factors of length n is not necessarily k-synchronized for k-automatic sequences.
