Systematic vs. Non-systematic Algorithms for Solving the MPE Task

The paper continues the study of partitioning based inference of heuristics     for search in the context of solving the Most Probable Explanation task in     Bayesian Networks. We compare two systematic Branch and Bound search     algorithms, BBBT (for which the heuristic information is constructed during     search and allows dynamic variable/value ordering) and its predecessor BBMB     (for which the heuristic information is pre-compiled), against a number of     popular local search algorithms for the MPE problem. We show empirically that,     when viewed as approximation schemes, BBBT/BBMB are superior to all of these     best known SLS algorithms, especially when the domain sizes increase beyond 2.     This is in contrast with the performance of SLS vs. systematic search on     CSP/SAT problems, where SLS often significantly outperforms systematic     algorithms. As far as we know, BBBT/BBMB are currently the best performing     algorithms for solving the MPE task.
