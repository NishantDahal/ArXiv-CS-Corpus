Comparative Analysis of dynamic graph techniques and data strucutre

Dynamically changing graphs are used in many applications of graph algorithms. The scope of these graphs are in graphics, communication networks and in VLSI designs where graphs are subjected to change, such as addition and deletion of edges and vertices. There is a rich body of the algorithms and data structures used for dynamic graphs. The paper overview the techniques and data structures used in various dynamic algorithms. The effort is tried to find out the comparison in these techniques namely the hierarchical decomposition of graphs and highlighting the ingenuity used in designing these algorithms.
