FlexiSec: A Configurable Link Layer Security Architecture for Wireless Sensor Networks

Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) indeed is critical; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well as due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment, with varying attributes and degrees of security required. The proliferation of the next generation sensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on low-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop communication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at the link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of being at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an energy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists a number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of the security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we show in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands of the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for investigating the feasibility of a configurable software-based link layer security architecture wherein an application can be compiled flexibly, with respect to its actual security demands. In this paper, we analyze, propose and experiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security architecture for WSNs. We also experimentally evaluate various aspects related to our scheme viz. configurable block ciphers, configurable block cipher modes of operations, configurable MAC sizes and configurable replay protection. The architecture proposed is aimed to offer the optimal level of security at the minimal overhead, thus saving the precious resources in the WSNs.
