Asynchrony from Synchrony

We consider synchronous dynamic networks which like radio networks may have asymmetric communication links, and are affected by communication rather than processor failures. In this paper we investigate the minimal message survivability in a per round basis that allows for the minimal global cooperation, i.e., allows to solve any task that is wait-free read-write solvable. The paper completely characterizes this survivability requirement. Message survivability is formalized by considering adversaries that have a limited power to remove messages in a round. Removal of a message on a link in one direction does not necessarily imply the removal of the message on that link in the other direction. Surprisingly there exist a single strongest adversary which solves any wait-free read/write task. Any different adversary that solves any wait-free read/write task is weaker, and any stronger adversary will not solve any wait-free read/write task. ABD \cite{ABD} who considered processor failure, arrived at an adversary that is $n/2$ resilient, consequently can solve tasks, such as $n/2$-set-consensus, which are not read/write wait-free solvable. With message adversaries, we arrive at an adversary which has exactly the read-write wait-free power. Furthermore, this adversary allows for a considerably simpler (simplest that we know of) proof that the protocol complex of any read/write wait-free task is a subdivided simplex, finally making this proof accessible for students with no algebraic-topology prerequisites, and alternatively dispensing with the assumption that the Immediate Snapshot complex is a subdivided simplex.
