Mechanisms and Behavior Prediction

This article discusses the possibility of predicting human behavior in a mechanism. Such a mechanism will have certain properties, which are defined and discussed here. Here it is shown that, unfortunately, certain property combinations are not possible. The impossibility result implies that either the such mechanism will not be finite or it would never be fully known. In both cases such a mechanism is inapplicable to fully predict human behavior.
