Secure electronic lock using pic 16f628a microcontroller

The proposed system implements the electronic embedded lock, its provides a great benefit over traditional lock, which use the manual key, so if the key lost or theft then anybody could open the lock, while thieving or losing the long and complex password is harder compare to traditional key, furthermore combining both manual key with computerized password make the system more secure. Long password will reduce the possibilities of breaking the code and opening the lock. The system comprised keypad, and HD44780 20x2 LCD Along with PIC16f628a microcontroller. The firmware control these components such that interaction with keypad is very is ver easy and smoothly, the LCD provide user with messages and notification to be informed about what is the system state. User can performing opening and closing the lock, changing the current password in the microcontroller EEPROM and clearing single digit while entering the password when wrong digit entered (back space). The proposed system firmware developed using assembly language with MPLAB development environment. It tested and implemented in real hardware with proper functioning and bug free.
