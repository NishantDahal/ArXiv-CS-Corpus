CloudPass - a passport system based on Cloud Computing and Near Field Communication

Wireless communication has penetrated into all fields of technology, especially in mobility, where wireless transactions are gaining importance with improvements in standards like 3G and 4G. There are many technologies that support the wireless forms of interactions between devices. One among them is NFC - Near Field Communication. In addition to NFC, other external technologies like Quick Response (QR) Codes assist in establishing interactions among participating devices. In this paper, we examine an approach that will involve standards and technologies like NFC, QR Codes and Cloud Infrastructure to design a mobile application which will perform desired functionalities. Cloud Storage is used as a reservoir to store the artifacts used by the application. Development and testing of the application is initially carried out on emulators or simulators followed by testing on real handsets/devices.
