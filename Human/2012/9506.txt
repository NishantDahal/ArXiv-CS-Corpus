Shattering-Extremal Systems

The Shatters relation and the VC dimension have been investigated since the early seventies. These concepts have found numerous applications in statistics, combinatorics, learning theory and computational geometry. Shattering extremal systems are set-systems with a very rich structure and many different characterizations. The goal of this thesis is to elaborate on the structure of these systems.
