Museum: Multidimensional web page segment evaluation model

The evaluation of a web page with respect to a query is a vital task in the web information retrieval domain. This paper proposes the evaluation of a web page as a bottom-up process from the segment level to the page level. A model for evaluating the relevancy is proposed incorporating six different dimensions. An algorithm for evaluating the segments of a web page, using the above mentioned six dimensions is proposed. The benefits of fine-granining the evaluation process to the segment level instead of the page level are explored. The proposed model can be incorporated for various tasks like web page personalization, result re-ranking, mobile device page rendering etc.
