Publishing Life Science Data as Linked Open Data: the Case Study of miRBase

This paper presents our Linked Open Data (LOD) infrastructures for genomic and experimental data related to microRNA biomolecules. Legacy data from two well-known microRNA databases with experimental data and observations, as well as change and version information about microRNA entities, are fused and exported as LOD. Our LOD server assists biologists to explore biological entities and their evolution, and provides a SPARQL endpoint for applications and services to query historical miRNA data and track changes, their causes and effects.
