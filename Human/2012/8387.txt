A Robust Lot Sizing Problem with Ill-known Demands

The paper deals with a lot sizing problem with ill-known demands modeled by fuzzy intervals whose membership functions are possibility distributions for the values of the uncertain demands. Optimization criteria, in the setting of possibility theory, that lead to choose robust production plans under fuzzy demands are given. Some algorithms for determining optimal robust production plans with respect to the proposed criteria, and for evaluating production plans are provided. Some computational experiments are presented.
