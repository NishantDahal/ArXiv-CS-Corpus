Homeomorphic approximation of the intersection curve of two rational surfaces

We present an approach of computing the intersection curve $\mathcal{C}$ of two rational parametric surface $ยง_1(u,s)$ and $ยง_2(v,t)$, one being projectable and hence can easily be implicitized. Plugging the parametric surface to the implicit surface yields a plane algebraic curve $G(v,t)=0$. By analyzing the topology graph $\G$ of $G(v,t)=0$ and the singular points on the intersection curve $\mathcal{C}$ we associate a space topology graph to $\mathcal{C}$, which is homeomorphic to $\mathcal{C}$ and therefore leads us to an approximation for $\mathcal{C}$ in a given precision.
