Quantum Hyperdense Coding for Distributed Communications

Superdense coding proved that entanglement-assisted quantum communications can improve the data transmission rates compared to classical systems. It allows sending 2 classical bits between the parties in exchange of 1 quantum bit and a pre-shared entangled Bell pair. This paper introduces a new protocol which is intended for distributed communication. Using a pre-shared entangled Bell pair and 1 classical bit 2,5 classical bits can be transmitted in average. This means not only valuable increase in capacity but the two-way distributed operation opens new fields of investigation.
