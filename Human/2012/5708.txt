Transmission of Voice Signal: BER Performance Analysis of Different FEC Schemes Based OFDM System over Various Channels

In this paper, we investigate the impact of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes namely Cyclic Redundancy Code and Convolution Code on the performance of OFDM wireless communication system for speech signal transmission over both AWGN and fading (Rayleigh and Rician) channels in term of Bit Error Probability. The simulation has been done in conjunction with QPSK digital modulation and compared with uncoded resultstal modulation. In the fading channels, it is found via computer simulation that the performance of the Convolution interleaved based OFDM systems outperform than that of CRC interleaved OFDM system as well as uncoded OFDM channels.
