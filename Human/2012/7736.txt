Correctness of an Incremental and Worst-Case Optimal Decision Procedure for Modal Logic with Eventualities

We present a simple theory explaining the construction and the correctness of an incremental and worst-case optimal decision procedure for modal logic with eventualities. The procedure gives an abstract account of important aspects of Gor√© and Widmann's PDL prover. Starting from an input formula, the procedure grows a Pratt-style graph tableau until the tableau proves or disproves the satisfiability of the formula. The procedure provides a basis for practical provers since satisfiability and unsatisfiability of formulas can often be determined with small tableaux.
