A Novel Metric Approach Evaluation For The Spatial Enhancement Of Pan-Sharpened Images

Various and different methods can be used to produce high-resolution multispectral images from high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN) and low-resolution multispectral images (MS), mostly on the pixel level. The Quality of image fusion is an essential determinant of the value of processing images fusion for many applications. Spatial and spectral qualities are the two important indexes that used to evaluate the quality of any fused image. However, the jury is still out of fused image's benefits if it compared with its original images. In addition, there is a lack of measures for assessing the objective quality of the spatial resolution for the fusion methods. So, an objective quality of the spatial resolution assessment for fusion images is required. Therefore, this paper describes a new approach proposed to estimate the spatial resolution improve by High Past Division Index (HPDI) upon calculating the spatial-frequency of the edge regions of the image and it deals with a comparison of various analytical techniques for evaluating the Spatial quality, and estimating the colour distortion added by image fusion including: MG, SG, FCC, SD, En, SNR, CC and NRMSE. In addition, this paper devotes to concentrate on the comparison of various image fusion techniques based on pixel and feature fusion technique.
