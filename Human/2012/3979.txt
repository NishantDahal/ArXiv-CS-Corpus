Towards the Solution of Power Dissipation in Electronics Systems through Thermodynamics

Power loss in the electronic system is a very crucial limiting factor that can be reduced or minimized with the help of using the reversible logics "a concept came from Thermodynamics". In this paper the authors shows the concept of reversible logics for the Electronics system. The logical and physical designing approach is given in the paper in detail. The contradiction of logical and physical reversibility with the conventional CMOS designing is also shows and the solution of that contradiction is also proposed by the authors using adiabatic logic. This Paper gives a complete and clear idea if the thermodynamical concept for the electronics industries for power reduction.
