Near-Optimal Deterministic Algorithms for Volume Computation and Lattice Problems via M-Ellipsoids

We give a deterministic 2^{O(n)} algorithm for computing an M-ellipsoid of a convex body, matching a known lower bound. This has several interesting consequences including improved deterministic algorithms for volume estimation of convex bodies and the shortest and closest lattice vector problems under general norms.
