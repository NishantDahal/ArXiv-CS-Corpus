Seamless Handover for IMS over Mobile-IPv6 Using Context Transfer

Mobility support for the next generation IPv6 networks has been one of the recent research issues due to the growing demand for wireless services over internet. In the other hand, 3GPP has introduced IP Multimedia Subsystem as the next generation IP based infrastructure for wireless and wired multimedia services. In this paper we present two context transfer mechanisms based on predictive and reactive schemes, to support seamless handover in IMS over Mobile IPv6. Those schemes reduce handover latency by transferring appropriate session information between the old and the new access networks. Moreover, we present two methods for QoS parameters negotiations to preserve service quality along the mobile user movement path. The performances of the proposed mechanisms are evaluated by simulations.
