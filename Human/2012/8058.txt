Strong Faithfulness and Uniform Consistency in Causal Inference

A fundamental question in causal inference is whether it     is possible to reliably infer manipulation effects from observational     data. There are a variety of senses of asymptotic reliability in the     statistical literature, among which the most commonly discussed     frequentist notions are pointwise consistency and uniform     consistency. Uniform consistency is in general preferred to pointwise     consistency because the former allows us to control the worst case     error bounds with a finite sample size. In the sense of pointwise     consistency, several reliable causal inference algorithms have been     established under the Markov and Faithfulness assumptions [Pearl 2000,     Spirtes et al. 2001]. In the sense of uniform consistency, however,     reliable causal inference is impossible under the two assumptions when     time order is unknown and/or latent confounders are present [Robins et     al. 2000]. In this paper we present two natural generalizations of the     Faithfulness assumption in the context of structural equation models,     under which we show that the typical algorithms in the literature (in     some cases with modifications) are uniformly consistent even when the     time order is unknown. We also discuss the situation where latent     confounders may be present and the sense in which the Faithfulness     assumption is a limiting case of the stronger assumptions.
