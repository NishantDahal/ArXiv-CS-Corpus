A Novel Design for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata Cells and Full Adders

Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a novel and potentially attractive technology for implementing computing architectures at the nanoscale. The basic Boolean primitive in QCA is the majority gate. In this paper we present a novel design for QCA cells and another possible and unconventional scheme for majority gates. By applying these items, the hardware requirements for a QCA design can be reduced and circuits can be simpler in level and gate counts. As an example, a 1-bit QCA adder is constructed by applying our new scheme and is compared to the other existing implementation. Beside, some Boolean functions are expressed as examples and it has been shown, how our reduction method by using new proposed item, decreases gate counts and levels in comparison to the other previous methods.
