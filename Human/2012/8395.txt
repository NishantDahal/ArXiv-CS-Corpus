Attribute-Based Encryption for Circuits from Multilinear Maps

In this work, we provide the first construction of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) for general circuits. Our construction is based on the existence of multilinear maps. We prove selective security of our scheme in the standard model under the natural multilinear generalization of the BDDH assumption. Our scheme achieves both Key-Policy and Ciphertext-Policy variants of ABE.
