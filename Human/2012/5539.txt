A new algorithm for extracting a small representative subgraph from a very large graph

Many real-world networks are prohibitively large for data retrieval, storage and analysis of all of its nodes and links. Understanding the structure and dynamics of these networks entails creating a smaller representative sample of the full graph while preserving its relevant topological properties. In this report, we show that graph sampling algorithms currently proposed in the literature are not able to preserve network properties even with sample sizes containing as many as 20% of the nodes from the original graph. We present a new sampling algorithm, called Tiny Sample Extractor, with a new goal of a sample size smaller than 5% of the original graph while preserving two key properties of a network, the degree distribution and its clustering co-efficient. Our approach is based on a new empirical method of estimating measurement biases in crawling algorithms and compensating for them accordingly. We present a detailed comparison of best known graph sampling algorithms, focusing in particular on how the properties of the sample subgraphs converge to those of the original graph as they grow. These results show that our sampling algorithm extracts a smaller subgraph than other algorithms while also achieving a closer convergence to the degree distribution, measured by the degree exponent, of the original graph. The subgraph generated by the Tiny Sample Extractor, however, is not necessarily representative of the full graph with regard to other properties such as assortativity. This indicates that the problem of extracting a truly representative small subgraph from a large graph remains unsolved.
