Global Optimal Solution to Discrete Value Selection Problem with Inequality Constraints

This paper presents a canonical dual method for solving a quadratic discrete value selection problem subjected to inequality constraints. The problem is first transformed into a problem with quadratic objective and 0-1 integer variables. The dual problem of the 0-1 programming problem is thus constructed by using the canonical duality theory. Under appropriate conditions, this dual problem is a maximization problem of a concave function over a convex continuous space. Numerical simulation studies, including some large scale problems, are carried out so as to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method proposed.
