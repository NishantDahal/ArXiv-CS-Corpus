Bibliometric Networks

This text is based on a translation of a chapter in a handbook about network analysis (published in German) where we tried to make beginners familiar with some basic notions and recent developments of network analysis applied to bibliometric issues (Havemann and Scharnhorst 2010). We have added some recent references.
