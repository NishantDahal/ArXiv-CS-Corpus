Random Sequences from Primitive Pythagorean Triples

This paper shows that the six classes of PPTs can be put into two groups. Autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions of the six classes derived from the gaps between each class type have been computed. It is shown that Classes A and D (in which the largest term is divisible by 5) are different from the other four classes in their randomness properties if they are ordered by the largest term. In the other two orderings each of the six random Baudhayana sequences has excellent randomness properties.
