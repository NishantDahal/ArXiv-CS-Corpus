Effect of AWGN & Fading (Raleigh & Rician) channels on BER performance of a WiMAX communication System

The emergence of WIMAX has attracted significant interests from all fields of wireless communications including students, researchers, system engineers and operators. The WIMAX can also be considered to be the main technology in the implementation of other networks like wireless sensor networks. Developing an understanding of the WIMAX system can be achieved by looking at the model of the WIMAX system. This paper discusses the model building of the WIMAX physical layer using computer MATLAB 7.5 versions. This model is a useful tool for BER (Bit error rate) performance evaluation for the real data communication by the WIMAX physical layer under different communication channels AWGN and fading channel (Rayleigh and Rician), different channel encoding rates and digital modulation schemes which is described in this paper. This paper investigates the effect of communication channels of IEEE 802.16 OFDM based WIMAX Physical Layer. The performance measures we presented in this paper are: the bit error rate (BER) versus the ratio of bit energy to noise power spectral density (Eb/No). The system parameters used in this paper are based on IEEE 802.16 standards. The simulation model built for this research work, demonstrates that AWGN channel has better performance than Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. Synthetic data is used to simulate this research work.
