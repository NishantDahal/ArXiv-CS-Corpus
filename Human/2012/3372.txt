Steganography Using Adaptive Pixel Value Differencing(APVD) of Gray Images Through Exclusion of Overflow/Underflow

In a gray scale image the pixel value ranges from 0 to 255. But when we use pixel-value differencing (pvd) method as image steganographic scheme, the pixel values in the stego-image may exceed gray scale range. An adaptive steganography based on modified pixel-value differencing through management of pixel values within the range of gray scale has been proposed in this paper. PVD method is used and check whether the pixel value exceeds the range on embedding. Positions where the pixel exceeds boundary has been marked and a delicate handle is used to keep the value within the range. From the experimental it is seen that the results obtained in proposed method provides with identical payload and visual fidelity of stego-image compared to the pvd method.
