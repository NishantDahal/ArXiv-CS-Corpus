Productivity of Non-Orthogonal Term Rewrite Systems

Productivity is the property that finite prefixes of an infinite constructor term can be computed using a given term rewrite system. Hitherto, productivity has only been considered for orthogonal systems, where non-determinism is not allowed. This paper presents techniques to also prove productivity of non-orthogonal term rewrite systems. For such systems, it is desired that one does not have to guess the reduction steps to perform, instead any outermost-fair reduction should compute an infinite constructor term in the limit. As a main result, it is shown that for possibly non-orthogonal term rewrite systems this kind of productivity can be concluded from context-sensitive termination. This result can be applied to prove stabilization of digital circuits, as will be illustrated by means of an example.
