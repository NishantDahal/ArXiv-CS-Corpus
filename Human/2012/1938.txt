An Agile Method for E-Service Composition

Nowadays, application of Service Oriented Architecture is increasing rapidly; especially since introduction of distributed electronic services on the web. SOA software has a modular manner and works as a collaboration of independent software components. As a result, e-service approach is sufficient for software with independent components, each of which may be developed by a different company. Such software components and their cooperation form a composite service. Agile methodologies are the best candidate for developing small software components. Composite services and its building blocks are small pieces of software, making agile methodology a perfect fit for their development. In this paper, we introduce an agile method for service composition, inspired by agile patterns and practices. Therefore, across the agile manifesto, we can develop low cost, high quality composite services quickly using this method.
