Performance Issues of Heterogeneous Hadoop Clusters in Cloud Computing

Nowadays most of the cloud applications process large amount of data to provide the desired results. Data volumes to be processed by cloud applications are growing much faster than computing power. This growth demands new strategies for processing and analyzing information. Dealing with large data volumes requires two things: 1) Inexpensive, reliable storage 2) New tools for analyzing unstructured and structured data. Hadoop is a powerful open source software platform that addresses both of these problems. The current Hadoop implementation assumes that computing nodes in a cluster are homogeneous in nature. Hadoop lacks performance in heterogeneous clusters where the nodes have different computing capacity. In this paper we address the issues that affect the performance of hadoop in heterogeneous clusters and also provided some guidelines on how to overcome these bottlenecks
