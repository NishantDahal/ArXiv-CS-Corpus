Solution regions in the parameter space of a 3-RRR decoupled robot for a prescribed workspace

This paper proposes a new design method to determine the feasible set of parameters of translational or position/orientation decoupled parallel robots for a prescribed singularity-free workspace of regular shape. The suggested method uses Groebner bases to define the singularities and the cylindrical algebraic decomposition to characterize the set of parameters. It makes it possible to generate all the robot designs. A 3-RRR decoupled robot is used to validate the proposed design method.
