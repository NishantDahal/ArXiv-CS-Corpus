Novel Framework for Mobile Collaborative learning (MCL)to substantiate pedagogical activities

Latest study shows that MCL is highly focusing paradigm for research particularity in distance and online education. MCL provides some features and functionalities for all participants to obtain the knowledge. Deployment of new emerging technologies and fast growing trends toward MCL boom attract people to develop learning management system, virtual learning environment and conference system with support of MCL. All these environments lack the most promising supportive framework. In addition some of major challenges in open, large scale, dynamic and heterogeneous environments are not still handled in developing MCL for education and other organizations. These issues includes such as knowledge sharing, faster delivery of contents, request for modified contents, complete access to enterprise data warehouse, delivery of large rich multimedia contents (video-on-demand), asynchronous collaboration, synchronous collaboration, support for multi model, provision for archive updating, user friendly interface, middleware support and virtual support. To overcome these issues; the paper introduces novel framework for MCL consisting of four layers with many promising functional components, which provide access to users for obtaining required contents from enterprise data warehouse (EDW). Novel framework provides information regarding the course materials, easy access to check the grades and use of labs. The applications running on this framework give substantial feedback for collaboration such as exchange for delivery of communication contents including platform for group discussion, short message service (SMS), emails, audio, video and video-on-demand to obtain on-line information to students and other persons who will be part of collaboration.
