A Framework of Value Exchange and Role Playing in Web 2.0 WebSites

Digitally engaged communities can be described as communities created and evolved within Web 2.0 Websites such as Facebook, Bebo, and Twitter. The growing importance of digitally engaged communities calls for the need to efficiently manage the building blocks of sustaining a healthy community. The initial operation of any digitally-engaged community depends on the existence of its own members, the beneficial values created and exchanged, and the relationships interlinking both. However, the level of contribution and involvement might vary depending on the benefits being gratified from engaging in such communities. In other words, motivations for participating and getting involved are purposive; individuals are driven into joining and /or taking part in any digitallyengaged network for capturing and purtaining certain beneficial values. Accordingly, this paper proposes a framework that classifies the values created and exchanged within these communities as well as the roles adopted and played by users of these communities. Utilizing ethnography as the primay methodological strategy to study Bebo digitally-engaged community, this research identifies five different roles of users: Newbie, Lurker, Novice, Insider, and Leader. Moreover, the research also identifies five value elements that could be captured by different users: Social, Hedonic, Epistemic, Gift, and Utilitarian. The results of this study provides insights for decision and policy makers, service providers, and developers; as it inspires them in knowing and meeting the needs and values of participants based on the roles adopted by users.
