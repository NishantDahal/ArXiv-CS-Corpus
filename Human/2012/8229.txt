On Construction of a Class of Orthogonal Arrays (Thesis)

We propose a novel method for the construction of orthogonal arrays. The algorithm makes use of the Kronecker Product operator in association with unit column vectors to generate new orthogonal arrays from existing orthogonal arrays. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm lies in the fact that it works well with any linear seed orthogonal array without imposing any constraints on the strength or the number of levels. The resulting orthogonal array has the same strength as the seed orthogonal array. We also discuss the proof of correctness of the algorithm. In the Results section we provide a list of new orthogonal arrays generated using this algorithm, that are currently not present in the libraries of orthogonal arrays.
