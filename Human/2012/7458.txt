Communication-Efficient and Exact Clustering Distributed Streaming Data

A widely used approach to clustering a single data stream is the two-phased approach in which the online phase creates and maintains micro-clusters while the off-line phase generates the macro-clustering from the micro-clusters. We use this approach to propose a distributed framework for clustering streaming data. Our proposed framework consists of fundamen- tal processes: one coordinator-site process and many remote-site processes. Remote-site processes can directly communicate with the coordinator-process but cannot communicate the other remote site processes. Every remote-site process generates and maintains micro- clusters that represent cluster information summary, from its local data stream. Remote sites send the local micro-clusterings to the coordinator by the serialization technique, or the coordinator invokes the remote methods in order to get the local micro-clusterings from the remote sites. After the coordinator receives all the local micro-clusterings from the remote sites, it generates the global clustering by the macro-clustering method. Our theoretical and empirical results show that, the global clustering generated by our distributed framework is similar to the clustering generated by the underlying centralized algorithm on the same data set. By using the local micro-clustering approach, our framework achieves high scalability, and communication-efficiency.
