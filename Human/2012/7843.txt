Hybrid systems modeling for gas transmission network

Gas Transmission Networks are large-scale complex systems, and corresponding design and control problems are challenging. In this paper, we consider the problem of control and management of these systems in crisis situations. We present these networks by a hybrid systems framework that provides required analysis models. Further, we discuss decision-making using computational discrete and hybrid optimization methods. In particular, several reinforcement learning methods are employed to explore decision space and achieve the best policy in a specific crisis situation. Simulations are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the method.
