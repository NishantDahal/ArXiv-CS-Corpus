An Overview on Clustering Methods

Clustering is a common technique for statistical data analysis, which is used in many fields, including machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, image analysis and bioinformatics. Clustering is the process of grouping similar objects into different groups, or more precisely, the partitioning of a data set into subsets, so that the data in each subset according to some defined distance measure. This paper covers about clustering algorithms, benefits and its applications. Paper concludes by discussing some limitations.
