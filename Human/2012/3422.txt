On the Stretch Factor of Randomly Embedded Random Graphs

We consider a random graph G(n,p) whose vertex set V has been randomly embedded in the unit square and whose edges are given weight equal to the geometric distance between their end vertices. Then each pair {u,v} of vertices have a distance in the weighted graph, and a Euclidean distance. The stretch factor of the embedded graph is defined as the maximum ratio of these two distances, over all u,v in V. We give upper and lower bounds on the stretch factor (holding asymptotically almost surely), and show that for p not too close to 0 or 1, these bounds are best possible in a certain sense. Our results imply that the stretch factor is bounded with probability tending to 1 if and only if n(1-p) tends to 0, answering a question of O'Rourke.
