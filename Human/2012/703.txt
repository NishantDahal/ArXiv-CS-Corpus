Proceedings 7th Workshop on Model-Based Testing

This volume contains the proceedings of the Seventh Workshop on Model-Based Testing (MBT 2012), which was held on 25 March, 2012 in Tallinn, Estonia, as a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2012. 
  The workshop is devoted to model-based testing of both software and hardware. Model-based testing uses models describing the required behavior of the system under consideration to guide such efforts as test selection and test results evaluation. Testing validates the real system behavior against models and checks that the implementation conforms to them, but is capable also to find errors in the models themselves. 
  The first MBT workshop was held in 2004, in Barcelona. At that time MBT already had become a hot topic, but the MBT workshop was the first event devoted mostly to this topic. Since that time the area has generated enormous scientific interest, and today there are several specialized workshops and more broad conferences on software and hardware design and quality assurance covering model based testing. MBT has become one of the most powerful system analysis tools, one of the latest hot topic related is applying MBT in security analysis and testing. MBT workshop tries to keep up with current trends. In 2012 "industrial paper" category was added to the program and two industrial papers were accepted by the program committee.
