A search for Wilson primes

A Wilson prime is a prime p such that (p-1)! = -1 mod p^2. We report on a search for Wilson primes up to 2 * 10^13, and describe several new algorithms that were used in the search. In particular we give the first known algorithm that computes (p-1)! mod p^2 in average polynomial time per prime.
