On the Covering Radius of Some Modular Codes

This paper gives lower and upper bounds on the covering radius of codes over $\Z_{2^s}$ with respect to homogenous distance. We also determine the covering radius of various Repetition codes, Simplex codes (Type $α$ and Type $β$) and their dual and give bounds on the covering radii for MacDonald codes of both types over $\Z_4$.
