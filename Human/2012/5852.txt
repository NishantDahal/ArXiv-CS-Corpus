Novel Grey Interval Weight Determining and Hybrid Grey Interval Relation Method in Multiple Attribute Decision-Making

This paper proposes a grey interval relation TOPSIS for the decision making in which all of the attribute weights and attribute values are given by the interval grey numbers. The feature of our method different from other grey relation decision-making is that all of the subjective and objective weights are obtained by interval grey number and that decisionmaking is performed based on the relative approach degree of grey TOPSIS, the relative approach degree of grey incidence and the relative membership degree of grey incidence using 2-dimensional Euclidean distance. The weighted Borda method is used for combining the results of three methods. An example shows the applicability of the proposed approach.
