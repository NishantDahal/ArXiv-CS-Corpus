Deploying Health Monitoring ECU Towards Enhancing the Performance of In-Vehicle Network

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are the fundamental electronic building blocks of any automotive system. They are multi-purpose, multi-chip and multicore computer systems where more functionality is delivered in software rather than hardware. ECUs are valuable assets for the vehicles as critical time bounded messages are communicated through. Looking into the safety criticality, already developed mission critical systems such as ABS, ESP etc, rely fully on electronic components leading to increasing requirements of more reliable and dependable electronic systems in vehicles. Hence it is inevitable to maintain and monitor the health of an ECU which will enable the ECUs to be followed, assessed and improved throughout their life-cycle starting from their inception into the vehicle. In this paper, we propose a Health monitoring ECU that enables the early trouble shooting and servicing of the vehicle prior to any catastrophic failure.
