Wireless Public key Infrastructure for Mobile Phones

Mobile devices play an important role in the wireless network environment for providing different services over internet. The business transactions over wireless electronic devices are not secure and hence the messages are prone to be intercepted and modified by an intruder. So, devices supporting wireless internet must be guaranteed at the same level of security as the wired network. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) used in the wired environment is not suitable for wireless environment because of the less powerful processor and small memory. This arises a need for the development of a Wireless Public Key Infrastructure (WPKI) that provides the similar security level as the wired PKI suitable for mobile phone. In this paper, a discussion of public key infrastructure and an experimental set up for Wireless Public key Infrastructure for mobile phones are made.
