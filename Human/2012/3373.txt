Proactive TCP mechanism to improve Handover performance in Mobile Satellite and Terrestrial Networks

Emerging standardization of Geo Mobile Radio (GMR-1) for satellite system is having strong resemblance to terrestrial GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) at the upper protocol layers and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of them. This space segment technology as well as terrestrial technology, is characterized by periodic variations in communication properties and coverage causing the termination of ongoing call as connections of Mobile Nodes (MN) alter stochastically. Although provisions are made to provide efficient communication infrastructure this hybrid space and terrestrial networks must ensure the end-to-end network performance so that MN can move seamlessly among these networks. However from connectivity point of view current TCP performance has not been engineered for mobility events in multi-radio MN. Traditionally, TCP has applied a set of congestion control algorithms (slow-start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, fast recovery) to probe the currently available bandwidth on the connection path. These algorithms need several round-trip times to find the correct transmission rate (i.e. congestion window), and adapt to sudden changes connectivity due to handover. While there are protocols to maintain the connection continuity on mobility events, such as Mobile IP (MIP) and Host Identity Protocol (HIP), TCP performance engineering has had less attention. TCP is implemented as a separate component in an operating system, and is therefore often unaware of the mobility events or the nature of multi-radios' communication. This paper aims to improve TCP communication performance in Mobile satellite and terrestrial networks.
