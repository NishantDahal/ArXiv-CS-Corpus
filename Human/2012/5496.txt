High Reliable secure data collection using Complexity exchanging code key method addressing protocol in Wireless Sensor Network

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is emerging field in Information and communication technology. In WSN data transmission and data collection are unsecure because of sensor node Incompatibility. So providing security to Sensor network is very important. The key based Mechanism is secure data collection and it's mainly used to guarantee data confidentiality. Range pair wise key is largely used due to the necessary of data encryption and decryption between each pair range of communication node. Fixed key mechanism difficult for the attacker to detect the regularity of the randomly generated key chain function in privacy homomorphism (PH).PH means no intermediate node to encrypt and decrypt only direct collect and aggregate data for encryption and decryption. It is special key based scheme. It's totally based on beta distribution and some statistical tool using key code method by using Complexity exchanging code key method addressing protocol. We show how to reduce significant attacks and secure data collection on wireless sensor network.
