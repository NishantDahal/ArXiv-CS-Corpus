Theoretical Modeling and Simulation of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for Clock Data Recovery (CDR)

Modern communication and computer systems require rapid (Gbps), efficient and large bandwidth data transfers. Agressive scaling of digital integrated systems allow buses and communication controller circuits to be integrated with the microprocessor on the same chip. The Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) protocol handles all communcation between the central processing unit (CPU) and hardware devices. PCIe buses require efficient clock data recovery circuits (CDR) to recover clock signals embedded in data during transmission. This paper describes the theoretical modeling and simulation of a phase-locked loop (PLL) used in a CDR circuit. A simple PLL architecture for a 5 GHz CDR circuit is proposed and elaborated in this work. Simulations were carried out using a Hardware Description Language, Verilog- AMS. The effect of jitter on the proposed design is also simulated and evaluated in this work. It was found that the proposed design is robust against both input and VCO jitter.
