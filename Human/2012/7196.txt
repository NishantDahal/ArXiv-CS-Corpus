Band Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Images using Mutual Information: An algorithm based on minimizing the error probability using the inequality of Fano

Hyperspectral image is a substitution of more than a hundred images, called bands, of the same region. They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies. The reference image of the region is called Ground Truth map (GT). the problematic is how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions; because the bands can be not only redundant, but a source of confusion, and decreasing so the accuracy of classification. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and threshold, to select relevant bands. Recently there's an algorithm selection based on mutual information, using bandwidth rejection and a threshold to control and eliminate redundancy. The band top ranking the MI is selected, and if its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered redundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method, because this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious information can be discarded. In this paper we'll make difference between useful and useless redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it contributes to decreasing error probability. According to this scheme, we introduce new algorithm using also mutual information, but it retains only the bands minimizing the error probability of classification. To control redundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold. So the good band candidate must contribute to decrease the last error probability augmented by the threshold. This process is a wrapper strategy; it gets high performance of classification accuracy but it is expensive than filter strategy.
