A DDS-Based Scalable and Reconfigurable Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) involve the interconnection of heterogeneous computing devices which are closely integrated with the physical processes under control. Often, these systems are resource-constrained and require specific features such as the ability to adapt in a timeliness and efficient fashion to dynamic environments. Also, they must support fault tolerance and avoid single points of failure. This paper describes a scalable framework for CPSs based on the OMG DDS standard. The proposed solution allows reconfiguring this kind of systems at run-time and managing efficiently their resources.
