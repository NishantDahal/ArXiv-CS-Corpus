Estimation of Effort in Software Cost Analysis for Heterogenous Dataset using Fuzzy Analogy

One of the significant objectives of software engineering community is to use effective and useful models for precise calculation of effort in software cost estimation. The existing techniques cannot handle the dataset having categorical variables efficiently including the commonly used analogy method. Also, the project attributes of cost estimation are measured in terms of linguistic values whose imprecision leads to confusion and ambiguity while explaining the process. There are no definite set of models which can efficiently handle the dataset having categorical variables and endure the major hindrances such as imprecision and uncertainty without taking the classical intervals and numeric value approaches. In this paper, a new approach based on fuzzy logic, linguistic quantifiers and analogy based reasoning is proposed to enhance the performance of the effort estimation in software projects dealing with numerical and categorical data. The performance of this proposed method illustrates that there is a realistic validation of the results while using historical heterogeneous dataset. The results were analyzed using the Mean Magnitude Relative Error (MMRE) and indicates that the proposed method can produce more explicable results than the methods which are in vogue.
