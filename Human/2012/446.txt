Towards Self-Service Governance by Means of Information Technology

In this paper we present a novel model for governing societies based on modern information technology, which neither relies on manual bureaucratic labor, nor depends on process-based e-government services for governance. We expose the flaws of the later and argue that it is not feasible for sustainable governance due to permanently changing laws and instead propose a model in which people can govern themselves in a self-service manner by relying on constellations of data stored in a network of governmental databases to which citizen and officials have read- and write access under rules defined by temporary valid law.
