Proceedings 8th International Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic

This volume contains the proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2011), which was held October 27-29, 2011 at Radboud University Nijmegen. The goal of this workshop series is to bring together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing and spatio-temporal causal structures, and in particular those that use logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantic methods and other computer science methods for the study of physical behavior in general. Over the past few years, there has been growing activity in these foundational approaches, together with a renewed interest in the foundations of quantum theory, which complement the more mainstream research in quantum computation.
