A Block Cipher using Rotation and Logical XOR Operations

Cryptography is the study of methods of sending messages in disguised form so that only the intended recipients can remove the disguise and read the messages. Information security has become a very critical aspect of modern communication systems. With the global acceptance of the Internet as a medium of communication, virtually every computer in the world is connected to every other. It has created a new risk for the users of the computers with a constant threat of being hacked and being victims of data theft. In this connection data encryption has become an essential part of secure communication of the messages. In the present paper we propose a new method of encryption of data in blocks using the operations Rotation and Logical XOR
