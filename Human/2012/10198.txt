Use of BESTEST procedure to improve a building thermal simulation program

Validation of building energy simulation programs is of major interest to both users and modellers. To achieve such a task, it is essential to apply a methodology based on a priori test and empirical validation. A priori test consists in verifying that models embedded in a program and their implementation are correct. this should be achieved before carrying out experiments. The aim of this report is to present results from the application of the BESTEST procedure to our code. We will emphasise the way it allows to find bugs in our program and also how it permits to qualify models of heat transfer by conduction
