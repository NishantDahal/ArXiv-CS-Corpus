Design of English-Hindi Translation Memory for Efficient Translation

Developing parallel corpora is an important and a difficult activity for Machine Translation. This requires manual annotation by Human Translators. Translating same text again is a useless activity. There are tools available to implement this for European Languages, but no such tool is available for Indian Languages. In this paper we present a tool for Indian Languages which not only provides automatic translations of the previously available translation but also provides multiple translations, in cases where a sentence has multiple translations, in ranked list of suggestive translations for a sentence. Moreover this tool also lets translators have global and local saving options of their work, so that they may share it with others, which further lightens the task.
