A Survey Of Activity Recognition And Understanding The Behavior In Video Survelliance

This paper presents a review of human activity recognition and behaviour understanding in video sequence. The key objective of this paper is to provide a general review on the overall process of a surveillance system used in the current trend. Visual surveillance system is directed on automatic identification of events of interest, especially on tracking and classification of moving objects. The processing step of the video surveillance system includes the following stages: Surrounding model, object representation, object tracking, activity recognition and behaviour understanding. It describes techniques that use to define a general set of activities that are applicable to a wide range of scenes and environments in video sequence.
