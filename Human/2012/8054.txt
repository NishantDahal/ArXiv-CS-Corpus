Markov Random Walk Representations with Continuous Distributions

Representations based on random walks can exploit discrete data distributions for clustering and classification. We extend such representations from discrete to continuous distributions. Transition probabilities are now calculated using a diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that inversely depends on the data density. We relate this diffusion equation to a path integral and derive the corresponding path probability measure. The framework is useful for incorporating continuous data densities and prior knowledge.
