A New UWB System Based on a Frequency Domain Transformation Of The Received Signal

Differential system for ultra wide band (UWB) transmission is a very attractive solution from a practical point of view. In this paper, we present a new direct sequence (DS) UWB system based on the conversion of the received signal from time domain to frequency domain that's why we called FDR receiver. Simulation results show that the proposed receiver structure outperforms the classical differential one for both low and high data rate systems.
