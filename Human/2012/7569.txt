Surveying the Social, Smart and Converged TV Landscape: Where is Television Research Headed?

The TV is dead motto of just a few years ago has been replaced by the prospect of Internet Protocol (IP) television experiences over converged networks to become one of the great technology opportunities in the next few years. As an introduction to the Special Issue on Smart, Social and Converged Television, this extended editorial intends to review the current IP television landscape in its many realizations: operator-based, over-the-top, and user generated. We will address new services like social TV and recommendation engines, dissemination including new paradigms built on peer to peer and content centric networks, as well as the all important quality of experience that challenges services and networks alike. But we intend to go further than just review the existing work by proposing areas for the future of television research. These include strategies to provide services that are more efficient in network and energy usage while being socially engaging, novel services that will provide consumers with a broader choice of content and devices, and metrics that will enable operators and users alike to define the level of service they require or that they are ready to provide. These topics are addressed in this survey paper that attempts to create a unifying framework to link them all together. Not only is television not dead, it is well alive, thriving and fostering innovation and this paper will hopefully prove it.
