Parametricity in an Impredicative Sort

Reynold's abstraction theorem is now a well-established result for a large class of type systems. We propose here a definition of relational parametricity and a proof of the abstraction theorem in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), the underlying formal language of Coq, in which parametricity relations' codomain is the impredicative sort of propositions. To proceed, we need to refine this calculus by splitting the sort hierarchy to separate informative terms from non-informative terms. This refinement is very close to CIC, but with the property that typing judgments can distinguish informative terms. Among many applications, this natural encoding of parametricity inside CIC serves both theoretical purposes (proving the independence of propositions with respect to the logical system) as well as practical aspirations (proving properties of finite algebraic structures). We finally discuss how we can simply build, on top of our calculus, a new reflexive Coq tactic that constructs proof terms by parametricity.
