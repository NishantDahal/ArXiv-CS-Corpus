Towards a Formalization of the OSGi Component Framework

We present a formalization of the OSGi component framework. Our formalization is intended to be used as a basis for describing behavior of OSGi based systems. Furthermore, we describe specification formalisms for describing properties of OSGi based systems. One application is its use for behavioral types. Potential uses comprise the derivation of runtime monitors, checking compatibility of component composition, discovering components using brokerage services and checking the compatibility of implementation artifacts towards a specification.
