Quick Summary

Quick Summary is an innovate implementation of an automatic document summarizer that inputs a document in the English language and evaluates each sentence. The scanner or evaluator determines criteria based on its grammatical structure and place in the paragraph. The program then asks the user to specify the number of sentences the person wishes to highlight. For example should the user ask to have three of the most important sentences, it would highlight the first and most important sentence in green. Commonly this is the sentence containing the conclusion. Then Quick Summary finds the second most important sentence usually called a satellite and highlights it in yellow. This is usually the topic sentence. Then the program finds the third most important sentence and highlights it in red. The implementations of this technology are useful in a society of information overload when a person typically receives 42 emails a day (Microsoft). The paper also is a candid look at difficulty that machine learning has in textural translating. However, it speaks on how to overcome the obstacles that historically prevented progress. This paper proposes mathematical meta-data criteria that justify the place of importance of a sentence. Just as tools for the study of relational symmetry in bio-informatics, this tool seeks to classify words with greater clarity. "Survey Finds Workers Average Only Three Productive Days per Week."
