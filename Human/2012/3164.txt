Should I quit using my resource? Modeling Resource Usage through Game Theory

Existing web infrastructures have supported the publication of a tremendous amount of resources, and over the past few years Data Resource Usage is an everyday task for millions of users all over the world. In this work we model Resource Usage as a Cooperative Cournot Game in which a resource user and the various resource services are engaged. We give quantified answers as to when it is of interest for the user to stop using part of a resource and to switch to a different one. Moreover, we do the same from the perspective of a resource's provider.
