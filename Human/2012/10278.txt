Scaling efficient code-based cryptosystems for embedded platforms

We describe a family of highly efficient codes for cryptographic purposes and dedicated algorithms for their manipulation. Our proposal is especially tailored for highly constrained platforms, and surpasses certain conventional and post-quantum proposals (like RSA and NTRU, respectively) according to most if not all efficiency metrics.
