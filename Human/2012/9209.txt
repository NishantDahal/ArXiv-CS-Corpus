A RDF-based Data Integration Framework

Data integration is one of the main problems in distributed data sources. An approach is to provide an integrated mediated schema for various data sources. This research work aims at developing a framework for defining an integrated schema and querying on it. The basic idea is to employ recent standard languages and tools to provide a unified data integration framework. RDF is used for integrated schema descriptions as well as providing a unified view of data. RDQL is used for query reformulation. Furthermore, description logic inference services provide necessary means for satisfiability checking of concepts in integrated schema. The framework has tools to display integrated schema, query on it, and provides enough flexibilities to be used in different application domains.
