Experimenting with the Novel Approaches in Text Steganography

As is commonly known, the steganographic algorithms employ images, audio, video or text files as the medium to ensure hidden exchange of information between multiple contenders to protect the data from the prying eyes. However, using text as the target medium is relatively difficult as compared to the other target media, because of the lack of available redundant information in a text file. In this paper, in the backdrop of the limitations in the prevalent text based steganographic approaches, we propose simple, yet novel approaches that overcome the same. Our approaches are based on combining the random character sequence and feature coding methods to hide a character. We also analytically evaluate the approaches based on metrics viz. hiding strength, time overhead and memory overhead entailed. As compared to other methods, we believe the approaches proposed impart increased randomness and thus aid higher security at lower overhead.
