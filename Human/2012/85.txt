A New Local Adaptive Thresholding Technique in Binarization

Image binarization is the process of separation of pixel values into two groups, white as background and black as foreground. Thresholding plays a major in binarization of images. Thresholding can be categorized into global thresholding and local thresholding. In images with uniform contrast distribution of background and foreground like document images, global thresholding is more appropriate. In degraded document images, where considerable background noise or variation in contrast and illumination exists, there exists many pixels that cannot be easily classified as foreground or background. In such cases, binarization with local thresholding is more appropriate. This paper describes a locally adaptive thresholding technique that removes background by using local mean and mean deviation. Normally the local mean computational time depends on the window size. Our technique uses integral sum image as a prior processing to calculate local mean. It does not involve calculations of standard deviations as in other local adaptive techniques. This along with the fact that calculations of mean is independent of window size speed up the process as compared to other local thresholding techniques.
