Secret Key Generation from Sparse Wireless Channels: Ergodic Capacity and Secrecy Outage

This paper investigates generation of a secret key from a reciprocal wireless channel. In particular we consider wireless channels that exhibit sparse structure in the wideband regime and the impact of the sparsity on the secret key capacity. We explore this problem in two steps. First, we study key generation from a state-dependent discrete memoryless multiple source. The state of source captures the effect of channel sparsity. Secondly, we consider a wireless channel model that captures channel sparsity and correlation between the legitimate users' channel and the eavesdropper's channel. Such dependency can significantly reduce the secret key capacity.
  According to system delay requirements, two performance measures are considered: (i) ergodic secret key capacity and (ii) outage probability. We show that in the wideband regime when a white sounding sequence is adopted, a sparser channel can achieve a higher ergodic secret key rate than a richer channel can. For outage performance, we show that if the users generate secret keys at a fraction of the ergodic capacity, the outage probability will decay exponentially in signal bandwidth. Moreover, a larger exponent is achieved by a richer channel.
