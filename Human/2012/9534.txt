Sequential Voronoi diagram calculations using simple chemical reactions

In our recent paper [de Lacy Costello et al. 2010] we described the formation of complex tessellations of the plane arising from the various reactions of metal salts with potassium ferricyanide and ferrocyanide loaded gels. In addition to producing colourful tessellations these reactions are naturally computing generalised Voronoi diagrams of the plane. The reactions reported previously were capable of the calculation of three distinct Voronoi diagrams of the plane. As diffusion coupled with a chemical reaction is responsible for the calculation then this is achieved in parallel. Thus an increase in the complexity of the data input does not utilise additional computational resource. Additional benefits of these chemical reactions is that a permanent record of the Voronoi diagram calculation (in the form of precipitate free bisectors) is achieved, so there is no requirement for further processing to extract the calculation results. Previously it was assumed that the permanence of the results was also a potential drawback which limited reusability. This paper presents new data which shows that sequential Voronoi diagram calculations can be performed on the same chemical substrate. This is dependent on the reactivity of the original reagent and the cross reactivity of the secondary reagent with the primary product. We present the results from a number of binary combinations of metal salts on both potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide substrates. We observe three distinct mechanisms whereby secondary sequential Voronoi diagrams can be calculated. In most cases the result was two interpenetrating permanent Voronoi diagrams. This is interesting from the perspective of mapping the capability of unconventional computing substrates. But also in the study of natural pattern formation per se.
