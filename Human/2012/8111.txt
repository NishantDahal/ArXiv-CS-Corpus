On Triangulating Dynamic Graphical Models

This paper introduces new methodology to triangulate dynamic Bayesian     networks (DBNs) and dynamic graphical models (DGMs). While most methods to     triangulate such networks use some form of constrained elimination scheme based     on properties of the underlying directed graph, we find it useful to view     triangulation and elimination using properties only of the resulting undirected     graph, obtained after the moralization step. We first briefly introduce the     Graphical model toolkit (GMTK) and its notion of dynamic graphical models, one     that slightly extends the standard notion of a DBN. We next introduce the     'boundary algorithm', a method to find the best boundary between partitions     in a dynamic model. We find that using this algorithm, the notions of forward-     and backward-interface become moot - namely, the size and fill-in of the best     forward- and backward- interface are identical. Moreover, we observe that     finding a good partition boundary allows for constrained elimination orders     (and therefore graph triangulations) that are not possible using standard     slice-by-slice constrained eliminations. More interestingly, with certain     boundaries it is possible to obtain constrained elimination schemes that lie     outside the space of possible triangulations using only unconstrained     elimination. Lastly, we report triangulation results on invented graphs,     standard DBNs from the literature, novel DBNs used in speech recognition     research systems, and also random graphs. Using a number of different     triangulation quality measures (max clique size, state-space, etc.), we find     that with our boundary algorithm the triangulation quality can dramatically     improve.
