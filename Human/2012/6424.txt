Survey on Using GIS in Evacuation Planning

Natural crises form a big threat on environment; these crises mean the loss of enterprises and individuals, and therefore losses in the sum total of community development. Management to these crises is required through a crisis management plan to control the crises before, during, and after the event. One of the most needed things to consider during preparing the crisis management plan is preparing the evacuation plan in order to transfer people from the incident place to a safe place; this must be done quickly and carefully. Because of the geographic nature of the evacuation process, Geographical Information System (GIS) has been used widely and effectively for over 20 years in the field of crisis management in general and in evacuation planning in particular. This paper provides an overview about evacuation process and the basic concepts of GIS systems. The paper also demonstrates the importance of evacuation planning and how GIS systems used in other studies to assists in evacuation process.
