Usage Management of Personal Health Records

Personal health record (PHR) management is under new scrutiny as private companies move into the market and government agencies actively address perceived health care distribution inequalities and inefficiencies. Current systems are coarse-grained and provide consumers very little actual control over their data. Herein, we propose an alternative system for managing the use of healthcare information. This novel system is finer grained, allows for data mining and repackaging, and gives users more control over their data, allowing it to be distributed to their specifications. In this paper, we outline the characteristics of such a system in different contexts, present relevant background information and research leading to the system design, and cover specific usage scenarios supported by this system that are difficult to control using simpler access control strategies.
