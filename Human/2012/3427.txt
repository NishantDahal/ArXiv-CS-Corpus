Current Web Application Development and Measurement Practices for Small Software Firms

This paper discusses issues on current development and measurement practices that were identified from a pilot study conducted on Jordanian small software firms. The study was to investigate whether developers follow development and measurement best practices in web applications development. The analysis was conducted in two stages: first, grouping the development and measurement practices using variable clustering, and second, identifying the acceptance degree. Mean interval was used to determine the degree of acceptance. Hierarchal clustering was used to group the development and measurement practices. The actual findings of this survey will be used for building a new methodology for developing web applications in small software firms.
