Umgebungserfassungssystem fuer mobile Roboter (environment logging system for mobile autonomous robots)

This diploma thesis describes the theoretical bases, the conception of the module and the final result of the development process in application. for the environment logging with a small mobile robot for interiors should be sketched an economical alternative to the expensive laser scanners. the structure, color or the material of the objects in the radius of action, as well as the environment brightness and illuminating are to have thereby no influence on the results of measurement.
