Online Forum Thread Retrieval using Pseudo Cluster Selection and Voting Techniques

Online forums facilitate knowledge seeking and sharing on the Web. However, the shared knowledge is not fully utilized due to information overload. Thread retrieval is one method to overcome information overload. In this paper, we propose a model that combines two existing approaches: the Pseudo Cluster Selection and the Voting Techniques. In both, a retrieval system first scores a list of messages and then ranks threads by aggregating their scored messages. They differ on what and how to aggregate. The pseudo cluster selection focuses on input, while voting techniques focus on the aggregation method. Our combined models focus on the input and the aggregation methods. The result shows that some combined models are statistically superior to baseline methods.
