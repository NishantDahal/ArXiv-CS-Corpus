A Cache Management Strategy to Replace Wear Leveling Techniques for Embedded Flash Memory

Prices of NAND flash memories are falling drastically due to market growth and fabrication process mastering while research efforts from a technological point of view in terms of endurance and density are very active. NAND flash memories are becoming the most important storage media in mobile computing and tend to be less confined to this area. The major constraint of such a technology is the limited number of possible erase operations per block which tend to quickly provoke memory wear out. To cope with this issue, state-of-the-art solutions implement wear leveling policies to level the wear out of the memory and so increase its lifetime. These policies are integrated into the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) and greatly contribute in decreasing the write performance. In this paper, we propose to reduce the flash memory wear out problem and improve its performance by absorbing the erase operations throughout a dual cache system replacing FTL wear leveling and garbage collection services. We justify this idea by proposing a first performance evaluation of an exclusively cache based system for embedded flash memories. Unlike wear leveling schemes, the proposed cache solution reduces the total number of erase operations reported on the media by absorbing them in the cache for workloads expressing a minimal global sequential rate.
