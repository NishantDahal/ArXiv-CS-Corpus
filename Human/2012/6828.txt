Message Embedded cipher using 2-D chaotic map

This paper constructs two encryption methods using 2-D chaotic maps, Duffings and Arnold's cat maps respectively. Both of the methods are designed using message embedded scheme and are analyzed for their validity, for plaintext sensitivity, key sensitivity, known plaintext and brute-force attacks. Due to the less key space generally many chaotic cryptosystem developed are found to be weak against Brute force attack which is an essential issue to be solved. For this issue, concept of identifiability proved to be a necessary condition to be fulfilled by the designed chaotic cipher to resist brute force attack, which is a basic attack. As 2-D chaotic maps provide more key space than 1-D maps thus they are considered to be more suitable. This work is accompanied with analysis results obtained from these developed cipher. Moreover, identifiable keys are searched for different input texts at various key values. The methods are found to have good key sensitivity and possess identifiable keys thus concluding that they can resist linear attacks and brute-force attacks.
