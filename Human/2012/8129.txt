Non-uniform Quantization of Detail Components in Wavelet Transformed Image for Lossy JPEG2000 Compression

The paper introduces the idea of non-uniform quantization in the detail components of wavelet transformed image. It argues that most of the coefficients of horizontal, vertical and diagonal components lie near to zeros and the coefficients representing large differences are few at the extreme ends of histogram. Therefore, this paper advocates need for variable step size quantization scheme which preserves the edge information at the edge of histogram and removes redundancy with the minimal number of quantized values. To support the idea, preliminary results are provided using a non-uniform quantization algorithm. We believe that successful implementation of non-uniform quantization in detail components in JPEG-2000 still image standard will improve image quality and compression efficiency with lesser number of quantized values.
