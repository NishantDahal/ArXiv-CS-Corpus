Simulation Study For Performance Comparison in Hierarchical Network With CHG Approach in MANET

The implementation of MANET for commercial purposes is not an easy task. Unlike other wireless technologies such as cellular networks, MANET face more difficult problems concerning management functions, routing and scalability . As a solution to these complications, clustering schemes are proposed for MANET in order to organize the network topology in a hierarchical manner. Many clustering techniques have been developed. Clustering is a method which aggregates nodes into groups. These groups are contained by the network and they are known as clusters. By Increasing network capacity and reducing the routing overhead through clustering brings more efficiency and effectiveness to scalability in relation to node numbers and the necessity for high mobility. The manager node in clustering has responsibility for many functions such as cluster maintenance, routing table updates, and the discovery of new routes within the network. The other node named as gateway node communicate to the other cluster. In this paper we remove the cluster head (CH) and given a new approach in which cluster head and gateway will be same and that node is known as cluster head gateway (CHG), in which all the responsibilities of cluster head and gateway will be perform by the Cluster head gateway(CHG) itself. By applying this approach we reduce of overheads and improve the over all performance of the network while throughput will be same in both condition with the help of Exata simulation.
