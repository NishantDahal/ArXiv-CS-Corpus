Compressive sampling with chaotic dynamical systems

We investigate the possibility of using different chaotic sequences to construct measurement matrices in compressive sampling. In particular, we consider sequences generated by Chua, Lorenz and Rossler dynamical systems and investigate the accuracy of reconstruction when using each of them to construct measurement matrices. Chua and Lorenz sequences appear to be suitable to construct measurement matrices. We compare the recovery rate of the original sequence with that obtained by using Gaussian, Bernoulli and uniformly distributed random measurement matrices. We also investigate the impact of correlation on the recovery rate. It appears that correlation does not influence the probability of exact reconstruction significantly.
