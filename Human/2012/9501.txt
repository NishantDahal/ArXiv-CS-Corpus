Active Tile Self-assembly, Self-similar Structures and Recursion

We present an active tile assembly model which extends Winfree's abstract tile assembly model to tiles that are capable of transmitting and receiving binding site activation signals. In addition, we introduce a mathematical framework to address self-similarity and recursion within the model. The model is applied to show a recursive assembly of an archetypal self-similar aperiodic tiling known as the L-shape tiling.
