Academic Ranking with Web Mining and Axiomatic Analysis

Academic ranking is a public topic, such as for universities, colleges, or departments, which has significant educational, administrative and social effects. Popular ranking systems include the US News & World Report (USNWR), the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), and others. The most popular observables for such ranking are academic publications and their citations. However, a rigorous, quantitative and thorough methodology has been missing for this purpose. With modern web technology and axiomatic bibliometric analysis, here we perform a feasibility study on Microsoft Academic Search metadata and obtain the first-of-its-kind ranking results for American departments of computer science. This approach can be extended for fully automatic intuitional and college ranking based on comprehensive data on Internet.
