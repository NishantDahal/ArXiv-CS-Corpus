Space Efficient Cryptographic Protocol Using Recursive Bitwise & Pairs Of Bits Of Operation (RBPBO)

The technique considers a message as binary string on which a Efficient Cryptographic Protocol using Recursive Bitwise amd pairs of Bits of operation (RBPBO) is performed. A block of n bits is taken as an input stream, where n varies from 4 to 256, from a continuous stream of bits and the technique operates on it to generate the intermediate encrypted stream. This technique directly involves all the bits of blocks in a boolean operation and a session key. The same operation is performed repeatedly for different block sizes as per the specification of a session key to generate the final encrypted stream. It is a kind of block cipher and symmetric in nature hence, decoding is done following the same procedure. A comparison of the proposed technique with existing and industrially accepted RSA and TDES has also been done in terms of frequency distribution and non homogeneity of source and encrypted files. Key words: Space Efficient Cryptographic Protocol using Recursive Bitwise & pairs of Bits of operation (RBPBO),Cipher text, Block cipher, Session Key.
