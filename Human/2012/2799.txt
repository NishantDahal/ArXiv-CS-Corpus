STP/HAMPI and Computer Security

In the past several years I have written two SMT solvers called STP and HAMPI that have found widespread use in computer security research by leading groups in academia, industry and the government. In this brief note I summarize the features of STP/HAMPI that make them particularly suited for computer security research, and a listing of some of the more important projects that use them.
