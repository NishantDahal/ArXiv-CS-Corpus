Adaptive Real Time Imaging Synthesis Telescopes

The digital revolution is transforming astronomy from a data-starved to a data-submerged science. Instruments such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will measure their accumulated data in petabytes. The capacity to produce enormous volumes of data must be matched with the computing power to process that data and produce meaningful results. In addition to handling huge data rates, we need adaptive calibration and beamforming to handle atmospheric fluctuations and radio frequency interference, and to provide a user environment which makes the full power of large telescope arrays accessible to both expert and non-expert users. Delayed calibration and analysis limit the science which can be done. To make the best use of both telescope and human resources we must reduce the burden of data reduction.
  Our instrumentation comprises of a flexible correlator, beam former and imager with digital signal processing closely coupled with a computing cluster. This instrumentation will be highly accessible to scientists, engineers, and students for research and development of real-time processing algorithms, and will tap into the pool of talented and innovative students and visiting scientists from engineering, computing, and astronomy backgrounds.
  Adaptive real-time imaging will transform radio astronomy by providing real-time feedback to observers. Calibration of the data is made in close to real time using a model of the sky brightness distribution. The derived calibration parameters are fed back into the imagers and beam formers. The regions imaged are used to update and improve the a-priori model, which becomes the final calibrated image by the time the observations are complete.
