DNF Sparsification and a Faster Deterministic Counting Algorithm

Given a DNF formula on n variables, the two natural size measures are the number of terms or size s(f), and the maximum width of a term w(f). It is folklore that short DNF formulas can be made narrow. We prove a converse, showing that narrow formulas can be sparsified. More precisely, any width w DNF irrespective of its size can be $ε$-approximated by a width $w$ DNF with at most $(w\log(1/ε))^{O(w)}$ terms.
  We combine our sparsification result with the work of Luby and Velikovic to give a faster deterministic algorithm for approximately counting the number of satisfying solutions to a DNF. Given a formula on n variables with poly(n) terms, we give a deterministic $n^{\tilde{O}(\log \log(n))}$ time algorithm that computes an additive $ε$ approximation to the fraction of satisfying assignments of f for $ε= 1/\poly(\log n)$. The previous best result due to Luby and Velickovic from nearly two decades ago had a run-time of $n^{\exp(O(\sqrt{\log \log n}))}$.
