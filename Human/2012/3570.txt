Visualization of features of a series of measurements with one-dimensional cellular structure

This paper describes the method of visualization of periodic constituents and instability areas in series of measurements, being based on the algorithm of smoothing out and concept of one-dimensional cellular automata. A method can be used at the analysis of temporal series, related to the volumes of thematic publications in web-space.
