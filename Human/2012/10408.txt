Identification of efficient peers in P2P computing system for real time applications

Currently the Peer to Peer computing paradigm rises as an economic solution for the large scale computation problems. However due to the dynamic nature of peers it is very difficult to use this type of systems for the computations of real time applications. Strict deadline of scientific and real time applications require predictable performance in such applications. We propose an algorithm to identify the group of reliable peers, from the available peers on the Internet, for the processing of real time applications tasks. The algorithm is based on joint evaluation of peer properties like peer availability, credibility, computation time and the turnaround time of the peer with respect to the task distributor peer. Here we also define a method to calculate turnaround time on task distributor peers at application level.
