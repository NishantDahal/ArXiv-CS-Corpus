Cultural Algorithm Toolkit for Multi-objective Rule Mining

Cultural algorithm is a kind of evolutionary algorithm inspired from societal evolution and is composed of a belief space, a population space and a protocol that enables exchange of knowledge between these sources. Knowledge created in the population space is accepted into the belief space while this collective knowledge from these sources is combined to influence the decisions of the individual agents in solving problems. Classification rules comes under descriptive knowledge discovery in data mining and are the most sought out by users since they represent highly comprehensible form of knowledge. The rules have certain properties which make them useful forms of actionable knowledge to users. The rules are evaluated using these properties namely the rule metrics. In the current study a Cultural Algorithm Toolkit for Classification Rule Mining (CAT-CRM) is proposed which allows the user to control three different set of parameters namely the evolutionary parameters, the rule parameters as well as agent parameters and hence can be used for experimenting with an evolutionary system, a rule mining system or an agent based social system. Results of experiments conducted to observe the effect of different number and type of metrics on the performance of the algorithm on bench mark data sets is reported.
