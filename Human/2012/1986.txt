Blind 3D Model Watermarking Based on Multi-Resolution Representation and Fuzzy Logic

Insertion of a text message, audio data or/and an image into another image or 3D model is called as a watermarking process. Watermarking has variety of applications like: Copyright Protection, Owner Identification, Copy Protection and Data Hiding etc., depending upon the type of watermark insertion algorithm. Watermark remains in the content after applying various attacks without any distortions. The blind watermarking method used in the system is based on a wavelet transform, a fuzzy inference system and a multi-resolution representation (MRR) of the 3d model. The watermark scrambled by Arnold Transform is embedded in the wavelet coefficients at third resolution level of the MRR. Fuzzy logic approach used in the method makes it to approximate the best possible gain with an accurate scaling factor so that the watermark remains invisible. The fuzzy input variables are computed for each wavelet coefficient in the 3D model. The output of the fuzzy system is a single value which is a perceptual value for each corresponding wavelet coefficient. Thus, the fuzzy perceptual mask combines all these non-linear variables to build a simple, easy to use HVS model. Results shows that the system is robust against affine transformations, smoothing, cropping and noise attacks.
