Elitism Levels Traverse Mechanism For The Derivation of Upper Bounds on Unimodal Functions

In this article we present an Elitism Levels Traverse Mechanism that we designed to find bounds on population-based Evolutionary algorithms solving unimodal functions. We prove its efficiency theoretically and test it on OneMax function deriving bounds cμn log n - O(μ n). This analysis can be generalized to any similar algorithm using variants of tournament selection and genetic operators that flip or swap only 1 bit in each string.
