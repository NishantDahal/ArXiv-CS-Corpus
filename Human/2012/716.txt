A Framework Studio for Component Reusability

The deployment of a software product requires considerable amount of time and effort. In order to increase the productivity of the software products, reusability strategies were proposed in the literature. However effective reuse is still a challenging issue. This paper presents a framework studio for effective components reusability which provides the selection of components from framework studio and generation of source code based on stakeholders needs. The framework studio is implemented using swings which are integrated onto the Net Beans IDE which help in faster generation of the source code.
