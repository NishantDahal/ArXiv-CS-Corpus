On Channels with Action-Dependent States

Action-dependent channels model scenarios in which transmission takes place in two successive phases. In the first phase, the encoder selects an "action" sequence, with the twofold aim of conveying information to the receiver and of affecting in a desired way the state of the channel to be used in the second phase. In the second phase, communication takes place in the presence the mentioned action-dependent state. In this work, two extensions of the original action-dependent channel are studied. In the first, the decoder is interested in estimating not only the message, but also the state sequence within an average per-letter distortion. Under the constraint of common knowledge (i.e., the decoder's estimate of the state must be recoverable also at the encoder) and assuming non-causal state knowledge at the encoder in the second phase, we obtain a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate-distortion-cost trade-off. In the second extension, we study an action-dependent degraded broadcast channel. Under the assumption that the encoder knows the state sequence causally in the second phase, the capacity-cost region is identified. Various examples, including Gaussian channels and a model with a "probing" encoder, are also provided to show the advantage of a proper joint design of the two communication phases.
