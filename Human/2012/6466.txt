A Missing and Found Recognition System for Hajj and Umrah

This note describes an integrated recognition system for identifying missing and found objects as well as missing, dead, and found people during Hajj and Umrah seasons in the two Holy cities of Makkah and Madina in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is assumed that the total estimated number of pilgrims will reach 20 millions during the next decade. The ultimate goal of this system is to integrate facial recognition and object identification solutions into the Hajj and Umrah rituals. The missing and found computerized system is part of the CrowdSensing system for Hajj and Umrah crowd estimation, management and safety.
