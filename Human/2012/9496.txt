A characterization of two-weight projective cyclic codes

We give necessary conditions for a two-weight projective cyclic code to be the direct sum of two one-weight irreducible cyclic subcodes of the same dimension, following the work of Wolfmann and Vega. This confirms Vega's conjecture that all the two-weight cyclic codes of this type are the known ones in the projective case.
