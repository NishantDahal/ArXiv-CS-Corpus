Design of PIC12F675 Microcontroller Based Data Acquisition System for Slowly Varying Signals

The present paper describes the design of a cost effective, better resolution data acquisition system (DAS) which is compatible to most of the PC and laptops. A low cost DAS has been designed using PIC12F675 having 4-channel analog input with 10-bit resolution for the monitoring of slowly varying signals. The DAS so designed is interfaced to the serial port of the PC. Firmware is written in Basic using Oshonsoft PIC IDE and burn to the microcontroller by using PICkit2 programmer. An application program is also developed using Visual Basic 6 which allows to display the waveform of the signal(s) and simultaneously the data also can be saved into the hard disk of the computer for future use and analysis.
