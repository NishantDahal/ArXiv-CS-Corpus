The Definition of AI in Terms of Multi Agent Systems

The questions which we will consider here are "What is AI?" and "How can we make AI?". Here we will present the definition of AI in terms of multi-agent systems. This means that here you will not find a new answer to the question "What is AI?", but an old answer in a new form.
  This new form of the definition of AI is of interest for the theory of multi-agent systems because it gives us better understanding of this theory. More important is that this work will help us answer the second question. We want to make a program which is capable of constructing a model of its environment. Every multi-agent model is equivalent to a single-agent model but multi-agent models are more natural and accordingly more easily discoverable.
