Analysis of WiMAX Physical Layer Using Spatial Multiplexing

Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) has emerged as a promising solution for providing last mile internet access technology to provide high speed internet access to the users in the residential as well as in the small and medium sized enterprise sectors. IEEE 802.16e is one of the most promising and attractive candidate among the emerging technologies for broadband wireless access. The emergence of WiMAX protocol has attracted various interests from almost all the fields of wireless communications. MIMO systems which are created according to the IEEE 802.16-2005 standard (WiMAX) under different fading channels can be implemented to get the benefits of both the MIMO and WiMAX technologies. In this paper analysis of higher level of modulations (i.e. M-PSK and M-QAM for different values of M) with different code rates and on WiMAX-MIMO system is presented for Rayleigh channel by focusing on spatial multiplexing MIMO technique. Signal-to Noise Ratio (SNR) vs Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis has been done.
