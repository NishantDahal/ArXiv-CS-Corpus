Dithered quantizers with negligible in-band dither power

Subtractive dithered quantizers are examined to minimize the signal-band dither power. The design of finite impulse response(FIR) filters that shape most of the dither-power out of the signal band while maintaining the benefits of dithering are dealt with in detail. Simulation results for low-medium resolution quantizers are presented to highlight the overall design consideration.
