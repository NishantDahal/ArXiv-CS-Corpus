Describing and Modeling of Video-on-Demand Service with the Usage of Multi-Layer Graph

Considered in this paper is the method of describingc of telecommunications systems providing VoD service using multi-layer graph. The paper describes the relations between the structural elements at each hierarchical level of the multi-layer graph. Transfer of video is a resource consuming task, and it requires an optimal configuration of the studied system. The usage of the multi-layer graph makes it possible to consider the telecommunication system as a whole and avoid falling in the local optimums when solving optimization problems.
