Enhanced Load Balancing Approach to Avoid Deadlocks in Cloud

The state-of-art of the technology focuses on data processing to deal with massive amount of data. Cloud computing is an emerging technology, which enables one to accomplish the aforementioned objective, leading towards improved business performance. It comprises of users requesting for the services of diverse applications from various distributed virtual servers. The cloud should provide resources on demand to its clients with high availability, scalability and with reduced cost. Load balancing is one of the essential factors to enhance the working performance of the cloud service provider. Since, cloud has inherited characteristic of distributed computing and virtualization there is a possibility of occurrence of deadlock. Hence, in this paper, a load balancing algorithm has been proposed to avoid deadlocks among the Virtual Machines (VMs) while processing the requests received from the users by VM migration. Further, this paper also provides the anticipated results with the implementation of the proposed algorithm. The deadlock avoidance enhances the number of jobs to be serviced by cloud service provider and thereby improving working performance and the business of the cloud service provider.
