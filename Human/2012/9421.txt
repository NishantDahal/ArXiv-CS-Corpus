Relating Reasoning Methodologies in Linear Logic and Process Algebra

We show that the proof-theoretic notion of logical preorder coincides with the process-theoretic notion of contextual preorder for a CCS-like calculus obtained from the formula-as-process interpretation of a fragment of linear logic.  The argument makes use of other standard notions in process algebra, namely a labeled transition system and a coinductively defined simulation relation.  This result establishes a connection between an approach to reason about process specifications and a method to reason about logic specifications.
