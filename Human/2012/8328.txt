Classification Analysis Of Authorship Fiction Texts in The Space Of Semantic Fields

The use of naive Bayesian classifier (NB) and the classifier by the k nearest neighbors (kNN) in classification semantic analysis of authors' texts of English fiction has been analysed. The authors' works are considered in the vector space the basis of which is formed by the frequency characteristics of semantic fields of nouns and verbs. Highly precise classification of authors' texts in the vector space of semantic fields indicates about the presence of particular spheres of author's idiolect in this space which characterizes the individual author's style.
