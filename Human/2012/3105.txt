MyProLang - My Programming Language: A Template-Driven Automatic Natural Programming Language

Modern computer programming languages are governed by complex syntactic rules. They are unlike natural languages; they require extensive manual work and a significant amount of learning and practicing for an individual to become skilled at and to write correct programs. Computer programming is a difficult, complicated, unfamiliar, non-automated, and a challenging discipline for everyone; especially, for students, new programmers and end-users. This paper proposes a new programming language and an environment for writing computer applications based on source-code generation. It is mainly a template-driven automatic natural imperative programming language called MyProLang. It harnesses GUI templates to generate proprietary natural language source-code, instead of having computer programmers write the code manually. MyProLang is a blend of five elements. A proprietary natural programming language with unsophisticated grammatical rules and expressive syntax; automation templates that automate the generation of instructions and thereby minimizing the learning and training time; an NLG engine to generate natural instructions; a source-to-source compiler that analyzes, parses, and build executables; and an ergonomic IDE that houses diverse functions whose role is to simplify the software development process. MyProLang is expected to make programming open to everyone including students, programmers and end-users. In that sense, anyone can start programming systematically, in an automated manner and in natural language; without wasting time in learning how to formulate instructions and arrange expressions, without putting up with unfamiliar structures and symbols, and without being annoyed by syntax errors. In the long run, this increases the productivity, quality and time-to-market in software development.
