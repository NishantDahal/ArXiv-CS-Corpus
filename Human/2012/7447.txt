A performance Analysis of the Game of Life based on parallel algorithm

In this article, Conway's Game of Life using OpenMP parallel processing to simulate several different parallel methods, experimental performance results and compare to find the optimal solution of the parallelization of the Game of Life. Finally pointed out the importance of the design of parallel algorithms in solving the parallel problem.
