Algorithms for Low-Dimensional Topology

In this article, we re-introduce the so called "Arkaden-Faden-Lage" (AFL for short) representation of knots in 3 dimensional space introduced by Kurt Reidemeister and show how it can be used to develop efficient algorithms to compute some important topological knot structures. In particular, we introduce an efficient algorithm to calculate holonomic representation of knots introduced by V. Vassiliev and give the main ideas how to use the AFL representations of knots to compute the Kontsevich Integral.
  The methods introduced here are to our knowledge novel and can open new perspectives in the development of fast algorithms in low dimensional topology.
