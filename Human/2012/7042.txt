From individual to population: Challenges in Medical Visualization

In this paper, we first give a high-level overview of medical visualization development over the past 30 years, focusing on key developments and the trends that they represent. During this discussion, we will refer to a number of key papers that we have also arranged on the medical visualization research timeline. Based on the overview and our observations of the field, we then identify and discuss the medical visualization research challenges that we foresee for the coming decade.
