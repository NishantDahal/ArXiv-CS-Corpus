Almost Optimal Sublinear Time Algorithm for Semidefinite Programming

We present an algorithm for approximating semidefinite programs with running time that is sublinear in the number of entries in the semidefinite instance. We also present lower bounds that show our algorithm to have a nearly optimal running time.
