Securing Speech in GSM Networks using DES with Random Permutation and Inversion Algorithm

Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is one of the most commonly used cellular technologies in the world. One of the objectives in mobile communication systems is the security of the exchanged data. GSM employs many cryptographic algorithms for security like A5/1, A5/2 and A5/3. Even so, these algorithms do not provide sufficient level of security for protecting the confidentiality of GSM. Therefore, it is desirable to increase security by additional encryption methods. This paper presents a voice encryption method called: "DES with Random permutation and Inversion", based on current voice channel, which overcomes data channel's insufficiencies and solves the problem of penetrating the RPE-LTP vocoder by the encrypted voice. The proposed method fulfils an end-to-end secured communication in the GSM; insure a good compatibility to all GSM networks, and easy implementation without any modification in these systems.
