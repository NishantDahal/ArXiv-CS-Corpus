Cut-Free ExpTime Tableaux for Checking Satisfiability of a Knowledge Base in the Description Logic SHI

We give the first cut-free ExpTime (optimal) tableau decision procedure for checking satisfiability of a knowledge base in the description logic SHI, which extends the description logic ALC with transitive roles, inverse roles and role hierarchies.
