Locating dominating codes: Bounds and extremal cardinalities

In this work, two types of codes such that they both dominate and locate the vertices of a graph are studied. Those codes might be sets of detectors in a network or processors controlling a system whose set of responses should determine a malfunctioning processor or an intruder. Here, we present our more significant contributions on λ-codes and η-codes concerning concerning bounds, extremal values and realization theorems.
