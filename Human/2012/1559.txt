An Analysis of Structured Data on the Web

In this paper, we analyze the nature and distribution of structured data on the Web. Web-scale information extraction, or the problem of creating structured tables using extraction from the entire web, is gathering lots of research interest. We perform a study to understand and quantify the value of Web-scale extraction, and how structured information is distributed amongst top aggregator websites and tail sites for various interesting domains. We believe this is the first study of its kind, and gives us new insights for information extraction over the Web.
