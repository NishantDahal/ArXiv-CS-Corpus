On the principal impossibility to prove P=NP

The material of the article is devoted to the most complicated and interesting problem -- a problem of P = NP?. This research was presented to mathematical community in Hyderabad during International Congress of Mathematicians. But there it was published in a very brief form, so this article is an attempt to give those, who are interested in the problem, my reasoning on the theme. It is not a proof in full, because it is very difficult to prove something, which is not provable, but it seems that these reasoning will help us to understand the problem of the combinatorial explosion more deeply and to realize in full all the problems to which we are going because of the combinatorial explosion. Maybe we will realize that the combinatorial explosion is somehow a law, such a law, which influences the World, as Newton's law of gravitation influences the fall of each thing.
