Report on "Mathematical Aspects of P vs. NP and its Variants."

This is a report on a workshop held August 1 to August 5, 2011 at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, organized by Saugata Basu, Joseph M. Landsberg, and J. Maurice Rojas. We provide overviews of the more recent results presented at the workshop, including some works-in-progress as well as tentative and intriguing ideas for new directions. The main themes we discuss are representation theory and geometry in the Mulmuley-Sohoni Geometric Complexity Theory Program, and number theory and other ideas in the Blum-Shub-Smale model.
