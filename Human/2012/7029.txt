Adversary Lower Bound for the k-sum Problem

We prove a tight quantum query lower bound $Î©(n^{k/(k+1)})$ for the problem of deciding whether there exist $k$ numbers among $n$ that sum up to a prescribed number, provided that the alphabet size is sufficiently large.
  This is an extended and simplified version of an earlier preprint of one of the authors arXiv:1204.5074.
