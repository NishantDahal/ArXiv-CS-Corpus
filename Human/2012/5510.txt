Stator flux optimization on direct torque control with fuzzy logic

The Direct Torque Control (DTC) is well known as an effective control technique for high performance drives in a wide variety of industrial applications and conventional DTC technique uses two constant reference value: torque and stator flux. In this paper, fuzzy logic based stator flux optimization technique for DTC drives that has been proposed. The proposed fuzzy logic based stator flux optimizer self-regulates the stator flux reference using induction motor load situation without need of any motor parameters. Simulation studies have been carried out with Matlab/Simulink to compare the proposed system behaviors at vary load conditions. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed DTC technique has been improved and especially at low-load conditions torque ripple are greatly reduced with respect to the conventional DTC.
