A common interface for multi-rule-engine distributed systems

The rule technological landscape is becoming ever more complex, with an extended number of specifications and products. It is therefore becoming increasingly difficult to integrate rule-driven components and manage interoperability in multi-rule engine environments. The described work presents the possibility to provide a common interface for rule-driven components in a distributed system. The authors' approach leverages on a set of discovery protocol, rule interchange and user interface to alleviate the environment's complexity.
