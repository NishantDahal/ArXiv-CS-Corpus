Minimal Binary Abelian Codes of length $p^m q^n$

We consider binary abelian codes of length $p^m q^n$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime rational integers under some restrictive hypotheses. In this case, we determine the idempotents generating minimal codes and either the respective weights or bounds of these weights. We give examples showing that these bounds are attained in some cases.
