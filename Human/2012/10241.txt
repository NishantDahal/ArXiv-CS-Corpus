Voltage Temperature Monitoring System (VTMS) for a BTS Room

Although Cellular communication is getting more and more popular in our country present days, but its network improvement is hampered by the crysis of electricity. The recent decision of present Government is that they will not provide any electricity from the grid to any new BTS rooms of any Celluler operator companies like Grammen Phone, Robi, Airtel etc. These companies have to develop their own power stations either by using generators or by developing solar plants. Now a days most of the BTS rooms, that the cellular operators are installing with a generator and 48 volt battery backup. So for the synchronisation of the operation of PDB, Generator and battery, they require a device called Voltage Temperature Monitoring System or VTMS. It is a Microcontroller based controlling unit which controlls the operation of generator and battery when PDB in not available in the BTS room.
