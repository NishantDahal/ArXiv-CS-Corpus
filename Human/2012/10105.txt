Development of Low Cost Private Office Access Control System (OACS)

Over the years, access control systems have become more and more sophisticated and several security measures have been employed to combat the menace of insecurity of lives and property. This is done by preventing unauthorized entrance into buildings through entrance doors using conventional and electronic locks, discrete access code, and biometric methods such as the finger prints, thumb prints, the iris and facial recognition. We have designed a flexible and low cost modular system based on integration of keypad, magnetic lock and a controller. PIC 16F876A which is an 8-bit Microcontroller, is used here as a main controller. An advanced simulation based compiler Flowcode V4 is used to develop the software part in this project.
