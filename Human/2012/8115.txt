On revising fuzzy belief bases

We look at the problem of revising fuzzy belief bases, i.e., belief base     revision in which both formulas in the base as well as revision-input formulas     can come attached with varying truth-degrees. Working within a very general     framework for fuzzy logic which is able to capture a variety of types of     inference under uncertainty, such as truth-functional fuzzy logics and certain     types of probabilistic inference, we show how the idea of rational change from     'crisp' base revision, as embodied by the idea of partial meet revision, can     be faithfully extended to revising fuzzy belief bases. We present and     axiomatise an operation of partial meet fuzzy revision and illustrate how the     operation works in several important special instances of the framework.
