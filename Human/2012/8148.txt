Energy Efficient Algorithms and Power Consumption Techniques in High Performance Computing

High Performance Computing is an internet based computing which makes computer infrastructure and services available to the user for research purpose. However, an important issue which needs to be resolved before High Performance Computing Cluster with large pool of servers gain widespread acceptance is the design of data centers with less energy consumption. It is only possible when servers produce less heat and consume less power. Systems reliability decreases with increase in temperature due to heat generation caused by large power consumption as computing in high temperature is more error-prone. Here in this paper our approach is to design and implement a high performance cluster for high-end research in the High Energy Physics stream. This involves the usage of fine grained power gating technique in microprocessors and energy efficient algorithms that reduce the overall running cost of the data center.
