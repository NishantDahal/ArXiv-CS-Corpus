Incomplete Information in RDF

We extend RDF with the ability to represent property values that exist, but are unknown or partially known, using constraints. Following ideas from the incomplete information literature, we develop a semantics for this extension of RDF, called RDFi, and study SPARQL query evaluation in this framework.
