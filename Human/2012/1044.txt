Segmentation Based Approach to Dynamic Page Construction from Search Engine Results

The results rendered by the search engines are mostly a linear snippet list. With the prolific increase in the dynamism of web pages there is a need for enhanced result lists from search engines in order to cope-up with the expectations of the users. This paper proposes a model for dynamic construction of a resultant page from various results fetched by the search engine, based on the web page segmentation approach. With the incorporation of personalization through user profile during the candidate segment selection, the enriched resultant page is constructed. The benefits of this approach include instant, one-shot navigation to relevant portions from various result items, in contrast to a linear page-by-page visit approach. The experiments conducted on the prototype model with various levels of users, quantifies the improvements in terms of amount of relevant information fetched.
