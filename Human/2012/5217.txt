Power-law weighted networks from local attachments

This letter introduces a mechanism for constructing, through a process of distributed decision-making, substrates for the study of collective dynamics on extended power-law weighted networks with both a desired scaling exponent and a fixed clustering coefficient. The analytical results show that the connectivity distribution converges to the scaling behavior often found in social and engineering systems. To illustrate the approach of the proposed framework we generate network substrates that resemble steady state properties of the empirical citation distributions of (i) publications indexed by the Institute for Scientific Information from 1981 to 1997; (ii) patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from 1975 to 1999; and (iii) opinions written by the Supreme Court and the cases they cite from 1754 to 2002.
