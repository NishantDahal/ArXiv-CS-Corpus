Secondary Constructions of Bent Functions and Highly Nonlinear Resilient Functions

In this paper, we first present a new secondary construction of bent functions (building new bent functions from two already defined ones). Furthermore, we apply the construction using as initial functions some specific bent functions and then provide several concrete constructions of bent functions. The second part of the paper is devoted to the constructions of resilient functions. We give a generalization of the indirect sum construction for constructing resilient functions with high nonlinearity. In addition, we modify the generalized construction to ensure a high nonlinearity of the constructed function.
