Secure & Rapid Composition of Infrastructure Services in the Cloud

A fundamental ambition of grid and distributed systems is to be capable of sustaining evolution and allowing for adaptability ((F. Losavio et al., 2002), (S. Radhakrishnan, 2005)). Furthermore, as the complexity and sophistication of theses structures increases, so does the need for adaptability of each component. One of the primary benefits of service oriented architecture (SOA) is the ability to compose applications, processes or more complex services from other services which increases the capacity for adaptation. This document proposes a novel infrastructure composition model that aims at increasing the adaptability of the capabilities exposed through it by dynamically managing their non functional requirements.
