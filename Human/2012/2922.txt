A Lattice-Theoretic Characterization of Optimal Minimum-Distance Linear Precoders

This work investigates linear precoding over non-singular linear channels with additive white Gaussian noise, with lattice-type inputs. The aim is to maximize the minimum distance of the received lattice points, where the precoder is subject to an energy constraint. It is shown that the optimal precoder only produces a finite number of different lattices, namely perfect lattices, at the receiver. The well-known densest lattice packings are instances of perfect lattices, however it is analytically shown that the densest lattices are not always the solution. This is a counter-intuitive result at first sight, since previous work in the area showed a tight connection between densest lattices and minimum distance. Since there are only finitely many different perfect lattices, they can theoretically be enumerated off-line. A new upper bound on the optimal minimum distance is derived, which significantly improves upon a previously reported bound. Based on this bound, we propose an enumeration algorithm that produces a finite codebook of optimal precoders.
