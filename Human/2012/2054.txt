Enhancement Techniques for Local Content Preservation and Contrast Improvement in Images

There are several images that do not have uniform brightness which pose a challenging problem for image enhancement systems. As histogram equalization has been successfully used to correct for uniform brightness problems, a histogram equalization method that utilizes human visual system based thresholding(human vision thresholding) as well as logarithmic processing techniques were introduced later . But these methods are not good for preserving the local content of the image which is a major factor for various images like medical and aerial images. Therefore new method is proposed here. This method is referred as "Human vision thresholding with enhancement technique for dark blurred images for local content preservation". It uses human vision thresholding together with an existing enhancement method for dark blurred images. Furthermore a comparative study with another method for local content preservation is done which is further extended to make it suitable for contrast improvement. Experimental results shows that the proposed methods outperforms the former existing methods in preserving the local content for standard images, medical and aerial images.
