Parallel Sorting System for Objects

Conventional sorting algorithms make use of such data structures as array, file and list which define access methods of the items to be sorted. Such traditional methods as exchange sort, divide and conquer sort, selection sort and insertion sort require supervisory control program. The supervisory control program has access to the items and is responsible for arranging them in the proper order. This paper presents a different sorting algorithm that does not require supervisory control program. The objects sort themselves and they are able to terminate when sorting is completed. The algorithm also employs parallel processing mechanisms to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The paper makes a review of the traditional sorting methods, identifying their pros and cons and proposes a different design based on conceptual combination of these algorithms. Algorithms designed were implemented and tested in Java desktop application
