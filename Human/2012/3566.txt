SD-AREE: A New Modified Caesar Cipher Cryptographic Method Along with Bit-Manipulation to Exclude Repetition from a Message to be Encrypted

In this paper the author presents a new cryptographic technique to exclude the repetitive terms in a message, when it is to be encrypted, so that it becomes almost impossible for a person to retrieve or predict the original message from the encrypted message. In modern world, cryptography hackers try to break a code or cryptographic algorithm or try to retrieve the key, which is needed to encrypt a message, by analyzing the insertion or presence of repetitive bits / characters (bytes) in the message and encrypted message to find out the encryption algorithm or the key used for it. So it is must for a good encryption method to exclude the repetitive terms such that no trace of repetitions can be tracked down. For this reason we apply SD-AREE cryptographic method to exclude repetitive terms from a message, which is to be encrypted. In SD-AREE method the repetitive bits / characters are removed and there is no trace of any repetition in the message.
