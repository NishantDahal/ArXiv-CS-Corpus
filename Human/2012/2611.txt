Verification Condition Generation and Variable Conditions in Smallfoot

These notes are a companion to [1] which describe - the variable conditions that Smallfoot checks, - the analysis used to check them, - the algorithm used to compute a set of verification conditions corresponding to an annotated program, and - the treatment of concurrent resource initialization code.
