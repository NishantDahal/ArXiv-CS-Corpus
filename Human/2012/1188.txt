Reducing complexity of tail-biting trellises

It is shown that a trellis realization can be locally reduced if it is not state-trim, branch-trim, proper, observable, and controllable. These conditions are not sufficient for local irreducibility. Making use of notions that amount to "almost unobservability/uncontrollability", a necessary and sufficient criterion of local irreducibility for tail-biting trellises is presented.
