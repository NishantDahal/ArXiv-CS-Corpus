Programing Using High Level Design With Python and FORTRAN: A Study Case in Astrophysics

In this work, we present a short review about the high level design methodology (HLDM), that is based on the use of very high level (VHL) programing language as main, and the use of the intermediate level (IL) language only for the critical processing time. The languages used are Python (VHL) and FORTRAN (IL). Moreover, this methodology, making use of the oriented object programing (OOP), permits to produce a readable, portable and reusable code. Also is presented the concept of computational framework, that naturally appears from the OOP paradigm. As an example, we present the framework called PYGRAWC (Python framework for Gravitational Waves from Cosmological origin). Even more, we show that the use of HLDM with Python and FORTRAN produces a powerful tool for solving astrophysical problems.
