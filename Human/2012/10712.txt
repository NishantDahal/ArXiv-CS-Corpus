Frames in Outdoor 802.11 WLANs Provide a Hybrid Binary-Symmetric/Packet-Erasure Channel

Corrupted frames with CRC errors potentially provide a useful channel through which we can transmit information. Using measurements taken in an outdoor environment, we demonstrate that for 802.11 wireless links the channel provided by corrupted frames alone (i.e. ignoring frames with PHY errors and frames received correctly) can be accurately modelled as a binary symmetric channel (BSC) provided appropriate pre- and post- processing is carried out. Also, the channel provided by corrupted frames and other frames combined can be accurately modelled as a hybrid binary symmetric/packet erasure channel. Importantly, we find that this hybrid channel offers capacity increases of more than 100% compared to a conventional packet erasure channel over a wide range of RSSIs. This is a striking observation as it indicates that the potential exists for significant network throughput gains if the information contained in 802.11 corrupted packets is exploited.
