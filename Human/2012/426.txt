Gibbs-Shannon Entropy and Related Measures: Tsallis Entropy

In this research paper, it is proved that an approximation to Gibbs-Shannon entropy measure naturally leads to Tsallis entropy for the real parameter q =2 . Several interesting measures based on the input as well as output of a discrete memoryless channel are provided and some of the properties of those measures are discussed. It is expected that these results will be of utility in Information Theoretic research.
