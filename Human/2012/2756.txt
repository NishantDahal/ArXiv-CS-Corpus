Blind graph rewriting systems

We consider a simple (probably, the simplest) structure for random access memory. This structure can be used to construct a universal system with nearly void processor, namely, we demonstrate that the processor of such a system may have empty instruction set, in a more strong manner than the existing ZISC (zero instruction set computer based on ideas for artificial neural networks) and NISC architecture (no instruction set computing). More precisely, the processor will be forbidden to analyze any information stored in the memory, the latter being the only state of such a machine. This particular paper is to cover an isolated aspect of the idea, specifically, to provide the logical operations embedded into a system without any built-in conditional statements.
