Combinatorial study of colored Hurwitz polyzêtas

A combinatorial study discloses two surjective morphisms between generalized shuffle algebras and algebras generated by the colored Hurwitz polyzêtas. The combinatorial aspects of the products and co-products involved in these algebras will be examined.
