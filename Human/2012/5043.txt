Mutually unbiased bases as submodules and subspaces

Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) have been used in several cryptographic and communications applications. There has been much speculation regarding connections between MUBs and finite geometries. Most of which has focused on a connection with projective and affine planes. We propose a connection with higher dimensional projective geometries and projective Hjelmslev geometries. We show that this proposed geometric structure is present in several constructions of MUBs.
