Multimedia Steganographic Scheme using Multiresolution Analysis

Digital steganography or data hiding has emerged as a new area of research in connection to the communication in secured channel as well as intellectual property protection for multimedia signals. The redundancy in image representation can be exploited successfully to embed specified characteristic information with a good quality of imperceptibility. The hidden multimedia information will be communicated to the authentic user through secured channel as a part of the data. This article deals with a transform domain, block-based and signal non-adaptive/adaptive technique for inserting multimedia signals into an RGB image. The robustness of the proposed method has been tested compared to the other transform domain techniques. Proposed algorithm also shows improvement in visual and statistical invisibility of the hidden information.
