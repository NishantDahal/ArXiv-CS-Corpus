Bio-Thentic Card: Authentication concept for RFID Card

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a technology that employs basic identifier of an object embedded in a chip, transmitted via radio wave, for identification. An RFID Card responds to query or interrogation irrespective of "Who" holds the Card; like a key to a door. Since an attacker can possess the card, access to such object can therefore be easily compromised. This security breach is classified as an unauthorized use of Card, and it forms the bedrock for RFID Card compromise especially in access control. As an on-card authentication mechanism, this research proposed a concept termed Bio-Thentic Card, which can be adopted to prevent this single point of failure of RFID Card. The Bio-Thentic Card was fabricated, tested and assessed in line with the known threats, and attacks; and it was observed to proffer substantive solution to unauthorized use of RFID Card vulnerability
