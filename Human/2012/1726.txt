Variety Evasive Sets

We give an explicit construction of a large subset of F^n, where F is a finite field, that has small intersection with any affine variety of fixed dimension and bounded degree. Our construction generalizes a recent result of Dvir and Lovett (STOC 2012) who considered varieties of degree one (affine subspaces).
