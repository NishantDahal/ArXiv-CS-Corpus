Universal Witnesses for State Complexity of Boolean Operations and Concatenation Combined with Star

We study the state complexity of boolean operations and product (concatenation, catenation) combined with star. We derive tight upper bounds for the symmetric differences and differences of two languages, one or both of which are starred, and for the product of two starred languages. We prove that the previously discovered bounds for the union and the intersection of languages with one or two starred arguments, for the product of two languages one of which is starred, and for the star of the product of two languages can all be met by the recently introduced universal witnesses and their variants.
