A Novel Architecture For Network Coded Electronic Health Record Storage System

The use of network coding for large scale content distribution improves download time. This is demonstrated in this work by the use of network coded Electronic Health Record Storage System (EHR-SS). An architecture of 4-layer to build the EHR-SS is designed. The application integrates the data captured for the patient from three modules namely administrative data, medical records of consultation and reports of medical tests. The lower layer is the data capturing layer using RFID reader. The data is captured in the lower level from different nodes. The data is combined with some linear coefficients using linear network coding. At the lower level the data from different tags are combined and stored and at the level 2 coding combines the data from multiple readers and a corresponding encoding vector is generated. This network coding is done at the server node through small mat lab net-cod interface software. While accessing the stored data, the user data has the data type represented in the form of decoding vector. For storing and retrieval the primary key is the patient id. The results obtained were observed with a reduction of download time of about 12% for our case study set up.
