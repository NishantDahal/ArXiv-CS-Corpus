Statistical Simulation Models for Cascaded Rayleigh Fading Channels

In this paper, we present statistical simulators for cascaded Rayleigh fading channels with and without line-of-sight (LOS). These simulators contain two individual summations and are therefore easy to implement with lower complexity. Detailed statistical properties, including auto- and cross-correlations of the in-phase, quadrature components of the channels, envelopes, and squared envelopes, are derived. The time-average statistical properties and the corresponding variance are also investigated to justify that the proposed simulators achieve good convergence performance.
  Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed for various statistical properties to validate the proposed simulators. Results show that the simulators provide fast convergence to all desired statistical properties, including the probability density function (PDF), various auto- and cross-correlations, level crossing rate (LCR), and average fading duration (AFD).
  While various tests and measurements in dense scattering urban and forest environments indicate that mobile-to-mobile channels may experience cascaded Rayleigh fading, the proposed statistical models can be applied to simulate the underlying channels.
