Counting (k,l)-sumsets in groups of prime order

A subset $A$ of a group $G$ is called $(k, l)$-{\it sumset}, if $A= kB-lB$ for some $B\subseteq G$, where $kB-lB={x_1+...+x_k-x_{k+1}-...-x_{k+l} : x_1,..., x_{k+l}\in B}.$ Upper and lower bounds for the number $(k, l)$-sumsets in groups of prime order are provided.
