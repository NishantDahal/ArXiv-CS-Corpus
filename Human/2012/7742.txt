Edge-colouring eight-regular planar graphs

It was conjectured by the third author in about 1973 that every $d$-regular planar graph (possibly with parallel edges) can be $d$-edge-coloured, provided that for every odd set $X$ of vertices, there are at least $d$ edges between $X$ and its complement. For $d = 3$ this is the four-colour theorem, and the conjecture has been proved for all $d\le 7$, by various authors. Here we prove it for $d = 8$.
