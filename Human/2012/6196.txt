A Proof Checking View of Parameterized Complexity

The PCP Theorem is one of the most stunning results in computational complexity theory, a culmination of a series of results regarding proof checking it exposes some deep structure of computational problems. As a surprising side-effect, it also gives strong non-approximability results. In this paper we initiate the study of proof checking within the scope of Parameterized Complexity. In particular we adapt and extend the PCP[n log log n, n log log n] result of Feige et al. to several parameterized classes, and discuss some corollaries.
