Shape analysis using fractal dimension: a curvature based approach

The present work shows a novel fractal dimension method for shape analysis. The proposed technique extracts descriptors from the shape by applying a multiscale approach to the calculus of the fractal dimension of that shape. The fractal dimension is obtained by the application of the curvature scale-space technique to the original shape. Through the application of a multiscale transform to the dimension calculus, it is obtained a set of numbers (descriptors) capable of describing with a high precision the shape in analysis. The obtained descriptors are validated in a classification process. The results demonstrate that the novel technique provides descriptors highly reliable, confirming the precision of the proposed method.
