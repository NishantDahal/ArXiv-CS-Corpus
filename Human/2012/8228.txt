A Biomimetic Approach Based on Immune Systems for Classification of Unstructured Data

In this paper we present the results of unstructured data clustering in this case a textual data from Reuters 21578 corpus with a new biomimetic approach using immune system. Before experimenting our immune system, we digitalized textual data by the n-grams approach. The novelty lies on hybridization of n-grams and immune systems for clustering. The experimental results show that the recommended ideas are promising and prove that this method can solve the text clustering problem.
