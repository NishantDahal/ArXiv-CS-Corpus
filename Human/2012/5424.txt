Composition of Modular Telemetry System with Interval Multiset Estimates

The paper describes combinatorial synthesis approach with interval multset estimates of system elements for modeling, analysis, design, and improvement of a modular telemetry system. Morphological (modular) system design and improvement are considered as composition of the telemetry system elements (components) configuration. The solving process is based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD): (i) multicriteria selection of alternatives for system components, (ii) synthesis of the selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility). Interval multiset estimates are used for assessment of design alternatives for telemetry system elements. Two additional systems problems are examined: (a) improvement of the obtained solutions, (b) aggregation of the obtained solutions into a resultant system configuration. The improvement and aggregation processes are based on multiple choice problem with interval multiset estimates. Numerical examples for an on-board telemetry subsystem illustrate the design and improvement processes.
