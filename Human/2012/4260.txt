How the online social networks are used: Dialogs-based structure of MySpace

Quantitative study of collective dynamics in online social networks is a new challenge based on the abundance of empirical data. Conclusions, however, may depend on factors as user's psychology profiles and their reasons to use the online contacts. In this paper we have compiled and analyzed two datasets from \texttt{MySpace}. The data contain networked dialogs occurring within a specified time depth, high temporal resolution, and texts of messages, in which the emotion valence is assessed by using SentiStrength classifier. Performing a comprehensive analysis we obtain three groups of results: Dynamic topology of the dialogs-based networks have characteristic structure with Zipf's distribution of communities, low link reciprocity, and disassortative correlations. Overlaps supporting "weak-ties" hypothesis are found to follow the laws recently conjectured for online games. Long-range temporal correlations and persistent fluctuations occur in the time series of messages carrying positive (negative) emotion. Patterns of user communications have dominant positive emotion (attractiveness) and strong impact of circadian cycles and nteractivity times longer than one day. Taken together, these results give a new insight into functioning of the online social networks and unveil importance of the amount of information and emotion that is communicated along the social links. (All data used in this study are fully anonymized.)
