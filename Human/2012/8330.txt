Multilayer image watermarking scheme for providing high security

The main theme of this application is to provide an algorithm color image watermark to manage the attacks such as rotation, scaling and translation. In the existing watermarking algorithms, those exploited robust features are more or less related to the pixel position, so they cannot be more robust against the attacks. In order to solve this problem this application focus on certain parameters rather than the pixel position for watermarking. Two statistical features such as the histogram shape and the mean of Gaussian filtered low-frequency component of images are taken for this proposed application to make the watermarking algorithm robust to attacks and also AES technique is used to provide higher security.
