Single-window Integrated Development Environment

This paper addresses the problem of IDE interface complexity by introducing single-window graphical user interface. This approach lies in removing additional child windows from IDE, thus allowing a user to keep only text editor window open. We describe an abstract model of IDE GUI that is based on most popular modern integrated environments and has generalized user interface parts. Then this abstract model is reorganized into single windowed interface model: access to common IDE functions is provided from the code editing window while utility windows are removed without loss of IDE functionality. After that the implementation of single-window GUI on KDevelop 4 is described. And finally tool views and usability of several well- known IDEs are surveyed.
