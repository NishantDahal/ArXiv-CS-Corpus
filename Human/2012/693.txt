On an Ethical Use of Neural Networks: A Case Study on a North Indian Raga

The paper gives an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to time series modeling, the data being instance versus notes (characterized by pitch) depicting the structure of a North Indian raga, namely, Bageshree. Respecting the sentiments of the artists' community, the paper argues why it is more ethical to model a structure than try and "manufacture" an artist by training the neural network to copy performances of artists. Indian Classical Music centers on the ragas, where emotion and devotion are both important and neither can be substituted by such "calculated artistry" which the ANN generated copies are ultimately up to.
