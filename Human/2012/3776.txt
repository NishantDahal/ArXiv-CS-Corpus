Performance improvement in OFDM system by PAPR reduction

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is an efficient method of data transmission for high speed communication systems. However, the main drawback of OFDM system is the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signals. OFDM consist of large number of independent subcarriers, as a result of which the amplitude of such a signal can have high peak values. Coding, phase rotation and clipping are among many PAPR reduction schemes that have been proposed to overcome this problem. Here two different PAPR reduction methods e.g. partial transmit sequence (PTS) and selective mapping (SLM) are used to reduce PAPR. Significant reduction in PAPR has been achieved using these techniques. The performances of the two methods are then compared.
