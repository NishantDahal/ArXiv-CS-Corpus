Integration of CAD and rapid manufacturing for sand casting optimisation

In order to reduce the time and costs of the products development in the sand casting process, the SMC Colombier Fontaine company has carried out a study based on tooling manufacturing with a new rapid prototyping process. This evolution allowed the adequacy of the geometry used for the simulation to the tooling employed physically in the production. This allowed a reduction of the wall thickness to 4mm and retained reliable manufacturing process.
