A Two Intermediates Audio Steganography Technique

On the rise of the Internet, digital data became openly public which has driven IT industries to pay special consideration to data confidentiality. At present, two main techniques are being used: Cryptography and Steganography. In effect, cryptography garbles a secret message turning it into a meaningless form; while, steganography hides the very existence of the message by embedding it into an intermediate such as a computer file. In fact, in audio steganography, this computer file is a digital audio file in which secret data are concealed, predominantly, into the bits that make up its audio samples. This paper proposes a novel steganography technique for hiding digital data into uncompressed audio files using a randomized algorithm and a context-free grammar coupled with a lexicon of words. Furthermore, the proposed technique uses two intermediates to transmit the secret data between communicating parties: The first intermediate is an audio file whose audio samples, which are selected randomly, are used to conceal the secret data; whereas, the second intermediate is a grammatically correct English text that is generated at runtime using a context-free grammar and it encodes the location of the random audio samples in the audio file. The proposed technique is stealthy and irrecoverable in a sense that it is difficult for unauthorized third parties to detect the presence of and recover the secret data. Experiments conducted showed how the covering and the uncovering processes of the proposed technique work. As future work, a semantic analyzer is to be developed so as to make the intermediate text not only grammatically correct but also semantically plausible.
