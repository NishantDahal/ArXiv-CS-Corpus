Gauge Field Generation on Large-Scale GPU-Enabled Systems

Over the past years GPUs have been successfully applied to the task of inverting the fermion matrix in lattice QCD calculations. Even strong scaling to capability-level supercomputers, corresponding to O(100) GPUs or more has been achieved. However strong scaling a whole gauge field generation algorithm to this regim requires significantly more functionality than just having the matrix inverter utilizing the GPUs and has not yet been accomplished. This contribution extends QDP-JIT, the migration of SciDAC QDP++ to GPU-enabled parallel systems, to help to strong scale the whole Hybrid Monte-Carlo to this regime. Initial results are shown for gauge field generation with Chroma simulating pure Wilson fermions on OLCF TitanDev.
