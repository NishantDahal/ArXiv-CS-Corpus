Online Estimation of Battery Lifetime for Wireless Sensors Network

Battery is a major hardware component of wireless sensor networks. Most of them have no power supply and are generally deployed for a long time. Researches have been done on battery physical model and their adaptation for sensors. We present an implementation on a real sensor operating system and how architectural constraints have been assumed. Experiments have been made in order to test the impact of some parameter, as the application throughput, on the battery lifetime.
