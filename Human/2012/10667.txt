Centralized Integrated Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radios

Spectrum sensing is the challenge for cognitive radio design and implementation, which allows the secondary user to access the primary bands without interference with primary users. Cognitive radios should decide on the best spectrum band to meet the Quality of service requirements over all available spectrum bands. This paper investigates the integrated centralized spectrum sensing techniques in multipath fading environment and the performance was analyzed with energy detection and wavelet based sensing techniques for unknown signal.
