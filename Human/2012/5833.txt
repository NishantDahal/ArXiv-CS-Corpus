Genetic agent approach for improving on-the-fly web map generalization

The utilization of web mapping becomes increasingly important in the domain of cartography. Users want access to spatial data on the web specific to their needs. For this reason, different approaches were appeared for generating on-the-fly the maps demanded by users, but those not suffice for guide a flexible and efficient process. Thus, new approach must be developed for improving this process according to the user needs. This work focuses on defining a new strategy which improves on-the-fly map generalization process and resolves the spatial conflicts. This approach uses the multiple representation and cartographic generalization. The map generalization process is based on the implementation of multi- agent system where each agent was equipped with a genetic patrimony.
