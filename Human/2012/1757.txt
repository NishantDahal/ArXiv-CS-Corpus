Quartile Clustering: A quartile based technique for Generating Meaningful Clusters

Clustering is one of the main tasks in exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics where the main objective is partitioning observations in groups. Clustering has a broad range of application in varied domains like climate, business, information retrieval, biology, psychology, to name a few. A variety of methods and algorithms have been developed for clustering tasks in the last few decades. We observe that most of these algorithms define a cluster in terms of value of the attributes, density, distance etc. However these definitions fail to attach a clear meaning/semantics to the generated clusters. We argue that clusters having understandable and distinct semantics defined in terms of quartiles/halves are more appealing to business analysts than the clusters defined by data boundaries or prototypes. On the samepremise, we propose our new algorithm named as quartile clustering technique. Through a series of experiments we establish efficacy of this algorithm. We demonstrate that the quartile clustering technique adds clear meaning to each of the clusters compared to K-means. We use DB Index to measure goodness of the clusters and show our method is comparable to EM (Expectation Maximization), PAM (Partition around Medoid) and K Means. We have explored its capability in detecting outlier and the benefit of added semantics. We discuss some of the limitations in its present form and also provide a rough direction in addressing the issue of merging the generated clusters.
