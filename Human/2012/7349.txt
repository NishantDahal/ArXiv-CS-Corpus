Reliability of swarming algorithms for mobile sensor network applications

There are many well-studied swarming algorithms which are often suited to very specific purposes. As mobile sensor networks become increasingly complex, and are comprised of more and more agents, it makes sense to consider swarming algorithms for movement control. We introduce a natural way to measure the reliability of various swarming algorithms so a balance can be struck between algorithmic complexity and sampling accuracy.
