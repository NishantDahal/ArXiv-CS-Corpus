The Survey of Data Mining Applications And Feature Scope

In this paper we have focused a variety of techniques, approaches and different areas of the research which are helpful and marked as the important field of data mining Technologies. As we are aware that many Multinational companies and large organizations are operated in different places of the different countries.Each place of operation may generate large volumes of data. Corporate decision makers require access from all such sources and take strategic decisions.The data warehouse is used in the significant business value by improving the effectiveness of managerial decision-making.
