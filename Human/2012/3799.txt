Factors affecting acceptance of web-based training system: Using extended UTAUT and structural equation modeling

Advancement in information system leads organizations to apply e-learning system to train their employees in order to enhance its performance. In this respect, applying web based training will enable the organization to train their employees quickly, efficiently and effectively anywhere at any time. This research aims to extend Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT) using some factors such flexibility of web based training system, system interactivity and system enjoyment, in order to explain the employees' intention to use web based training system. A total of 290 employees have participated in this study. The findings of the study revealed that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence and system flexibility have direct effect on the employees' intention to use web based training system, while effort expectancy, system enjoyment and system interactivity have indirect effect on employees' intention to use the system.
