Online open neuroimaging mass meta-analysis

We describe a system for meta-analysis where a wiki stores numerical data in a simple format and a web service performs the numerical computation.
  We initially apply the system on multiple meta-analyses of structural neuroimaging data results. The described system allows for mass meta-analysis, e.g., meta-analysis across multiple brain regions and multiple mental disorders.
