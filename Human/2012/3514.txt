SD-EQR: A New Technique To Use QR CodesTM in Cryptography

In this paper the author present a new technique of using QR Codes (commonly known as 'Quick Respond Codes') in the field of Cryptography. QR Codes are mainly used to convey or store messages because they have higher or large storage capacity than any other normal conventional 'barcodes'. In this paper the primary focus will be on storing messages in encrypted format with a password and send it to the required destination hiding in a QR Code, without being tracked or decrypted properly by any hacker or spyware. Since QR Codes have fast response time and have large storage capacity, QR Codes can be used perfectly to send encrypted data (messages) to the receiver. This method will be suitable in any business house, government sectors, communication network to send their encrypted messages faster to the destination. Or a person can even use this method to keep his important documents, like passport number, pan-card id, social security number, perfectly secured with him all the time, without the information getting leaked to outside world. The new method is achieved by entering the message along with a password. This password will generate a secret code, which will be added to each digit or alphabet in the numbers or text entered in the message (which is needed to be encrypted) and generate the first phase of encryption. That newly generated encrypted message will again be encrypted using various other methods to generate the final encrypted message.
