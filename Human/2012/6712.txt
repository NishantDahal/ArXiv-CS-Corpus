Partially-commutative context-free languages

The paper is about a class of languages that extends context-free languages (CFL) and is stable under shuffle. Specifically, we investigate the class of partially-commutative context-free languages (PCCFL), where non-terminal symbols are commutative according to a binary independence relation,  very much like in trace theory.  The class has been recently proposed as a robust class subsuming CFL and commutative CFL. This paper surveys properties of PCCFL. We identify a natural corresponding automaton model: stateless multi-pushdown automata.  We show stability of the class under natural operations, including homomorphic images and shuffle.  Finally, we relate expressiveness of PCCFL to two other relevant classes: CFL extended with shuffle   and trace-closures of CFL. Among technical contributions of the paper are pumping lemmas, as an elegant completion of known pumping properties of regular languages, CFL and commutative CFL.
