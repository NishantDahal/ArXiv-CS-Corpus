Noise based logic: why noise? A comparative study of the necessity of randomness out of orthogonality

Although noise-based logic shows potential advantages of reduced power dissipation and the ability of large parallel operations with low hardware and time complexity the question still persist: is randomness really needed out of orthogonality? In this Letter, after some general thermodynamical considerations, we show relevant examples where we compare the computational complexity of logic systems based on orthogonal noise and sinusoidal signals, respectively. The conclusion is that in certain special-purpose applications noise-based logic is exponentially better than its sinusoidal version: its computational complexity can be exponentially smaller to perform the same task.
